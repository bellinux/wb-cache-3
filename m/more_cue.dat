Because prey aggregations may produce <b>more</b> <b>cue</b> and {{be easier to}} detect, predation could limit aggregation size. However, disturbance in the flow may diminish the reliability of odour as a prey cue, impeding predator foraging success and efficiency. We explore how different cue concentrations (as a proxy for prey group size) affect risk to prey by fish predators in disturbed (more turbulent or mixed) and non-disturbed (less mixed) flowing water. We find that increasing odour cue concentration increases predation risk and disturbing the flow reduces predation risk. At high cue concentration fish were able to locate the cue source in both disturbed and non-disturbed flow, but at medium concentrations, predators only located the cue source more often than expected by chance in non-disturbed flow. This suggests that objects disturbing flow provide a sensory refuge allowing prey to form larger groups, but that group sizes may be limited by level of disturbance to the flow...|$|E
40|$|Unpredictability of an unconditioned {{stimulus}} (US) {{is known to}} produce context conditioning in animals and humans. We modified the Martians task −a computer game in which learning of Pavlovian associations is measured using conditioned suppression− for assessing context conditioning in humans. Two experiments are reported: one between-subjects and one within-subjects study. Both experiments comprised four conditions. A predictable (Paired) condition in which the US was predicted by the conditioned stimulus (CS), a neutral condition (No-US) and two unpredictable conditions, {{one in which the}} CS did not predict the US (Unpaired) and one in which only unsignaled and temporally unpredictable USs were scheduled but no CSs were presented (US-only). The background color of the computer screen was changed to manipulate context. Results showed {{that at the end of}} acquisition, more conditioned suppression to the context occurred in the unpredictable conditions (Unpaired and US-only) compared to the predictable condition (Paired). For conditioned suppression to the CS, on the other hand, <b>more</b> <b>cue</b> conditioning was present in the Paired condition than in the Unpaired condition. Consistent with animal research, context conditioning was increased by unpredictability. These data support the Martians task as a promising tool to extend research on human context conditioning. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Category-level object {{recognition}} {{is a fundamental}} capability for the potential use of robots in the assistance of humans in useful tasks. There have been numerous vision-based {{object recognition}} systems yielding fast and accurate results in constrained environments. However, by depending on visual cues, these techniques are susceptible to object variations in size, lighting, rotation, and pose, all of which cannot be avoided in real video data. Thus, the task of object recognition still remains very challenging. My thesis work builds upon the fact that robots can observe humans interacting with the objects in their environment. We refer to the set of objects, which can {{be involved in the}} interaction as `interactionable 2 ̆ 7 objects. The interaction of humans with the `interactionable 2 ̆ 7 objects provides numerous nonvisual cues to the identity of objects. In this thesis, I will introduce a flexible object recognition approach called Multiple-Cue Object Recognition (MCOR) that can use multiple cues of any predefined type, whether they are cues intrinsic to the object or provided by observation of a human. In pursuit of this goal, the thesis will provide several contributions: A representation for the multiple cues including an object definition that allows for the flexible addition of these cues; Weights that reflect the various strength of association between a particular cue and a particular object using a probabilistic relational model, as well as object displacement values for localizing the information in an image; Tools for defining visual features, segmentation, tracking, and the values for the non-visual cues; Lastly, an object recognition algorithm for the incremental discrimination of potential object categories. We evaluate these contributions through a number of methods including simulation to demonstrate the learning of weights and recognition based on an analytical model, an analytical model that demonstrates the robustness of the MCOR framework, and recognition results on real video data using a number of datasets including video taken from a humanoid robot (Sony QRIO), video captured from a meeting setting, scripted scenarios from outside universities, and unscripted TV cooking data. Using the datasets, we demonstrate the basic features of the MCOR algorithm including its ability to use multiple cues of different types. We demonstrate the applicability of MCOR to an outside dataset. We show that MCOR has better recognition results over vision-only recognition systems, and show that performance only improves with the addition of <b>more</b> <b>cue</b> types...|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} mimicry on liking in {{interacting}} with an ECA {{was investigated in}} Experiment 1. An error correction task effectively encouraged production of visual prominence cues from participants with {{a greater proportion of}} prominence cues produced after the ECA uttered a sentence erroneously rather than speaking it correctly. Contrasting with the first hypothesis, <b>more</b> visual prominence <b>cues</b> were produced in the condition where the ECA did not mimic the user. Some ratings were correlated with the frequency of producing visual prominence <b>cues.</b> <b>More</b> prominence <b>cues,</b> for example, were associated with greater judged lifelikeness of the ECA in the ECA mimic condition. As hypothesized, there was a tendency for greater mimicry of the ECA by the participant in the final phase when those participants had produced <b>more</b> prominence <b>cues</b> in the mimic condition. Experiment 1 has demonstrated mimicry as a way to enhance gestural similarity between ECA and human that has in turn increased ECA lifelikeness. The absence of a significant positive correlation between amount of mimicry and all self-report ratings of ECA liking could be explained by the non-conscious nature of mimicry.|$|R

30|$|There {{are several}} key {{advantages}} to using automated linguistic analysis techniques to detect deception in transcripts of 911 homicide calls. First, 911 calls represent the initial contact between a caller and an emergency response team, including law enforcement, leaving callers {{little time to}} prepare or to settle down for the encounter. Moreover, as noted above, the caller’s statement {{has not yet been}} corrupted by contact with criminal investigators or lawyers [4]. Furthermore, because callers do not perceive 911 operators to be members of law enforcement, deceptive callers may exhibit less controlled behavior and <b>more</b> <b>cues</b> of deception; consequently, 911 callers may become more engaged in interpersonal communication and be less guarded because 911 operators interview rather than interrogate. Due to the temporal immediacy of the crime in relation to the 911 call, there may also be more active stress on the caller, in turn causing the caller to display <b>more</b> deceptive <b>cues.</b> Another advantage for comparison of truthful and deceptive responses in emergency calls is that 911 operators use a structured interview style that was similar across calls.|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} ability to use prosodic cues when parsing Intonational Phrases (IPs) in American Sign Language (ASL) by four different populations, i. e. ASL signers, Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) signers, Non-Signers and second language (L 2) signers of ASL. ^ ASL signers, Non-Signers and L 2 signers showed similar performance in terms of accuracy when identifying prosodic boundaries. Although hearing participants (i. e. Non-Signers and L 2 signers) do not have a phonology for gestures, they are able to use superficial visual cues to mark prosodic boundaries based on their “gestural competence”; that is, their experience using co-speech gesture. Native HKSL signers’ performance was better overall demonstrating a greater ability to be accurate and fast when parsing ASL clauses than even native ASL signers. I argue that the ASL signers’ ability may be affected by lexical or semantic interference. Long reaction times and low accuracy levels revealed the complexity of the mental process involved in this task. ^ When data were analyzed within group, Non-Signers as well as L 2 signers showed a better performance when stimuli contained <b>more</b> <b>cues.</b> Contrary to hearing participants, the native signers groups did not show changes on accuracy depending on the number of cues. Data shows that 3 - 4 cues are sufficient for HKSL and ASL signers to be accurate, whereas Non-Signers and L 2 signers needed <b>more</b> <b>cues.</b> ^ HKSL signers as well as Non-Signers and L 2 signers parse ASL clauses based on a broader range of cues whereas ASL signers focus just on a couple of cues when parsing ASL clauses, that is, ASL signers are sensitive to fewer cues. ...|$|R

In this approach, each party involved is asked to identify the objectives which it perceives as relevant to it in considering any joint action that might lead to cooperation or tempering of the conflict. From their statements on objectives, cues and insights may be obtained on how to get around their stances on issues – stances (often very heated) that have resulted in the existing stalemate. The objectives, of course, often lie behind the issues.

40|$|International audienceA {{previous}} {{line of research}} suggests that interlocutors identify appropriate places to speak by in the behaviour of the preceding speaker. If used in combination, these cues have an additive effect on listeners' turn-taking attempts. The present study further explores these findings by examining the effect of such turn-taking cues experimentally. The objective is to investigate the possibilities of generating turn-taking cues with a synthetic voice. Thus, in addition to stimuli realized with a human voice, the experiment included dialogues {{where one of the}} speakers is replaced with a synthesis. The turn-taking cues investigated include intonation, phrase-final lengthening, semantic completeness, stereotyped lexical expressions and non-lexical speech production phenomena such as lexical repetitions, breathing and lip-smacks. The results show that the turn-taking cues realized with a synthetic voice affect the judgements similar to the corresponding human version and there is no difference in reaction times between these two conditions. Furthermore, the results support Duncan's findings: the <b>more</b> turn-taking <b>cues</b> with the same pragmatic function, turn-yielding or turn-holding, the higher the agreement among subjects on the expected outcome. In addition, the number of turn-taking cues affects the reaction times for these decisions. Thus, the <b>more</b> <b>cues,</b> the faster the reaction time...|$|R
