40|$|A {{system of}} pasture yield {{measurement}} {{was developed for}} New Zealand’s pasture based, rotationally grazed farming systems. Pasture yield measurement is complex because the pasture biomass has to be measured in-situ, pre and post grazing so that pasture consumption and utilisation can be calculated. The “C-Dax Pasture Meter ” was initially developed by Massey University and subsequently commercialised by C-Dax Ltd of New Zealand. The pasture management solution has gained traction in the market-place and is considered a valuable management tool for dairy farmers in New Zealand and Australia. The method of measurement is simple but highly effective and provides reliable measurement of pasture cover {{in a range of}} pasture types regardless of weather and light conditions. The measurement unit is pulled behind an ATV and can be used at speeds of up to 20 kmh- 1. Two technology levels are available, either as a basic system deriving average cover for individual paddocks, or with the incorporation of a GPS to allow pasture production to be mapped. Recent independent calibration results from New Zealand based research organisations have shown the C-Dax Pasture Meter to have a higher level of accuracy than traditionally used methods as well as increased utility. The system has also proved to be reliable in <b>measuring</b> <b>post</b> grazing residual levels which are known as Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) to achieving good pasture management and maintaining pasture quality. Measuring pasture covers allows farmers to make timely decisions regarding feed conservation, fertiliser use and stocking policies as well as giving farmers greater certainty in budgeting feed resources. The paper examines the KPI’s that farmers use to benchmark the success of their grazing management. Acase study is presented to illustrate how the C-Dax Pasture Meter is benefiting dairy farmers in New Zealand and Australia...|$|E

Identification of reliable and easy to measure growth attributes will help in monitoring seedling survival and establishment in reseeding projects. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify seedling growth attribute(s) that can be used to predict survival and establishment of H. elegans using simple correlation factor analysis and pathcoefficient analysis. Survival and establishment were highly and significantly correlated with most growth attributes.

Factor analysis classified growth attributes into three groups of factors. Factor one accounted for 59 % of variation and included survival and growth attributes <b>measured</b> <b>post</b> rainy seasons.

Using H. 264 encoding as an example, we demonstrate significant yield improvements (as much as 30 % points at 0 % hardware overdesign), a reduction in overdesign (by as much as 8 % points at 80 % yield) as well as application quality improvements (about 2. 0 dB increase in average peak-signal-to-noise ratio at 70 % yield). Further, we investigate implications of limited information exchange (i. e. signature quantization) on yield and quality. We conclude that hardware-signature based application adaptation is an easy and inexpensive (to implement), better informed (by actual appli-cation requirements) and effective way to manage yield-cost-quality tradeoffs in application-implementation design flows.
