25|$|Stanford University {{political}} scientist Professor Rob Reich wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can probably result in biased students, as many homeschooling parents view {{the education of}} their children as a matter properly under their control and no one else's.

July 1895 – 1978), Arthur Percival Foley (b. 27 September 1897) and a second daughter, Nesta Foley (1900–1973). Unlike <b>most</b> <b>parents</b> of the Victorian era, the parents of Rhys-Davids {{spent a great deal}} of their time with their children, although they employed a child minder named Minna, a German woman. The first words of Arthur and his sister were German and the children often used German phrases. Nevertheless, Rhys-Davids's parents continued to be busy academics. In 1905 his father became a professor at the University of Manchester. His mother became a prolific author.|$|E
25|$|Parents play a {{vital part}} in a child’s early life, for {{they are the first}} group of people that a child meets and learns from. The {{information}} that surrounds a child at home becomes reinforcements for desired behaviors of a male or female. Studies have shown that as immediate as 24 hours after a child is born <b>most</b> <b>parents</b> have already engaged in gender stereotypic expectations of sons or daughters. Through examples such as painting a room pink or blue, encouragement to participate in shared sex-typed activities, offering gender differentiated toys, or treating the opposite sex child differently, these parent-child interactions have long lasting influence on how a child connects to certain gender-specific behaviors.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{publicly}} funded State schools in France must be secular, {{owing to the}} 1905 separation of Church and State, Muslim parents who wish their children to be educated at a religious school often choose private (and therefore fee-paying, though heavily subsidised) Catholic schools, {{of which there are}} many. Few specifically Muslim schools have been created. There is a Muslim school in La Réunion (a French island to the east of Madagascar), and the first Muslim [...] (a school for students aged eleven to fifteen) opened its doors in 2001 in Aubervilliers (a suburb northeast of Paris), with eleven students.

When something is wrong with our car, our watch or our house, we call a professional to fix it. No one wants to repair these himself. In modern society, {{it is not enough to}} love the children. No seed will become a flower just because it gets love. It also needs professional care and nursing to bloom. So if we do not nurse and protect the child's talent, he will become a gloomy adult and the whole world will be poorer.

30|$|Of course, {{correlations}} do {{not tell}} the whole story of intergenerational education mobility. There is also increasing interest in directly comparing individuals’ Educational Attainment to that of their parents. 27 With PIAAC data we can compute two relevant statistics for each country: (i) The probability that an individual’s educational level equals or exceeds that of her <b>most</b> educated <b>parent</b> and (ii) For an individual whose <b>most</b> educated <b>parent’s</b> education lies in one of the two lower categories, the probability that her education level exceeds that of her <b>most</b> educated <b>parent.</b> The unweighted sample results are contained in Table  2, columns B and C.

2500|$|Suicide {{rates are}} growing {{worldwide}} {{and over the}} last thirty years there has been international research trying to curb this phenomenon and gather knowledge about who is [...] "at-risk". When a parent loses their child through suicide it is traumatic, sudden and affects all loved ones impacted by this child. Suicide leaves many unanswered questions and leaves <b>most</b> <b>parents</b> feeling hurt, angry and deeply saddened by such a loss. Parents may feel they can't openly discuss their grief and feel their emotions because of how their child died and how the people around them may perceive the situation. Parents, family members and service providers have all confirmed the unique nature of suicide-related bereavement following the loss of a child. They report a wall of silence that goes up around them and how people interact towards them. One {{of the best ways to}} grieve and move on from this type of loss is to find ways to keep that child as an active part of their lives. It might be privately at first but as parents move away from the silence they can move into a more proactive healing time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{king penguin}} has an unusually {{prolonged}} breeding cycle, taking some 14–16 months from laying to offspring fledging. Although pairs {{will attempt to}} breed annually, they are generally only successful one year in two, or two years in three in a triennial pattern on South Georgia. The reproductive cycle begins in September to November, as birds return to colonies for a prenuptial moult. Those that were unsuccessful in breeding the previous season will often arrive earlier. They {{then return to the}} sea for three weeks before coming ashore in November or December. [...] The female penguin lays one pyriform (pear-shaped) white egg weighing 300g (⅔lb). It is initially soft, but hardens and darkens to a pale greenish colour. It measures around [...] The egg is incubated for around 55 days with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6–18days each. Hatching may take up to 2–3days to complete, and chicks are born semi-altricial and nidicolous. In other words, they have only a thin covering of down and are entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth. The guard phase starts with the birth of the chick. The young chick spends its time balanced on its parents' feet, sheltered by a pouch formed from the abdominal skin of the latter. During this time, the parents alternate every 3–7days, one guarding the chick while the other forages. The guard phase lasts for 30–40 days. By then the chick has grown much bigger, can keep itself warm and protect itself against most predators. It becomes more curious and starts to explore its surroundings. It ends up forming a group with other chicks, a so-called crèche. Crèches are guarded by only a few adult birds; <b>most</b> <b>parents</b> can leave their chick to forage for themselves and their chick. Other species of penguins also practice this method of communal care for offspring.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1996, Marshall University {{sociology}} professor Dr. William Westbrook was {{having a conversation with}} a recent Master's graduate. [...] The graduate inquired about Marshall's traditional admissions policy, which had a lower SAT/ACT apparent requirement than his undergraduate school, Shepherd University, with a [...] "selective" [...] admissions policy and higher SAT/ACT apparent requirement. The graduate made an incorrect inference from the averages and thought Shepherd was arbitrarily turning new students away below a higher fixed ACT or SAT score. Dr. Westbrook clarified the situation first by explaining that every university or college is going to meet its enrollment quota with the best students available, and asked where both Marshall University and Shepherd University got their students. Marshall typically recruited from Cabell, Logan, Wayne, and Putnam Counties, WV, and Lawrence County, OH. Shepherd typically recruited both from West Virginia, both locally in the Eastern Panhandle and in the interior of and elsewhere in the state, and from the comparatively wealthy Maryland and Virginia suburbs surrounding Washington D.C. Dr. Westbrook made the point that SAT and ACT scores are an indirect measure of socioeconomic status. [...] County kindergarten to twelfth-grade school boards are funded by property taxes assessed on home values. [...] At nearly the end of grade school, a college-bound student takes the SAT or ACT. The difference between Shepherd University and Marshall University is that Shepherd recruited more from areas whose home values were higher, whose homeowners paid more in property taxes, whose school systems were better funded, and whose students benefitted as a result, took the SAT or ACT, some of whom applied to Shepherd University and were accepted, and attended. Colleges and universities, then, have less control over setting their ACT and SAT requirements than the graduate assumed and than <b>most</b> <b>parents</b> might imagine. [...] Parents need to understand that large scale political and economic forces such as the level of Federal employment and commensurate income around Washington, or other regional differences in living standards, have more to do setting ACT and SAT requirements than the decisions of college committees trying to enroll the best students they can under the circumstances over which they have no control.|$|E
