In this work, {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) from patients with rheumatoid heart disease (RHD) and control subjects that had never experienced acute rheumatoid fever were stimulated with rheumatogenic and non-rheumatogenic group A streptococci (GAS) strains. EFS was one of only four genes with significantly increased expression in both arms of the study: 1) RHD patient versus control PBMCs after stimulation of both groups with rheumatogenic GAS and 2) RHD patient PBMC stimulated with rheumatogenic versus non-rheumatogenic GAS.|$|E
5|$|He was {{thereafter}} mostly {{withdrawn from}} public life, dedicating himself to researching {{the work of}} 15th-century poet François Villon, and, like his fellow Surrealist Michel Leiris, to promoting primitive and African art, {{which he had been}} collecting for years. In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the Rive Gauche, which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde Mouvement Jariviste, an outcome which reportedly pleased him. In August 1960, one year after the Fifth Republic had been established by President Charles de Gaulle, French forces were confronting the Algerian rebels (see Algerian War). Together with Simone de Beauvoir, Marguerite Duras, Jérôme Lindon, Alain Robbe-Grillet and other intellectuals, he addressed Premier Michel Debré a letter of protest, concerning France's refusal to grant Algeria its independence. As a result, Minister of Culture André Malraux announced that his cabinet would not subsidize any films to which Tzara and the others <b>might</b> <b>contribute,</b> and the signatories could no longer appear on stations managed by the state-owned French Broadcasting Service.|$|E

5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it <b>might</b> <b>contribute</b> {{to the development of}} new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea {{came to be known as}} the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E

25|$|Recently, {{a battery}} of extracardiac effects were {{discovered}} in Kcne2-/- mice that may contribute to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in Kcne2-/- mice and could potentially contribute to human cardiac arrhythmias if similar effects are observed in human populations.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that fully melting Antarctica would contribute over 60 metres of sea level rise, and Greenland would contribute more than 7 metres.

The latter figure is much smaller than for Antarctica or Greenland, but it could occur relatively quickly (within the coming century), whereas full melting of Greenland would be slow (perhaps 1,500 years to fully deglaciate at the fastest likely rate) and Antarctica even slower. However, this calculation does not account for the possibility of accelerate melting as meltwater flows under and lubricates the larger ice sheets, which would begin to move much more rapidly towards the sea.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} people attempt to {{establish}} and maintain a desired personal image in social situations. People are motivated to present themselves towards others in a good light, and some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias is a representative of self-presentational processes: people want to appear more well-off than others. However, this is not through conscious effort. In a study where participants believed their driving skills would be either tested in either real-life or driving simulations, people who believed they were to be tested had less optimistic bias and were more modest about their skills than individuals who would not be tested. Studies also suggest that individuals who present themselves in a pessimistic and more negative light are generally less accepted by the rest of society. This <b>might</b> <b>contribute</b> to overly optimistic attitudes.|$|E
25|$|It {{has long}} been {{established}} that genetic factors along with social and psychological factors are contributors to addiction. A common theory along these lines is the self-medication hypothesis. Epidemiological studies estimate that genetic factors account for 40–60% of the risk factors for alcoholism. Similar rates of heritability for other types of drug addiction have been indicated by other studies. Knestler hypothesized in 1964 that a gene or group of genes <b>might</b> <b>contribute</b> to predisposition to addiction in several ways. For example, altered levels of a normal protein due to environmental factors could then change the structure or functioning of specific brain neurons during development. These altered brain neurons could change the susceptibility of an individual to an initial drug use experience. In support of this hypothesis, animal {{studies have shown that}} environmental factors such as stress can affect an animal's genotype.|$|E

25|$|Because enamel is {{vulnerable}} to demineralization, prevention of tooth decay {{is the best way}} to maintain the health of teeth. Most countries have wide use of toothbrushes, which can reduce the number of dental biofilm and food particles on enamel. In isolated societies that do not have access to toothbrushes, it is common for those people to use other objects, such as sticks, to clean their teeth. In between two adjacent teeth, floss is used to wipe the enamel surfaces free of plaque and food particles to discourage bacterial growth. Although neither floss nor toothbrushes can penetrate the deep grooves and pits of enamel, good general oral-health habits can usually prevent enough bacterial growth to keep tooth decay from starting. Genetic variations, in humans, <b>might</b> <b>contribute</b> to the intrinsic structural integrity of the enamel, and to its predisposition to demineralization or attack from bacteria.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} to this case-control approach. [...] A common alternative to case-control GWA studies is {{the analysis of}} quantitative phenotypic data, e.g. height or biomarker concentrations or even gene expression.

Calculations are typically done using bioinformatics software such as SNPTEST and PLINK, which also include support {{for many of these}} alternative statistics. Earlier GWAS focused on the effect of individual SNPs. However, the empirical evidence shows that complex interactions among two or more SNPs, epistasis, <b>might</b> <b>contribute</b> to complex diseases. Moreover, the researchers tries to integrate GWA data with other biological data such as protein protein interaction network [...] to extract more informative results.|$|E
