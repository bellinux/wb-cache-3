50|$|A local {{initiative}} under Proposition 218 {{could also}} be pursued as a tie-in initiative that would tie the continued imposition of a parcel tax to satisfaction of specified conditions. For example, a local initiative could attach an annual <b>matching</b> <b>contribution</b> condition whereby a parcel tax would be reduced or repealed if the specified annual <b>matching</b> <b>contribution</b> condition is not satisfied. A <b>matching</b> <b>contribution</b> condition is intended to leverage additional financial support {{as well as to}} demonstrate a strong financial commitment to the purposes for which the parcel tax is imposed, especially from those interests who promoted the parcel tax. Matching contributions typically come from the private sector in the form of voluntary payments such as from the local business community. This approach is particularly appropriate in places like Los Angeles County and the Silicon Valley where the local business community tends to be big supporters of tax increases that disproportionately burden ordinary taxpayers, such as parcel taxes, but generally opposes tax increases on the business community for the same public purposes.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} {{illustrates a}} <b>matching</b> <b>contribution</b> condition {{in a local}} initiative. Suppose various organizations and groups promoted a successful sales tax increase within a local government. After passage of the tax increase, there remained questions concerning the fairness and burden of the tax. A tie-in initiative is pursued containing an annual <b>matching</b> <b>contribution</b> condition in which the sales tax would either by reduced or repealed unless the private sector, particularly the various organizations and groups that promoted the sales tax increase, provides annual matching funds (typically in an amount {{equal to or greater}} than the annual revenues received from the sales tax) to make the revenue burden more equitable. An annual matching condition does not create a legal obligation to pay, but if {{at any time during the}} life of the sales tax the condition is not satisfied, the tax would either be reduced or repealed in accordance with the terms of the local initiative. In this example, a policy is also advanced whereby if those organizations and groups that promoted the sales tax increase aren’t willing to voluntarily contribute additional funds on an annual basis for their promoted purpose, then taxpayers would not be legally obligated to continue paying for that purpose in the form of higher taxes.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} severe {{criticism}} of the Government of India for not increasing the monthly pension provided to the elderly, widows and persons with disability in India.

While the Government of India maintains that State Governments should make a <b>matching</b> <b>contribution</b> to social pensions, the amount would still {{not account for the}} rise in living costs over the past decade. The Pension Parishad has demanded that the government raise the monthly pension to half of the minimum wage or , whichever is higher.

5000|$|On June 25, 2006, Warren Buffett (then the world's richest person, {{estimated}} {{worth of}} US$62 billion as of April 16, 2008) pledged {{to give the}} foundation approximately 10 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares spread over multiple years through annual contributions, with the first year's donation of 500,000 shares being worth approximately US$1.5 billion. Buffett set conditions so that these contributions do not simply increase the foundation's endowment, but effectively work as a <b>matching</b> <b>contribution,</b> doubling the Foundation's annual giving. Bloomberg News noted, [...] "Buffett's gift came with three conditions for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Bill or Melinda Gates must be alive and active in its administration; it must continue to qualify as a charity; and each year it must give away an amount equal to the previous year's Berkshire gift, plus an additional amount equal to 5 percent of net assets. Buffett gave the foundation two years {{to abide by the}} third requirement." [...] The Gates Foundation received 5% (500,000) of the shares in July 2006 and will receive 5% of the remaining earmarked shares in the July of each following year (475,000 in 2007, 451,250 in 2008).
