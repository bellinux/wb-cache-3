50|$|In {{moving up}} to a greater {{production}} scale, laboratory processing steps {{such as the use}} of electron beam lithography are slow and expensive. Therefore, a roll-to-roll manufacturing method was devised using a new manufacturing technique based on a <b>master</b> <b>pattern.</b> This <b>master</b> <b>pattern</b> in effect mechanically “stamps” the precision pattern onto an inexpensive flexible substrate and thereby creates the metallic loop elements seen in the laboratory processing steps. The master template fabricated by Idaho National Laboratories consists of approximately 10 billion antenna elements on an 8-inch round silicon wafer. Using this semi-automated process, Idaho National Labs has produced a number of 4-inch square coupons. These coupons were combined to form a broad flexible sheet of antenna arrays. This work did not include production of the diode component.|$|E

50|$|Creating a cast {{urethane}} <b>master</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is different}} from the steps involved in creating hard tooling for injection molding. Hard tools for injection molding are going to be subjected to a lot of stress and heat during the injection process. They will see runs of thousands of parts per day. The care that goes into a hard tool involves intense machine programming which costs thousands of dollars alone. The price for hard tooling is balanced by the mass production the tooling brings, which is where cast urethanes begin to differ. Cast urethanes are suited for smaller runs of parts and prototyping. Because the cost for soft tooling is lower, down in the hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands, cast urethanes are excellent resources for creators still testing product design, for one-off products, or for testing market and consumer response to a new product.|$|E

Odd numbers replace even numbers in the regularity of a Chinese <b>master</b> <b>pattern,</b> and a pull to one side allows a motif to turn {{the corner of a}} three-dimensional object, thus giving continuity and motion that is lacking in a static frontal design. Japanese painters used the devices of the cutoff, close-up, and fade-out by the 12th century in yamato-e, or Japanese-style, scroll painting, perhaps one reason why modern filmmaking has been such a natural and successful art form in Japan.

40|$|A common way of realizing {{microstructural}} {{features on}} metallic surfaces is {{to generate the}} designated pattern on each single part by means of microstructuring technologies such as e. g. laser ablation, electric discharge machining or micromilling. The disadvantage of these process chains is the limited productivity due to the additional processing of each part. The approach of this work is to replicate microstructured surfaces from a <b>master</b> <b>pattern</b> via lost wax investment casting {{in order to reach}} a higher productivity. We show that microholes of different sizes (Ø 15 - 22 µm at depths of 6 - 14 µm) can be replicated in AlSi 7 Mg-alloy from a laser-structured <b>master</b> <b>pattern</b> via investment casting. However, some loss of molding accuracy during the multi-stage molding process occurs. Approximately 50 % of the original microfeature's heights are lost during the wax injection step. In the following process step of manufacturing a gypsum-bonded mold, a further loss in the surface quality of the microfeatures can be observed. In the final process step of casting the aluminum melt, the microfeatures are filled without any loss of molding accuracy and replicate the surface quality of the gypsum mold. The contact angle measurements of ultrapure water on the cast surfaces show a decrease in wettability on the microstructured regions (75 °) compared to the unstructured region (60 °) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The LOMOLD {{process is}} a new plastic {{moulding}} process being researched at the University of Stellenbosch. The process essentially combines injection moulding and compression moulding. Molten plastic is forced into the mould cavity using a plunger. This plunger then forms part of the cavity wall. The plunger face must therefore follow the geometry of the part. Rapid Tooling evolved from Rapid Prototyping. There are two categories of Rapid Tooling: indirect and direct rapid tools. Indirect rapid tools are manufactured by using a <b>master</b> <b>pattern</b> to form the mould cavity. The accuracy of the mould cavity depends heavily on {{the accuracy of the}} <b>master</b> <b>pattern.</b> The <b>master</b> <b>pattern</b> is usually produced using Rapid Prototyping technology. Direct rapid tools use Rapid Prototyping technology to build the mould through and additive, layer by layer process or a subtractive process. This research investigates the use of Rapid Tools for the LOMOLD process. Aluminium Filled Epoxy Tooling (AFET) represents the indirect technology and CNC-machined tooling the direct technology. Both of these technologies are available at the University of Stellenbosch. Parts are manufactured on these tools using an experimental LOMOLD machine. These two technologies are compared in terms of part accuracy, tool lead time, tool cost and part cost. The research concluded that the only advantage the AFET has over the CNC-machined tool is a shorter manufacturing lead-time. In terms of tool cost, tool life, part geometric accuracy, part cost and cycle time the CNC tool is superior. Therefore the application of AFET is limited to small volume, prototype or pre-production runs for tool design confirmation, part functional testing and part appearance testing. It is also demonstrated that a cooling system on the AFET tool has no significant influence on the tool performance and should therefore, especially for production runs less than 150 parts, not be included in the tool to save on tool cost. Another conclusion is that the LOMOLD process is not consistent enough for a production process. This statement could be limited to the machine used for the research but to prove this statement wrong, the machine must be improved and more investigation is required...|$|E
