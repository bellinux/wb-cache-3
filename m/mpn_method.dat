40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact on numbers of using different media for the enumeration of Escherichia coli subjected to stress, and to evaluate the use of different resuscitation methods on bacterial numbers. E. coli was subjected to heat stress by exposure to 55 °C for 1 h or to light-induced oxidative stress by exposure to artificial light for up to 8 h in the presence of methylene blue. In both cases, the bacterial counts on selective media were below the limits of detection whereas on non-selective media colonies were still produced. After resuscitation in non-selective media, using a multi-well <b>MPN</b> resuscitation <b>method</b> or resuscitation on membrane filters, the bacterial counts on selective media matched those on non-selective media. Heat and light stress can affect the ability of E. coli to grow on selective media essential for the enumeration as indicator bacteria. A resuscitation method is essential for the recovery of these stressed bacteria in order to avoid underestimation of indicator bacteria numbers in water. There was no difference in resuscitation efficiency using the membrane filter and multi-well <b>MPN</b> <b>methods.</b> This study emphasises the need to use a resuscitation method if the numbers of indicator bacteria in water samples are not to be underestimated.

40|$|Primers were {{designed}} to target 16 S rRNA and nodD genes of Rhizobium leguminosarum from DNA extracted from two different soil types contaminated with Zn applied in sewage sludge. Numbers of rhizobia estimated using 16 S rRNA gene copy number showed higher abundance than those estimated by both nodD and the most-probable-number (<b>MPN)</b> enumeration <b>method</b> using a plant trap host. Both 16 S rRNA gene copies and the MPN rhizobia declined with increased levels of Zn contamination, as did the abundance of the functional gene nodD, providing compelling evidence of a toxic effect of Zn on R. leguminosarum populations in the soil. Regression analysis suggested the total Zn concentration in soil as a better predictor of rhizobial numbers than both NH 4 NO 3 -extractable and soil solution Zn. R. leguminosarum bv. viciae nodD gene copies were generally less sensitive to Zn than R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii nodD. The latter were generally below detection limits at Zn levels of > 250 mg kg− 1. Although there were differences in the actual numbers estimated by each approach, the response to Zn was broadly similar across all methods. These differences were likely to result {{from the fact that}} the molecular approaches assess the potential for nodulation while the MPN approach assesses actual nodulation.

Preliminary research evaluated three inoculum preparation methods using EZ-Spore™ B. cereus pellets. Two methods involved EZ-Spore™ B. cereus pellets that were dissolved in deionized (DI) water, grown in {{brain heart infusion}} broth with manganese sulfate, and then heated to produce spores. The third inoculum preparation method of dissolving EZ-Spore™ pellets only in DI water was the most efficient due to 100 % spores being present in the inoculum. Preliminary research also determined that <b>MPN</b> <b>method</b> recovered greater (p 0. 05) were observed among sampling times so data was pooled for overall mean values for each treatment. The overall B. cereus population mean of pooled sampling times for <b>MPN</b> <b>method</b> (2. 59 log CFU/mL) was greater (p< 0. 05) than MYP plating method (1. 89 log CFU/mL).

The method was applied to an acidic soil of a coniferous forest exhibiting nitrate production. In this soil nitrate production was unlikely to be catalyzed by autotrophic nitrifiers, since autotrophic ammonia oxidizers never could be detected, and autotrophic nitrite oxidizers were usually not found in appreciable cell numbers. The developed <b>MPN</b> <b>method</b> is based on the demonstration of the presence/absence of nitrite/nitrate produced by heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria during growth in a complex medium (peptone-meat-extract softagar medium) containing low concentrations of agar (0. 1 per cent).

Analysis of correlation effects reveals that MP 6 will be superior to other MP methods if a bond situation is described not involving more than six electrons (single, double, or triple bonds). As soon as there is the influence of additional electron pairs as for example in the case of multiple bonds involving heteroatoms with electron lone pairs, bond lengths are slightly exaggerated due to missing disconnected eight and ten electron correlation effects.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple most-probable-number (MPN) {{procedure}} for the enumeration of dissimilatory arsenic-reducing bacteria (DARB) is presented. The method {{is based on}} the specific detection of arsenite, the end product of anaerobic arsenate respiration, by a precipitation reaction with sulfide. After 4 weeks of incubation, the medium for the <b>MPN</b> <b>method</b> is acidified to pH 6 and sulfide is added to a final concentration of about 1 mM. The brightly yellow arsenic trisulfide precipitates immediately and can easily be scored at arsenite concentrations as low as 0. 05 mM. Abiotic reduction of arsenate upon sulfide addition, which could yield false positives, apparently produces a soluble As-S intermediate, which does not precipitate until about 1 h after sulfide addition. Using the new <b>MPN</b> <b>method,</b> population estimates of pure cultures of DARB were similar to direct cell counts. MPNs of environmental water and sediment samples yielded DARB numbers between 101 and 105 cells per ml or gram (dry weight), respectively. Poisoned and sterilized controls showed that potential abiotic reductants in environmental samples did not interfere with the MPN estimates. A major advantage is that the assay can be easily scaled to a microtiter plate format, enabling analysis of large numbers of samples by use of multichannel pipettors.

Underlying the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico is a highly permeable fractured karst limestone that increases the potential for rapid transport of microbial and chemical contaminants from the surface to underlying aquifers. With rampant growth in many areas throughout the peninsula there is a potential to release from wastewater a large number of contaminants including pathogens. The objective of this research project was to test multiple groundwater samples near Tulum, Quintana Roo that ranged from protected to impacted to determine the occurrence and source of fecal contamination and link this information to the hydrogeologic setting. The membrane filtration and most probable number (<b>MPN)</b> <b>methods</b> were used for the quantification of total coliforms and E. coli.

40|$|Introduction Myeloproliferative {{neoplasms}} (MPNs) include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), {{and primary}} myelofibrosis (PMF). Patients with MPNs {{are prone to}} develop arterial and venous thrombosis either at diagnosis or during follow-up; in particular splancnic vein is strongly associated with MPN. Conversely, presence of MPN is uncommon in patients with deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities and with pulmonary embolism. Only few studies with conflicting results have evaluated the prevalence of an underlying MPN in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), and limited evidence exists on the incidence of CVT in patients with established <b>MPN.</b> <b>Methods</b> We assessed the frequency of MPNs {{in a series of}} 706 patients with cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT) and the frequency of CVT in a cohort of 2, 143 MPNs patients.

Nine CVT cases (0. 4 %) were diagnosed in the MPN cohort, with a slightly higher frequency in PV (five of 735, 0. 7 %) than in ET (three of 964, 0. 3 %) and in PMF (one of 444, 0. 2 %). Conclusion Considering the analyses of these databases jointly, the results obtained suggest a weak association between CVT and MPNs and ultimately suggest that a thorough investigation looking for an underlying MPN may not be warranted in all the patients with CVT without overt myeloproliferative features...|$|R

Pentraxin 3 (PTX 3) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are inflammatory biomarkers potentially useful for refining prognostic classification of <b>MPNs.</b> <b>Methods</b> We evaluated 305 with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and 172 polycythemia vera (PV) patients diagnosed according to the 2016 WHO criteria and with full molecular characterization for driver mutations. Results PTX 3 levels were significantly increased in carriers of homozygous JAK 2 V 617 F mutation compared {{to all the other}} genotypes and triple negative ET patients, while hs-CRP levels were independent of the mutational profile. The risk of haematological evolution and death from any cause was about 2 - and 1. 5 -fold increased in individuals with high PTX- 3 levels, while the thrombosis rate tended to be lower. High hs-CRP levels were associated with risk of haematological evolution, death and also major thrombosis. After sequential adjustment for potential confounders (age, gender, diagnosis and treatments) and the presence of JAK 2 V 617 F homozygous status, high hs-CRP levels remained significant for all outcomes, while JAK 2 V 617 F homozygous status as well as treatments were the factors independently accounting for adverse outcomes among patients with high PTX 3 levels. Conclusions These results provide evidence that JAK 2 V 617 F mutation influences MPN-associated inflammation with a strong correlation between allele burden and PTX 3 levels. Plasma levels of hs-CRP and PTX 3 might be of prognostic value for patients with ET and PV, but their validation in future prospective studies is needed...|$|R

Phylogenetic analysis showed that Gammaproteobacteria were dominants and mainly represented by Vibrio species, which displayed GLUase activities on the same order of magnitude and sometimes much higher as E. coli reference strains. Conclusions: The'Coliplage((R)) ' assay is a rapid method for the quantification of E. coli showed few discordances with the standard <b>MPN</b> <b>method.</b> Some Vibrio species could interfere on the direct GLUase activity measurement of E. coli. Significance and Impact of the Study: Data present the first qualitative investigation on disagreement between Coliplage((R)) and the MPN results. If the interference of Vibrio species is confirmed in situ, appropriate treatments should be developed to remove the interfering signal. FLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Dirt {{floors are}} used on most Brazilian poultry farms since the {{construction}} of concrete floors is very expensive. In vitro tests carried out to verify the effectiveness of disinfectants do not consider the adverse conditions found in poultry farms. Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating the effect of six commercial disinfectants on the reduction of total and fecal coliforms on the dirt floor of breeder houses. The amount of disinfectant solution to be used per square meter was defined by counting total and fecal coliforms at different soil depths and by analyzing soil physical properties. Coliforms were detected at 0. 5 cm, and one liter of disinfectant solution was sufficient for soil saturation at this depth. After that, the efficacy of six commercial products (caustic soda, hydrated lime, phenols 1 and 2, iodine, glutaraldehyde, and quaternary ammonium) in {{reducing the number of}} coliforms, after six hours of contact with the dirt floor, was assessed using the most probable number (<b>MPN)</b> <b>method.</b> Escherichia coli specimens isolated from the dirt floor were used to evaluate in vitro effectiveness of disinfectants. Products that yielded the best results in the <b>MPN</b> <b>method</b> were also effective in the in vitro tests. Among the tested disinfectants, hydrated lime was the most efficient, reducing the initial contamination by 2. 9 log after six hours of contact with the dirt floor...|$|E

Two classes of system are distinguished, namely class A systems possessing well separated electron pairs and class B systems which are characterized by electron clustering in certain regions of atomic and molecular space. For class A systems, electron pair correlation e ects as described by D, Q, DD, DQ, QQ, DDD, etc., contributions are most important, which are stepwise included at MPn with n ˆ 2; [...] .; 6. Class A systems are reasonably described by MPn theory, which is re ¯ ected by the fact that convergence of the MPn series is monotonic (but relatively slow) for class A systems. The description of class B systems is di cult since three- and four-electron correlation e ects and couplings between two-, three-, and four-electron correlation e ects missing for lower order perturbation theory are signi ® cant. <b>MPn</b> <b>methods,</b> which do not cover these e ects, simulate higher order with lower order correlation e ects thus exaggerating the latter, which has to be corrected with increasing n. Consequently, the MPn series oscillates for class B systems at low orders. A possible divergence of the MPn series is mostly a consequence of an unbalanced basis set. For example, di use functions added to an unsaturated sp basis lead to an exaggeration of higher order correlation e ects, which can cause enhanced oscillations and divergence of the MPn series. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patients with Ph-negative {{myeloproliferative}} neoplasms (MPN), such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), {{and primary}} myelofibrosis (PMF), are {{at increased risk}} for thrombosis/thromboembolism and major bleeding. Due to the morbidity and mortality of these events, antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents are commonly employed as primary and/or secondary prophylaxis. On the other hand, disease-related bleeding complications (i. e., from esophageal varices) are common in patients with MPN. This analysis was performed to define the frequency of such events, identify risk factors, and assess antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy in a cohort of patients with <b>MPN.</b> <b>Methods</b> The <b>MPN</b> registry of the Study Alliance Leukemia is a non-interventional prospective study including adult patients with an MPN according to WHO criteria (2008). For statistical analysis, descriptive methods and tests for significant differences as well as contingency tables were used to identify the odds of potential risk factors for vascular events. Results MPN subgroups significantly differed in sex distribution, age at diagnosis, blood counts, LDH levels, JAK 2 V 617 F positivity, and spleen size (length). While most thromboembolic events occurred around the time of MPN diagnosis, one third of these events occurred after that date. Splanchnic vein thrombosis was most frequent in post-PV-MF and MPN-U patients. The chance of developing a thromboembolic event was significantly elevated if patients suffered from post-PV-MF (OR 3. 43; 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 39 – 8. 48) and splenomegaly (OR 1. 76; 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 15 – 2. 71). Significant odds for major bleeding were previous thromboembolic events (OR[*]=[*] 2. 71; 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 36 – 5. 40), splenomegaly (OR[*]=[*] 2. 22; 95  % CI 1. 01 – 4. 89), and the administration of heparin (OR[*]=[*] 5. 64; 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 84 – 17. 34). Major bleeding episodes were significantly less frequent in ET patients compared to other MPN subgroups. Conclusions Together, this report on an unselected “real-world” cohort of German MPN patients reveals important data on the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of thromboembolic and major bleeding complications of MPN...|$|R
40|$|Sacca di Goro” is {{a coastal}} lagoon, {{south of the}} Po River Delta, {{and it is one}} of the most {{important}} aquacultural systems in Italy. That area has a strong environmental value for its large biodiversity and it is inserted in SCI (Site of Community Importance) and SPAs (Special Protection Areas) areas. This paper reports the data of geochemical and microbiological characterization and monitoring of sediments carried out in the 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 years. All samples were collected from the surface sediment (20 cm) on the entire extension of the lagoon. Sediments were analysed after oven drying at 50 °C for 48 hrs, except microbiological parameters. The major elements (expressed in percentage of oxide) and the trace elements (expressed in ppm) were carried out by X ray Fluorescence. The granulometric classification was carried out according to Shepard diagram in order to estimate the granulometric variations in the time. Carbon and nitrogen elemental measurements were performed by aqueous acidification procedure to remove carbonate [1]. Samples were then analysed by a Carlo Erba CHNS-O 1108 elemental analyser configured for C and N analysis. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were determinated by an Agilent GC (6890 N) /MS (5973) after extraction, clean up and chromatographic separation according to EPA methods (3500 B, 3540 C 3600 C 8000 B). The microbial analyses were performed within 18 - 24 hrs and include: total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci by <b>MPN</b> <b>methods</b> [2, 3], Salmonellae by the enrichment and selective media [2]; spores of solfate reducing bacteria [4]. The heavy metal concentration in the sediments of “Sacca di Goro” is similar to the Po river alluvional plain sediments near the city of Ferrara (“background level”). The range of the quality of “Sacca di Goro” sediments is from poor to medium – good as a grain size function of that kind of sediments [5]. Total Organic Carbon ranged from 0. 14 to 1. 40...|$|R
