[...] Whereas a lot of rock and roll isn't even entertaining at all, let alone allowing people the voice for expression. [...] That's what the Make-Up has come to remedy.

Hall had to pull off the road until the storm passed. According to an interview, Hall said that he based the character of Jimmy Gator on real-life TV personalities such as Bob Barker and Arthur Godfrey. The rain of frogs was inspired by the works of Charles Fort and Anderson claims that he was unaware that it was also a reference in The Bible when he first wrote the sequence. At the time the filmmaker came across the notion of a rain of frogs, he was [...] "going through a weird, personal time", and he started to understand [...] "why people turn to religion in times of trouble, and maybe my form of finding religion was reading about rains of frogs and realizing that <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> somehow".|$|E

Someone might look at my records and say it's schizophrenic, but there's always that element I hear. Maybe it's delusional, but it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I guess.

I {{really wanted to be}} featured on it, because, you know, I've been signed and dropped, and now signed a second time, so it's been hard. What ended up happening was that it looked like a lot of names on the title, so they wanted to keep as many low features as possible. That's what I was told, and it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I guess more than two featured names doesn't look good on the radio.

5000|$|I'd like {{to clarify}} {{comments}} published in Playboy about religious people being weak-minded. I didn't mean all religious people.

But I believe because it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> not because I think it can be proven. There are lots {{of people out there who}} think they know the truth about God and religion, but does anybody really know for sure? That's why the Founding Fathers built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation, so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves. But I do have a problem with the people who think they have some right to try to impose their beliefs on others. I hate what the fundamentalist fanatics are doing to our country. It seems as though, if everybody doesn't accept their version of reality, that somehow invalidates it for them. Everybody must believe the same things they do. That's what I find weak and destructive.|$|E
