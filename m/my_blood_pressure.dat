40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{measurement}} in {{the diagnosis}} and management of hypertension, including the technique required for ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring and home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring, will be reviewed in this article. Home and ambulatory measurements are widely used, both to confirm the diagnosis and to improve adherence to therapy. The major advantage of out-of-office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring is that it provides {{a large number of}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements away from the medical environment, which represents a more reliable assessment of actual <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> than office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> The advantage of ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring is its unique ability to measure nocturnal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Although not fully validated in large-scale clinical trials, ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring appears to correlate best with prognosis. Ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring and home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring provide somewhat different information on the subject’s <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> status, and the two methods should thus be regarded as complementary, rather than competitive or alternative...|$|R
50|$|This {{measurement}} {{suggests the}} opposite conclusion, {{that the average}} causal effect {{is an increase in}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> One obtains this result because the positive change in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> for Joe is a larger percentage of his <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> This would occur if Joe's <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is lower than the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> of the other subjects. For example, Joe's <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is 140 and increase by 14 mm Hg, an increase of 10%. If Mary's <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is 200 mm Hg and her <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> increases by 14 mm Hg, then her <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> only increases by 7%. Consequently, a small absolute change in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> would yield a larger percentage change for Joe.|$|R
5000|$|Vallicella {{argues that}} the future tense {{sentence}} cannot generate the liar paradox because this sentence cannot be ever treated as a falsity.

For although I made (what turned out to be) a false statement with the intention to deceive, I {{had no way of}} knowing exactly what <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> would be the next day." [...] The same explanation could be used to explain Pinocchio's sentence. Even if his prediction that his nose will grow turns out to be false, it is impossible to claim that he has lied. Then Vallicella explains why he does not see the liar paradox in Pinocchio's sentence if the present tense is used: ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{measurements}} {{taken at}} home by physicians, nurses, and patients with office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement, ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring and home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement. METHODS: A total of 44 patients seen by a home care program were studied. Protocol 1 a) <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{was measured by the}} patient, a physician and a nurse during a regular home visit (Home 1); b) home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement was measured for 4 days (HBPM 1); c) office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement was measured by a physician, a nurse, and the patient; and by 24 -hour ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring. Protocol 2 <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was measured by the patient, a physician, and a nurse during a special home visit {{in the presence of a}} physician and a nurse only (Home 2); and b) home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement was taken for the second time (HBPM 2). Echocardiography, guided by a two-dimensional echocardiograph, was performed. RESULTS: Protocol 1 : a) office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement and Home 1 were significantly higher than ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring, except for systolic and diastolic office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement taken by the patient or a family member, systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a nurse, and diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a physician. b) ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring and HBPM 1 were similar. Protocol 2 : a) HBPM 2 and Home 2 were similar. b) Home 2 was significantly lower than Home 1, except for diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a nurse or the patient. There were significant relationships between: a) diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measured by the patient and the thickness of the interventricular septum, posterior wall, and left ventricular mass; and b) ambulatory and HBPM 2 diastolic and systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a physician (home 2) and left ventricular mass. Therefore, the data indicate that home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement and ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring had good prognostic values relative to "office measurement. " CONCLUSION: This study showed that the measurement most similar to home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement and ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring was <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measured by the patient, and that home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement and ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring had good prognostic value relative to "office measurements"...|$|R

However, if the same person takes the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> agent when their <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was not high and their <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> goes lower, {{to the point that}} they are dizzy and have difficultly standing without falls and injury, then the same <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> agent is undesirable.|$|R
40|$|This review {{addresses}} methodological {{issues in}} the assessment of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability and the predictive value of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability derived from <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> readings obtained in the relaxed home environment. Preference should be given to indexes of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability that are independent of the mean because we should evaluate the impact of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability by eliminating the effect of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> levels. Beat-to-beat <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> recordings outperform home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement {{in the assessment of}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability in longitudinal Belgian and Japanese population studies, whereas <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability did not incrementally predict outcome beyond <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> level and other cardiovascular risk factors. In conclusion, clinicians should focus on <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> level, given that it is the predominant risk factor and is manageable by lifestyle modifications and adequate antihypertensive drug treatment. <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability remains a research tool that requires further prospective studies with hard end points to define its potential application, as it may be potentially useful in daily clinical practice.

In spite of the seriousness of the situation, it amused me to see how the Germanic face of my colleague had acquired a purely Indian expression. At the peak of the intoxication, about 1½ hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, the rush of interior pictures, mostly changing in shape and colour, reached such an alarming degree that I feared I would be torn into this whirlpool of form and colour and would dissolve. After about six hours, the dream came to an end. Subjectively, I had no idea how long this condition had lasted. I felt my return to everyday reality to be a happy return from a strange, fantastic but quite really experienced world into an old and familiar home.|$|E

[...] After giving poor ratings to Elves, Dwarves, and Dark Folk, he commented that [...] "Fortunately for <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> Wizards {{is a much better}} book. It suffers from the same appalling presentation (anybody who produces an Arthurian adventure and talks about the 'Seige Perlious' should be bastinadoed to death), but succeeds almost in spite of itself." [...] He comments how [...] "I have not come across a more effective translation of literature into FRP, and I actually enjoyed reading some of the scenarios which, generally speaking, captured the atmosphere of the novels they drew from. The stories are well thought-out (especially Gilgamesh( [...] have reasonably objectives and credible characterisations. I did take exception to the hybrid Dark Age and Chivalric background to the Arthurian adventure, for the justification of the action was inconsistent with the plot. Accepting this however, The Pillar of Clinschor plays well enough." [...] Dale went on to say, [...] "I retain mixed feelings about Wizards on the grounds that though there is material in the book for several evenings play, there will be problems integrating the differing scenarios into any long-term campaign (unless of course they have the same setting), and the book therefore lacks unity Wizards succeeds on its own terms, to some extent, despite the presentation, but it is of limited value otherwise." ...|$|E

Liverpool won the English league title that season, and Wark made sufficient appearances to earn himself a medal. His unusual ability as a goalscoring midfielder was on display when he finished the 1984-85 season as the club's top goalscorer, ahead of prolific striker Ian Rush, with a tally of 27 goals in 62 appearances—a goal every 2.3 games. [...] Wark's season included three hat-tricks, one each in the League, the FA Cup and the European Cup. [...] Liverpool qualified for the 1985 European Cup Final but the match was overshadowed by the Heysel Stadium Disaster, a tragedy Wark remembers as [...] "a nightmare memory".|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} quality and {{accuracy}} of manual office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and automated office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> using the awake ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> as a gold standard. Design Multi-site cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting Primary care practices in five cities in eastern Canada. Participants 555 patients with systolic hypertension and no serious comorbidities {{under the care of}} 88 primary care physicians in 67 practices in the community. Interventions Practices were randomly allocated to either ongoing use of manual office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (control group) or automated office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (intervention group) using the BpTRU device. The last routine manual office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (mm Hg) was obtained from each patient’s medical record before enrolment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Insufficient <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{control is}} a {{frequent}} problem despite the existence of effective treatment. Insufficient adherence to self-monitoring {{as well as to}} therapy is a common reason. <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> self-measurement at home (Home <b>Blood</b> <b>Pressure</b> Measurement, HBPM) has positive effects on treatment adherence and is helpful in achieving the target <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Only a few studies have investigated whether adherence to HBPM can be improved through simple measures resulting also in better <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> control. OBJECTIVE: Improvement of self-monitoring and improved <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> control by using a new colour-coded <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary. OUTCOME: Primary outcome: Change in systolic and/or diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> 6 months after using the new colour-coded <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary. Secondary outcome: Adherence to <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> self-measurement (number of measurements/entries). METHODS/DESIGN: Randomised controlled study. Population: 138 adult patients in primary care with uncontrolled hypertension despite therapy. The control group uses a conventional <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary; the intervention group uses the new colour-coded <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary (green, yellow, red according a traffic light system). EXPECTED RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The visual separation and entries in three colour-coded areas reflecting risk (green: <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in the target range 140 /> 90 mmHg, red: <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in danger zone > 180 mmHg/> 110 mmHg) lead to better self-monitoring compared with the conventional (non-colour-coded) <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> booklet. The colour-coded, visualised information supports improved perception (awareness and interpretation) of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and triggers correct behaviour, in the means of improved adherence to the recommended treatment as well as better communication between patients and doctors resulting in improved <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> control.

At my lightest I weighed eighty-two kilograms. ” I am a male researcher, researching masculine bodyweight and masculine embodiment. In the qualitative tradition, seven men (primary participants) who underwent significant weight gain. and loss were interviewed with the purpose of understanding how they experienced their sense of self as socially reflected. In addition to this, seven significant others (secondary participants) were interviewed in relation to their observations of primary participants during these periods. This is an interdisciplinary study which utilises symbolic interactionist concepts of self, and social identity, in conjunction with sociological and philosophical concerns about body-image, bodyweight, and the expression of subjective and social masculine identities in a gendered socio-cultural context, where tension exists between individual freedom and social control (See Bordo, ! 999 a: Cooley, 1964; Drummond, 2002; Foucault, 1980; Goffman 1963 b, 1967; Mead, 1934; Sparkes, 1999). It was found that different levels of male body fat influences subjective conceptions of self, subjective expressions of masculine identities, and social projections {{of what it means to}} be a fat and thin man. This study reveals that men went to extremes to lose weight, in most cases by restricting their food intake. In addition to this, it was also found that thinner men consume more fashion than fatter men, and that happy fat men in sexual relationships were least likely to regulate their bodyweight until these relationships ended. Self-regulation was found to be more prominent in those men competing for intimacy in the sexual market. In brief, this study establishes here is a softer reflective side of men than had been previously documented...|$|E

The objectives of this retrospective analysis were to answer three basic questions about <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability: 1) Does <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> entry criterion have an effect on baseline <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability? 2) Do thiazide diuretics {{have a significant effect on}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability? and 3) Does systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> vary to the same degree as diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure?</b> This analysis of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> variability is based on resting standardized research setting BP readings from two systematic reviews evaluating <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> lowering efficacy of thiazide diuretics from double blind randomized controlled trials in 33, 611 patients with primary hypertension. The standard deviation reported in trials was the focus of the research and the unit of analysis. When a threshold systolic or diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> value is used to determine entry into a trial, baseline variability is significantly decreased, systolic from 14. 0 to 9. 3 mmHg and diastolic from 8. 4 to 5. 3 mmHg. Thiazides do not change BP variability as the standard deviation and coefficient of variation of systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> did not differ between thiazide and placebo groups at end of treatment.

Design: Casual <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> of adolescents who were identified as having elevated <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> during a school screen was re-evaluated in the laboratory. The adolescents were classified into two groups: (i) those with consistently elevated <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> across school and laboratory assessments and (i) those with labile <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> whose <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in the laboratory was below 130 / 80 mmHg.

Last night after we left you Mother 2 ̆ 6 I went to some restaurant {{and as soon as}} we got there they played “Making Believe. ” Lord, I’m so lonesome 2 ̆ 6 miss you so much. Gee, honey, I love you so. Just ran out of ink. I hope that you’ll be able to read this, hon—I know that pencil smears. Mother just managed to get me some more ink. They’re trying to starve me to death here, honey. The nurses are walking down the hall with trays of food but they won’t bring me any. Still haven’t seen the doctor so haven’t any idea when they’ll operate or anything. Gee darling it was so hard to leave you yesterday. I miss you so, honey. It’s terrific! You looked so adorable last night. Of course you always do but I just couldn’t believe that you were leaving for the old South. I actually expect to see you next weekend the way I used to. Golly, honey, who ever would have thought on that first night when you called me that we would get engaged and be married before another year. Everything happened so fast but it doesn’t seem that way at all. It seems as we’d always gone around together in a way. As though there’d never been another boy that I went out with. (There goes my English again). Sweetheart, I don’t know how to write you really. There are so many millions of things that I want to tell you but somehow I just can’t find the words for. The only thing I can say is I love you. That seems so inadequate. I want to tell you how very much I love you, honey, but there just aren’t words enough. All the way down to this dump (hope the nurses can’t read) I thought about you and getting married 2 ̆ 6 how wonderful things will be. Just think, next time you’re home we’ll be married. Golly, that sounds marvelous. Wish you were coming home this weekend. Wonder if you’ll get tight that night. Suppose some of the fellers get home 2 ̆ 6 want you to have a few drinks with them. Just don’t get too tight. That will be too important a night. Honey, this week sure changed me. Remember how I wanted to get tight at the reception. Well, you’ve certainly changed my mind about that 2 ̆ 6 everything. You can’t imagine how I felt before but now everything is wonderful. Some intern just came in and took <b>my</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> I hope they don’t say anything to mother about it’s [sic] being low. I almost drove him crazy telling him all the things I had when I was a kid. They’re arguing now about whether I’m going to be operated on at one or not. What a place. They were all set to prepare me for the operation 2 ̆ 6 I kept trying to tell them that I hadn’t even seen a doctor yet. It’s a madhouse. Don’t know when the doctor’s coming but it’s three minutes of one 2 ̆ 6 they have me scheduled to be operated on at one. Oh, well, nothing ever happens to me. This is really some place. They brought me up to the sixth floor and left me sitting in a waiting room. Said they’d be right back. That right back turned out to be three quarters of an hour 2 ̆ 6 finally I said something to one of the nurses who was roaming around. She had forgotten all about me. Great place. Golly, honey, I hope that they don’t give me ether because there’s no telling what I’ll say. That would be bad! Called Woody today 2 ̆ 6 she hadn’t mailed the letter. I hope she remembers to today because that has to pay part of the doctor’s bill. Honey, I miss you so much. It sure has been perfect being with you so much. This was an almost perfect week. There was only one thing it needed to be complete. Of course you wouldn’t know what that was. We really should have gotten married, Sweetheart. It was so wonderful to be with you almost every minute. Can you imagine what we’ll be like after we’re married? It will really be pityful [sic] then. We certainly won’t have any friends. Maybe we’ll change but I sure hope not. You’re still on the train, now, darling. Gee, I wish you were here with me. Honey, everything was so nice this week. It was almost as though we were married. It was the funniest feeling that night at Nanny’s when we got lost and went to New York, remember[?] To come upstairs with you 2 ̆ 6 be staying at the same house—It will be so nice to be married. Nice is putting it rather mildly. But think how convenient it’s going to be. People won’t have to worry about conventions any more. Gee, honey this isn’t the type of letter I planned to write you. This certainly isn’t a very romantic atmosphere to write in but I sure love you. I hate to leave you last night. It was so awful to go home without you. And this morning it was even worse when you weren’t there to kiss me as soon as I woke up. That was awful. That was such a beautiful way to wake up at your house. I love you so, honey. Gee, being married to you {{is going to be the}} most wonderful thing that ever happened. It would have to be because you’re the most wonderful man in the whole world. Honestly, Judd, whenever I think of any of the other boys I ever went out with I wonder how I ever lived without you. You have everything I’ve ever admired in a man and more. Besides being so darned good looking 2 ̆ 6 so nice 2 ̆ 6 manish [sic] you’re so[,] I guess[,] versatile is the word—maybe convertable [sic]. Anyway, honey, you’re just perfect. Of course you’re stubborn but I love you more for it. You’re nice and tall. Just exactly right and sensative [sic] and sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful. You’re a musician and a marvelous one at that. Wish I could tell you how much I admire you 2 ̆ 6 respect you. As long as I’ve known you I’ve [crossed-out word] you (wrong word) idolized [you] and you’ve been my ideal (my secret love). Honey, guess what—since the last line I’ve had my tonsils out! The nurse came 2 ̆ 6 said the doctor wanted to look at me 2 ̆ 6 they got me all bandaged up in those hospital rags 2 ̆ 6 before I know it my tonsils were out. I feel fine. My writing is a little shaky because they have so much junk on the table. Honey, it’s so funny—my mouth feels as though I had millions of marbles 2 ̆ 6 about four times it’s [sic] normal size. The whole thing didn’t take more than ten minutes. It was all very disappointing. You know in the movies how it’s all so dramatic—well, the movies are crazy. This wasn’t. He sat me in a chair. Well, first of all, there was a lovely build up. The nurse came in 2 ̆ 6 dressed me in real sanitary stuff. You could almost feel the germlessness. So then she wrapped my feet in big booties. All white and tied a rag around my hair. It was all nice 2 ̆ 6 dramatic because they were hurrying like a movie 2 ̆ 6 I couldn’t get the back of the thing buttoned—more fun. Then a guy came with a wheelchair 2 ̆ 6 wrapped me in a white sheet—sarong style. Then they threw me in the wheel chair cause the sarong was so tight around me [sic] knees. Well, he pushed me down the hall 2 ̆ 6 I felt real sharp 2 ̆ 6 like I was impressing everyone with the seriousness of my condition. We rode up to the seventh floor and there were loads of rooms with tables in them 2 ̆ 6 lights over them 2 ̆ 6 instruments hanging all around. Well, that was fine. I began to feel mighty important and sorry for myself. Thinking how glad I was he was only going to look at my throat. Well, I got into his office after passing about five rooms with all the tables 2 ̆ 6 gagets [sic] in them. It had a chair like the dentist’s office and they put me in it. The doctor was nice. There was a nurse with a thing around her nose 2 ̆ 6 mouth. That all added to the impression. So far it was all good. He looks down my throat 2 ̆ 6 says it’s not bad—inflamed or anything. So he gets out the huge needle. Honestly, honey it was miles long 2 ̆ 6 stabs my throat with it. He jabed [sic] around half a dozen times 2 ̆ 6 I was chatting merrily away to him about whether it was going to hurt or not. Then he told me to listen that my voice would go away. It did 2 ̆ 6 you should hear me. I’m much worse than Kenneth ever was. Honestly, hon, it’s a riot. I began to laugh 2 ̆ 6 he had to laugh with me. Well, it’s beginning to hurt like the devil now. Have to stop writing now. [Transcription ends...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Insufficient <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{control is}} a {{frequent}} problem despite the existence of effective treatment. Insufficient adherence to self-monitoring {{as well as to}} therapy is a common reason. <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> self-measurement at home (H ome B lood P ressure M easurement, HBPM) has positive effects on treatment adherence and is helpful in achieving the target <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Only a few studies have investigated whether adherence to HBPM can be improved through simple measures resulting also in better <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> control. Objective Improvement of self-monitoring and improved <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> control by using a new colour-coded <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary. Outcome Primary outcome: Change in systolic and/or diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> 6 months after using the new colour-coded <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary. Secondary outcome: Adherence to <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> self-measurement (number of measurements/entries). Methods/Design Randomised controlled study. Population: 138 adult patients in primary care with uncontrolled hypertension despite therapy. The control group uses a conventional <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary; the intervention group uses the new colour-coded <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> diary (green, yellow, red according a traffic light system). Expected results/conclusion The visual separation and entries in three colour-coded areas reflecting risk (green: <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in the target range ≤ 140 /≤ 90 mmHg, yellow: <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> > 140 /> 90 mmHg, red: <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in danger zone > 180 mmHg/> 110 mmHg) lead to better self-monitoring compared with the conventional (non-colour-coded) <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> booklet. The colour-coded, visualised information supports improved perception (awareness and interpretation) of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and triggers correct behaviour, in the means of improved adherence to the recommended treatment as well as better communication between patients and doctors resulting in improved <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> control.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine whether}} {{reactions}} of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> to psychological stress predict future <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> DESIGN [...] <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was recorded at a medical screening examination after which pressor reactions to a psychological stress task were determined. Follow up measurement of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was undertaken, on average, 4. 9 years later. SETTING [...] 20 civil service departments in London. SUBJECTS [...] 1003 male civil servants aged between 35 and 55 years at {{entry to the}} study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> at follow up screening. RESULTS [...] Reactions of systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> to stress correlated positively with systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> at follow up screening (r = 0. 22, P < 0. 01). The dominant correlate of follow up <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> at initial screening (r = 0. 60; P < 0. 01 between initial and follow up systolic blood pressure; r = 0. 59, P < 0. 01 between initial and follow up diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure).</b> Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that reactions to the stressor provided minimal prediction of follow up <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> over and above that afforded by <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> at initial screening. In the case of follow up systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> systolic reactions to stress accounted for only 1 % of follow up variance; systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> at initial screening accounted for 34 %. With regard to diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> at follow up, the independent contribution from diastolic reactions to stress was less than 1 %.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{reactions}} to mental stress predicted future <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and hypertension. Methods: <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was recorded at an initial medical screening examina-tion after which <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> reactions to a mental stress task were determined. A follow-up screening assessment of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and antihypertensive medication status was undertaken 10 years later. Data were available for 796 male public servants, between 35 and 55 years of age upon entry to the study. Results: Systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> reactions to mental stress were positively correlated with follow-up screening systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and to a lesser extent, follow-up diastolic pressure. In multivariate tests, by far the strongest predictors of follow-up <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> were initial screening <b>blood</b> <b>pressures.</b> In the case of follow-up systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> systolic reactions to stress emerged as an additional predictor of follow-up systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> With regard to follow-up diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> reactivity did not enter the analogous equations. The same outcomes emerged when the analyses were adjusted for medication status. When hypertension at 10 -year follow-up was the focus, both systolic and diastolic reactions to stress were predictive. However, with correction for age and initial screening <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> these associations were no longer statistically significant. Conclusions: The results of this study provide modest support for the hypothesis that heightened <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> reactions to mental stress contribute to the development of high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> At the same time, they question the clinical utility of stress testing as a prognostic device.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{define the}} range and {{variability}} of ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in normal schoolchildren.  DESIGN—Prospective study.  METHODS—Resting <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> of 1121 schoolchildren from Newcastle upon Tyne was recorded. An ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> device, which uses both auscultatory (Korotkoff) and oscillometric methods of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement, was then put in place for 24 hours.  RESULTS—The day was divided into three time periods: school, home, and night time. Normal centiles for <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{for each of these}} time periods were obtained and many daytime readings were outside reported normal resting levels. The normal variation of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was quantified by comparing each of these time periods with the resting readings. Resting systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> did not predict 24 hour mean systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b>  CONCLUSIONS—The availability of normal ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> data on the level and variation of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in children may facilitate the early identification of hypertension in this age group. ...|$|R

Methods: Height, systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (SBP) and diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (DBP) were measured with standard methods in 2270 healthy school children (1174 boys, 1096 girls) who were selected by multi-stage random sampling in 2003 - 2004 academic years. We produced <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> percentiles by height percentiles using Healy-Rasbash-Yang method. Findings: The <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (both systolic and diastolic) tends to increase with age, but after adjusting the measurements for height, no significant correlation was found between either systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> or diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and age (r=- 0. 03 and P= 0. 15 for systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> r=- 0. 005 and P= 0. 8 for diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure).</b> Then systolic and diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> percentile values by age and height percentiles, and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> smoothed centiles by height in 6. 5 - 11. 5 years school children were derived. Conclusion: Due to genetic, cultural and environmental differences among populations, it is suggested to use local <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> standards in Iran. We produced <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> percentiles by height instead of age because it seems that it would lead to better evaluation for real hypertensive diagnosis...|$|R
