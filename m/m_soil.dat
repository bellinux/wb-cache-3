The network was designed to sample typical site conditions across the urban area, and forms one prototype for the Canadian Urban Seismology Project, intended to gather weak motion data in the short-term, and produce near-realtime shake maps in the long-term. Sites were placed at the Ottawa Observatory and the Eco-Musee (rock), Glebe High School (< 5 <b>m</b> <b>soil),</b> Westminster Avenue (10 <b>m</b> <b>soil),</b> and Fallingbrook (18 <b>m</b> <b>soil).</b> After careful attention to site noise characteristics, the trigger thresholds were set in the range 0. 02 - 0. 12 %g. Observatory recorded a magnitude 3 earthquake at 50 km distance in January 2002, and then all stations (less Eco-Musee which had flooded) recorded a Mw 5. 0 event at 190 km in April 2002. Remarkably, two instruments recorded a Mw 3. 7 aftershock. We have analyzed the 6 records for consistency and find significant amplification and sharp resonance peaks in the Fallingbrook site. Although strong ground motion records are of the greatest value, these weak motion records help to calibrate engineering models in the linear range of soil behavior. Some degree of extrapolation will probably be required to predict local effects for damaging strong motions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Challenges for {{dryland farming}} on the Loess Plateau of China are {{continuous}} nutrient loss, low {{soil organic matter}} and crop yield, and soil degradation. Controlled traffic, combined with zero or minimum tillage and residue cover, has been proposed to improve soil structure and crop yield. From 1998 to 2006, we conducted a field experiment comparing soil organic matter and wheat productivity between controlled traffic and conventional tillage farming systems. The field experiment was conducted using 2 controlled traffic treatments (zero tillage with residue cover and no compaction, shallow tillage with residue cover and no compaction) and a conventional tillage treatment. Results showed that controlled traffic treatments significantly increased soil organic matter and microbial biomass in the 0 – 0. 30 <b>m</b> <b>soil</b> profile. Controlled traffic with zero tillage significantly increased total N in the 0 – 0. 05 <b>m</b> <b>soil</b> profile.

A study was thus conducted in the Western Usambara Mountains, Tanzania to investigate rooting characteristics of Guatemala grass (Tripsacum andersonii), Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and Tithonia shrub (Tithonia diversifolia), also referred to as wild sunflower, and to evaluate their potential for erosion control. For each plant species, mean root diameter (D), root density (RD), root length density (RLD) and root area ratio (RAR) were assessed for six plants in each species and relative soil detachment rate (RSD) predicted. Mean RD values in the 0 - 0. 4 <b>m</b> <b>soil</b> depth for Majulai village and Migambo village respectively were 50. 9 and 58. 6 kg/m 3 for Guatemala grass, 30. 4 and 31. 3 kg/m 3 for Napier grass and 22. 1 and 23. 0 kg/m 3 for Tithonia shrub. RLD values were 35. 9 and 45. 0 km/m 3 for Guatemala grass, 31. 3 and 150. 0 km/m 3 for Napier grass and 10. 5 and 6. 4 km/m 3 for Tithonia shrub.

40|$|Salinity, sodicity, acidity, and {{phytotoxic}} {{levels of}} chloride (Cl) in subsoils are major constraints to crop production in many soils of north-eastern Australia because they reduce {{the ability of}} crop roots to extract water and nutrients from the soil. The complex interactions and correlations among soil properties result in multi-colinearity between soil properties and crop yield {{that makes it difficult}} to determine which constraint is the major limitation. We used ridge-regression analysis to overcome colinearity to evaluate the contribution of soil factors and water supply to the variation in the yields of 5 winter crops on soils with various levels and combinations of subsoil constraints in the region. Subsoil constraints measured were soil Cl, electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (ECse), and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). The ridge regression procedure selected several of the variables used in a descriptive model, which included in-crop rainfall, plant-available soil water at sowing in the 0. 90 - 1. 10 <b>m</b> <b>soil</b> layer, and soil Cl in the 0. 90 - 1. 10 <b>m</b> <b>soil</b> layer, and accounted for 77 - 85 % of the variation in the grain yields of the 5 winter crops.

Subsoil Cl concentration was found to be an effective substitute for subsoil water extraction. The estimates of the critical levels of subsoil Cl for a 10 % reduction in the grain yield were 492 mg cl/kg for chickpea, 662 mg Cl/kg for durum wheat, 854 mg Cl/kg for bread wheat, 980 mg Cl/kg for canola, and 1012 mg Cl/kg for barley, thus suggesting that chickpea and durum wheat were more sensitive to subsoil Cl than bread wheat, barley, and canola...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to present an approach based on the thermal inertia approach to estimate the profile of soil moisture content (SMC) in the top 1 <b>m</b> <b>soil</b> column using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. In the approach, both diurnal Land Surface Temperature (LST) difference and broadband albedo (α 0) are used to determine the spatial-temporal variation of SMC. The SMC retrieval rationale is that the high Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) values represent the high soil moisture contents, and the opposites are true for the low ATI values. The approach assumes that the water flux in the top 1 <b>m</b> <b>soil</b> column is proportional to the difference in SMC at the surface and bottom of the soil column. The water balance equation can then be applied over the soil column, which results in the establishment of a relationship between the areal mean of SMC in the soil column and the remotely sensed surface SMC. The established SMC relationship is calibrated using the experimental data and a new soil texture classification technique based on the existing Chinese soil type classification. The SMC relationship is validated over a typical arid and semi-arid area in Xinjiang. The observed soil texture data is used in the application of the SMC relationship. Results show that the SMC relationship has the best performance for the loam and loamy clay types of soils, as the values of estimated SMC are very much close to the Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) observations. In comparison with the TDR observation, a marginal relative error of 2. 16 % is found in the estimated SMC in a subarea with the sandy type of soil. Our result demonstrates the potential of using the established SMC relationship to map the spatial-temporal variation of SMC in the top 1 <b>m</b> <b>soil</b> column using the MODIS imagery over arid and semi-arid areas.

The plant attributes determined were dry matter yield of U. brizantha (DMY), and grain yield (GY) and final plant population (PP) of winter common bean. The soil physical attributes, evaluated at 0. 0 - 0. 10 m and 0. 10 - 0. 20 m, were soil bulk density (BD), macroporosity (MA), microporosity (MI), total porosity (TP), penetration resistance (PR), gravimetric water content (GW), and volumetric water content (VW).

Method: A 15 N tracer methodology with 15 N enriched ammonium-sulphate placed at three different soil depths (0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 2 m) was applied to determine the depth dependent soil N-access measured as plant 15 N-uptake in pure stands, two-species and four-species grassland plant communities. Important findings: The study showed that herbage yield of the four-species mixture including deep- and shallow rooted grassland plant species was generally greater than both the pure stands and the two-species mixture, besides for lucerne in pure stand. This positive plant diversity effect in the four-species mixture on above-ground herbage yield could not be explained by complementary soil 15 N uptake from 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 2 <b>m</b> <b>soil</b> depths, even though chicory indicated deep soil 15 N uptake.

The developed relational diagram predicts how modelled regional groundwater levels and flooding patterns {{are related to the}} occurrence of different vegetation types in this peatland watershed. In dry conditions when groundwater levels are deeper than 1 <b>m</b> below <b>soil</b> surface, fire risk increases. When areas susceptible to fire actually burn and both vegetation and peat disappear, the total inundated area will expand with a factor five. In wet conditions with groundwater levels of more than 1 <b>m</b> above <b>soil</b> surface for a prolonged period of time, flooding limits restoration possibilities as plant species cannot successfully regrow. In the intermediate range, rehabilitation of different plant species is promising and is related to the actual hydrological regime...|$|R
