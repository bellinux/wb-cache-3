In this paper we use arrangement theory to determine the number of ranking patterns theoretically for all m and numerically for m ≤ 8.

50|$|In 1995 Borland {{released}} Delphi, {{its first}} release of an Object Pascal IDE and language. Up until that point, Borland's Turbo Pascal for DOS and Windows {{was largely a}} procedural language, with minimal object-oriented features, and building UI frameworks with the language required using frameworks like Turbo Vision and <b>Object</b> <b>Windows</b> Library. OWL, a similar framework to MFC, required writing code to create UI objects.|$|R
50|$|<b>Object</b> <b>Windows</b> Library (OWL), {{designed}} for use with Borland's Turbo C++ compiler, was a competing product introduced by Borland around the same time.

40|$|Training {{a generic}} objectness measure {{to produce a}} small set of {{candidate}} <b>object</b> <b>windows,</b> {{has been shown to}} speed up the classical sliding <b>window</b> <b>object</b> detection paradigm. We observe that generic objects with well-defined closed boundary can be discriminated by looking at the norm of gradients, with a suitable resizing of their cor-responding image windows in to a small fixed size. Based on this observation and computational reasons, we propose to resize the window to 8 × 8 and use the norm of the gra-dients as a simple 64 D feature to describe it, for explicitly training a generic objectness measure. We further show how the binarized version of this fea-ture, namely binarized normed gradients (BING), can be used for efficient objectness estimation, which requires only a few atomic operations (e. g. ADD, BITWISE SHIFT, etc.). Experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset show that our method efficiently (300 fps on a single lap-top CPU) generates a small set of category-independent, high quality <b>object</b> <b>windows,</b> yielding 96. 2 % object detec-tion rate (DR) with 1, 000 proposals. Increasing the num-bers of proposals and color spaces for computing BING fea-tures, our performance can be further improved to 99. 5 % DR. 1...|$|R
