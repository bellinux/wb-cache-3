After the divorce was finalised, Gallagher admitted he had only claimed to have cheated in order to speed up the divorce process and that he had never actually been unfaithful.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield {{had long}} felt {{uncomfortable with the}} idea of medical {{officers}} marrying. Louise Hind, in Gender and Class in English Asylums, 1890–1914, hints that this might have been the result of misogynist tendencies, although Hubert Bond, his obituary-writer and former colleague, preemptively defended him against these claims. Stansfield nevertheless married twice; firstly, in 1908 to Mary Caroline (died 1926), a daughter of the Hon. James Dever, a Canadian senator from St John's, Newfoundland. After her death, he married (in 1929) Marie, second daughter of Alexander Effremoff, of Moscow; he had <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Paris, where she had been living in exile after the Russian Revolution. There were no children from either marriage, but he worked with the scouting movement, and served as President of the North Central Kent Boys' Scouts Association. He was a fond rose-grower and it was the gardens at Southmead in Wimbledon which attracted him and his first wife to the house; they lived there for many years. He retired to Castello Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, with his second wife, before going to Paris to seek treatment for an illness; he died there on 19 February 1939. His widow remained at the Castello in Sanremo until her death in 1973, spending her last 21 years as starosta of the Russian Orthodox parish community there.|$|E

25|$|Lucas could {{possibly}} {{be involved in the}} murders of two young unidentified people found in Sumter County, South Carolina in 1976. Lucas stated that he had been in South Carolina {{on the day of the}} crime. Lucas is also suspected in the death of another unidentified victim, the New Castle County Jane Doe, who was discovered in June 1977. He had described a crime scene similar to the one that this woman was found. Yet another unidentified victim was discovered in 1980, that of the Walker County Jane Doe. It was initially believed that Lucas was responsible for both her murder and sexual assault. However, a bite mark on the girl's shoulder has not been confirmed to match Lucas's dental charts. Lucas confessed to the murder of a young woman found in 1981 in Corona, California that had been buried near a freeway, citing he had <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the town of Riverside.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June 1539, Norfolk, the Duke of Suffolk, and Thomas Cromwell dined with King Henry VIII {{as guests}} of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. During a heated {{discussion}} about Cardinal Wolsey, Cromwell charged Norfolk with disloyalty and Norfolk called Cromwell a liar. Their mutual hostility was now {{out in the}} open. Cromwell inadvertently played into Norfolk's hands by taking the initiative in the King's marriage to Anne of Cleves. The King's disillusionment with Anne's physical appearance when he <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> January 1540, and his desire to have the marriage annulled after the wedding had taken place, gave Norfolk an opportunity to bring down his enemy, Cromwell. On 10 June 1540, Cromwell was arrested at a Privy Council meeting on charges of high treason, and Norfolk personally 'tore the St George from his neck’. On 9 July 1540, King Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleves was annulled. On 28 July 1540, Cromwell was executed, and on the same day, the King wed Norfolk's other niece, Catherine Howard, as his fifth wife. As {{a result of this}} marriage, for a time, Norfolk enjoyed political prominence, royal favour, and material rewards.|$|E

25|$|Fincher {{intended}} to make The Game before Seven, but when Brad Pitt became available for Seven, that project took priority. The success of Seven helped the producers of The Game get the larger budget that they wanted. Then, they approached Michael Douglas to star in the film. He was hesitant at first because of concerns that PolyGram was not a big enough company to distribute the film. However, once on board, Douglas' presence helped get the film into production. At the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, PolyGram announced that Jodie Foster would be starring in the film with Douglas. However, Fincher was uncomfortable with putting a movie star of her stature in a supporting part. After talking to her, he considered rewriting the character of Conrad as Nicholas' daughter so that Foster could play that role. However, the actress had a scheduling conflict with the Robert Zemeckis film Contact and could not appear in The Game. Once she left, the role of Conrad was offered to Jeff Bridges but he declined and Sean Penn was cast instead. Deborah Kara Unger's audition {{for the role of}} Christine was a test reel consisting of a two-minute sex scene from David Cronenberg's Crash. Douglas thought it was a joke but when he and Fincher <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> person, they were impressed by her acting.|$|E
500|$|Despite these criticisms, {{the novel}} still {{captured}} {{the imagination of}} many Americans. According to Stowe's son, when Abraham Lincoln <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> 1862 Lincoln commented, [...] "So this is the little lady who started this great war." [...] Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made. Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement. Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement.|$|E

Schuur was noticed by country music singer/actor Jimmy Wakely, who <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> an Elks Club in 1971 when she was eighteen. After auditioning for him, Wakely arranged a recording session in California. Accompanied by her sister, Schuur took her first airplane trip to the session in Burbank, [...] and made a 45rpm record of a song called [...] "Dear Mommy and Daddy".

500|$|Sullivan's longest {{love affair}} {{was with the}} American socialite, Fanny Ronalds, a woman three years his senior, who had two children. He <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Paris around 1867, and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to London {{permanently}} in 1871. A contemporary account described Fanny Ronalds this way: [...] "Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, her features small and exquisitely regular. Her hair was a dark shade of brown – châtain foncé [...] – and very abundant ... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth." [...] Sullivan called her [...] "the best amateur singer in London". [...] She often performed Sullivan's songs at her famous Sunday soirees. She became particularly associated with [...] "The Lost Chord", singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan accompanying her. When Sullivan died, he left her the autograph manuscript of that song, along with other bequests.|$|E
500|$|Colt {{historian}} William Edwards {{wrote that}} Caroline Henshaw married Samuel Colt in Scotland when Colt <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Europe {{and that the}} son she bore was Samuel Colt's and not John Colt's. In a 1953 biography about Samuel Colt based largely on family letters, Edwards wrote that John's marriage to Caroline {{was a way to}} legitimize her son, Sammy. [...] Samuel Colt had abandoned her because he felt she was not fit to be the wife of an industrialist and divorce was a social stigma at the time. [...] Samuel Colt took care of the child named Samuel Caldwell Colt financially with a large allowance and paid for his tuition in what was described as [...] "the finest private schools". [...] In correspondence with and about his namesake, Samuel Colt referred to him as his [...] "nephew" [...] in quotes. [...] Historians such as Edwards and Harold Schechter have said this was the elder Colt's way of letting the world know that the boy was his own son without directly saying so. After Samuel Colt's death in 1862, he left the boy $2 million by 2010 standards. [...] Colt's widow, Elizabeth Jarvis Colt, and her brother contested this. [...] In probate Caroline's son Sam produced a valid marriage license showing that Caroline and Samuel Colt were married in Scotland in 1838 and that this document made him a rightful heir to part of Colt's estate, if not to the Colt Manufacturing Company.|$|E
500|$|The Ninth Doctor first {{appears in}} the episode [...] "Rose" [...] where he rescues 19-year-old shopgirl Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) from an Auton attack in the {{department}} store where she works. After Rose helps the Doctor defeat the Nestene Consciousness (living plastic), he invites her to travel {{with him in the}} TARDIS. On their first trip he takes her to witness the destruction of planet Earth in the year five billion. It is revealed that the Doctor's own species, the Time Lords, have been destroyed and the Doctor is the last of his kind. Following from this they visit Cardiff in 1869 where they encounter author Charles Dickens, of whom the Doctor claims to be a big fan. When faced with a near death situation, the Doctor tells Rose that he was glad to have <b>met</b> <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> taking Rose home the Doctor accidentally returns to earth 12 months after they left. Because of his actions he is treated like an Internet predator by Rose's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri) and Rose's boyfriend Mickey (Noel Clarke) has become Rose's murder suspect. After Mickey helps the Doctor and Rose defeat the Slitheen by firing a missile at their base at 10 Downing Street, the Doctor offers Mickey a place in the TARDIS with them but he refuses. In the episode [...] "Dalek" [...] the Doctor encounters a Dalek, though he had believed the race to be extinct as the [...] "Time War" [...] between the Time Lords and Daleks concluded with the mutual annihilation of both races—an event for which the Doctor himself was responsible. The Doctor tortures the surviving Dalek {{and at the end of}} the episode attempts to kill it in cold blood. He refrains once Rose calls him out on this.|$|E
