5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, agility and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail <b>muscle</b> <b>mass</b> may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the <b>muscle</b> <b>mass</b> in the tail of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis <b>muscle</b> <b>mass</b> out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail <b>muscle</b> <b>mass</b> would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight; improving its overall balance and agility. This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing rotational inertia. Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} <b>muscle</b> <b>mass</b> in the legs, particularly at the ankles. To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He found a few similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less <b>muscle</b> <b>mass</b> in the ankles but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E
50|$|Sim2, a BHLH-Pas {{transcription}} factor, inhibits transcription by active {{repression and}} displays enhanced expression in ventral limb <b>muscle</b> <b>masses</b> during chick and mouse embryonic development.

40|$|International audienceThe basic helix-loop-helix {{transcription}} factor MyoD {{is a central}} actor that triggers the skeletal myogenic program. Cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous regulatory pathways must tightly control MyoD expression to ensure correct initiation of the muscle program at different places in the embryo and at different developmental times. In the present study, we have addressed the involvement of Sim 2 (single-minded 2) in limb embryonic myogenesis. Sim 2 is a bHLH-PAS {{transcription factor}} that inhibits transcription by active repression and displays enhanced expression in ventral limb <b>muscle</b> <b>masses</b> during chick and mouse embryonic myogenesis. We have demonstrated that Sim 2 is expressed in muscle progenitors that have not entered the myogenic program, in different experimental conditions. MyoD expression is transiently upregulated in limb <b>muscle</b> <b>masses</b> of Sim 2 (-/-) mice. Conversely, Sim 2 gain-of-function experiments in chick and Xenopus embryos showed that Sim 2 represses MyoD expression. In addition, we show that Sim 2 represses {{the activity of the}} mouse MyoD promoter in primary myoblasts and is recruited to the MyoD core enhancer in embryonic mouse limbs. Sim 2 expression is non-autonomously and negatively regulated by the dorsalising factor Lmx 1 b. We propose that Sim 2 represses MyoD transcription in limb <b>muscle</b> <b>masses,</b> through Sim 2 recruitment to the MyoD core enhancer, in order to prevent premature entry into the myogenic program. This MyoD repression is predominant in ventral limb regions and is likely to contribute to the differential increase of the global <b>mass</b> of ventral <b>muscles</b> versus dorsal muscles...|$|R

40|$|Flexible {{metabolic}} phenotypes allow {{animals to}} adjust physiology to better fit ecological or environmental demands, thereby influencing fitness. Summit metabolic rate (Msum =maximal thermogenic capacity) {{is one such}} flexible trait. Skeletal <b>muscle</b> and heart <b>masses</b> and myocyte metabolic intensity are potential drivers of Msum flexibility in birds. We examined correlations of skeletal <b>muscle</b> and heart <b>masses</b> and pectoralis <b>muscle</b> citrate synthase (CS) activity (an indicator of cellular metabolic intensity) with Msum in house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) to determine whether these traits are associated with Msum variation. Pectoralis mass {{was positively correlated with}} Msum for both species, but no significant correlation remained for either species after accounting for body mass (Mb) variation. Combined flight and leg <b>muscle</b> <b>masses</b> were also not significantly correlated with Msum for either species. In contrast, heart mass was significantly positively correlated with Msum for juncos and nearly so (P = 0. 054) for sparrows. Mass-specific and total pectoralis CS activities were significantly positively correlated with Msum for sparrows, but not for juncos. Thus, myocyte metabolic intensity influences Msum variation in house sparrows, although the stronger correlation of total (r = 0. 495) than mass-specific (r = 0. 378) CS activity with Msum suggests that both pectoralis mass and metabolic intensity impact Msum. In contrast, neither skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>masses</b> nor pectoralis metabolic intensity varied with Msum in juncos. However, heart mass was associated with Msum variation in both species. These data suggest that drivers of metabolic flexibility are not uniform among bird species...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} foot and ankle myology of gibbons and bonobos, and compares {{it with the}} human foot. Gibbons and bonobos are both highly {{arboreal}} species, yet {{they have a different}} locomotor behaviour. Gibbon locomotion is almost exclusively arboreal and is characterized by speed and mobility, whereas bonobo locomotion entails some terrestrial knuckle-walking and both mobility and stability are important. We examine if these differences in locomotion are reflected in their foot myology. Therefore, we have executed detailed dissections of the lower hind limb of two bonobo and three gibbon cadavers. We took several measurements on the isolated <b>muscles</b> (<b>mass,</b> length, physiological cross sectional area, etc.) and calculated the relative <b>muscle</b> <b>masses</b> and belly lengths of the major muscle groups to make interspecific comparisons. An extensive description of all foot and ankle muscles is given and differences between gibbons, bonobos and humans are discussed. No major {{differences were found between the}} foot and ankle musculature of both apes; however, marked differences were found between the ape and human foot.

5|$|Limousin muscling is {{intermediate}} {{to that of}} British cattle breeds such as Angus, Hereford, and Shorthorn and {{the extreme}} double muscling found in the European Belgian Blue and Piedmontese breeds. Studies of double-muscled cattle identified natural mutations of the myostatin gene which produce inactivated proteins that are unable to control muscle development. In Belgian Blue and Piedmontese cattle this causes an increase in <b>muscle</b> <b>mass</b> of 20–25%. Subsequent studies identified a less extreme myostatin mutation known as F94L associated with Limousins. The resulting partially active protein results in Limousins having intermediate muscle development, which avoids the extreme muscling and associated disadvantages of double muscled cattle.|$|E

Variants of the gene produce proteins that are less effective at controlling muscle development, which results in increased <b>muscle</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E

40|$|Mice with a {{targeted}} mutation in the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix regulatory protein myogenin have severe muscle defects resulting in perinatal death. In this report, {{the effect of}} myogenin's absence on embryonic and fetal development is investigated. The initial events of somite differentiation occurred normally in the myogenin-mutant embryos. During primary myogenesis, <b>muscle</b> <b>masses</b> in mutant embryos developed simultaneously with control siblings, although muscle differentiation within the mutant <b>muscle</b> <b>masses</b> was delayed. More dramatic effects were observed when secondary myofibers form. During this time, very little muscle formation {{took place in the}} mutants, suggesting that the absence of myogenin affected secondary myogenesis more severely than primary myogenesis. Monitoring mutant neonates with fiber type-specific myosin isoforms indicated that different fiber types were present in the residual muscle. No evidence was found to indicate that myogenin was required for the formation of muscle in one region of the embryo and not another. The expression patterns of a MyoD- lacZ transgene in myogenin-mutant embryos demonstrated that myogenin was not essential for the activation of the MyoD gene. Together, these results indicate that late stages of embryogenesis are more dependent on myogenin than early stages, and that myogenin is not required for the initial aspects of myogenesis, including myotome formation and the appearance of myoblasts...|$|R
