5|$|Planning for {{the freeway}} began in 1954, with the {{proposal}} for a freeway from Elliott Bay to the Central Freeway, later I-5, via Broad and Mercer streets added to the city's comprehensive plan in 1957. Funded by a bond measure passed by Seattle voters in 1960, plans were drawn for the newly renamed Bay Freeway to serve a multi-purpose stadium at the Seattle Center via an elevated structure. Citizen groups voiced {{their opposition to the}} project at public hearings in 1967, forcing the Seattle Engineering Department to consider other designs. After determining that a cut-and-cover tunnel would not be feasible, a second series of public hearings to discuss the impact of an elevated option were held in 1970, leading to widespread controversy and a civil suit launched in opposition to the freeway. The lawsuit ended in November 1971, with a King County Superior Court judge ruling that a major deviation from the voter-approved 1960 plan occurred, forcing a referendum to be held on whether to continue the project. On February 8, 1972, the Bay Freeway project was rejected by a 10,000-vote margin in a <b>municipal</b> <b>referendum,</b> alongside the repeal of the R.H. Thomson Expressway. Mercer Street would later undergo several projects that attempted to provide congestion relief promised by the rejected freeway, culminating in the Mercer Corridor Project in 2012, which widened the street into a boulevard.|$|E

500|$|Leafs {{co-owner}} Stafford Smythe rejected {{accusations that}} he opposed expansion to Vancouver, {{pointing out that}} he had offered to build and operate an $8million facility in the city's downtown area, a proposal that he contended made little sense unless Vancouver had an NHL team. However, Smythe's proposal was contingent on him acquiring the parcel of land required from the city, then valued at $2.5 million, for $1. The proposed transaction was defeated in a <b>municipal</b> <b>referendum.</b> [...] Smythe therefore placed the blame for Vancouver's failed bid on the city: [...] "Vancouver lost its chance the day it turned down the referendum on our arena proposal", Smythe said. [...] "That proved to me that the people out there aren't interested in going major league." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{process to}} demerge from the forced {{amalgamation}} was complicated.(see Quebec <b>municipal</b> <b>referendums,</b> 2004 and 2000-2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec) The first stage was {{to sign a}} register {{in order for a}} referendum to be held, then the population had to vote a second time. In several areas, the referendums failed because even though a majority of those voting supported demerging, it did not meet the required threshold of 35% of registered voters. This process was detailed in a documentary film called The Village Resists: The Forced Municipal Mergers of Quebec by Ryan Young that followed the municipality of Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue as it fought successfully to demerge.|$|R

50|$|Referendums {{can be held}} in a {{municipality}} about a {{local political}} issue. Such referendums are common, and often held {{in connection with a}} general election.

The most well known Swedish <b>municipal</b> <b>referendum</b> is the 1988 Sjöbo referendum where the voters passed a motion to stop refugees from seeking asylum in the municipality.|$|E
