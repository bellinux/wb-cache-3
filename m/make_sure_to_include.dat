5000|$|Porn {{stars have}} differing {{views on the}} idea of women’s pornography. Some {{performers}} embrace the movement, like Asa Akira, an award-winning porn star. Akira stated “I’m part of the new era of porn. We’re feminists, very sex-positive people. We’re not victims of rape, not drug addicts, we don’t have any daddy issues.” [...] Some performers also note the problems in the industry and then turn to directing themselves, like Madison Young. Young felt that most mainstream adult film videos lacked substance and sent confusing and potentially harmful signals about sex and body image to viewers. As a result, she turned to directing to add to the new movement of porn. Madison <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> verbal consent, body positivity, and inclusiveness to all her performances.Meanwhile, other performers fail to see the need for a specific type of porn just for women. As porn star James Deen put it, “Why is there porn explicitly only for women?

This is how their sexuality should be.” It’s counterproductive (from what I understand) to the equality movement.” ...|$|R

You are {{going to create a}} decentralized framework of data storage and transformation that will allow you to quickly process large amounts of information. In this project you will provide SCOOP support for the implementation of a general class of concurrent divide-and-conquer algorithms, based on a tree data structure. Nodes can delegate tasks to a number of sub-nodes and compute a result {{based on the results of}} the sub-nodes and some additional computations. As an example, consider an algorithm to find the longest word in a book. The algorithm assigns the job to the root of the tree. The root divides the book into sets of pages or sets of paragraphs and assigns each set to a sub-node. Each sub-node returns the longest word in its respective set. The main node will compute its result by finding the longest word among the longest words from its sub-nodes. Each sub-node can recursively use further sub-nodes to find the longest word in its set. Your job is to devise a SCOOP-based scheme for such tree-based, concurrent divide-andconquer algorithms and to demonstrate the applicability of this scheme to at least two applications: the longest word problem, and another of your own invention. For the implementations, no GUI is required. The applications can use either the standard console or a text file. The main focus is on the concurrency issues and the way you handle them with SCOOP. It is recommended to solve the exercise in teams of up to two people.

This content {{analysis}} explores the gender roles and stereotypes {{in the top}} three best-selling adolescent books {{over the past ten years}} (2004 - 2014). The research was gathered on the books: Twilight (Meyer, 2005), Divergent (Roth, 2012), and The Hunger Games (Collins, 2008) through book synopsis, book notes, and methodological notes. Because a transaction takes place between the reader and text when one reads and books are an important mode of transmitting social and cultural norms, it is during reading that these cultural norms can be transmitted. In this study a typological analysis using aspects of Heine et al. 's (1999) Characteristics to Consider when Examining Children's Books for Positive Gender Role Models and open analysis were used and revealed major and minor themes in regard to both gender roles and stereotypes, as well as progressive gender roles. Findings reveal the major themes being lack of autonomy, damsel in distress, and conventional female stereotypes (a focus on physical/outward appearance, mama bear (compelled to protect young), and female being passive/submissive). The minor themes were cares for others (the characters putting others wants/needs/feelings before their own wants/needs/feelings), value of romance (the female needing the love of a man to be happy and a boyfriend/husband equals female worth), and traditional male stereotypes (the male behaving in an aggressive/assertive manner, controlling and strong).

40|$|Performance pay is a trickier idea than {{it might}} first seem, writes JACK WATERFORD PERFORMANCE pay for {{teachers}} is such an obviously good idea that anyone who is against it is obviously against rewarding excellence, fostering innovation, improving student outcomes, measurement of performance or improving teacher status, pay and conditions. That those who seem most adamantly against it - teachers’ unions - are so much against it suggests that they want mediocrity, that they are scared to have their performance critically appraised, {{and that they would}} prefer to handicap teacher and student talent to the performance of strugglers, stragglers and people who should not even be there. This, at any event, is the proposition of the federal education minister, Julie Bishop, and the federal government, members of which have been pushing schools, without great success, for performance pay, as well as performance standards, for years. The states have shown no enthusiasm, teachers’ unions have been positively antagonistic, and even private schools have been dragging the chain. Even the odd federal minister, not least the treasurer, Peter Costello, has reservations, if more about ending up footing the bill than about the principle. But now it is, thinks Ms Bishop, a time for federal leadership and at least some pilot programs - perhaps necessarily in the private sector since it seems impossible to get any state government cooperation. I wish her well, but I expect she will fail, and for a simple reason. Performance pay systems based on bonuses for demonstrated extra performance don’t work. They do not work in industry. They do not work in the public service. They might work, in a manner of speaking, in the merchant banking industry, where executives award each other million-dollar bonuses, but they especially do not work in team-based operations where it is difficult to separate individual performance from the work of the group. And, as the public service has discovered (as it has been busily repeating the mistakes made in other earlier jurisdictions, simply because of the ideological assumptions of ministers, Labor and Liberal), performance pay can actually undermine the team, and adversely affect overall performance. It can create cultures where it is not net improvement in public service or outputs which counts, but a culture of personal rewards where undermining colleagues and the team pays better than putting one’s shoulder to the common weal. That’s not to say that teachers should all be paid the same. Or paid the same according to how long {{they have been in the}} system. Or according to the title they have, or the level or skills of the class they teach. Nor does it mean that the resistance and opposition of teachers to any form of objective determination of educational outputs deserves any public support. There are alternatives to the drab mediocrities of teacher awards and schemes based on bonuses, piece work and alignment of the system to exam results. But they need a lot of thinking out - a good deal more thinking than has been going into the sloganising of those, such as Ms Bishop, who think that mere differential rewards based on “performance” will improve individual or group performance of school students. The mere question of “what performance” is a good start. Is it good performance, or improved performance? And performance at what level? And how measured? Assume, for example, that it was possible, perhaps by an IQ test, to rate all students on a one to 100 scale in terms of their performance or expected performance. Does raising average outcomes three points from 50 to 53 count as much as raising average performance in a different demographic from 70 to 73 ? Is performance improvement with students of advanced maths at Year 12 the same as performance improvement with teaching Year 1 students in elementary reading, or sums? Do we judge changed performance only by standard external measures in, say, literacy and maths or do we, or can we, rate performance change for less easily measurable subjects, such as art or drama? Do we pin everything on external measures which can reduce education to the memorisation and regurgitation of facts, these days by multiple choice tests, rather than to the wider, but less measurable acquisition of knowledge or skills? If we reward “good results” by teachers, what happens to the students of classes that get worse results, or bad results? How do we avoid a descending cycle by which “bad” schools get worse because there is less to pay for good teachers, and “good” schools become even better because they have happier, better paid teachers? But then again, if one recognises this problem by giving “bad” schools extra money so as to recruit and motivate better teachers, how can one avoid rewarding bad performance, or, at the “good” schools, punishing good performance? It is for reasons such as this that dedicated educators have largely given up on bonus systems. All the more so in jurisdictions, such as in America, where the very idea of such systems has sprung from ideology and with rules, or base-conditions, that have proven counter-productive. One doesn’t, for example make up for the problems of inadequate base pay with some bonuses which will make a few teachers earn a decent salary. You have to start with essentially decent salaries in the first place, otherwise you cannot recruit the talent capable of making big differences. There’s no point in artificial limits on how many can get bonuses (say one in four), or in having rewards are focused only in measurable fields say English and maths. As a recent report by a team of top American teachers put it, “how can we say we want every student to have a great teacher, but then say that we will reward only some predetermined smaller percentage of teachers for their greatness?” This report, which, to give her credit is being circulated by Ms Bishop, (www. teachingquality. org/pdfs/TSreport. pdf) argues that it is student achievement which is the base line, but that it is achievement over time, not performance on standardised tests, which ought to count. And there ought to be measurement of small team performance as well as individual achievement. Teachers, it says, should get more pay for addition qualifications and professional achievement, but only if it is relevant to what a school needs. One size does not fit all, and different schools and different school systems must be able to tailor their systems in ways that are focused on their specific goals, not on generalised goals. “For example, though math, science and special education might be the highest-needs subjects nationally, it makes no sense for an individual community to pay more for a math teacher if it actually needs more art and history teachers”. One has to encourage teamwork and collaboration, not punish it. “Highly competitive compensation plans discourage the teamwork and sharing of successful strategies that research has shown, time and again, to be a hallmark of high performing schools. Incentives should also be used to promote close collaboration between small teams at the department or grade level, where ‘team effects’ are most likely to produce better results for teachers. ” There should be incentives for teachers willing to work in high-need low-performing schools, but only if they are qualified. “Sending a willing but unqualified or underprepared teacher to such a school can do more harm than good”. There are three other recommendations: reward leadership, not seniority; be brave, be bold; and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> accomplished teachers in any efforts to overhaul teacher pay schemes. And even then, there is no great guarantee of success. But that was in the US, of course. Thank God such mistakes could not happen here. • Jack Waterford is editor-at-large of the Canberra Times, where this article first appeared. Photo: Lisa Thornberg/iStockphoto. co...|$|E
