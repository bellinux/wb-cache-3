50|$|Probable Maximum Loss (PML) is a {{term used}} in the {{insurance}} industry as well as Commercial Real Estate. Although the definition is not consistent in the insurance industry, it is generally defined as {{the value of the}} largest loss that could result from a disaster, assuming the normal functioning of passive protective features (e.g. firewalls, nonflammable materials, flood defences etc.) and proper functioning of most (perhaps not all) active suppression systems (e.g. sprinklers). This loss estimate is always less than (or in rare cases, equal to) the <b>Maximum</b> <b>Foreseeable</b> <b>Loss,</b> which assumes the failure of all active protective features. Underwriting decisions can be influenced by PML evaluations, and the amount of reinsurance ceded on a risk can be predicated on the PML valuation.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{procedure}} for Risk Assessment, which {{makes use of}} two risk indices (PML - Probable Maximum Loss and MFL - <b>Maximum</b> <b>Foreseeable</b> <b>Loss)</b> is applied to power plants to evaluate potential economic losses due to risk exposure for two different loss scenarios (probable and worst-case). The paper is mainly focused on Property Insurance aspects, though Boiler and Machinery Insurance and business interruption are also addressed. First, the procedure is applied to provide a prediction of probable and maximum loss {{as a function of}} power output. The results allow an estimate of whether the adoption of risk assessment procedures and devices allows an actual payback for plant owners. Second, the economic loss predicted through the risk assessment procedure is compared against real power plant loss values, taken from published data...|$|E
30|$|The worst {{credible}} consequence (WCC) {{scenario is}} the first step in evaluating a scenario. It considers the scenario when all active fire protection systems are impaired. Active fire protection systems can be active fire suppression systems such as sprinklers, evacuation alarm, self closing doors activated by smoke detection etc. This scenario has similarities with <b>maximum</b> <b>foreseeable</b> <b>loss</b> or estimated maximum loss within the insurance industry. However, it should be pointed out that different insurance companies have different definitions, some assumes that fire walls are not breeched and others require a special fire wall or physical separation if it should be assumed to limit the fire damage. The benefit of analyzing this scenario is that it provides information to whether active fire protection systems are needed to meet the protection objectives. If the protection objectives are met without any active fire protection system there is no need to conduct any further analysis of the scenario. Further, if protection objectives are met, there is no need to analyze impairment of the fire protection systems due to any reason (as part of antagonistic attack or common failures), hence there is no need to analyze the availability and reliability of the systems.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{procedure}} for Risk Assessment, which {{makes use of}} two risk indices (PML e Probable Maximum Loss and MFL e <b>Maximum</b> <b>Foreseeable</b> <b>Loss)</b> is applied to power plants to evaluate potential economic losses due to risk exposure for two different loss scenarios (probable and worst-case). First, the procedure is presented {{in order to provide}} a prediction of probable and maximum loss as a function of power output. Second, the economic loss predicted through the risk assessment procedure is compared to real power plant loss values, taken from published data, to validate the methodology against field data. Finally, the procedure is applied to some combined-cycle power plants by also including the contribution of business interruption losses. In this manner, the most common sources of loss are identified. A sample analysis for risk/benefit evaluation is also carried out to estimate whether the adoption of risk assessment procedures allows an actual profit for plant owners. Customer feedback is also discussed. The results presented in this paper allow a practical and easy-to-use rule of thumb for loss estimation and a guideline for plant owners to evaluate the impact of risk assessment procedures on operational costs...|$|E
2500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{breach of}} {{contract}} is defined in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 as: [...] non-performance, [...] poor performance, [...] part-performance, or [...] performance which is substantially different from what was reasonably expected. [...] Innocent parties may repudiate (cancel) the contract only for a major breach (breach of condition), but they may always recover compensatory damages, provided that the breach has caused <b>foreseeable</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{stated that}} the {{majority}} of arbitrators had applied too crude a test of what the type of <b>foreseeable</b> <b>loss</b> was. The industry's common understanding was crucial to Hadley v Baxendale. The question was not simply, what was a probable loss, but what the parties had in mind, or what was in their contemplation, regarding the nature of the business transaction. He noted Goff J's statement in Satef-Huttenes Albertus SpA v Paloma Tercera Shipping Co SA (The Pegase) 1981 Lloydâ€™s Rep 175, 183, asking what a reasonable person would have thought his responsibility was.|$|R
5000|$|To recover damages, a {{claimant}} {{must show}} that the breach of contract caused <b>foreseeable</b> <b>loss.</b> [...] Hadley v Baxendale established that the test of foreseeability is both objective or subjective. In other words, is it foreseeable to the objective bystander, or to the contracting parties, who may have special knowledge? On {{the facts of this}} case, where a miller lost production because a carrier delayed taking broken mill parts for repair, the court held that no damages were payable since the <b>loss</b> was <b>foreseeable</b> neither by the [...] "reasonable man" [...] nor by the carrier, both of whom would have expected the miller to have a spare part in store.|$|R
5000|$|Foreseeable events {{should not}} cause losses beyond ten times VaR. If they do {{they should be}} hedged or insured, or the {{business}} plan should be changed to avoid them, or VaR should be increased. It's hard {{to run a business}} if <b>foreseeable</b> <b>losses</b> are orders of magnitude larger than very large everyday losses. It's hard to plan for these events, because they are out of scale with daily experience. Of course there will be unforeseeable losses more than ten times VaR, but it's pointless to anticipate them, you can't know much about them and it results in needless worrying. Better to hope that the discipline of preparing for all foreseeable three-to-ten times VaR losses will improve chances for surviving the unforeseen and larger losses that inevitably occur.|$|R
5000|$|This {{reasoning}} matches that in English law {{where any}} <b>foreseeable</b> <b>loss</b> of control is excluded from automatism. To hold {{otherwise would be}} to excuse any driver or other person engaged in an activity where public safety is an issue, {{from the consequences of}} a loss of control that occurred after losing consciousness. Only sudden and unexpected health problems avoid culpability. In Scots law, Cardle v Mulrainey (1992) SCCR 658 applies the general requirement for cases involving a defence based on insanity or a comparable state, that there must be a total alienation of reason leading to a loss of self-control, to a case in which the accused claimed that he had involuntarily consumed a drug which had the effect that {{he knew what he was}} doing but was unable to refrain from acting (at 668): ...|$|R
25|$|The diver has a {{very limited}} ability to survive without a supply of {{breathing}} gas. Any interruption to that supply must be considered a life-threatening emergency, and the diver {{should be prepared to}} deal effectively with any reasonably <b>foreseeable</b> <b>loss</b> of breathing gas. Temporary interruptions due to flooding or dislodging the demand valve are recoverable by recovery and clearing of the demand valve. More permanent interruptions require other strategies. An obvious response which is appropriate in some circumstances is to ascend to the surface. This response is appropriate when the consequences are acceptable. When the surface is near enough to easily be reached, and the diver has no significant risk of decompression sickness as a consequence of a direct ascent, an emergency free ascent may be a suitable response. If the surface is too far to reach with confidence, or if the risk of decompression sickness is unacceptable, other responses would be preferable. These involve getting an alternative supply of breathing gas, either from an alternative source carried by the diver, or from another diver.|$|R
40|$|A {{family owned}} Mexican company, Zapata Hermanos Sucesores, S. A. ("Zapata"), sold {{approximately}} US 950, 000 worth of cookie tins {{over a period}} of four years to the Maurice Lenell Cooky Company ("Lenell"), an American company that produced baked goods. Lenell failed to pay Zapata for the cookie tins so Zapata sought legal advice and instituted legal proceedings against Lenell for breach of contract in the Federal District Court of Illinios. The cookie tin sale contracts were governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("CISG"). Zapata succeeded in its Federal District Court claim and, as part of the Court 2 Ì† 7 s order, was awarded US 550, 000 as <b>foreseeable</b> <b>loss</b> under Article 74 of the CISG, being the amount of legal fees incurred by Zapata in bringing proceedings against Lenell. On appeal to the Federal Appellate Court, however, the award of legal fees was overturned.

50|$|In Australia, {{the general}} rule is that damages for {{economic}} loss which are not consequential upon damage to person or property are not recoverable in negligence even if the <b>loss</b> is <b>foreseeable.</b> Economic <b>loss</b> may be recoverable {{in cases where the}} plaintiff can prove an assumption of responsibility bythe defendant and known reliance on the defendant by the plaintiff, or vulnerability {{in the sense of the}} inability of the plaintiff to take steps to protect itself from the risk of the loss.|$|R
40|$|The general {{concept of}} blood saving covers {{a number of}} {{technical}} and pharmacological actions which all aim to maintain the erythrocyte mass of the patient, and of which blood transfusion is only one. Severe anemia (Hb < 60 - 80 g/l) increases postoperative mortality and morbidity. However, its correction by blood transfusion tends to worsen the prognosis. It is therefore imperative to conserve the patient's blood by any means possible. Detecting anemia is of primary importance. Whenever possible, its cause should be identified and treated. Depending on the detected anemia, {{as well as the}} blood loss expected during surgery, the patient should receive EPO (anemia with <b>foreseeable</b> moderate blood <b>loss),</b> or autologous pre-donation associated with EPO (anemia with <b>foreseeable</b> large blood <b>loss)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{recent decades}} {{have seen a}} steady growth of {{international}} trade of goods. In order to harmonize the legal environment concerning this materia, attempts for unification of international sales law have been made. In the field of sales of goods, several international instruments have been adopted. These include the (unsuccessful) Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods, the model laws, i. e. the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts and the Principles of European Contract Law, and, most notably, the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods (CISG). This master's thesis aims to explore one type of remedies for non-performance under the CISG, namely provisions on damages. In a great detail, articles 74, 77, 79 and 80 will be analysed. First, a detailed commentary on two major prerequisites for liability for damages, i. e. causation and foreseeability, will be given. The various factual and legal causation theories will be described. Then it will be demonstrated why it is just and useful that the CISG contains a provision for limiting liability to <b>foreseeable</b> <b>loss</b> and how foreseeability is measured. We will then move to another method of limiting damages - mitigation rule. It will be shown why {{it is in the}} aggrieved party's best [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The Environmental Impact Statement for a Geologic Repository for the Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste at Yucca Mountain, Nye County, Nevada {{analyzes}} a Proposed Action to construct, operate, monitor, {{and eventually}} close a geologic repository for {{the disposal of}} spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. As part of the Proposed Action, the EIS analyzes the potential impacts of transporting commercial and DOE spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to Yucca Mountain from 77 sites across the United States. The analysis includes information on the comparative impacts of transporting these materials by truck and rail and discusses the impacts of building a rail line or using heavy-haul trucks to move rail casks from a mainline railroad in Nevada to the site. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the analyses and the potential impacts of these transportation activities. The potential transportation impacts were looked at from two perspectives: transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by legal-weight truck or by rail on a national scale and impacts specific to Nevada from the transportation of these materials from the State borders to the Yucca Mountain site. In order to address the range of impacts that could result from the most likely modes, legal-weight truck and rail, the EIS employed two analytical scenarios [...] mostly legal-weight truck and mostly rail. Estimated national transportation impacts were based on 24 years of transportation activities. Approximately 8 fatalities could occur from all causes in the nationwide general population from incident-free transportation activities of the mostly legal-weight truck scenario and about 4 from the mostly rail scenario. The analysis examined the radiological consequences under the <b>maximum</b> <b>foreseeable</b> accident scenario and also overall accident risk. The overall accident risk over the 24 year period would be about 0. 0002 latent cancer fatality for the mostly legal-weight truck scenario and about 0. 0005 latent cancer fatality for the mostly rail scenario. The <b>maximum</b> reasonably <b>foreseeable</b> accident scenario resulted in 0. 55 latent cancer fatality for the legal-weight truck case and 5 latent cancer fatalities in the case of mostly rail. The EIS also analyzed the impacts associated with the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in the State of Nevada. This included: constructing a branch rail line and using it to ship waste to the repository; upgrading highways in Nevada for use by heavy-haul trucks; constructing and operating an intermodal transfer station; and transporting personnel and materials to support construction and operation of the repository...|$|R
40|$|The {{rolling motion}} {{of a ship}} has been {{described}} by a nonlinear differential equation explicitly taking into account the nonlinearities of restoring and damping.

The approximate analytical solutions allow expressions for the frequency response and moreover an estimation of the <b>maximum</b> amplitudes <b>foreseeable</b> {{as a function of the}} excitation intensity. These are obtained through algebraic equations from which approximated solutions are obtained in an explicit form.

5000|$|In {{a review}} of a {{conviction}} of culpable homicide, Van Heerden J cited Silva's Fishing Corporation (Pty.) Ltd v Maweza, where Steyn CJ, who delivered the minority judgment, after referring to certain remarks made by Innes ACJ and Wessels JA, in Halliwell v Johannesburg Municipal Council, stated as follows:From these remarks it may fairly be gathered that an omission does not entail delictual liability {{where there is no}} legal duty to act, that generally speaking such a duty will arise from a prior act or from prior conduct, but that it could also arise from some other source, one such possible source being a statute. If the true sense of those judgments is a more restricted one, viz. that an omission unconnected with prior conduct is always to be regarded as a mere omission, i.e. as a failure to do what the person concerned is not bound to do, I must, with great deference, disagree with it. The Roman law, as also the Roman-Dutch law, recognises the principle that, generally speaking, no one is bound to mind the business of another, even where he can, with no danger or expense to himself, avert serious harm from the other, and that no liability is incurred by refraining from doing so, even if the omission should violate a moral duty .... But there is a variety of circumstances, some of them unconnected with prior conduct, which impose the duty to act in order to avoid reasonably <b>foreseeable</b> <b>loss</b> to another. The circumstances which will give rise to such a duty may differ according to the conceptions prevailing in a particular community at a given time.In Rex v Meiring, Innes CJ had stated as follows:Now negligence can never be disentangled from the facts; but its existence is best ascertained by applying to the facts of each case the standard of conduct which the law requires. And that standard is the degree of care and skill which a reasonable man would exercise under the circumstances.In Cape Town Municipality v Paine, Innes CJ added the following: ...|$|R

40|$|The {{conservation}} of biodiversity {{is a major}} environmental issue, one that promises to remain {{at or near the}} top of the environmental agenda for the <b>foreseeable</b> future. The <b>loss</b> of biodiversity affects human welfare as well as being lamentable for its own sake. Humans depend on natural systems to produce a wide variety of ecosystem goods and services, ranging from direct use of certain species for food or medicines to ecosystem functions that provide water purification, nutrient retention or climate regulation. Threats to biodiversity include habitat loss and fragmentation, the introduction of nonindigenous species, over-harvesting, pollution, changes in geochemical cycles and climate change. Sustaining biodiversity in the face of increasing human populations and increased human economic activity promises to be a major challenge. Economists have an important role to play in helping to develop and evaluate conservation strategies. Because biodiversity is at risk in large part because of human activity, finding ways to conserve biodiversity will come from better understanding and management of human affairs, not from better biology alone. Economists can help set priorities to allocate scarce conservation resources where they will do the most good. Economists can help design incentive schemes to make conservation policy both effective and efficient. Economic methods can shed light on what are the most valuable components of biodiversity, including analysis of species existence value, the value of bioprospecting and the value of ecosystem services. ...|$|R
