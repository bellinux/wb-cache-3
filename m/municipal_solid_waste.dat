40|$|There is an {{increasing}} worldwide interest in the effective utilisation of <b>municipal</b> <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> as an avenue of reducing its high cost of clearing. <b>Municipal</b> <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> are usefully converted into a medium grade fuel (biogas) to reduce its nuisance value to the environment. In this paper, the potential of vegetable (putriscible) component of <b>municipal</b> <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> was examined in terms of biogas production. The vegetable component of the waste was used as substrate in a batch-fed 200 dm 3 capacity anaerobic digester, which was consecutively loaded with a 10 - 20 kg ranged weight of vegetable. The total solid (TS) of substrate was 8 - 10 % over a retention period of 40 days. The temperature of the substrate during bio-digestion was maintained within 29 ºC and 33 ºC. The average biogas yield varied from 5. 15 dm 3 /kgTS to 5. 83 dm 3 /kgTS. From the digestion experiments, a regression equation, called the <b>municipal</b> <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> energy value model, was derived. This model estimates the biogas production from <b>municipal</b> <b>solid</b> <b>wastes.</b> For the predictive model formulation, a relationship between retention time and the daily/total biogas yield was explored. The polynomial function significantly represents the models formulated for the different quantity of substrate loaded. This strongly suggests that the polynomial series is best suited to predict the relationship between retention time and the quantity of substrate loaded for the experiment. This tool is useful in optimising biogas production from energy materials, and requires further validation and refinement.
