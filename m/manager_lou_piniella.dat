500|$|Later that month, Cub <b>manager</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> told Bradley {{to leave}} the dugout and go home after he [...] "went after" [...] a Gatorade cooler in {{frustration}} after flying out in another interleague game, against the Chicago White Sox.

Piniella later apologized to Bradley, and reinserted him back into the line-up during the team's next start.|$|E
500|$|On September 8, Zito {{became the}} first pitcher in the AL to win 20 games when he pitched seven innings and allowed no earned runs against the Minnesota Twins. [...] "I'm not {{pitching}} for the Cy Young", Zito said. [...] "I'm pitching to get the Oakland A's into the playoffs and to the World Series." [...] In his next start, against the Seattle Mariners, Zito took a no-hitter into the eighth inning before John Olerud singled to leadoff the inning. Seattle <b>manager</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> said if he could vote for the Cy Young Award winner, [...] "It would go to that young man who pitched for the Oakland team. There are other deserving pitchers, but [...] has won 21 games and he competes well." ...|$|E

50|$|The 2005 Tampa Bay Devil Rays {{season was}} the team's 8th since the {{franchise}} was created. This season, they finished {{last in the}} AL East division, and managed to finish the season with the AL's third-worst record of 67-95. Their <b>manager</b> was <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> who entered his 3rd and last season with the Devil Rays.|$|R
50|$|After {{his playing}} career ended, {{he was a}} {{longtime}} pitching coach in the Chicago Cubs farm system. Strode was the pitching coach for the Rookie League Wytheville Cubs in 1989, the Single-A Peoria Chiefs from 1990 to 1991, the Winston-Salem Spirits in 1992, and the Daytona Cubs in 1993. He was then the Cubs' minor league pitching coordinator from 1996 to 2006. Following the 2006 season, he became the Cubs' bullpen coach. Strode is currently the longest tenured Cubs coach, having served as bullpen coach since 2007, under <b>managers</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> Mike Quade, Dale Sveum, Rick Rentería, and Joe Maddon. He {{was a member of}} the 2016 coaching staff for the Cubs that led the team winning the World Series.|$|R
500|$|In 1987 {{he had a}} below-average {{season by}} his standards, fueling {{criticism}} from the New York media, which had never covered Henderson or his eccentricities kindly. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner issued a press release claiming that <b>manager</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> wanted to trade Henderson for [...] "jaking it" [...] (playing lackadaisically). Still, Henderson had his best on-base percentage to that point in his career (.423), with a [...]291 batting avg., was fifth in the AL in stolen bases (41) and hit 17 home runs despite playing only 95 games. It was the only season from 1980 to 1991 in which Henderson did not lead the AL in steals. Seattle's Harold Reynolds led the league with 60 steals; Reynolds {{tells the story of}} getting an impish phone call from Henderson after the season: ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1990 National League Championship Series, the Reds {{faced the}} Pittsburgh Pirates in a best-of-seven game series. In Game 1, the Reds, the home team, {{opened up a}} 3–0 lead but trailed 4–3 as the game entered {{the bottom of the}} ninth inning. Todd Benzinger led off the inning with a pinch-hit single against Bob Patterson. Patterson walked the next batter, Eric Davis, but forced an out at third base when Ron Oester tried to {{sacrifice}} Davis over. <b>Manager</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> put Bates into the game as a pinch runner for Oester. Davis, at second, tried to steal third, and Bates followed; while Davis was safe, Pirates catcher Mike LaValliere threw to second and Bates was out by three feet, which made the second out in the inning. Speaking about himself, Bates said he thought he [...] "had a better jump than [...] did", and added that he should not have attempted the steal. The Reds failed to score that inning and lost the game. Bates' next postseason appearance came in Game 3, when he pinch ran for Joe Oliver and scored a run as the Reds won 6–3. Cincinnati ultimately defeated the Pirates and moved on to the World Series, where they would play the Oakland Athletics for the league championship.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, the Mariners donned {{their current}} uniforms. During the 1992–93 offseason, the Mariners hired <b>manager</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> who {{had led the}} Cincinnati Reds to victory in the 1990 World Series.

50|$|The 2004 Tampa Bay Devil Rays {{season was}} their 7th since the {{franchise}} was created. This season, they finished {{fourth in the}} AL East division, Toronto Blue Jays in last place. They managed to finish {{the season with a}} record of 70-91, finishing out of last {{for the first time in}} their 7-year history. Their <b>manager</b> was <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> who entered his 2nd season with the Devil Rays.|$|R
2500|$|Many of {{his contemporaries}} have remarked on Martin's ability to {{surprise}} the opposition and his outside-the-box thinking. Commenting on Martin's strategy as a manager, Dave Winfield has stated that opposing players would often ask each other, [...] "What's Billy doing now?" [...] George Steinbrenner has stated that when Martin was in his best form, he was a [...] "baseball genius." [...] He has also been cited as an influence to other prominent <b>managers,</b> including <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella.</b> Martin both preceded and succeeded Piniella as Yankees manager.|$|R
5000|$|Fuld {{played for}} the Cubs in spring {{training}} in 2009, but was sent down to their AAA team in late March to work on stealing bases. [...] He was called back up on June 30. [...] Hendry said: [...] "Sammy has been really hot. This will let <b>Lou</b> (<b>manager</b> <b>Piniella)</b> mix and match with outfield defense until Reed (Johnson) comes back." ...|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} All-Star break, <b>manager</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> dropped Soriano in the batting order {{and made it}} clear {{that it was not a}} {{temporary}} change. [...] For the first time in his career, Soriano seemed to accept not being a leadoff hitter and actually praised his manager for making the necessary decision, citing the fact that [...] "I'm not doing my job." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chicago Cubs signed Soriano to {{an eight-year}} {{contract}} worth nearly $136 million. The contract marked {{the most expensive}} deal in the Cubs' franchise history {{at the time and}} went through 2014. It contained a no-trade clause, meaning Soriano could not be traded without his consent. The Cubs' <b>manager,</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> assigned Soriano to play center field, but later moved him to left field after he sustained a hamstring injury. He struggled during the first month of the season, during which he posted a [...]270 batting average, with no home runs. He managed to hit his first home run during the Cubs' first game in May, and gradually increased his batting average throughout the month.|$|E
2500|$|The Mariners {{started the}} [...] season hot (they were {{on pace to}} win 100+ games again well into the summer), but they missed out on the playoffs. This was widely {{attributed}} to their failure to find a substantial contributor at the trade deadline and hot streaks by the Anaheim Angels and Oakland Athletics in the later months of the season. Ultimately, the Angels won the World Series as the Mariners won 93 games, which was still the second best total in their history. At {{the end of the}} season, <b>manager</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> left the Mariners to manage his hometown Tampa Bay Devil Rays, reportedly due to his anger with management; Piniella believed that management was more concerned with the bottom line than acquiring quality players.|$|E
50|$|Al López, {{the first}} area native {{to play and}} manage {{in the major leagues}} and the first to be {{enshrined}} in the Baseball Hall of Fame, came out of the leagues of Ybor City in the early 20th century.

50|$|Lincoln's {{tenure as}} CEO of the Seattle Mariners has seen both success and controversy. Lincoln was {{considered}} instrumental, along with former Senator Slade Gorton, in preserving the team's location in Seattle and {{negotiating with the}} city for a new stadium, Safeco Field. His stewardship has seen the team's first post-season appearances, in 1995, 1997, 2000, and 2001, {{as well as the}} aggressive expansion of the Mariners into the Japanese market, most noticeably through the acquisition of Japanese superstar Ichiro Suzuki. However, Lincoln is also held responsible by many for the team's stagnation and decline following 2001. His inability to retain successful field managers and general <b>managers</b> like <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> and Pat Gillick, carte-blanche attitude towards superstar players, contentious relationship with local media, and pattern of questionable hiring decisions have led to increasing calls within the fanbase for Lincoln to assume a less-active administrative role.|$|R

2500|$|Clemens {{has been}} {{the focal point of}} several controversies. His {{reputation}} has always been that of a pitcher unafraid to throw close to batters. Clemens led his league in hit batsmen only once, in , but he has been among the leaders in several other seasons. This tendency was more pronounced during his earlier career and subsequently tapered off. Still, Clemens' reputation precedes him. After the 2000 ALCS game against the Mariners where he knocked down future teammate Alex Rodriguez and then argued with him, Seattle Mariners <b>manager</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> called Clemens a [...] "headhunter." [...] His beaning earlier that year of Mike Piazza, followed by his notorious broken-bat throw at Piazza in the 2000 World Series, cemented Clemens' surly, unapologetic image in the minds of many. In 2009, former manager Cito Gaston publicly denounced Clemens as a [...] "double-talker" [...] and [...] "a complete asshole". Clemens was ranked 9th all-time in hit batsmen after the 2007 season.|$|E
