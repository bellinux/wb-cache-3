40|$|AbstractA <b>Multitasking</b> <b>robot</b> for {{the field}} of Agriculture has been studied in this {{research}}. The whole process used in this research is based on DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency); GSM module; thermal sensor; sound sensor, flex sensor. The technology that has been implemented here is for expelling there toil level which they face for the aspects of distant farming. The device as based on DTMF has higher coverage area and is also cost effective, for being adaptable to any weather {{it will have a}} plastic fiber body. With the advancement in its properties this bot can be taken to a broad implementation...|$|E
40|$|Interface opening, a basic {{prerequisite}} for coupling a knowledge-based assembly planning to an industrial robot control (robot Manutec R 2, Siemens AG), was achieved using the modular constructed <b>multitasking</b> <b>robot</b> control FRC (flexible robot controller) {{developed by the}} Institut fuer Roboterforschung at the University Dortmund. Interfaces to neural nets were installed on different control levels: the neural space net NSN {{at the level of}} robot programming, the neural kinematic net NKN at the level of kinematic back-transformation and the neural net NDN for non-linear position controlling on the level of position control. Solution approaches for assembly tasks have been described and realized for two special assembly tasks.

5000|$|In 2004, Toyota showcased its trumpet-playing robot. Toyota {{has been}} {{developing}} <b>multitask</b> <b>robots</b> destined for elderly care, manufacturing, and entertainment. A specific example of Toyota's involvement in robotics for the elderly is the Brain Machine Interface. Designed for use with wheelchairs, it [...] "allows a person to control an electric wheelchair accurately, almost in real-time", {{with his or her}} mind. The thought controls allow the wheelchair to go left, right, and forward with a delay between thought and movement of just 125 milliseconds. Toyota also played a part in the development of Kirobo, a 'robotic astronaut'.|$|R
40|$|An active {{security}} system assures that interacting robots don't collide {{or that a}} robot operating independently doesn't hit any obstacle that is encountered in the robots workspace. In this paper, an {{active security}} system for a FANUC industrial robot is introduced. The active security problem where one robot needs to avoid a moving obstacle in its workspace is considered. An obstacle detection and localization mechanism based on stereoscopic vision methods was successfully developed. To connect the vision system, an operator's pc and the robot environment a real-time communication is set up over Ethernet using socket messaging. We used fuzzy logic for intelligent trajectory planning. A <b>multitask</b> oriented <b>robot</b> application in the KAREL programming language of FANUC Robotics was implemented and tested...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} questions in service robotics is how we can get those machines to work efficiently in the same environment with and {{under the command of}} the average user. The answer – not an easy one – is in the development of human-robot interfaces (HRI), which should be able to transmit the will of the user to the robot in a simple but effective way preferably using means that are natural to humans. The paper introduces a generic interface concept based on exchanging cognitive information between the robot and the user, both present in the same environment. The information is exchanged through a virtual world called “common situation awareness” or “common presence” of both entities. The virtual world is a simple map augmented by database of semantic information. Functions of the HRI are based on utilizing interactively the senses of both the human and machine entities, the human when perceiving the environment and commanding the machine and the machine when looking for working targets or moving in the environment. The syntax of the communication language utilizes the objects and work targets currently existing in the common presence. A <b>multitasking</b> humanoid <b>robot,</b> called WorkPartner, is used to demonstrate the interface principles. The interface is designed to support interaction, including teaching and learning, with the human user in various outdoors work tasks. Natural to human communication methods, such as speech and gestures, are promoted in order to ease the user‟s load. Methods and hardware presented have been designed for the WorkPartner robot, but many of them are generic in nature and not dependent upon the robot physics...|$|R
