40|$|The {{development}} and {{introduction of the}} closed locked intramedullary nail into clinical practice has revolutionized the treatment of fractures of long bone. The most difficult and technically demanding part of the procedure is often the insertion of the distal interlocking screws. A lot of efforts have been made during the past years to make it easier. In according with Whatling and Nokes, we can divide the different approaches to this issue in four main groups: Free-hand (FH) technique; Mechanical targeting devices mounted on image intensifier; Mechanical targeting devices mounted onto nail handle; Computer-assisted techniques. In addition of these, recently it has been proposed a navigational system using electromagnetic field. The main disadvantages of the FH technique, are prolonged exposure to radiation and results depend mostly on the dexterity of the surgeons. FH technique is however the most popular technique. Our targeting device is included into the mounted on image intensifier group. It consists of 2 radio-opaque rods at right angle to each over: one of this is fixed on the c-arm, whereas, {{the other is a}} sliding rod with a sleeve for the drill bit, which is the targeting guide itself. In the realization of this device, we have been inspired by the modification of the FH technique suggested by Kelley et al. To identify the distal holes we used the method described by Medoff (perfect circle). Once that the distal hole is seen as a perfect circle, with the C-arm in later view, the targeting guide is roughly positioned onto this and the drilling and the screwing operations are performed without the need for image intensifier. We used the device in bone models and in 9 clinical cases. In spite of authors demonstrated that the electromagnetic targeting device significantly reduced radiation exposure during placement of distal interlocking screws and was equivalent in accuracy when compared with the FH technique, the latter is the most used technique. Indeed, although all the studies have reported that the radiation exposure to orthopedic surgeon has been below the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>doses</b> in all cases, there is still the risk of cumulative lifetime radiation exposure. From this point of view, namely the reduction of cumulative lifetime radiation exposure, we think that, paradoxically, our device could be more effective than electromagnetic targeting device, because it can be used in all the orthopedic operations that required a targeting device...|$|R
5|$|Polish {{studies found}} that {{although}} the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> intake <b>doses</b> to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, several studies showed I.badia bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect {{is caused by a}} brown pigment, the polyphenol compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali chelators based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a bioremediation agent to clean up contaminated sites.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: A {{real-time}} dose {{management system}} {{was used to}} determine if radiation exposure levels would decrease when providers were privy to their real-time radiation exposure levels. Six aggregate categories of providers were first blinded (phase 1) and subsequently made aware of their radiation exposure levels during electrophysiology procedures (phase 2). Methods: A primary, quantitative crossover study of faculty and staff working in an electrophysiology lab at the University of Michigan Hospitals setting occurred. Participants in the control group was first blinded in phase 1 to their radiation exposure over an 10 -week time period. The same group subsequently became the treatment group in phase 2 when over a second 10 -week period real-time exposure levels were made available to them. Power analysis, using a 40 % decrease in exposure, was calculated using a variance of radiation exposure equal to the mean radiation exposure with 80 % power and alpha =. 05. Calculations revealed 102 subjects in each treatment and control group were necessary. Results: Using the mixed effect linear model, a significant decrease in radiation levels occurred in phase 2 as compared to phase 1 for the operator role represented by the combined electrophysiologist-fellow role with a P value of. 025. Exposure levels in all other provider groups for phase 1 or 2 failed to reach statistical significance.

The Composite Analysis is a companion document to published analyses of four active or planned low-level waste disposal actions: the solid waste burial grounds in the 200 West Area, the solid waste burial grounds in the 200 East Area, the Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility, and the disposal facilities for immobilized low-activity waste. A single Composite Analysis was prepared for the Hanford Site considering only sources on the 200 Area Plateau. The performance objectives prescribed in U. S. Department of Energy guidance for the Composite Analysis were 100 mrem in a year and examination of a lower dose (30 mrem in a year) to ensure the {open_quotes}as low as reasonably achievable{close_quotes} concept is followed.

40|$|Dear Ms. Vela: Thank {{you for the}} {{opportunity}} to comment on the proposed <b>Maximum</b> <b>Allowable</b> <b>Dose</b> Level (MADL) of 290 micrograms per day for exposures to bisphenol A (BPA). BPA is a high production volume chemical, it is used {{in a wide variety of}} consumer products, and biomonitoring studies in the US and elsewhere have shown that exposure to BPA is ubiquitous. Therefore, we strongly support the establishment of a MADL by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). As the agency wrote in its notice of proposed rulemaking, this establishment of a MADL should "encourage businesses to lower the amount of the listed chemical in their products to a level that does not cause a significant exposure. This in turn may reduce exposures to chemicals that cause reproductive harm. " As scientists, academics, health professionals, health advocates and others who work to improve public health, we strongly support this goal. We also strongly support the timing of proposing this MADL, simultaneous with the proposed Proposition 65 (Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act) listing of BPA. At the same time, we recommend that OEHHA reconsider recent research about the developmental effects of exposure to low doses of BPA.

30|$|We {{investigate}} {{a method to}} set the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power for a secondary base station in dynamic spectrum sharing among secondary users and primary users. In conventional methods, location information is assumed. Thus, the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power can be set by considering the shadowing between the secondary base station and the primary user receivers to satisfy a constraint. Specifically, {{the probability that the}} interference from secondary base station exceeds the acceptable level must be less than the constraint target probability. We assume that the location information is not available at the secondary network. Instead, the secondary base station uses the received signal strength from the primary user transmitter for distance estimation. In this case, we have to consider shadowing not only between the secondary base station and the primary user receivers, but also between the primary user transmitter and the secondary receiver(s). We also need to account for the uncertainty of the distance. In order to satisfy the constraint target probability, we proposed a two-step approach to setting the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power where a transmission decision margin and a transmit power margin are utilized. To reduce these margins, we also propose cooperative <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power setting method utilizing also received signal strength values from several secondary users. Simulation results confirm the validity of the analysis and show the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power setting method, i.e., the capacity based on cooperative <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power setting method is significantly better than that of non-cooperative <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power setting method.
