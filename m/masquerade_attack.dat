Prior work on <b>masquerade</b> <b>attack</b> detection has focused on profiling legitimate user behavior and detecting abnormal behavior indicative of a <b>masquerade</b> <b>attack.</b> Like any anomaly-detection based techniques, detecting masquerade attacks by profiling user behavior suffers from {{a significant number of}} false positives. We extend prior work and provide a novel integrated detection approach in this paper. We combine a user behavior profiling technique with a baiting technique in order to more accurately detect masquerade activity. We show that using this integrated approach reduces the false positives by 36 % when compared to user behavior profiling alone, while achieving almost perfect detection results. We also show how this combined detection approach serves as a mechanism for hardening the <b>masquerade</b> <b>attack</b> detector against mimicry attacks...|$|E

While several approaches do exist for masquerade detection, the relative effectiveness of approaches still needs considerable improvement. While in the past certain cost formulations have been used to compute the overall performance of masquerade detection methods, but these formulations appeared to be biased. Hence we present a formulation to compute the effectiveness of masquerade detection and also present a highly effective approach to masquerade detection using Hidden Markov Models (HMM).

40|$|Abstract: Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{have gained}} worldwide attention in recent years, {{particularly with the}} proliferation in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology which has facilitated the development of smart sensors. These sensors are small, with limited processing and computing resources, and they are inexpensive compared to traditional sensors. Wireless medium is inherently broadcast in nature. This makes them vulnerable to attacks. These attacks can disrupt the operation of WSN and can even defeat the purpose of their deployment. An adversary can launch DoS attacks without much effort (e. g. even without cracking keys used for cryptography-based solutions). <b>Masquerade</b> <b>attacks</b> can be very dangerous because adversaries can launch other attacks and can still hide and project themselves as legitimate nodes. Therefore, masquerade detection mechanisms are necessary. To be practical for real life WSN deployments techniques for detecting <b>masquerade</b> <b>attacks</b> should be lightweight.

40|$|Abstract—As {{reliance}} on Internet connected systems expands, {{the threat of}} damage from malicious actors, especially undetected actors, rises. <b>Masquerade</b> <b>attacks,</b> where one individual or system poses as another, {{are among the most}} harmful and difficul to detect types of intrusion. Previous efforts to detect <b>masquerade</b> <b>attacks</b> have focused on host-based approaches, including command line, system call, and GUI interaction profiling but when host data is not accessible or legal/ethical restrictions apply, these methods are infeasible. In this work, we present an approach to masquerade detection using only basic network statistics. We use server log analysis to tag network events with the associated user and build user network profiles By utilizing only anonymized summary data, we limit the privacy impact of masquerade detection while avoiding the data accessibility issues associated with host-based approaches. We compile 90 days of NetFlow data from over 50 users and show the user profile are unique, and likely useful for detecting masqueraders. Finally, we apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) classificatio to demonstrate feasibility of masquerade detection using network data...|$|R

40|$|Masquerade {{attacks are}} {{unfortunately}} a familiar security {{problem that is}} a consequence of identity theft. Detecting masqueraders is very hard. Prior work has focused on user command modeling to identify abnormal behavior indicative of impersonation. This paper extends prior work by presenting one-class Hellinger distance-based and one-class SVM modeling techniques that use a set of novel features to reveal user intent. The specific objective is to model user search profiles and detect deviations indicating a <b>masquerade</b> <b>attack.</b> We hypothesize that each individual user knows their own file system well enough to search in a limited, targeted and unique fashion in order to find information germane to their current task. Masqueraders, on the other hand, will likely not know the file system and layout of another user’s desktop, and would likely search more extensively and broadly {{in a manner that is}} different than the victim user being impersonated. We extend prior research that uses UNIX command sequences issued by users as the audit source by relying upon an abstraction of commands. We devise taxonomies of UNIX commands and Windows applications that are used to abstract sequences of user commands and actions. We also gathered our own normal and masquerader data sets captured in a Windows environment for evaluation. The datasets are publicly available for other researchers who wish to study <b>masquerade</b> <b>attack</b> rather than author identification as in much of the prior reported work. The experimental results show that modeling search behavior reliably detects all masqueraders with a very low false positive rate of 0. 1 %, far better than prior published results. The limited set of features used for search behavior modeling also results in huge performance gains over the same modeling techniques that use larger sets of features. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In a <b>masquerade</b> <b>attack,</b> {{an adversary}} who has stolen a {{legitimate}} user’s credentials attempts to impersonate him {{to carry out}} malicious actions. Automatic detection of such attacks is often undertaken constructing models of normal behaviour of each user and then measuring significant departures from them. One potential vulnerability {{of this approach is}} that anomaly detection algorithms are generally susceptible of being deceived. In this paper, we first investigate how a resourceful masquerader can successfully evade detection while still accomplishing his goals. We then propose an algorithm based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence which attempts to identify if a sufficiently anomalous attack is present within an apparently normal request. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves considerably better detection quality than adversarial-unaware approaches.
