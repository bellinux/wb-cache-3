50|$|Motor damage {{may occur}} from over-speeding (running at a {{rotational}} speed {{in excess of}} design limits) if the unit is operated with no significant mechanical load. On larger motors, sudden loss of load is to be avoided, {{and the possibility of}} such an occurrence is incorporated into the <b>motor's</b> <b>protection</b> and control schemes. In some smaller applications, a fan blade attached to the shaft often acts as an artificial load to limit the motor speed to a safe level, as well as a means to circulate cooling airflow over the armature and field windings. If there were no mechanical limits placed on a universal motor it could theoretically speed out of control in the same way any series-wound DC motor can.|$|R

50|$|The {{other common}} {{overload}} protection system uses an electromagnet coil in series with the motor circuit that directly operates contacts. This {{is similar to a}} control relay but requires a rather high fault current to operate the contacts.

50|$|Once {{the motor}} is in operation, {{the speed of}} the motor is {{dependent}} only on the supply frequency. When the motor load is increased beyond the breakdown load, the motor falls out of synchronization and the field winding no longer follows the rotating magnetic field. Since the motor cannot produce (synchronous) torque if it falls out of synchronization, practical synchronous motors have a partial or complete squirrel-cage damper (amortisseur) winding to stabilize operation and facilitate starting. Because this winding is smaller than that of an equivalent induction motor and can overheat on long operation, and because large slip-frequency voltages are induced in the rotor excitation winding, synchronous <b>motor</b> <b>protection</b> devices sense this condition and interrupt the power supply (out of step protection).|$|E

50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage <b>motor</b> <b>protection</b> is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{understood}} that induction motors draw higher currents during their starting operations {{than is the}} case under full load running conditions. Since {{the early days of}} induction motor availability, starting methods other than Direct-on-Line have been used, and in some cases mandated by Utilities, to reduce the effect of these high starting currents on the electrical distribution network. What is generally not recognised, is the existence of short duration inrush currents, that greatly exceed these starting currents. Furthermore, the introduction of complex starting methods to reduce starting currents is often compromised by other unanticipated inrush currents introduced by the starting system itself, unless special precautions are taken. This paper examines the sources and consequences of these inrush currents on the distribution system, {{as well as on the}} <b>motor</b> <b>protection</b> components.

40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) is an inborn neuromuscular {{disorder}} caused by {{low levels of}} survival motor neuron protein, and for which no efficient therapy exists.

Furthermore, exercise is capable of specifically enhancing the expression of the gene encoding the major activating subunit of the NMDA receptor in motor neurons, namely the NR 2 A subunit, which is dramatically downregulated in the spinal cord of type 2 SMA-like mice. Accordingly, inhibiting NMDA-receptor activity abolishes the exercise-induced effects on muscle development, <b>motor</b> neuron <b>protection</b> and life span gain.

40|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem for}} Aircraft Manufacturers {{has been the}} difficulty in carrying out accurate and robust simulations of the complete aircraft power network, while including numerous models {{from a variety of}} individual equipment suppliers. Often the models are of variable or low quality, with ill-defined parameters or behavior, and in many cases of the wrong level of abstraction to be appropriate for large scale network simulations. In addition, individual equipment suppliers often provide poor models for network integration, with a common issue being low robustness of models leading to lack of convergence, excessive simulation times and delays in development due to the need for rework and extensive testing of these models. In order to address this specific issue a complete library of power electronic system models for Aerospace applications has been developed that encompasses the range of functions from elementary components (passives, devices, switches and magnetic components), intermediate building blocks (rectifiers, inverters, <b>motors,</b> <b>protection</b> devices) and finally complete system models (variable frequency starter generators, power converters, battery and storage elements, transformers). These models have been developed in partnership with several key aircraft equipment suppliers and in partnership with Airbus to ensure that the resulting models are complete and robust. Specific equipment models were also developed in this library including permanent magnet generators, synchronous machines, environmental control systems, wing ice protection systems, power electronic modules and advanced power protection systems. The specific models have been validated against reference and measured data to ensure that they are consistent and accurate. This paper will describe the techniques used to achieve more robust models, using model based engineering, the integration of specific equipment models into the complete aircraft network and the validation of the behavior against measured results. The paper will provide the results of a complete aircraft power network highlighting how the individual models are integrated into the overall network model and the inherent robustness ensure effective, accurate and robust simulations...|$|R

The MPR is a crucial piece of equipment within an electrical circuit.
