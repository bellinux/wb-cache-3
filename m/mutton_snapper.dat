50|$|The <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus analis) is {{a species}} of snapper native to the Atlantic coastal waters of the Americas from Massachusetts to {{southern}} Brazil, including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. They are particularly common in the Caribbean. They inhabit reef environments, with adults found in areas with rock or coral, while juveniles occur in sandy habitats with plentiful weed growth. They {{can be found at}} depths of from 25 to 90 m, though most often between 40 and 70 m. They have olive-tinted backs and red sides with a black spot between the lateral line and the dorsal fin and blue stripes on the head. This species can reach a length of 94 cm, though most do not exceed 50 cm. The greatest known weight recorded for this species is 15.6 kg. This is a commercially important species and is also sought-after as a game fish. It can also be found in the aquarium trade.Mutton snapper are a highly prized fish by saltwater anglers; they can be caught on a variety of baits, but are most commonly caught on live or frozen shrimp, whole or cut squid, minnows, and smaller bait fish (such as live or dead pinfish). <b>Mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> have been caught on artificial baits, but seem to prefer live bait. They can generally be found in deeper water, although catches (generally of juveniles and smaller fish) are not uncommon in more shallow water. They are also caught on the surface during night-fishing expeditions. <b>Mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> are typically known as great fighters relative to other snapper species, so are harder to land on lighter tackle. Many are often landed as a bycatch of anglers targeting other species of snapper or grouper.|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{contains}} {{some of the}} healthiest parts of the reef system due to its elevation and good water quality. Gladden Spit itself hosts over 25 species of reef fish. Since the 1920s, fishermen have congregated here to harvest <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> and grouper during their ten-day spawning aggregation period that occurs between March and June. Historically, fishermen recorded substantial catches, and whale sharks—who come to feed on the eggs—were sighted in large numbers. It {{is the only place}} worldwide where this activity is known to occur.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} silvery-pink to reddish in color, with short, irregular, pink and yellow lines on its sides; {{it has a}} diffuse black spot, about {{as large as the}} eye; the dorsal fin is {{centered}} above the lateral line; the outer margin of the caudal fin is blackish. Similar fish are the <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus analis, and the mangrove snapper, L. griseus. This species can reach a length of 60 cm, though most do not exceed 25 cm. The greatest recorded weight for this species is 3.5 kg.|$|E
5000|$|By 2005, {{offshore}} aquaculture {{was present}} in 25 countries, both as experimental and commercial farms. Market demand means that the most offshore farming efforts are directed towards raising finfish. [...] Two commercial operations in the US, and a third in the Bahamas are using submersible cages to raise high-value carnivorous finfish, such as moi, cobia, and <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper.</b> Submersible cages are also being used in experimental systems for halibut, haddock, cod, and summer flounder in New Hampshire waters, and for amberjack, red drum, snapper, pompano, and cobia in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} red snapper's body is {{very similar}} in shape to other snappers, such as the mangrove snapper, <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper,</b> lane snapper, and dog snapper. All feature a sloped profile, medium-to-large scales, a spiny dorsal fin, and a laterally compressed body. Northern red snapper have short, sharp, needle-like teeth, but they lack the prominent upper canine teeth found on the mutton, dog, and mangrove snappers.This snapper reaches maturity at a length of about 39 cm. The common adult length is 60 cm, but may reach 100 cm. The maximum published weight is 84 lb, and the oldest reported age is 100+ years.Coloration of the northern red snapper is light red, with more intense pigment on the back. It has 10 dorsal spines, 14 soft dorsal rays, three anal spines and eight to 9 anal soft rays. Juvenile fish (shorter than 30-35 cm) can also have a dark spot on their sides, below the anterior soft dorsal rays, which fades with age.|$|E
40|$|Artisanal {{fisheries}} {{constitute a}} considerable source of employment, income, and protein for many coastal {{communities in the}} Caribbean. One of the region?s most valuable fisheries is for <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus analis), a coral-reef fish that uses various habitats throughout its life cycle, aggregates to spawn at specific places and times, and is considered vulnerable to extinction. This dissertation focuses on the <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> spawning aggregation fishery at Gladden Spit, Belize (western Caribbean), which has existed since the 1950 s. In 2000, the Government of Belize partnered with a community-based nongovernment organization, fishers, and other stakeholders to conserve and co-manage the artisanal fishery. Considering the study fishery as an adaptive socio-environmental fisher-fish system, this dissertation uses a holistic approach to provide baseline socioeconomic and biological information for strengthening conservation and management of <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> fisheries in Belize, applicable {{to the rest of}} the Caribbean. The three overall goals of this dissertation were to 1) present the history of the fishery and delineate for the first time its socio-environmental development and impact on inter-annual catch dynamics and yields, using published and grey literature, knowledge of experienced fishers and stakeholders, and data from landings surveys; 2) characterize the fishery?s within-season dynamics in 2011 through analyses of the variability in fishing activity, catch and bycatch, and in size, age, and maturation of reproductive <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper,</b> and 3) evaluate the potential distribution of habitat for early life stages of <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> across the Belize shelf, using a GIS-based multi-criteria modeling approach evaluated in the field. Inter-annual analyses evidenced a considerable reduction in total landings and fishing effort of the fishery in the late 1980 s, parallel to a rapid growth in the tourism industry and to a shift in the livelihoods of many local fishers. Between 1999 and 2011, during the co-management period of the fishery, relatively stable values of annual catch per unit effort (CPUE), individual sizes, and sex ratios suggested persistence of the fishery. Otolith, size, and gonad analyses depicted, for the first time for the species, age-, size-, and maturation-structured <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> spawning aggregations. Within-season analyses showed how <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> size, age, and degree of maturation vary in relation to the lunar cycle and throughout the spawning season, with individuals significantly smaller and females mostly immature later in the season. Overall, the within-season dynamics of the fishery were influenced by the lunar and seasonal patterns in the reproductive biology of <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper,</b> interactions with co-occurring fisheries, and the experience and traditions of local fishers. The GIS-based model provided a common spatial framework for guiding conservation and spatial management of <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> in Belize and highlighted a low degree of protection currently afforded to critical juvenile habitats constituted of mangroves and seagrass from coastal and shelf regions...|$|E
40|$|Determining {{patterns}} of population connectivity {{is critical to}} the evaluation of marine reserves as recruitment sources for harvested populations. <b>Mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus analis) is a good test case because the last known major spawning aggregation in U. S. waters was granted no-take status in the Tortugas South Ecological Reserve (TSER) in 2001. To evaluate the TSER population as a recruitment source, we genotyped <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> from the Dry Tortugas, southeast Florida, and from three locations across the Caribbean at eight microsatellite loci. Both Fstatistics and individual-based Bayesian analyses indicated that genetic substructure was absent across the five populations. Genetic homogeneity of <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> populations is consistent with its pelagic larval duration of 27 to 37 days and adult behavior of annual migrations to large spawning aggregations. Statistical power of future genetic assessments of <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> population connectivity may benefit from more comprehensive geographic sampling, and perhaps from the development of less polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci. Research where alternative methods are used, such as the transgenerational marking of embryonic otoliths with barium stable isotopes, is also needed on this and other species with diverse life history characteristics to further evaluate the TSER as a recruitment source and to define corridors of population connectivity across the Caribbean and Florida...|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} we {{describe}} the re-formation of a spawning aggregation of <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus analis). A review of four consecutive years of survey data indicates that the aggregation may be increasing in size. <b>Mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> are distributed in the temperate and tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from Florida to southeastern Brazil (Burton, 2002). Juveniles and subadults are found {{in a variety of}} habitats such as vegetated sand bottoms, bays, and mangrove estuaries (Allen, 1985). Adults are found offshore on coral reefs and other complex hardbottom habitat. They are solitary and wary fish, rarely found in groups or schools except during spawning aggregations (Domeier et al., 1996). Spawning occurs from May through July at Riley’s Hump (Domeier et al., 1996) and peaks in June, as indicated by gonadosomatic indices (M. Burton, unpubl. data). <b>Mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> are highly prized by Florida fishermen for their size and fighting ability, and the majority of landings occur from Cape Canaveral, through the Florida Keys, including the Dry Tortugas (Burton, 2002) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLutjanus analis (<b>Mutton</b> <b>snapper),</b> Lutjanus jocu(Dog snapper) and Mycteroperca bonaci (Black grouper) are reef fishes of high {{commercial}} value, and {{are among}} the principal exploited reef resources on the eastern and northeastern coast of Brazil. These species share the habit of forming transient spawning aggregations, predictable in time and space, which leaves them particularly vulnerable. The present study aimed to obtain indirect indicators of periods and places of spawning aggregations for these species, based on the exploratory analysis of available data on commercial catches and fishing efforts in Southern Bahia. Line fishery landings data were monitored in 12 locations in the region, and catch records of <b>Mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> (1320 landings), Dog snapper (654) and Black grouper (1162) were analyzed. A strategy was developed for exploratory analysis of monthly CPUE variation and individual distribution of CPUE per trip. The results showed the occurrence of aggregations in 26 specific sites, with values of relative abundance far above the annual mean, during spring/summer and autumn/winter. The occurrence of these anomalous catches was validated with the fishermen responsible for respective fishing trips. Additional {{studies are needed to}} confirm spawning activity at these sites. Analysis of inter-annual variation suggests a decreasing trend in relative abundance of Black grouper and <b>Mutton</b> <b>snapper,</b> possibly associated with unregulated fishing of spawning aggregations...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{structure}} and average long-term connectivity and effective size of <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus analis) sampled from offshore localities in the U. S. Caribbean and the Florida Keys were assessed by using nuclear-encoded microsatellites and {{a fragment of}} mitochondrial DNA. No significant differences in allele, genotype (microsatellites), or haplotype (mtDNA) distributions were detected; tests of selective neutrality (mtDNA) were nonsignificant after Bonferroni correction. Heuristic estimates of average long-term rate of migration (proportion of migrant individuals/generation) between geographically adjacent localities varied from 0. 0033 to 0. 0054, indicating that local subpopulations could respond independently of environmental perturbations. Estimates of average longterm effective population sizes varied from 341 to 1066 and differed significantly among several of the localities. These results indicate that over time larval drift and interregional adult movement may {{not be sufficient to}} maintain population sustainability across the region and that there may be different demographic stocks at some of the localities studied. The estimate of long-term effective population size at the locality offshore of St. Croix was below the minimum threshold size considered necessary to maintain the equilibrium between the loss of adaptive genetic variance from genetic drift and its replacement by mutation. Genetic variability in <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> likely is maintained at the intraregional level by aggregate spawning and random mating of local populations. This feature is perhaps ironic in that aggregate spawning also renders <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> especially vulnerable to overexploitation...|$|E
40|$|The <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus analis is an overexploited {{species of}} {{economic}} {{importance for the}} Northeast region of Brazil. To determine the reproductive aspects of the <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper,</b> biological data were sampled from Bahia, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará States, between 7 and 200 m depth, from February 1997 to December 1999, performed in the Brazilian Economic Exclusive Zone Study Program (REVIZEE-NE Program). Data on total length (TL), fork length (FL), standard length (SL), total weight (TW) and gutted weight (GW) were measured. The gonads were collected and fixed in FAACC for histological analysis on maturational stage and calculation of the gonadosomatic index (GSI). A total of 135 fishes were collected; from these, 74 were females and 61 were males. Females were between 28. 0 and 69. 0 cm (TL) and the males between 35. 0 and 75. 0 cm (TL). <b>Mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> are gonochorists, and the spawning season, determined by the maturity stages frequency and the GSI, occurred between November and April, with peak spawning in March. The mature females' minimum length was 28. 0 cm fork length, smaller than the minimum maturation length previously reported for the species in Cuba. The exploitation status of the species and the biological traits enhances the importance of establishing spatial and seasonal protection measures such as protected areas both in nursery and spawning sites.

Respondents were characterized with regard to their dependence on the reef fish fishery as a source of household income. Boats were described in terms of their physical and financial characteristics. Different kinds of fishing trips were identified by the species that generated the greatest revenue. Trips were grouped into the following categories: yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus); <b>mutton</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus analis), black grouper (Mycteroperca bonaci), or red grouper (Epinephelus morio); gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus); deeper water groupers and tilefishes; greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili); spiny lobster (Panulirus argus); king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla); and dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus). Average catches, revenues, routine trip costs, and net operating revenues per boat per trip and per boat per year were estimated for each category of fishing trips. In addition to its descriptive value, data collected during this study will aid in future examinations of the economic effects of various regulations on commercial reef fish fishermen.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of bathymetric distribution of five snappers caught along the Brazilian Northeastern coast by artisanal fleets through {{the analysis of}} the catch composition and relative abundance (CPUE) showed that, on the overall, fished mean size increased along depth and that particular species dominated the catch according to the depth strata. <b>Mutton</b> <b>snapper,</b> L. analis, yellowtail snapper, L. chrysurus, and dog snapper, L. jocu were mainly caught at intermediate depth (20 - 80 m) whereas lane snapper, L. synagris, and silk snapper, L. vivanus, inhabit respectively shallow (80 m) waters. Each fleet category exploited preferentially a particular combination of species and their size range. The fleet dynamic of the Northeast Brazil is technologically heterogeneous and determines the catch composition. Geographical distribution of the fishery and technical interaction between fleets and gears should be considered by the management of these species {{in order to maintain the}} sustainability of the stock and to guarantee the continuance of the resource. A distribuição batimétrica de cinco espécies de peixes do Nordeste Brasileiro foi examinada através da análise da composição da captura e e abundância relativa (CPUE) mostrou que, de uma maneira geral, o comprimento furcal aumentou com a profundidade e que algumas espécies dominaram a captura de acordo com a faixa de profundidade. A cioba, L. analis, a guaiúba, L. chrysurus, e o dentão, L. jocu foram principalmente pescados na zona intermediaria (20 - 80 m) enquanto ariocó, L. synagris e o pargo olho-de-vidro L. vivanus ocorreram respectivamente nas águas rasas e nas águas profundas. Cada tipo de embarcação do Nordeste do Brasil explota preferencialmente uma combinação particular de espécies e uma determinada amplitude de tamanho. A dinâmica da frota do nordeste do Brasil é tecnologicamente heterogênea e determina a composição da captura. A distribuição geográfica da pesca e a interação técnica entre as frotas e as artes de pesca devem ser consideradas pelo manejo destas espécies visando a manutenção dos estoques em bases sustentáveis e a garantia de continuidade do recurso...|$|E
