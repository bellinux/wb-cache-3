40|$|Near-to-real {{time as well}} as “archive quality ” Brewer {{total ozone}} observations, which are {{performed}} with well maintained and calibrated instruments over the Northern Hemisphere have been used for the validation of the total ozone column product of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard the NASA EOS-Aura satellite. During the commissioning phase of OMI, the near-to-real time ground-based data, which are submitted to the WMO Northern Hemisphere Ozone <b>Mapping</b> <b>Centre</b> within few hours after observation, have been employed to check the behaviour of the OMI instrument as a function of measuring geometry. In addition the near-to-real time ground based data are also used as an early warning tool for the detection of possible problems during the operation of OMI. Archived ground-based data have been used to validate more than one year of OMI-TOMS and OMI-DOAS total ozone measurements.

40|$|The use {{of spatial}} {{information}} in Aceh post-tsunami {{was driven by}} local practitioners and NGOs working on recovery projects, supported by the Spatial Information & <b>Mapping</b> <b>Centre</b> (SIM-Centre) based at the Bureau of Reconstruction & Rehabilitation (BRR). Initially directed to supporting recovery activities, the focus later turned to building capacity within local government agencies. A strategy for effectively using spatial information and technology throughout the province was developed. Fundamental to the strategy and for whole-of-government planning and operational support was {{the establishment of a}} spatial data infrastructure (SDI). In Australia, the development of a national spatial data infrastructure (NSDI) has been on the agenda for a number of years. However, despite appropriate technology being available, implementation to date has been restricted to projects driven by State Government Departments and to those in specific domains (for example Water Resources). This paper reviews a successful SDI implementation at Landgate in Western Australia and compares it to the process of establishing the Aceh SDI. Lessons learned from both contexts are applicable for many countries. 1...|$|E
40|$|Characterizing the {{multifaceted}} contribution of genetic and epigenetic factors to disease phenotypes {{is a major}} challenge in human genetics and medicine. We carried out high-resolution genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic profiling in three major human immune cell types (CD 14 ^+ monocytes, CD 16 ^+ neutrophils, and naive CD 4 ^+ T cells) from up to 197 individuals. We assess, quantitatively, the relative contribution of cis-genetic and epigenetic factors to transcription and evaluate their impact as potential sources of confounding in epigenome-wide association studies. Further, we characterize highly coordinated genetic effects on gene expression, methylation, and histone variation through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and allele-specific (AS) analyses. Finally, we demonstrate colocalization of molecular trait QTLs at 345 unique immune disease loci. This expansive, high-resolution atlas of multi-omics changes yields insights into cell-type-specific correlation between diverse genomic inputs, more generalizable correlations between these inputs, and defines molecular events that may underpin complex disease risk.

40|$|Background The {{functional}} {{impact of}} genetic variation {{has been extensively}} surveyed, revealing that genetic changes correlated to phenotypes lie mostly in non-coding genomic regions. Studies have linked allele-specific genetic changes to gene expression, DNA methylation, and histone marks but these investigations have only been carried out in a limited set of samples. Results We describe a large-scale coordinated study of allelic and non-allelic effects on DNA methylation, histone mark deposition, and gene expression, detecting the interrelations between epigenetic and functional features at unprecedented resolution. We use information from whole genome and targeted bisulfite sequencing from 910 samples to perform genotype-dependent analyses of allele-specific methylation (ASM) and non-allelic methylation (mQTL). In addition, we introduce a novel genotype-independent test to detect methylation imbalance between chromosomes. Of the ~ 2. 2 million CpGs tested for ASM, mQTL, and genotype-independent effects, we identify ~ 32 % as being genetically regulated (ASM or mQTL) and ~ 14 % as being putatively epigenetically regulated. We also show that epigenetically driven effects are strongly enriched in repressed regions and near transcription start sites, whereas the genetically regulated CpGs are enriched in enhancers. Known imprinted regions are enriched among epigenetically regulated loci, but we also observe several novel genomic regions (e. g., HOX genes) as being epigenetically regulated. Finally, we use our ASM datasets for functional interpretation of disease-associated loci and show the advantage of utilizing naïve T cells for understanding autoimmune diseases. Conclusions Our rich catalogue of haploid methylomes across multiple tissues will allow validation of epigenome association studies and exploration of new biological models for allelic exclusion in the human genome.

40|$|International audienceA record low {{total ozone}} column of 177 DU was {{observed}} at Reading, UK, on 19 January 2006. Low ozone values were also recorded at other stations in the British Isles and North West Europe on, and around, this date. Hemispheric maps of total ozone from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) Ozone <b>Mapping</b> <b>Centre</b> also show the evolution of this ozone minimum from 15 ? 20 January 2006 over North West Europe. Ozonesonde measurements made at Lerwick, UK, show that ozone mixing ratios in the mid-stratosphere on 18 January are around 1 ? 2 ppmv lower than both climatology and observations made one and two weeks prior to this date. In addition, ozone mixing ratios in the UTLS region were also noticeably reduced on 18 January. Analysis of the ozonesonde observations indicate that the mid-stratosphere ozone accounts for around {{a third of the}} reduction in {{total ozone column}} measurements while the UTLS ozone values account for two thirds of the depletion. It is evident from the ozonesonde data that ozone loss is occuring at two distinct vertical regions. Met Office analyses indicate that stratospheric polar vortex temperatures were cold enough for Polar Stratospheric Cloud (PSC) formation during 14 days in January prior to the low ozone event on 19 January. The presence of PSCs is confirmed by observations from the Scanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY). As a consequence of a stratospheric sudden warming that was in progress during January 2006, the polar vortex was shifted southwards over northwest Europe. This includes a period from 16 to 19 January where PSCs were present in the vortex over the UK. Throughout most of January suitable conditions were present for ozone destruction by heterogenous chemistry within the polar vortex. Evidence from Lerwick and Sodankylä ozonesonde profiles, and maps of Ertel's potential vorticity calculated from Met Office analyses, strongly suggests that the air inside the stratospheric vortex was poor in ozone for at least one week prior to 18 January. It is also possible that local chemical destruction of stratospheric ozone further contributed to the record low ozone observed at Reading. A closer examination of the WMO total ozone maps shows that the daily minima are often of synoptic, rather than planetary, scale. This therefore suggests a tropospheric, rather than stratospheric, mechanism for the ozone minima. Moderate total ozone depletion is commonly observed in the northern hemisphere middle and high latitude winter. This depletion is related to the lifting of the tropopause associated with the presence of an upper troposphere/lower stratosphere anticyclone. We show a strong link between the ozone minima in the WMO maps and 100 hPa geopotential height from Met Office analyses, and therefore it appears that this may also be a plausible mechanism for the record low ozone column that is observed. Back trajectories calculated by the Met Office NAME III model show that air parcels in the mid-stratosphere do arrive over the British Isles on 19 January via the polar vortex. The NAME III model results also show that air parcels near the tropopause arrive from low latitudes and are transported anticyclonically. Therefore this strongly suggests that the record low ozone values are due to a combination of a raised tropopause and the presence of low ozone stratospheric air aloft...|$|E
