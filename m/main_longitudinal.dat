Abnormal driving behaviours can be detected by either monitoring of drivers or monitoring of vehicle-human interactions. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy system that classifies the driving styles (in-terms of vehicle-human interactions) into four classes; Below Normal (BN), Normal (N), Aggressive (A) and Very Aggressive (VA). The proposed classifier was built based on three <b>main</b> attributes: <b>longitudinal</b> acceleration, car velocity and the distance between the preceding and host car.

50|$|The M.19 was {{developed}} {{to compete in the}} Sachsenflug competition for single-seat lightplanes, to requirements set down by the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL). It was Messerschmitt's first low-wing cantilever monoplane, though the fuselage and empennage were clearly related to that of the high-wing two-seat M.17 of 1925. This fuselage had five <b>main</b> <b>longitudinal</b> members, four defining the lower rectangular part and a raised, central dorsal member that made the upper cross-section triangular. These members tapered strongly together towards the tail unit, where the fuselage was very slim. The rudder and fin assembly wae noticeable for being extremely rectangular, higher than wide and dominated by the rudder; the fin chord was very narrow and amounted to little more than a streamlined rudder post. It had single-axle tailskid undercarriage.|$|E
50|$|The 15-40-hp is {{fitted with}} Humber-Perrott semi-servo front wheel brakes. The driver's foot pedal still works the {{transmission}} brake {{and now the}} front wheel brakes as well. A floating shoe gives the semi-servo effect and it relies to some extent on forward motion. Applying the brakes when backing the car receives only half the force. Front axle and stub axles are strengthened to accommodate the higher loads from braking, to the same end the springs are wider {{and there is a}} new cross tube linking the dumb irons (forward ends of the <b>main</b> <b>longitudinal</b> chassis members). Front brake adjustment is carried out by jacking up that end of the car and the hand operated nuts turned until equal pressure is provided to each wheel. The following year a compensating device is installed between the two sets of brakes.|$|E
50|$|At this {{location}} the motorway route follows a horizontal curve of 2006 m radius. Transversal grade {{of the deck}} is constant and equal to 2.5%, while elevation grade of the bridge is constant at 0.835%, sloping down towards Oštrovica. The bridge is a box girder structure supporting the deck across 10 spans: 42.63 m + 8 x 50.16 m + 42.63 m. Since the elevation of the bridge lies 41 m above the average water level of Lake Bajer, incremental launching of the bridge was executed without use of any auxiliary piers. The <b>main</b> <b>longitudinal</b> girders comprise box cross-section and were divided in 19 sections each (2 x 27.94 m + 15 x 25.08 m + 2 x 27.94 m). Piers of the bridge comprise a 6.6 m by 3.1 m box cross-section with 30 cm thick walls. Bridge abutments and shore piers have shallow foundations, while those piers located within the lake have foundations executed on groups of six piles each. The piles are circular in cross section, 1.5 m in diameter, and are connected with beam cap slabs measuring 8.5 m x 9.5 m x 2.5 m.|$|E
40|$|In this work, tensile dynamic {{mechanical}} analysis (DMA) {{was used}} to characterise the solid-state rheological properties of a commercial ß-polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film in the two <b>main</b> directions (<b>longitudinal</b> and transversal to the stretch direction). The ß-relaxation, assigned to the segmental motions within the amorphous phase, is observed at∼− 25 ◦C. The alpha-c-relaxation is observed above room temperature. This relaxation is the main responsible for the anelastic properties of the material and to the short-term creep behaviour. Longer-term creep tests along the longitudinal direction were also performed and the Eyring model was applied, in order to characterize the flow-process within the polymeric structure. The results suggest that long-term creep is mostly controlled by the deformation of amorphous tie-chains that connect adjacent crystalline lamellae.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a phenomenological model for the {{viscosity}} changes in bulk high molecular mass polyethylene (HMMPE) due to {{the addition of a}} very small quantity of a <b>main</b> chain <b>longitudinal</b> thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer (TLCP) containing flexible spacers. The chain alignment in the elongated TLCP domains causes chain alignment and disengagement in the neighboring HMMPE melt. In converging capillary flows, this occurs at a certain critical centerline velocity. After the onset of such transition, melt of elongated chain conformations forms from the center core and expands towards the capillary wall with increasing flow rates. The model successfully predicts both the drastic viscosity reduction effects and the critical yield stress in the HMMPE + TLCP blends without any adjustable parameters. Our model is also applicable to other systems that undergo flow-induced phase transitions, e. g. in biphasic liquid crystalline polymer melts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper was the {{optimization}} design of heavy strength carriage for 50 t heavy-duty truck. Two optimization schemes B and C were provided based on original scheme A, which have different thickness of sole/side plate and <b>main</b> <b>longitudinal</b> girder and different number of strengthening ribs. ANSYS was used to do the finite element analysis of equivalent stress and elastic displacement of truck carriages. The equivalent stress of <b>main</b> <b>longitudinal</b> girder, soleplate and transverse bars of soleplate will increase when the soleplate’s thickness was reduced. The maximum of equivalent stress will increase 13 %~ 15 % with 1 mm reduction. When the thickness of side plate or the number of side plate’s strengthening ribs was reduced, the elastic displacement of side plate would increase. Scheme C fulfilled the requirement of structure strength, in which the elastic displacement increases in the allowable range and the lightening ratio was 12. 6 %. Scheme B didn’t fulfill the requirement of structure strength. The numerical results provided theoretical foundations for optimization design of carriage in actual production and the solutions of expansion of carriage...|$|E
30|$|DTI {{provides}} several quantitative parameters, most {{of which}} are useful in the assessment of white matter conditions. Fractional anisotropy (FA) reflects how dominant one particular water movement direction in a voxel is. It varies from 0 to 1 and can be considered a biomarker of axonal integrity (usually decreased in white matter pathologies). Mean diffusivity (MD) represents a more exact value than ADC because it considers the three main directions of water movement. Axial diffusivity (AD) quantifies water movement along the <b>main</b> <b>longitudinal</b> direction, evaluating axonal integrity, while radial diffusivity (RD) reflects myelin integrity (myelin injury leads to increased RD).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe early axon {{scaffold}} is {{the first}} axonal structure {{to appear in the}} rostral brain of vertebrates, paving the way for later, more complex connections. Several early axon scaffold components are conserved between all vertebrates; most notably two <b>main</b> ventral <b>longitudinal</b> tracts, the tract of the postoptic commissure and the medial longitudinal fascicle. While the overall structure is remarkably similar, differences both in the organization and the development of the early tracts are apparent. This review will bring together extensive data from the last 25 years in different vertebrates and for the first time, the timing and anatomy of these early tracts have been directly compared. Representatives of major vertebrate clades, including cat shark, Xenopus, chick, and mouse embryos, will be compared using immunohistochemistry staining based on previous results. There is still confusion over the nomenclature and homology of these tracts which this review will aim to address. The discussion here is relevant both for understanding the evolution of the early axon scaffold and for future studies into the molecular regulation of its formation.
