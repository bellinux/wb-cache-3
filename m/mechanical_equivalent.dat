In 1845, Joule reported his best-known experiment, involving {{the use of}} a falling weight to spin a paddle-wheel in a barrel of water, which allowed him to estimate a <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of heat of 819ft·lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). This led to the theory of conservation of energy and explained why heat can do work.|$|E
25|$|In June 1845, Joule {{read his}} paper On the <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Equivalent</b> of Heat to the British Association meeting in Cambridge. In this work, he {{reported}} his best-known experiment, involving {{the use of}} a falling weight, in which gravity does the mechanical work, to spin a paddle wheel in an insulated barrel of water which increased the temperature. He now estimated a <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 819ft·lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). He {{wrote a letter to the}} Philosophical Magazine, published in September 1845 describing his experiment.|$|E

The presented work represents {{a continuation of the}} investigations into the possible application of miniature hydraulic actuation and control techniques to high speed reciprocating mechanisms in manipulative machinery.

The numerical results show the proved results and illustrate that the SMSA-FE algorithm is a rational method for predicting the <b>equivalent</b> <b>mechanical</b> parameters of the composite material with multiscale random grains. In conclusion, we discuss the future work for the inhomogeneous composite material with multiscale random grains...|$|R
25|$|A key {{stage in}} the {{development}} of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of heat. The caloric theory maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.|$|E
25|$|Further {{experiments}} and measurements with his electric motor led Joule {{to estimate the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of heat as 4.1868 joules per calorie of work to raise the temperature of a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. He announced his results {{at a meeting of}} the chemical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Cork in August 1843 and was met by silence.|$|E
25|$|With Ørsted's support, {{a further}} series of {{quantitative}} experiments {{was sponsored by}} the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, culminating in a report in 1847. By 1850, Colding had obtained a value for the <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of heat, some 14% lower than the modern value (4.1860 J·cal−1) at a time when Joule had measured 4.159 J·cal−1. A subsequent calculation by Colding in 1852 yielded a value only 3% below modern values.|$|E

40|$|Direct-drive air-bearing slides {{have the}} {{inherent}} advantages of high positioning accuracy and smoothness of motion, {{but due to}} low damping in the air bearings, they generally lack dynamic stiffness. The rigidity of the drive, both statically and dynamically, can also be low compared to <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalents.</b> In this paper, the dynamic response of an air-bearing slide fitted with a novel design of oil-lubricated squeeze film damper and driven by a fast-response, high-resolution control system is reported. The {{results show that the}} damper produces a substantial improvement in dynamic stiffness and that sufficient drive stiffness can be obtained to enable the slide to be used in some precision-machining applications...|$|R
25|$|Joule was undaunted {{and started}} to seek a purely {{mechanical}} demonstration of the conversion of work into heat. By forcing water through a perforated cylinder, he could measure the slight viscous heating of the fluid. He obtained a <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 770ft·lbf/Btu (4.14joule/calorie (J/cal)). The fact that the values obtained both by electrical and purely mechanical means were in agreement {{to at least one}} order of magnitude was, to Joule, compelling evidence of the reality of the convertibility of work into heat.|$|E
25|$|Joule {{could not}} resist finding antecedents of his views in Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, John Locke, Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) and Sir Humphry Davy. Though such views are justified, Joule went on to {{estimate}} a value for the <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of heat of 1034 foot-pound from Rumford's publications. Some modern writers have criticised this approach {{on the grounds that}} Rumford's experiments in no way represented systematic quantitative measurements. In one of his personal notes, Joule contends that Mayer's measurement was no more accurate than Rumford's, perhaps in the hope that Mayer had not anticipated his own work.|$|E
25|$|In 1783 he {{published}} {{a paper on}} the temperature at which mercury freezes and in that paper made use {{of the idea of}} latent heat, although he did not use the term because he believed that it implied acceptance of a material theory of heat. He made his objections explicit in his 1784 paper on air. He went on to develop a general theory of heat, and the manuscript of that theory has been persuasively dated to the late 1780s. His theory was at once mathematical and mechanical: it contained the principle of the conservation of heat (later understood as an instance of conservation of energy) and even contained the concept (although not the label) of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of heat.|$|E

25|$|The {{centre of}} gravity of the rotor can be in a fixed position. The rotor {{simultaneously}} spins about one axis and is capable of oscillating about the two other axes, and it is free to turn in any direction about the fixed point (except for its inherent resistance caused by rotor spin). Some gyroscopes have <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalents</b> substituted for {{one or more of}} the elements. For example, the spinning rotor may be suspended in a fluid, instead of being mounted in gimbals. A control moment gyroscope (CMG) is an example of a fixed-output-gimbal device that is used on spacecraft to hold or maintain a desired attitude angle or pointing direction using the gyroscopic resistance force.|$|R

25|$|In the 19th century, the {{connection}} between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by Julius Robert von Mayer and James Prescott Joule, who measured the <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalent</b> of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat {{is a form of}} energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of Sadi Carnot was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics—a restatement of the law of conservation of energy—which was stated around 1850 by William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin, and Rudolf Clausius. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of Lazare Carnot, Sadi Carnot, and Émile Clapeyron–as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work—to formulate the first law.|$|E

The electromagnetic (or absolute) system of units was one of the two systems of units identified in the BAAS report of 1862 and defined in the report of 1873. In this system, current is defined by setting the magnetic force constant [...] to unity and potential difference is defined {{in such a way as}} to ensure the unit of power calculated by the relation [...] is identical to the unit of power required to move a mass of one gram a distance of one centimetre in one second when opposed by a force of one dyne.

5000|$|The {{electro-mechanical}} analogy {{provides for}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>equivalents</b> of a resistor, an inductance, and a capacitance, {{which are the}} dashpot (quantified by the drag coefficient, ξp), the point mass (quantified by the mass, mp), and the spring (quantified by the spring constant, κp). For a dashpot, the impedance by definition is Zm=F / (du/dt)=ξm with F the force and (du/dt) the speed). For a point mass undergoing oscillatory motion u(t) = u0 exp(iωt) we have Zm = iωmp.

The transformer acts as an impedance converter in the sense that a mechanical impedance, Zm, appears as an electrical impedance, Zel, across the electrical ports. [...] Zel is given by Zel = φ2 Zm. For planar piezoelectric crystals, φ takes the value φ = Ae/dq, where A is the effective area, e is the piezoelectric stress coefficient (e = 9.65·10−2 C/m2 for AT-cut quartz) and dq is the thickness of the plate.
