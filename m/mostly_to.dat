5|$|Archaea {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from bacteria and eukaryotes, {{with up to}} 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function.

The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related function—such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.|$|E

Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, although this is <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> warm in the sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Maeda became {{involved}} with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned company town in Pará, Brazil.

The crops grown by the Japanese were not popular with the Brazilians, and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project. Maeda also continued teaching judo, now <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> the children of Japanese immigrants. Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted him to 6th dan, and on November 27, 1941, to 7th dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. The cause of death was kidney disease.|$|E
