As <b>marine</b> <b>atmospheres</b> it includes natural atmospheres with a salinity level above S 1 classification of ISO standard 9223 (> 3 mg Cl- m- 2 day- 1), and sulphur dioxide contamination only up to classification P 1 of the same standard (maximum of 35 mg SO 2 m- 2 day- 1). Consideration is also made of accelerated tests traditionally used to assess the anticorrosive behaviour of the substrate/paint coatings contemplated in the study, namely salt spray, artificial weathering and different cycles involving ultraviolet radiation, humidity, temperature and different contamination conditions. The substrates were steel, hot-dip galvanised steel and electrogalvanised steel (Zincorr® sheet). The paint systems applied on these substrates, with or without pretreatments, were solventborne, waterborne, high solid and powder paint systems.

50|$|Intergranular {{corrosion}} {{is generally}} considered to be caused by the segregation of impurities at the grain boundaries or by enrichment or depletion of one of the alloying elements in the grain boundary areas. Thus in certain aluminium alloys, small amounts of iron have been shown to segregate in the grain boundaries and cause intergranular corrosion. Also, {{it has been shown that}} the zinc content of a brass is higher at the grain boundaries and subject to such corrosion. High-strength aluminium alloys such as the Duralumin-type alloys (Al-Cu) which depend upon precipitated phases for strengthening are susceptible to intergranular corrosion following sensitization at temperatures of about 120 °C. Nickel-rich alloys such as Inconel 600 and Incoloy 800 show similar susceptibility. Die-cast zinc alloys containing aluminum exhibit intergranular corrosion by steam in a <b>marine</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Cr-Mn and Cr-Mn-Ni steels are also susceptible to intergranular corrosion following sensitization in the temperature range of 420°-850 °C. In the case of the austenitic stainless steels, when these steels are sensitized by being heated in the temperature range of about 520° to 800 °C, depletion of chromium in the grain boundary region occurs, resulting in susceptibility to intergranular corrosion. Such sensitization of austenitic stainless steels can readily occur because of temperature service requirements, as in steam generators, or as a result of subsequent welding of the formed structure.|$|E

The authors of this work have taken advantage of the opportunity to use different natural atmospheres in the Ibero-American region to study the behaviour of new water-borne, high-solids and powder paint systems, with and without pre-treatment. The study has involved coatings exposure in 7 natural atmospheres and different laboratory accelerated tests. It was completed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis, and adhesion, water up-take and electrochemical measurements. It has been concluded that water-borne acrylic paint systems incorporating primers pigmented with zinc phosphate and others show deficient behaviour in <b>marine</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> but better behaviour in industrial <b>atmospheres.</b> In <b>marine</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> water-borne epoxy paint systems, including zinc-rich primers, together with epoxy and epoxy-polyurethane high-solids paint systems, present the most efficient anti-corrosive behaviour. The coatings obtained with epoxy and epoxy-polyester powder paints only show good behaviour, when applied on an adequate pre-treatment, in atmospheres of low to medium corrosivity category (C 2 -C 3). Finally, the best correlation was observed between the results of natural exposure in <b>marine</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> salt spray and water up-take measurements. It was not possible to verify good correlation between natural exposure and prohesion, adhesion and electrochemical tests. The latter are highly sensitive to the chemical nature of coatings, and seem to be significantly more useful when comparing coatings with more identical nature. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2001.

[...] The Sisterhood of Margaret of Boston were chosen to run the Sanitarium. This society was already very involved in the Children's Hospital in Boston and the Sea-Shore Home in Winthrop, so its members had experience with the recovery of ill or crippled children.

On July 11, 1886 the Children's Island Sanitarium was opened for nearly two months and hosted a total of 150 children “exposed to the summer diseases of crowded cities, or to children...troubled by the affliction popularly called ‘rickets’.” The children were carefully selected and initially “boys under 10 and girls of any age or race, suffering from the chronic diseases which are benefited by a <b>marine</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> such as rickets, hip, spinal diseases, etc.; also, for children convalescing from severe operations” were eligible for admission. “Children (were) admitted free when circumstances demand(ed).

The literature on this topic is scarce and lacks a rigorous analytical characterization of the different morphologies seen in microscopic observation of rust surfaces under a scanning electron microscope. The research presented in this paper uses XRD and the powerful integrated SEM/Micro-Raman technique to characterize a series of morphologies commonly found in the rust that forms when mild steel is exposed to <b>marine</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> Two atmospheres with highly different chloride deposition rates (atmospheric salinity) have been considered. In the lower salinity atmosphere an adherent rust layer was formed on the steel, the outer surface of which layer exhibited a variety of SEM morphologies corresponding to lepidocrocite (mainly) and goethite.

The present study assesses the structure and morphology of corrosion product layers formed on mild steel after 13 years of exposure in five Spanish atmospheres of different types: rural, urban, industrial, and marine (mild and severe).
