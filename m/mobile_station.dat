25|$|A {{specialized}} form of <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> {{used for}} competition in a VHF amateur radio contest in North America {{is called a}} rover station. A rover station is often designed to be operated by a passenger in the vehicle rather than the driver, and may include multiple transceivers, transverters, directional antennas, and a laptop computer to log contacts made.|$|E
25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{installed}} in a vehicle {{is referred to as}} a <b>mobile</b> <b>station.</b> A typical <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> is equipped with a transceiver, one or more antennas, and a microphone. The transceiver may be specially designed for installation in vehicles. It may be much smaller than transceivers designed for fixed station use, to facilitate installation under a seat or in a trunk, and it may feature a detachable control head that can be mounted in a separate location {{from the rest of the}} radio. Antennas designed for mobile stations must accommodate the unique physical constraints of the vehicle and travel lanes which it occupies, allowing for clearance under overpasses and bridges, and safe passage by vehicles in adjacent lanes. Most antennas used in mobile stations are omnidirectional. Few mobile stations are equipped to communicate with Morse code or digital modes. Most mobile stations are designed to be operated by the vehicle operator while driving.|$|E
25|$|On 24 August 2005, JAXA {{launched}} the experimental satellites OICETS and INDEX on a Ukrainian Dnepr rocket. OICETS (Kirari) is a mission tasked with tesing optical {{links with the}} European Space Agency (ESA) ARTEMIS satellite, which is around 40,000km away from OICETS. The experiment was successful on 9 December, when the link could be established. In March 2006 JAXA could establish with OICETS the worldwide first optical links between a LEO satellite and a ground station first in Japan and in June 2006 with a <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Aeronautical <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> are <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> {{installed}} in an aircraft. In {{addition to the}} regulatory requirements of amateur radio, operation of aeronautical <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> also requires {{the permission of the}} pilot of the aircraft.

40|$|Information systems {{consist of}} {{multiple}} <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> and fixed stations communicating with each other. Mission critical applications {{are required to}} be executed fault-tolerantly in these systems. However, <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> support neither enough volume of storage and processing power nor enough capacity of battery to do reliable communication for a long period. Moreover, wireless communication channels are less reliable. Hence, the communication channels with the <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> are often disconnected. Therefore, {{it is difficult for}} multiple <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> to take checkpoints synchronously since the communication channels with the <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> may be disconnected even during taking the checkpoints. We have proposed hybrid checkpointing where checkpoints are taken asynchronously by the <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> and synchronously by the fixed stations. In addition, the <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> record messages for getting local states consistent with the checkpoints taken by the fixed stations. In this [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|Maritime <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> are <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> {{installed}} in a watercraft, usually an ocean-going vessel. When in international waters, these stations are operated under the regulatory authority of the flag under which the vessel is registered. In addition to the regulatory requirements of amateur radio, operation of maritime <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> also requires {{the permission of the}} captain of the vessel. Maritime <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> append a /MM to end of their call sign (pronounced as [...] "slash maritime mobile").|$|R
25|$|Jules Verne was {{launched}} into low Earth orbit atop the maiden {{flight of the}} Ariane 5ES carrier rocket. Lift-off from ELA-3 at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, occurred at 04:03:04 UTC on 9 March 2008. The spacecraft separated from its carrier rocket one hour, six minutes and 41 seconds after lift-off, and navigation systems were subsequently activated. Two days later, on 11 March, the four main engines of the ATV were fired for the first time, marking the beginning of several orbital insertion boosts. The Overberg Test Range {{played a part in}} relaying ATV telemetry data from a <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> deployed in New Zealand during the launch phase.|$|E
25|$|Massive MIMO is a {{technology}} where {{the number of}} terminals is {{much less than the}} number of base station (<b>mobile</b> <b>station)</b> antennas. In a rich scattering environment, the full advantages of the massive MIMO system can be exploited using simple beamforming strategies such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT), maximum ratio-combining (MRC) or zero forcing (ZF). To achieve these benefits of massive MIMO, accurate CSI must be available perfectly. However, in practice, the channel between the transmitter and receiver is estimated from orthogonal pilot sequences which are limited by the coherence time of the channel. Most importantly, in a multicell setup, the reuse of pilot sequences of several co-channel cells will create pilot contamination. When there is pilot contamination, the performance of massive MIMO degrades quite drastically. To alleviate the effect of pilot contamination, the work of proposes a simple pilot assignment and channel estimation method from limited training sequences.|$|E

5000|$|When {{operating}} {{through a}} repeater, <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> must transmit {{on a different}} frequency than the repeater output. Although the repeater site must be capable of simultaneous reception and transmission (on two different frequencies), <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> can operate in one mode at a time, alternating between receiving and transmitting; so, <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> do not need the bulky, and costly filters required at a repeater site. <b>Mobile</b> <b>stations</b> may have an option to select a [...] "talk around" [...] mode to transmit and receive on the same frequency; this is sometimes used for local communication within range of the mobile units.|$|R

For example, <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> can periodically advertise AP of their bandwidth demands with a piggy-back technique using ACK frame.|$|R
2500|$|While {{it may not}} be a {{regulatory}} requirement, many mobile stations will append a /M to end of their call sign (pronounced as [...] "slash mobile" [...] on phone) while operating to identify themselves to other stations as a <b>mobile</b> <b>station.</b> Rover station operating in a VHF contest will append a /R to the end of their call sign (pronounced [...] "slash rover").|$|E
5000|$|Internal Roaming: The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> (MS) {{moves from}} one access point (AP) to another AP within a home network if the signal {{strength}} is too weak. An authentication server (RADIUS) performs the re-authentication of MS via 802.1x (e.g. with PEAP). The billing of QoS {{is in the}} home network. A <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> roaming from one access point to another often interrupts the flow of data among the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> and an application connected to the network. The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station,</b> for instance, periodically monitors the presence of alternative access points (ones that will provide a better connection). At some point, based on proprietary mechanisms, the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> decides to re-associate with an access point having a stronger wireless signal. The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station,</b> however, may lose a connection with an access point before associating with another access point. In order to provide reliable connections with applications, the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> must generally include software that provides session persistence.|$|E
50|$|The LAI is {{broadcast}} regularly {{through a}} broadcast control channel (BCCH). A <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> (e.g. cell phone) recognizes the LAI and stores {{it in the}} SIM Card. If the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> is moving and notices a change of LAI, it will issue a location update request, thereby informing the mobile provider of its new LAI. This allows the provider to locate the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> {{in case of an}} incoming call.|$|E
40|$|We {{address in}} this paper the problem of {{transmitting}} data to multiple <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> (MS) using a decode-and-forward strategy. The links {{between the base station}} and relays are considered ideal and we study the downlink between relays and <b>mobile</b> <b>stations.</b> We propose a method to optimize the precoding vector in relays to cancel out multiple access interference and to maximize the signal to noise ratio at the <b>mobile</b> <b>stations.</b> Simulation results show that the maximum diversity advantage can be obtained, which is the product of the number of antennas at each relay by the number of relays minus the total number of system constraints. Furthermore, using Lagrange multipliers to optimize precoding vectors, we obtain a flexibility that enables us to consider different cases for signal to noise ratio at <b>mobile</b> <b>stations.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address a new problem that has not been {{addressed}} in the past: how to improve energy efficiency for both unicast and multicast services without violating QoS requirements of <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> in 802. 16 e wireless networks. We propose a scheduling set based integrated scheduling (SSBIS) algorithm to solve the problem. SSBIS partitions all the <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> into multicast Scheduling Sets and a unicast Scheduling Set on the principle of minimizing <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> 2 ̆ 7 energy consumptions by making use of the multicast transmission scheme and it adopts different scheduling policies based on the attributes of the Scheduling Sets to improve energy efficiency of the whole system. Numerical results show that SSBIS can result in a significant overall energy saving {{while at the same time}} guaranteeing the minimum data rates of <b>mobile</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
50|$|Also in 2009 a new 60653 <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> was announced, {{completely}} redesigned {{with many}} more features than the earlier model. As before, the new <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> {{can be used}} by itself or as an additional controller with the new Central Station.|$|E
50|$|The IMSI-catcher {{subjects}} {{the phones}} in its vicinity to a man-in-the-middle attack, acting {{to them as}} a preferred base station in terms of signal strength. With {{the help of a}} SIM, it simultaneously logs into the GSM network as a <b>mobile</b> <b>station.</b> Since the encryption mode is chosen by the base station, the IMSI-catcher can induce the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> to use no encryption at all. Hence it can encrypt the plain text traffic from the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> and pass it to the base station.|$|E
5000|$|Once a push {{message is}} {{received}} from the Push Initiator, the PPG has two avenues for delivery. If the IP address of the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> is known to the PPG, the PPG can deliver directly to the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> over an IP bearer. This is known as [...] "Connection Oriented Push". If the IP address of the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> is not known to the PPG, the PPG will deliver over an SMS bearer.

Also, we applied analytical methods for evaluating the interference effect between <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> using adjacent frequency bands.
