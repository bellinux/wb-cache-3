40|$|ABSTRACTPeeled and unpeeled cassava tubers (TMS 30572) were {{soaked with}} {{the leaves of}} Ficus exasperata (Ipin) and Spondias mombin (Iyeye) and the effects were {{determined}} on functional and sensory properties. The cassava samples were soaked in water to ferment for 72 h, pressed, dried, milled and sieved to obtain lafun flour. The lafun flour was reconstituted with hot water to produce a stiff dough and subjected to sensory evaluation using a 9 -point Hedonic scale. Bulk density, water holding capacity, swelling index and dispersibility index varied from 0. 53 to 0. 63 g/cm 3, 14. 13 to 14. 85 g/ml, 0. 50 to 1. 00 g/ml and 8. 00 to 10. 00 ml respectively. Lafun obtained from cassava steeped with F. exasperata leaves was significantly different (p 0. 05). The work revealed that F. exasperata increased the <b>maltose</b> <b>equivalent</b> and invariably reduced the level of water absorption in dough preparation. S. mombin {{on the other hand}} had no significant effect. Extract is more effective in stabilizing RPKO (hydrolytically and oxidatively) than MALE...|$|E
40|$|Current work {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} different tea (green, oolong and black teas) In inhibiting human salivary a-amylase (HSA) and mammalian a-glucosidase (AGH). The inhibitory profiles were correlated to their major polyphenol content (theaflavins and catechins). The fully fermented black tea was demonstrated to be most potent In Inhibiting HSA and AGH (IC 50 of 0. 42 to 0. 67 and 0. 56 to 0. 58 mg of tea leaves/mL respectively). Its capability in retarding the digestion of a real food system (rice noodle) was further elucidated with an in vitro digestion study. Results indicated that black tea was able to retard starch digestion moderately, thereby allowing a gradual reduction of sugar liberation. Polyphenols profile analysis suggested that the oxidized catechins, theaflavins, {{may be responsible for}} its activity. We have found that refractive index (RI) measurement is a rapid, direct, and highly convenient method for quantifying the degree of enzymatic starch digestion and kinetics. The RI method has good linearity range, limit of detection (0. 1596 mg/mL, <b>maltose</b> <b>equivalent)</b> and limit of quantitation (0. 6312 mg/mL) and was successfully applied in our study...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) {{remain the}} leading cause of mortality in modern societies. Age is the major risk factor for CVD due largely to adverse changes to arteries. Two key features of arterial aging that increase CVD risk are the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction, characterized by reduced nitric oxide (NO) -mediated endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD), and large elastic artery stiffness. These adverse functional changes are driven by increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Trehalose is a naturally occurring disaccharide with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that protects against aging in lower organisms. Moreover, oral trehalose treatment improves NO-mediated EDD and reduces arterial stiffness in old mice. However, the efficacy of trehalose to reverse arterial aging in humans is unknown. The goal of this dissertation was to test the hypothesis that oral trehalose supplementation would improve resistance and/or conduit artery NO-mediated EDD in healthy MA/O adults, and that improvements would be related to reduced inflammation and oxidative stress. A secondary hypothesis was that trehalose supplementation would decrease large elastic artery stiffness in this same population. Thirty-two men and postmenopausal women aged 50 - 77 years consumed 100 g/day of trehalose or <b>maltose</b> (energy <b>equivalent</b> control disaccharide without the reported health benefits of trehalose) for 12 weeks (randomized, double-blind). Resistance artery NO-mediated EDD increased with trehalose in subjects remaining weight-stable, and this was associated with evidence of decreased endothelial cell inflammation. Contrastingly, trehalose did not modify conduit artery EDD or oxidative stress. These findings indicate that trehalose may be a novel therapy for reducing vascular inflammation and improving resistance but not conduit artery EDD in MA/O adults able to maintain stable body mass. In a secondary protocol of the parent investigation, large elastic artery stiffness was assessed in 31 healthy adults 50 - 77 years before and after 12 weeks of oral trehalose or maltose supplementation (100 g/day). Trehalose was not effective for reversing arterial stiffness in this population. These studies indicate that although trehalose has heterogeneous effects on different aspects of arterial aging and its caloric content poses challenges, this may be an effective intervention for the primary prevention of CVD by reversing resistance artery EDD in healthy MA/O adults...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of the various Somogyi-Shaffer-Hartmann (1, 2) copper reagents for glucose determination in biological material has been estab-lished. Adaptation of these reagents to calorimetric use may be accom-plished by omission of the iodide and iodate in their preparation, since these interfere with the molybdate color reagents. This omission produces no especial change {{in the character of}} the reagents. KI, however, inhibits the autoreduction of the copper and in its absence an unstable reagent results. Nevertheless, if the copper is added {{to the rest of the}} reagent on the day of its use, this difficulty is avoided. When the Somogyi micro reagent (2) is used in this way with almost any of the various phosphomolybdate reagents, very satisfactory proportion-ality is found between color density and glucose taken over a wide range of values. However, all of the phosphomolybdate reagents tried left much to be desired in reproducibility from time to time and lacked the desired stability of color. We therefore tried various color reagents, which led to the development of a new arsenomolybdate reagent. When this reagent was used with Somogyi’s micro reagent, it gave satisfactory stability and reproducibility of color. By this means it has been possible to utilize the copper reagents in a photometric procedure for practically all the uses to which the titri-metric procedures are adapted. These include tissue sugar, glycogen, urine reduction <b>equivalent,</b> <b>maltose,</b> glucuronic acid, etc. However, diastase determinations have not been successful because of the effect of the undigested starch on the clarity of the final colored solution. The reactions involved in the molybdenum blue reaction are uncertain and beyond the scope of this report. Woods and Mellon (3) discuss and give references to the various interpretations of the reaction. Reagents-Analytical reagent grade or the equivalent...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an automated procedure for determina-tion of a-amylase activity in serum or urine {{by use of}} a water-insoluble chromogenic starch substrate (commercially available). “AutoAnalyzer ” (Techni-con Corp.) equipment is used in which the sample and suspended substrate are introduced simulta-neously into the flow system. After incubation at 37 #{ 176 }Cthe water-soluble blue-starch breakdown products are filtered on-line across a cellulose nitrate mem-brane. Absorbance is measured at 630 nm, and the a-amylase activity read from a standard curve. The automated procedure has been in use {{for the past year}} and {{has been found to be}} an operationally sim-ple, reproducible, and reliable method, which can be applied over a wide range of enzyme activity. Re-sults of comparative studies with other a-amylase methods are also described. Additional Keyphrases: “Phadebas Amylase Kit ” #{ 149 } AutoAnalyzer #{ 149 }normal range The procedures most frequently used to determine a-amylase (EC 3. 2. 1. 1) activity are either amylo-clastic or saccharogenic. The former is based on the starch-iodine reaction (1, 2) and the latter on the for-mation of reducing sugars, measured as <b>maltose</b> or glucose <b>equivalents.</b> A number of reports have ap-peared in the recent literature describing adaptations of these methods for use in automated systems em-ploying conventional “AutoAnalyzer ” modules (3, 5). Although a number of the disadvantages inherent in these methods have been overcome in the automated procedures, problems of protein interference and nonspecific background absorbance necessitate the use of corrective blanks, which complicates operation and detracts from its ease and simplicity. More recently, techniques have been introduced in which either soluble or insoluble chromogenic sub-strates for a-amylase are used (6 - 8). Starches bound covalently with various dyes are hydrolyzed by a-amylase to give soluble colored fragments, which are measured colorimetrically after removal of unhydro-lyzed substrate...|$|R
