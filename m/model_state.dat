He designed the coat of arms of the state, and laid the foundation of the <b>model</b> <b>state</b> the Orange Free State was to become in later years. Having worked in secretarial functions for the State President himself (as clerk), but also as a servant of parliament, the government, and the State, Spruyt left a clear mark on the early administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the state apparatus, and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually the matter of the salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient to live on with a family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E

40|$|Many AI systems involve state change: dynamic {{planning}} systems need to predict resulting states after state transitions {{in terms of}} relevant events or actions; robots need to change their current belief sets in order to react the external world; medical diagnosis systems need to update their knowledge bases if there are new rules acquired for more precise diagnoses. Therefore, representing and <b>modeling</b> <b>state</b> change {{is an important issue}} in AI. This thesis investigates issues in representing and <b>modeling</b> <b>state</b> change from a formal perspective. Generally, representing and <b>modeling</b> <b>state</b> change addresses the following question: given an initial state what changes may be caused by some event (or action) or the occurrence of new knowledge and how to specify the resulting state when the initial state has changed? Although many formal approaches to state change have been proposed in the last decade, detailed work exploring a unified methodology for representing and <b>modeling</b> <b>state</b> change is re [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|For {{problems}} with coherent features, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, firelines, squall lines, and rain fronts, {{there is a}} need to adjust the numerical <b>model</b> <b>state</b> by deforming the state in space (its grid) as well as by [...] correcting the state amplitudes additively. In Data Assimilation by Field Alignment, Ravela et al. introduce the joint position-amplitude adjustment model using ensembles, and systematically derive a sequential approximation which can be applied to both EnKF and other formulations. Their method does not make the assumption that amplitudes and position errors are independent or jointly Gaussian, as others do. The morphing EnKF employs intermediate states, obtained by techniques borrowed from image registration and morphing, instead of linear combinations of states.|$|E
2500|$|Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon {{assert that}} the {{organizing}} model has several key advantages that distinguish it from the servicing model, such {{as the fact that}} the organizing model promotes [...] "systematic," [...] proactive, and well-thought out campaigns, which help the union's goals get satisfactorily and pragmatically achieved. More broadly, one of the obvious advantages of the organizing model is that it allows workers to actually be involved in the campaigns that most closely affect them, promoting both equity and equality. In addition, the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, provides for the union's future by broadening its support from the workers and giving them a sense of investment into the day-to-day functions of the union itself. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, in their research about British trade unions and their use of the organizing <b>model,</b> <b>state</b> that, within the unions themselves, there was praise for the organizing model because it upheld the [...] "...core role of trade unions". This is to say that the British union members felt the organizing model adhered to what unions should be doing in regard to their members.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{capability}} of improving the distributed hydrological model performance by assimilating the streamflow observations. Incorrectly estimated <b>model</b> <b>states</b> will lead to discrepancies between the observed and estimated streamflow. Consequently, streamflow observations {{can be used to}} update the <b>model</b> <b>states,</b> and the improved <b>model</b> <b>states</b> will eventually benefit the streamflow predictions. This study tests this concept in upper Huai River basin. We assimilate the streamflow observations sequentially into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to update the <b>model</b> <b>states.</b> Both synthetic experiments and real data application are used to demonstrate the benefit of this data assimilation scheme. The experiment shows that assimilating the streamflow observations at interior sites significantly improves the streamflow predictions for the whole basin. Assimilating the catchment outlet streamflow improves the streamflow predictions near the catchment outlet. In real data case, the estimated streamflow at the catchment outlet is significantly improved by assimilating the in situ streamflow measurements at interior gauges. Assimilating the in situ catchment outlet streamflow also improves the streamflow prediction of one interior location on the main reach. This may demonstrate that updating <b>model</b> <b>states</b> using streamflow observations can constrain the flux estimates in distributed hydrological modeling...|$|R

2500|$|Europe was racked by {{two decades}} of war {{revolving}} around France's efforts to spread its revolutionary ideals, and the opposition of reactionary royalty. War broke out in 1792 as Austria and Prussia invaded France, but were defeated at the Battle of Valmy (1792). The German lands saw armies marching back and forth, bringing devastation (albeit on a far lower scale than the Thirty Years' War, almost two centuries before), but also bringing new ideas of liberty and civil rights for the people. Prussia and Austria ended their failed wars with France but (with Russia) partitioned Poland among themselves in 1793 and 1795. The French {{took control of the}} Rhineland, imposed French-style reforms, abolished feudalism, established constitutions, promoted freedom of religion, emancipated Jews, opened the bureaucracy to ordinary citizens of talent, and forced the nobility to share power with the rising middle class. Napoleon created the Kingdom of Westphalia (1807–1813) as a <b>model</b> <b>state.</b> These reforms proved largely permanent and modernized the western parts of Germany. When the French tried to impose the French language, German opposition grew in intensity. A Second Coalition of Britain, Russia, and Austria then attacked France but failed. Napoleon established direct or indirect control over most of western Europe, including the German states apart from Prussia and Austria. The old Holy Roman Empire {{was little more than a}} farce; Napoleon simply abolished it in 1806 while forming new countries under his control. In Germany Napoleon set up the [...] "Confederation of the Rhine," [...] comprising most of the German states except Prussia and Austria.|$|E

60|$|That was {{one side}} of the argument: that the change would remove inequality; and there was an answer on the other side. It can be stated most truly by putting another model {{institution}} and edifice {{side by side with the}} Post Office. It is even more of an ideal republic, or commonwealth without competition or private profit. It supplies its citizens not only with the stamps but with clothes and food and lodging, and all they require. It observes considerable level of equality in these things; notably in the clothes. It not only supervises the letters but all the other human communications; notably the sort of evil communications that corrupt good manners. This twin model to the Post Office is called the Prison. And much of the scheme for a <b>model</b> <b>State</b> was regarded by its opponents as a scheme for a model prison; good because it fed men equally, but less acceptable since it imprisoned them equally.|$|E
60|$|Such a revulsion {{requires}} explanation, {{and it may}} be briefly given. There was {{a province}} of Europe which had carried nearer to perfection than any other the type of order and foresight that are the subject of this book. It had long been the <b>model</b> <b>State</b> of all those more rational moralists who saw in science the ordered salvation of society. It was admittedly ahead of all other States in social reform. All the systematic social reforms were professedly and proudly borrowed from it. Therefore when this province of Prussia found it convenient to extend its imperial system to the neighbouring and neutral State of Belgium, all these scientific enthusiasts had a privilege not always granted to mere theorists. They had the gratification of seeing their great Utopia at work, on a grand scale and very close at hand. They had not to wait, like other evolutionary idealists, for the slow approach of something nearer to their dreams; or to leave it merely as a promise to posterity. They had not to wait for it as for a distant thing like the vision of a future state; but in the flesh they had seen their Paradise. And they were very silent for five years.|$|E
