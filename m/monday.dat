5|$|Before {{the series}} had premiered, some media critics {{stated that the}} series had {{potential}} to become a ratings hit and possibly raise NBC from being the fourth highest-rated network out of five.

Despite this, other media critics have said unless the series receives a rating above a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, it will be considered a failure, and only two other NBC series ranked above a 3.0 rating at the time; Fear Factor and The Office. The series has also been put on <b>Monday</b> nights against CBS, with <b>Monday</b> featuring Two and a Half Men, one of the highest-rated shows of the season.
