40|$|Viral {{encephalomyelitis}} is {{an important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide, and many encephalitic viruses are emerging and re-emerging due to changes in virulence, spread to new geographic regions, and adaptation to new hosts and vectors [1]. The term encephalomyelitis refers to inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that results from the immune response to virus infection. In humans, the viruses most commonly identified as causes of viral encephalomyelitis are herpesviruses and RNA viruses in the enterovirus (e. g., polio, enterovirus 71), rhabdovirus (e. g., rabies), alphavirus (e. g., eastern equine, Venezuelan equine, and western equine encephalitis), flavivirus (e. g., West Nile, Japanese <b>encephalitis,</b> <b>Murray</b> <b>Valley,</b> and tick-borne <b>encephalitis),</b> and bunyavirus (e. g., La Crosse) families. Other virus families with members that can cause acute encephalitis are the paramyxoviruses (e. g., Nipah, Hendra) and arenaviruses (e. g., lymphocyti...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Murray</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (MVEV) is a {{zoonotic}} flavivirus {{endemic to}} northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. It is the causal agent of <b>Murray</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (previously known as Australian encephalitis or Australian X disease). In humans {{it can cause}} permanent neurological disease or death. MVEV is related to Kunjin virus which has a similar ecology but a lower morbidity rate. Although the arbovirus is endemic to Northern Australia, it has occasionally spread to the southern states during times of heavy rainfall during the summer monsoon season via seasonal flooding of the Murray-Darling river system. These outbreaks can be [...] "...decades apart, with no or very few cases identified in between".|$|E

During the 1960s, QIMR Berghofer established an oncology section to investigate cancer-causing viruses. One project researched cancer cells taken from Burkitt's lymphoma patients in Papua New Guinea, and found they were infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is now known to cause many types of leukaemias and lymphomas. Eight years later, this same virus was found to immortalise white blood cells; a discovery that revolutionised research of these immune cells and their DNA.|$|E

She would travel to the Torres Strait Islands on research expeditions for the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR). In 1954, Marks made a significant collection of marine insects off Low Isles Reef of far North Queensland. Other members of the expedition included Dr Mackerras, Isobel Bennett and Dorothy Hill. Marks discovered a tiny marine insect on the reef near Heron Island, where a UQ research station was being established. It was named Corallocoris marksae in recognition of her discovery.|$|E

When he returned to Australia, he conducted research at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research under director Frank Macfarlane Burnet and was involved in the establishment of the Biochemistry and Biophysics Research Unit with Henry Holden. At the Hall Institute he initially worked on the viruses that cause influenza and <b>Murray</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> He was the first to establish that influenza is an RNA virus and was awarded his DSc by the University of Sydney in 1959. From 1962 he focused on immune reactions, demonstrating that antigens are not present in antibody-producing cells, in support of Burnet's clonal selection theory.|$|E
