5|$|AML which {{arises from}} a {{pre-existing}} myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or <b>myeloproliferative</b> disease (so-called secondary AML) has a worse prognosis, as does treatment-related AML arising after chemotherapy for another previous malignancy. Both of these entities {{are associated with}} a high rate of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants and <b>myeloproliferative</b> disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Tetrasomy and hexasomy 8 {{are rare}} {{compared}} to trisomy 8, {{which is the}} most common karyotypic finding in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). AML, MDS, or <b>myeloproliferative</b> disorder (MPD) with a high incidence of secondary diseases and a six-month survival rate are associated with a polysomy 8 syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Low {{platelet}} {{concentration is}} thrombocytopenia and {{is due to}} either decreased production or increased destruction. Elevated platelet concentration is thrombocytosis and is either congenital, reactive (to cytokines), or due to unregulated production: one of the <b>myeloproliferative</b> neoplasms or certain other myeloid neoplasms. A disorder of platelet function is a thrombocytopathy.|$|E
25|$|Erlotinib has {{recently}} {{been shown to be}} a potent inhibitor of JAK2V617F activity. JAK2V617F is a mutant of tyrosine kinase JAK2, is found in most patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and a substantial proportion of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis or essential thrombocythemia. The study suggests that erlotinib may be used for treatment of JAK2V617F-positive PV and other <b>myeloproliferative</b> disorders.|$|E
25|$|Anemia {{dominates the}} early course. Most {{symptomatic}} patients complain of the gradual onset of fatigue and weakness, dyspnea, and pallor, {{but at least}} half the patients are asymptomatic and their MDS is discovered only incidentally on routine blood counts. Previous chemotherapy or radiation exposure is an important fact in the person's medical history. Fever and weight loss should point to a <b>myeloproliferative</b> rather than myelodysplastic process.|$|E
25|$|The FDA has {{approved}} imatinib {{for use in}} adults with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), myelodysplastic/ <b>myeloproliferative</b> diseases associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene rearrangements, aggressive systemic mastocytosis without or an unknown D816V c-KIT mutation, hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia who have the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase (CHIC2 allele deletion) or FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase negative or unknown, unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. On 25 January 2013, Gleevec was approved for use in children with Ph+ ALL.|$|E
25|$|Azacitidine {{is a drug}} {{approved}} by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} CMML and by the European Medicines Agency for high risk non-proliferative CMML with 10-19% marrow blasts. It is a cytidine analogue that causes hypomethylation of DNA by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine is a similar drug to azacitidine and is {{approved by}} the FDA for treatments of all subtypes of MDS, including CMML. Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy that is used in the <b>myeloproliferative</b> form of CMML to reduce cell numbers.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{confusion}} in terminology, Norton and Zager and Grady classified erythromelalgia in 1998 as either: primary/idiopathic erythromelalgia or secondary erythromelalgia. The primary/idiopathic form of erythromelalgia is not associated with any other disease process and can be either early onset (in children) or adult onset. In their paper they described secondary erythromelalgia as being associated with another disease, often related to a <b>myeloproliferative</b> disorder and has also seen cases of: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, astrocytoma of the brain, vasculitis, and pernicious anemia.|$|E
25|$|CMML shows {{characteristics}} of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); a disorder that produces abnormal looking blood cells, and a <b>myeloproliferative</b> disorder (MPD); a disorder characterised by the overproduction of blood cells. For this reason CMML was reclassified as a MDS/MPN overlap disorder in 2002. For a diagnosis of CMML, the World Health Organisation (WHO) states that the blood monocyte count must be >1x109/L, no Philadelphia chromosome or mutations in the PDGFRA or PDGFRB gene should be present, the blast count must be <20% and dysplasia {{of at least one}} lineage of myeloid blood cell should be present.|$|E
25|$|CMML-2 has {{a reduced}} overall {{survival}} {{as compared with}} CMML-1, with median survivals of 15 and 20 months, respectively. <b>Myeloproliferative</b> CMML (>13x109 monocytes/L) has a reduced survival compared with myelodysplastic CMML. A platelet count of <100 x109/L reduces overall survival. A haemoglobin level of <10g/dL has a reduced overall survival. Some cytogenetic abnormalities have implications on the prognosis of CMML. Normal karyotypes or the single loss of the Y chromosome have low risk prognoses. Trisomy 8, chromosome 7 abnormalities and complex karyotypes comprise a high risk group. Other cytogenetic abnormalities have intermediate prognoses. Somatic mutations in genes such as ASXL1 and EZH2 are associated with poor prognosis.|$|E
25|$|The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was {{developed}} in the mid-1990s to assess the prognosis of MDS patients. This system stratifies cases into 2 groups; a lower-risk group (sub divided into low and intermediate-1) and a higher risk (subdivided into intermediate-2 and high). It uses the blast percentage, number of cytopaenias and bone marrow cytogenetics data to place cases of CMML into these groups. Due to the scoring system being developed for MDS, the more <b>myeloproliferative</b> cases of CMML (WBC >13x109) are excluded from the scoring system. Although the IPSS scoring system is used clinically, there is a high variability in each group. For this reason, new modalities for assessing prognosis in MDS (and CMML) are being developed.|$|E
25|$|Chronic myelogenous (or myeloid or myelocytic) leukemia (CML), {{also known}} as chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), is a cancer of the white blood cells. It {{is a form of}} leukemia {{characterized}} by the increased and unregulated growth of predominantly myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found. It is a type of <b>myeloproliferative</b> neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome. CML is now largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since the introduction of the first such agent in 2001. These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs. In Western countries, CML accounts for 15–25% of all adult leukemias and 14% of leukemias overall (including the pediatric population, where CML is less common).|$|E
500|$|... "Preleukemic" [...] blood disorders, such as myelodysplastic {{syndrome}} (MDS) or <b>myeloproliferative</b> disease (MPS), can {{evolve into}} AML; the exact risk {{depends on the}} type of MDS/MPS. The presence of asymptomatic clonal hematopoiesis also raises the risk of transformation into AML to 0.5-1.0% per year.|$|E
500|$|Hematologic {{conditions}} {{associated with}} sluggish blood flow can increase risk for thrombosis. For example, sickle-cell disease (caused by mutations of hemoglobin) {{is regarded as}} a mild prothrombotic state induced by impaired flow. [...] Similarly, <b>myeloproliferative</b> disorders, in which the bone marrow produces too many blood cells, predispose to thrombosis, particularly in polycythemia vera (excess red blood cells) and essential thrombocytosis (excess platelets). Again, these conditions usually warrant specific treatment when identified.|$|E
500|$|The {{two most}} {{commonly}} used classification schemata for AML are the older French-American-British (FAB) system and the newer World Health Organization (WHO) system. According to the widely used WHO criteria, the diagnosis of AML is established by demonstrating involvement of more than 20% of the blood and/or bone marrow by leukemic myeloblasts, except in the three best prognosis forms of acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities (t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17)) in which {{the presence of the}} genetic abnormality is diagnostic irrespective of blast percent. The French–American–British (FAB) classification is a bit more stringent, requiring a blast percentage of at least 30% in bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) for the diagnosis of AML. AML must be carefully differentiated from [...] "preleukemic" [...] conditions such as myelodysplastic or <b>myeloproliferative</b> syndromes, which are treated differently.|$|E

2500|$|The two {{commonly}} used categories of {{white blood cell}} disorders divide them [...] into those causing excessive numbers (proliferative disorders) and those causing insufficient numbers (leukopenias). Leukocytosis is usually healthy (e.g., fighting an infection), but it also may be dysfunctionally proliferative. WBC proliferative disorders can be classed as <b>myeloproliferative</b> and lymphoproliferative. Some are autoimmune, but many are neoplastic.|$|E
2500|$|Leukaemia subtypes are {{categorised}} into single clinical entities so {{that they}} can be diagnosed and treated appropriately. Leukaemias are subdivided into lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms, depending on which bone marrow cells are cancerous. The myeloid neoplasms contain acute and chronic leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and <b>myeloproliferative</b> neoplasms (MPNs). MPNs are characterised by increased production of myeloid blood cells, with a higher than normal number of mature cells. Unlike MPNs, MDSs have a dysfunctional production of myeloid cells with a reduced number of [...] mature cells. Many of the cells produced in MDS are abnormal looking, known as dysplasia. CMML shows characteristics of both groups and thus is a difficult disease to categorise.|$|E
50|$|The {{thrombopoietin}} receptor {{also known}} as the <b>myeloproliferative</b> leukemia protein or CD110 (Cluster of Differentiation 110) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MPL (<b>myeloproliferative</b> leukemia virus) oncogene.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>myeloproliferative</b> {{neoplasms}} (MPNs), previously <b>myeloproliferative</b> diseases (MPDs), are a {{group of}} diseases of the bone marrow in which excess cells are produced. They are related to, and may evolve into, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, although the <b>myeloproliferative</b> diseases on the whole have a much better prognosis than these conditions. The concept of <b>myeloproliferative</b> disease was first proposed in 1951 by the hematologist William Dameshek. In the most recent World Health Organization classification of hematologic malignancies, this group of diseases was renamed from [...] "myeloproliferative diseases" [...] to [...] "myeloproliferative neoplasms". This reflects the underlying clonal genetic changes that are a salient feature of this group of disease.|$|E
