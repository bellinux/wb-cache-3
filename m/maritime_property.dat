50|$|Attachment is not dependent, as is {{arrest in}} rem, on the {{existence}} of a maritime lien or preferred mortgage lien, but necessitates merely an in personam claim against the defendant which falls within U.S. admiralty jurisdiction.

This paper examines the status of historic wreck as a salvable <b>maritime</b> <b>property</b> under Malaysian law by looking at core provisions under Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1952 and some of the universally accepted salvage law principles with particular emphasis on the requirements for a successful salvage. This paper suggests that although the Ordinance is ill-suited to deal with the specific concerns of historic wrecks in terms of preservation mechanism, certain mechanism offered are still of practical use. ...|$|E
40|$|Marine salvage, in principle, is {{a service}} {{rendered}} to assist or save a <b>maritime</b> <b>property</b> in marine peril. Today {{there are many}} improvements in maritime safety in the world. In parallel, decreasing number of marine accidents and the technological changes in ship designs as well as characteristics of cargo and increasing amount of dangerous goods being transported by ships started to cause the characteristics of demand for marine salvage services to change putting the marine salvage industry in operational and financial difficulties. Today, marine salvage is considered as a solution for preventing marine pollution caused by shipping accidents in the maritime industry. Emergency response and pollution prevention has become important elements of marine salvage services. Maritime nations are in continuously working on improving maritime safety for pollution prevention, as the maritime traffic is constantly increasing.

40|$|Under U. S. {{maritime}} law, a salvor of imperiled <b>maritime</b> <b>property</b> on {{navigable waters}} {{is entitled to}} a monetary award from the owner. When the salvage service is rendered voluntarily {{in the absence of}} a contract, the court determines the salvage award according to six factors enumerated by the Supreme Court in The Blackwall, 77 U. S. 1 (1869). The law, however, does not specify a precise formula or rule for calculating awards on the basis of the Blackwall factors. How do courts turn their findings on the Blackwall factors into salvage awards? This article addresses this question by examining the reported decisions of U. S. courts in salvage cases from 1799 to 2007. It employs two statistical methods—fractional polynomial regression and regression tree analysis—to make inferences about the mapping from factors to awards implicit in the salvage cases. In addition to presenting the first systematic empirical study of U. S. marine salvage awards, which complements the traditional doctrinal analysis offered by maritime commentators, an important contribution of the article is that it showcases statistical methods that are well suited to empirical doctrinal analysis but are underutilized in legal scholarship...|$|E
40|$|Multipath {{effect in}} vessel {{communication}} {{is caused by}} a combination of reflections from the sea surface and vessels. This paper proposes employing stochastic ray method to analyze <b>maritime</b> multipath propagation <b>properties.</b> The paper begins by modeling maritime propagation environment of radio waves as random lattice grid, by utilizing maximum entropy principle to calculate the probability of stochastic ray undergoing k time(s) reflection(s), and by using stochastic process to produce the basic random variables. Then, the paper constructs the multipath channel characteristic parameters, including amplitude gain, time delay, and impulse response, based on the basic random variables. Finally, the paper carries out a digital simulation in two-dimensional specific fishery fleet model environment. The statistical properties of parameters, including amplitude response, probability delay distribution, and power delay profiles, are obtained. Using these parameters, the paper calculates the root-mean-squared (rms) delay spread value with the amount of 9. 64 [*]μs. It is a good reference for the research of maritime wireless transmission rate of the vessels.

The Woolwich Royal Ordnance Factories closed in 1967, and at the same time a large part of the eastern end of the site was sold to the Greater London Council. Much of it was used to build the new town of Thamesmead. Parts of the older (western) section of the site were leased as storage or office space to assorted public bodies (including HM Customs and Excise, the British Museum Library, the National <b>Maritime</b> Museum, the <b>Property</b> Services Agency); alongside these tenants, a variety of smaller MOD departments were accommodated, some on a temporary but others on a longer term basis.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to discuss in detail privileged marithne claims, Maritime Liensfocusing on their {{existence}} in Enghsh Law, {{and deal with the}} aspects of their enforcement, whilst also considering the problems which can -and in practice usually do- arise while the entitied claimants attempt to enforce their Maritime Liens. The points covered by this thesis include the principle of Maritime Liens as recognised under English Law, and the way that these can be enforced against the offending <b>maritime</b> <b>property</b> in order to satisfy the existing claims. Also, discussed are the-various problems with which maritime lienholders aire often faced, such as the conflict'of laws existing between the numerous maritime nations-as well as the various Conventions that have been createdin order to eliminate the existing problems relating to Maritime lines arid the Arrest of Ships!. Additionally, a brief discussion about the need for the creation of uniform rules regarding Maritime Liens wiU be made, followed by an outline of the practice of forum shopping. To give a more specific preview of this thesis, the stmcture of the chapters presented is this: In the first -introductory- chapter Maritime Liens are defined and historically reviewed; the concept of Maritime Liens is closely examined by discussing their fundamental characteristics and properties, and, finally, their worth as a privileged maritime claim is evaluated. At the same time, a brief introduction to the problems that claimants may face while trying to enforce them, as weU as the attempts that have been made to unify the Intemational law regarding Maritime Liens, is given. The second chapter deals with Maritime Liens recognised in English Law, discussing those claims which give the claimant the right to proceed in rem against <b>maritime</b> <b>property.</b> In the third chapter, the enforcement of Maritime Liens is discussed. The whole procedure of enforcing a claim is dealt with in detail, startmg from the action in rem, and its nature, to the arrest of ships. The right to arrest a sister ship is also considered as well as the issue of arresting a ship chartered by demise charterers. The actual procedure of arrest is also mentioned, including the practicalities of arrest; further, the difficulties that claimants encounter in enforcing Maritime Liens are discussed -such as the extinction of Maritime Liens, the provisions of the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims and the Caveat Against Arrest. The fourth chapter introduces the issue of the conflict of laws relating to Maritime Liens; it concentrates into the numerous forms the problem can take, extensively discussing the matter of priority of Maritime Liens. The priority given under the English, American and the 1926 Maritime Liens and Mortgages Convention are briefly mentioned. Finally, the attempts that have so far been, made to settie and unify the existing Maritime Liens conflicts are reviewed, considering the various Conventions relating to both Maritime Liens and Mortgages and the Arrest of ships. In the fifth Chapter, aspects such as the uniformity that could be achieved through the ratification of international conventions and the practice of forum shopping are dealt with. Finally, in the sbcth Chapter, a brief summary of the project and its scope is made and conclusions are drawn...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of Australian maritime law was {{closely associated with}} Britain's Empire-building. To promote, and later consolidate, trade and security links within til£' 1 Empire, a large merchant fleet to be manned almost t exclusively by British seamen was created. For merchant shipping to operate as an effective and coherent force, a single body of law was specially enacted to regulate this enterprise. Maritime law was a domain for the Parliament of Great Britain and later the United Kingdom. The nature and content of this subject, as imported, administered and developed in the Australian colonies, and later States, are analysed {{in the light of}} the Imperial goals. This body of law developed and changed in conformity with the Imperial objectives. The use of paramount legislation, the invalidation of inconsistent colonial laws and the establishment of courts in the colonies, and later States, to administer Imperial maritime law were clearly part of a coordinated Imperial strategy. The mechanisms for exacting compliance by Commonwealth legislators continued until the Statute of Westminster 1931 (Imp.) was adopted. One of the main problems which the High Court had to resolve was the recurring conflict between Commonwealth and State legislation on shipping. The cause in most cases was the lack of precision between the powers conferred under the Commonwealth Constitution and those exercisable by meeting the requirements of the Imperial legislation. Several High Court decisions have significantly enlarged the role of Commonwealth legislation at the expense of State legislative powers. The major differences between the maritime laws of Australia and the United Kingdom are traceable to several factors. First there was delay or failure by the Commonwealth and State Parliaments to extend to Australia or the States the operation of those provisions of' the United Kingdom's legislation that would not otherwise apply. Second, the existing backwardness of Australian maritime law has stemmed from a prolonged indifference to a number of international conventions which have produced vital changes in maritime law. Third, Australia's departure from the strict "British ship" concept has led to a marked relaxing of the requirements for owning Australian ships or shares therein. Wherever considered appropriate, emphasis is placed on the advantages which proceedings in rem have over common law actions. The comparative analysis has brought to light many anomalies. With regard to a number of maritime matters the laws of the Commonwealth and several States are inconsistent. In many instances, it is patently illogical for penalties and strict liability to be imposed personally on shipowners and the master under the anti-pollution laws. Often the enforcement of such laws may also result in the unjustified destruction of <b>maritime</b> <b>property,</b> with the consequent loss of the existing maritime liens and other claims against the ship and freight. A workable solution may be found by integrating anti -pollution legislation with maritime law. Moreover, the methods for enforcing payment of statutory compensation for accidental injury or death suffered by seamen are examined with the view to strengthening the position of claimants. The various problem areas and anomalies highlighted are dealt with in the context of the reforms and changes which are deemed desirable to upgrade Australian maritime law. Chapter Nine discusses the important benefits and new protection that will be conferred on maritime claimants when the Draft Admiralty Bill 1985 enacted as law...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{island of}} Pag {{belongs to the}} {{geographical}} region of Northern Dalmatia, {{and is one of}} the five biggest islands of Croatia. A Liburnian population inhabited it during the time of the Roman conquest, and Pliny the Elder mentioned it under the name of Cissa (Hist. Nat., 3, 140). Although the position of the main Liburnian settlement has not been confirmed, it has been suggested that it was situated on the hill of Košljun in the near vicinity of the bay of Caska, at the north-western edge of the gulf of Pag. The bay of Caska preserved the notable remains of a multi-stratified settlement, whose important phase seems to be identifiable with a big and well-organized <b>maritime</b> villa <b>property</b> of the senatorial family Calpurnii Pisones. The systematic documentation and study of the structures on land and underwater started just recently, revealing some interesting archaeological features. The muddy bottom of the bay preserved a wooden anchor, an interesting structure made of rectangular caissons composed of logs and filled with stones, which probably served as the basis of a pier or a breakwater, and the remains of three seagoing vessels from the Early Roman Imperial Period, uncovered until 2015. The boat Caska 1, about 9 m long, was assembled with the old local sewing technique that survived into Roman times. It was probably scuttled and reused to reinforce some pier-like wooden coastal structure. On the other hand, Caska 2 is more than 15 m long, and was assembled by the standard Roman mortise-and-tenon shipbuilding technique. This ship was also scuttled and reused in a pier-like structure. Finally, a fragment of planking of a sewn boat similar to Caska 1, named Caska 3, was found inside the ship Caska 2. The poster aims at presenting the remains of the three ships, without entering into details on their secondary infrastructural function, and the adjacent harbour structures...|$|R
40|$|This chapter defines in {{what way}} the seaside and the {{waterfront}} can be place of conflicts among infrastructures, production, unplanned urbanisation, bathing tourism and many other activities. The last section of the chapter describes synthetically the study case of Saint-Nazare Submarine base and the terms of regeneration of a typically place of conflict, like a military area connected with the waterfront. The transformations underway in the waterfront areas present a variety of complex settlement dynamics that are ascribable to the infrastructural and productive nature of many activities, such as unplanned urbanisation, the pressures of bathing tourism and mass tourism, and the system of second homes. Waterfronts highlight the {{need to deal with}} the issues of conflict, a conflict generated by the separation of the authority, roles, actions and sectors of the various actors involved in the process of management and transformation of these areas. It is a conflict that only seems surmountable through the creation of a common vision of transformation that is able to bring together the tensions in play into a shared future vision, starting from an understanding of specifics and differences. At a national level, the wide fragmentation of the institutional bodies responsible for governing the coast has been determined by the definition of management roles related to <b>maritime</b> public <b>property</b> and the definition of jurisdictional limits. The concept of jurisdiction that identifies the sphere of competence and consists of the application of the objective right of the body to exercise its own administrative functions recalls the themes of management, definition of uses and modification. The areas of jurisdiction that affect waterfront areas are the main elements which define the responsibilities of the bodies which manage the territory and call on different planning regulations, whose drawing up and carrying out bring about that “separateness” of vision and of objectives that {{is at the heart of}} the fragmentation in the current national system for governing the transformation of the waterfront areas in which the bodies whose responsibilities and needs often conflict (port authorities, investors and manufacturers, communities etc.) ...|$|R
