5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to cats. For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal. Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of <b>minoxidil</b> (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal. Essential oils can be toxic to cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minoxidil</b> is {{a growth}} {{stimulant}} that stimulates already-damaged hair follicles to produce normal hair. <b>Minoxidil</b> does not, however, provide any protection to the follicles from further DHT damage. When a follicle is destroyed by DHT, <b>minoxidil</b> {{will no longer}} be able to have any more regrowth effects on that follicle. Other treatments include tretinoin combined with <b>minoxidil,</b> ketoconazole shampoo, spironolactone, alfatradiol, and topilutamide (fluridil).|$|E
25|$|Hair loss can be slowed or {{reversed}} in {{its early}} stages with medication. Medications approved by the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat male-pattern hair loss include <b>minoxidil</b> and finasteride.|$|E
25|$|Management {{may include}} simply {{accepting}} the condition. Otherwise, treatments may include <b>minoxidil,</b> finasteride, or hair transplant surgery. Evidence for finasteride in women, however, is poor {{and it may}} result in birth defects if taken during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Acquired {{generalized}} hypertrichosis may {{be caused}} by cancer. The resulting hair growth is known as malignant down. The mechanism behind cancer induced hypertrichosis is unknown. Oral and topical <b>minoxidil</b> treatments are also known to cause acquired generalized hypertrichosis.|$|E
25|$|Even aspirin, {{which is}} {{sometimes}} {{used to treat}} arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of <b>minoxidil</b> (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidental or by well-meaning owners attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes proved fatal.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes, which helps these people avoid hypoxia by aiding in pulmonary vasculature vasodilation. Effects include vasodilatation, neurotransmission (see gasotransmitters), modulation {{of the hair}} cycle, {{production of}} reactive nitrogen intermediates and penile erections (through its ability to vasodilate). Nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite serve as vasodilators because they are converted to nitric oxide in the body. The vasodilating antihypertensive drug <b>minoxidil</b> contains an Â·NO moiety and may act as an NO agonist. Likewise, Sildenafil citrate, popularly known by the trade name Viagra, stimulates erections primarily by enhancing signaling through the nitric oxide pathway in the penis.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{causes of}} {{hyperkalemia}} are discussed as follows. Acute digitalis overdose such as digoxin toxicity may cause hyperkalemia through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump. Massive blood transfusion can cause hyperkalemia in infants due to leakage of potassium {{out of the}} red blood cells during storage. Giving succinylcholine tn patients with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged immobilisation can cause hyperkalemia due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. Arginine hydrochloride is used to treat refractory metabolic alkalosis. The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing hyperkalemia. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, diazoxide, and <b>minoxidil</b> can cause hyperkalemia. Box jellyfish venom can also cause hyperkalemia.|$|E
2500|$|Acquired {{generalized}} hypertrichosis commonly {{affects the}} cheeks, upper lip, and chin. [...] This form also affects the forearms and legs, but is less common in these areas. Another deformity associated with acquired generalized hypertrichosis is multiple hairs occupying the same follicle. It may also include abnormal hair growth patterns as {{what happens to}} the eyelashes in a condition known as trichiasis. Oral <b>minoxidil</b> treatments for hypertension are known to cause this condition. Topical <b>minoxidil</b> used for alopecia causes hair growth in the areas where it is applied, however this hair disappears shortly after discontinuing the use of topical <b>minoxidil.</b>|$|E

50|$|Side {{effects of}} oral <b>minoxidil</b> may include {{swelling}} of the face and extremities, rapid and irregular heartbeat, lightheadedness, cardiac lesions, and focal necrosis of the papillary muscle and subendocardial areas of the left ventricle. There have been cases of allergic reactions to <b>minoxidil</b> or the non-active ingredient propylene glycol, which is found in some topical <b>minoxidil</b> formulations. Pseudoacromegaly is an extremely rare side effect reported with large doses of oral <b>minoxidil.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Minoxidil</b> is less {{effective}} {{when there is}} a large area of hair loss. In addition, its effectiveness has largely been demonstrated in younger men who have experienced hair loss for less than 5 years. <b>Minoxidil</b> use is indicated for central (vertex) hair loss only. <b>Minoxidil</b> is also a vasodilator. Two clinical studies are being conducted in the US for a medical device that may allow patients to determine if they are likely to benefit from <b>minoxidil</b> therapy.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} by which <b>minoxidil</b> promotes hair growth is not fully understood. <b>Minoxidil</b> is a potassium channel opener, causing hyperpolarization of cell membranes. Hypothetically, by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels, it allows more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to the follicles. This may cause follicles in the telogen phase to shed, which are then replaced by thicker hairs in a new anagen phase. <b>Minoxidil</b> is a prodrug that is converted by sulfation via the sulfotransferase enzyme SULT1A1 to its active form, <b>minoxidil</b> sulfate. Several studies demonstrated that the activity of sulfotransferase in hair follicles predict <b>minoxidil</b> response {{in the treatment of}} hair loss.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Minoxidil</b> (Rogaine) is a nonprescription {{medication}} {{approved for}} male pattern baldness and alopecia areata. In a liquid or foam, it is rubbed into the scalp twice a day. Some {{people have an}} allergic reaction to the propylene glycol in the <b>minoxidil</b> solution and a <b>minoxidil</b> foam was developed without propylene glycol. Not all users will regrow hair. The longer the hair has stopped growing, the less likely <b>minoxidil</b> will regrow hair. <b>Minoxidil</b> is not effective for other causes of hair loss. Hair regrowth can take 1 to 6 months to begin. Treatment must be continued indefinitely. If the treatment is stopped, hair loss resumes. Any regrown hair and any hair susceptible to being lost, while <b>Minoxidil</b> was used, will be lost. Most frequent side effects are mild scalp irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, and unwanted hair {{in other parts of}} the body.|$|E
5000|$|Adenosine {{has been}} shown to promote {{thickening}} of hair on people with thinning hair. [...] A 2013 study compared topical adenosine to <b>minoxidil</b> in male androgenetic alopecia, finding it was not superior to <b>minoxidil</b> and further trials were needed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Minoxidil</b> was {{developed}} in the late 1950s by the Upjohn Company (later became part of Pfizer) to treat ulcers. In trials using dogs, the compound did not cure ulcers, but proved to be a powerful vasodilator. Upjohn synthesized over 200 variations of the compound, including the one it developed in 1963 and named <b>minoxidil.</b> These studies resulted in FDA approving <b>minoxidil</b> (with the trade name 'Loniten') in the form of oral tablets to treat high blood pressure in 1979.|$|E

50|$|<b>Minoxidil,</b> applied topically, {{is widely}} used for the {{treatment}} of hair loss. It is effective in helping promote hair growth in both men and women with androgenic alopecia. About 40% of men experience hair regrowth after 3-6 months. <b>Minoxidil</b> must be used indefinitely for continued support of existing hair follicles and the maintenance of any experienced hair regrowth.|$|E
50|$|Kopexil (INCI name diaminopyrimidine oxide, {{trade name}} Aminexil) is a {{chemical}} compound similar to <b>minoxidil.</b> <b>Minoxidil</b> was originally {{used to treat}} high blood pressure; a side effect was increased body hair.
