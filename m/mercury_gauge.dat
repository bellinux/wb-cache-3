40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of the arterial wall was determined theoretically utilizing some parameters of blood flow measured in vivo. Continuous experimental measurements of pressure and diameter {{were recorded in}} anesthetized dogs on the thoracic ascending and midabdominal aorta. The pressure was measured by using a catheter, and the diameter firstly, at the same site, by a plethysmograph with <b>mercury</b> <b>gauge</b> and secondly, by a sonomicrometer with ferroelectric ceramic transducers. The unstressed radius and thickness were measured {{at the end of}} each experiment in situ. Considering that the viscous component is not important relatively to the nonlinear component of the elasticity and utilizing several equations for Young modulus calculation (thick and thin wall circular cylindrical tube formulas and Bergel's equation) the following values were obtained for this parameter: 0. 6 MPa- 2 MPa in midabdominal aorta and 2 MPa- 6. 5 MPa in thoracic ascending aorta. The behaviour of the aorta wall was modelled considering an elastic law and using the finite element program "Lagamine" working in large deformations. The discretized equilibrium equations are non-linear and a unique axi-symmetric, iso-parametric element of 1 cm in length with 8 knots was used for this bi-dimensional problem. The theoretical estimation of radius vessel, utilizing a constant 5 MPa Young modulus and also a variable one, are in good agreement with the experimental results, showing that this finite element model can be applied to study mechanical properties of the arteries in physiological and pathological conditions.

This requires adequate tools - reference values of a normal blood pressure range. The main objective {{of this study was to}} provide sex- and BMI-specific percentile reference values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure based on the adolescent Polish population, participants in the ADOPOLNOR study. A cross-sectional survey was carried out on a representative, randomly selected cohort of 4, 941; 2, 451 male and 2, 490 female students aged 10 - 18 years, residents in Wielkopolska province and its capital, the city of Poznań. All examinations were performed in school nursery rooms during morning hours according to standard procedures. Body height and weight were measured and BMI was calculated. Blood pressure was measured twice on each occasion on the right arm using a fully calibrated TECH MED TM-Z <b>mercury</b> <b>gauge</b> sphygmomanometer with sets of exchangeable cuffs and a clinical stethoscope. The blood pressure classification was determined using the surveillance method. For each participant, the mean of measurements taken on each of the three occasions was calculated and served as his/her final blood pressure value. Using the LMS method, fitted percentile curves were created for BMI-related systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The findings revealed that age related blood pressure pattern was similar in boys and girls. It showed a steady increase of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with age. There was a positive correlation between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure indicating that when systolic blood pressure increased so diastolic did (r= 0. 61 at p< 0. 01). Boys were likely to have relatively higher mean values of systolic and diastolic {{blood pressure and}} steeper slope for BMI-related change in blood pressure than girls. Similar pattern was found for age-related changes in BMI. The quotation of 3 rd, 5 th, 10 th, 15 th, 25 th, 50 th, 75 th, 85 th, 90 th, 95 th, and 97 th at any given BMI between 12 kg/m 2 and 35 kg/m 2 provided indication of the entire variation in blood pressure of adolescent males and females aged 10 - 18 years. The sex- and BMI-specific reference values and charts for systolic and diastolic blood pressure may be a useful tool in monitoring blood pressure for early detection of its abnormal level and treatment of children and adolescents with high blood pressure...|$|E

This study was approved by the TAMU-SA IRB and 41 subjects (Age= 26. 8 ± 7. 3 yrs, Ht= 167. 9 ± 3. 3 cm, Wt= 88. 0 ± 44. 6 kg, BMI= 28. 2 ± 6. 4) reported to the lab after fasting for at least four hours and sat quietly for five minutes, after which blood pressure was measured using a <b>mercury</b> <b>gauge</b> (CRIT) by the investigator, then BR followed by WR. A repeated measures ANOVA test was used to explore for differences in mean arterial pressure (MAP) among the three readings. Two groups were formed by placing those above the CRIT systolic mean (126 mmHg) to represent a lower BP group (115. 4 ± 6. 2 mmHg) and a higher BP group (137. 3 ± 8. 33 mmHg), after which a 2 (group) X 3 (method of reading) factorial ANOVA was conducted to explore for differences between groups. Alpha was set at 3 ̆c. 05 for all tests. The repeated measures ANOVA indicated the BR (100. 5 ± 13. 5 mmHg) and WR (101. 7 ± 13. 7 mmHg) MAP were significantly greater than CRIT (95. 5 ± 10. 6 mmHg), P 3 ̆c. 05. The factorial ANOVA indicated no significant interaction among group and method of reading (P 3 ̆e. 05), however, the main effect of method indicated significant differences between both instruments and CRIT in systolic readings (P 3 ̆c. 05), and a significant difference in diastolic readings between CRIT and WR only, P 3 ̆c. 05 (Table 1).

ObjectiveOur aim was to compare the effects of three light retrograde drainage options: 2 pneumatic and one manual one's. MethodWe used a fragmentation program with a seven-compartment i-Press® 10 th serial (Mazet Med™, Fr); with a Lymphassist® program with a 12 -compartment Hydroven 12 ® (Flowtron™, GB); and a manual drainage are successively and randomly carried out on 9 women (71 years old) with an old (14 years) persistent upper limb lymphoedema that appeared 7 years after radio-surgical treatment against breast cancer. All volume variations are recorded continuously with a plethysmograph (JSI™, SU 4). <b>Mercury</b> <b>gauges</b> are fitted 4 inches below the elbow. The protocol of pneumatic drainages consisted of a standardised retrograde approach with constant pressure (40 mmHg) (without regressive pressure) at a single to double-level of compression. ResultsBy use of Kruskal and Wallis, one-way ANOVA on ranks, the effect of arm drainage on the fore-arm was + 0. 04 ml/ 100 mloed (med 0 [+ 1 to − 1]) when the drainage was applied manually, + 0. 07 ml/ 100 mloed (med 0 [0 to + 1. 25]) using Lymphassist® and − 0. 17 ml/ 100 mloed (med 0 [0 to − 1. 2]) using the iPress pneumatic pump.

Two {{of the most important}} of the factors in Starling’s forces controlling fluid filtration across the capillary have hitherto not been studied in nephrotic subjects. MethodsThe hydrostatic capillary pressure at the finger nailfold in actively nephrotic subjects and age and sex matched controls was studied, using direct puncture of the apex of the capillary under video microscopy, and a servonulling apparatus to give a direct measurement of capillary pressure. Capillary filtration capacity (CFC) at the calf was measured noninvasively by a modern derivative of the technique of <b>mercury</b> strain <b>gauge</b> plethysmography. Fifteen nephrotic subjects with a variety of underlying pathological lesions, and age matched controls were studied. ResultsContrary to the assumption of the “overflow” hypothesis of edema formation, {{there was no evidence of}} capillary hypertension. The capillary pressure showed no difference between nephrotic subjects and controls: median (range) of 17. 6 (12. 0 to 24. 2) compared with 17. 3 (9. 0 to 21. 6) mm Hg, P = NS. CFC was significantly higher in nephrotic subjects than controls [5. 23 (3. 28 to 8. 52) × 10 - 3 versus 3. 55 (2. 43 to 5. 28) × 10 - 3 ml/min/ 100 g/mm Hg, P < 0. 01].

40|$|Alterations in the <b>mercury</b> strain <b>gauge</b> {{plethysmograph}} pulse tracing {{have been}} previously thought to denote changes in venous tone. This {{study was designed}} to define the implications of changes in amplitude and contour of pulse tracing. Seven normal subjects were studied. After control measurements, amyl nitrite was administered and the pulse tracing was recorded. When the haemodynamic state had returned to control levels 0. 4 mg sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was given. The amplitude of the plethysmograph pulse tracing (Y mm) and the vertical distance from the dicrotic notch to the peak of the pulse tracing (X mm) were measured. With amyl nitrite, the amplitude of the pulse tracing (Y) decreased from 10. 4 +/- 1 to 4. 5 +/- 0. 6 mm (mean +/- SEM), while the X/Y ratio increased from 0. 7 +/- 0. 02 to 0. 98 +/- 0. 02 (P less than 0. 005). After GTN Y increased from 9. 3 +/- 0. 8 to 31 +/- 4. 8 mm (P less than 0. 005) and X/Y ratio increased from 0. 7 +/- 0. 06 to 0. 99 +/- 0. 01 (P less than 0. 005). Since it is known that amyl nitrite produces venoconstriction and arteriolar dilatation, and GTN causes venous and arteriolar dilatation, we conclude that an increase in Y reflects venous dilatation, and an increase in X/Y ratio, that is a fall in the dicrotic notch, denotes arteriolar dilatation. Thus, the plethysmograph pulse tracing can be used to assess the effects of drugs on the capacitance and resistance beds...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} the haemodynamic effects of varying {{the angle of}} head up tilt.  METHODS— 20 healthy subjects (12  female, eight male; mean (SD) age 33. 6  (8. 4) years) underwent head up tilt for five minutes to each of four angles of tilt in random order, with a five minute rest period at the horizontal between each angle. Forearm blood flow was measured using intermittent occlusion <b>mercury</b> strain <b>gauge</b> plethysmography at two and five minutes. Subjects underwent continuous monitoring of heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by Finapres and cardiac output and stroke volume by impedance cardiography. Each variable was measured at two and five minutes, averaged over the period of blood flow measurement.  RESULTS—Every haemodynamic variable at each angle was significantly different from supine values. Head up tilt produced progressive increases in heart rate (11 - 21 %), SBP (12 - 21 %), and DBP (20 - 33 %) with increasing tilt angle. However, although 45 ° produced significantly less haemodynamic effect, {{there were no significant}} differences for angles between 60 ° and 90 °. Cardiac output fell on head up tilt by 17 - 20 % and stroke volume by 28 - 34 %, but increasing tilt angle produced no significant additional reduction in cardiac output and stroke volume because of increases in heart rate and vasoconstriction.  CONCLUSIONS—Angles <  60 ° produce significantly less haemodynamic effects than steeper angles. Increasing tilt angle beyond 60 ° produces no apparent additional effect on cardiac output or sympathetic tone. Increasing tilt angle beyond 60 ° confers no additional orthostatic stress and may not affect the sensitivity and specificity of head up tilt testing as previously thought. Sixty degrees of tilt is a more practical angle for support of a syncopal patient and is recommended.    Keywords: head up tilt test; vasovagal syncope; thoracic impedanc...|$|R
40|$|In {{motorcycle}} {{and marine}} outboard engines with multiple carburetors, the vacuum pressure of each carburetor should be balanced.

Also, improper engine tuning can cause mercury to be sucked into the engine and released instantly in high concentrations from the exhaust system. Acute exposure to high concentrations of mercury vapor can affect lung function and possibly damage the lungs. Mercury can also enter the body through the skin. Prolonged exposure to mercury can damage the kidneys and the central nervous system.

Even healthy people may exhibit nausea, dizziness, or headache during long periods of standing. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) {{is often used to}} simulate orthostatic stress to elucidate orthostatic reflexes. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is used in various research and clinical fields. NIRS monitors tissue oxygenation changes by measuring oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) and {{it might be possible to}} apply NIRS to assess vascular responses during LBNP to blood volume change. The purpose of this thesis was to examine vasoconstrictor responses in the lower limbs during graded LBNP to determine the efficacy of using NIRS to investigate orthostatic mechanisms, and to investigate the physiological differences between subjects with high and low tolerance and between males and females during graded orthostatic stress. A series of five orthostatic studies were conducted: 1) Changes in (superficial) blood distribution in thigh during LBNP; 2) Assessments of tissue vascular responses between forearm and selective deep calf and calf with superficial portion during graded LBNP; 3) Comparisons of oxygenated Hb with blood flow measured by plethysmography and muscle sympathetic nerve activity during graded LBNP (reliability of calf blood flow assessment by selective deep oxygenated Hb); 4) Differential vasoconstrictor responses between subjects with low and high tolerance to graded LBNP; 5) Comparisons in peripheral vascular responses between genders (with high and low tolerant individuals) during graded LBNP. It was concluded that: 1) NIRS measurement of oxygenated and deoxygenated Hb was able to distinguish the tendency of blood distribution between the arterial and venous compartments during graded LBNP. 2) Selective deep calf oxygenated Hb responses assessed by a two-detector NIRS model may reflect (sympathetically mediated) blood flow changes in muscle vasculature. 3) Selective deep NIRS may be an useful tool to evaluate calf vasoconstrictor responses based on comparisons between selective deep oxygenated Hb responses (arbitrary units) and blood flow changes evaluated by <b>mercury</b> strain <b>gauge</b> plethysmography, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity assessed by microneurography. 4) The delayed reductions in the selective deep oxygenated Hb and heart rate (HR) increments in subjects with high compared to low tolerance may indicate that cardiovascular responses to LBNP in the High group were shifted toward more severe negative pressure levels during graded LBNP. 5) The greater reductions in oxygenated Hb with either negative pressure levels, or with blood pooling, in men compared to women suggest that men had greater vasoconstrictor responses during graded LBNP...|$|R
40|$|Established primary {{hypertension}} {{is primarily}} characterised by elevated peripheral resistance {{and an increase}} in renal vascular resistance. Antagonism of angiotensin II may be a particularly relevant intervention in this condition, as angiotensin II is known to act both as a powerful vasoconstrictor and as a stimulus to vascular hyperthrophy. The aims of this study were to: - evaluate the acute and long-term effects of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil o. d., an angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor blocker, on systemic and renal haemodynamics and RAAS hormones in patients with mild and moderate hypertension, - assess the long-term effects on forearm haemodynamics and baroreceptor sensitivity and, finally, - compare the effects of candesartan cilexetil 16 mg with the effects of losartan 50 mg and valsartan 80 mg on blood pressure, renal haemodynamics and RAAS hormones before and during intravenous angiotensin II infusion. Blood pressure was assessed intra-arterially and by ordinary mercury manometer. Cardiac output was measured using the dye dilution technique in the acute and long-term study. In the comparison between AT 1 receptor blockers, blood pressure was assessed with an ordinary mercury manometer. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were obtained from PAH and 51 CrEDTA clearance and forearm blood flow by <b>mercury</b> strain <b>gauge</b> plethysmography. Baroreceptor sensitivity was calculated from beat-to-beat changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate. A single oral dose of candesartan cilexetil induced systemic and renal vasodilation and blood pressure reduction without compromising renal perfusion or filtration or affecting cardiac perfomance. Long-term treatment with candesartan cilexetil o. d. induced systemic, forearm and renal vasodilation and a blood pressure reduction. As in the acute study, candesartan cilexetil induced a reduction in renal vascular resistance. The glomerular filtration rate was maintained and the filtration fraction was reduced, indicating a decreased glomerular capillary pressure. The baroreceptor sensitivity was not influenced by candesartan cilexetil but the operational set point was shifted to the left. In the comparative study, candesartan cilexetil 16 mg o. d. reduced resting blood pressure significantly more than losartan 50 mg o. d. and valsartan 80 mg o. d. Candesartan cilexetil almost completely inhibited the exogenous angiotensin II-induced renal vasoconstriction, effectively inhibited the increase in filtration fraction and significantly blunted aldosterone secretion compared with losartan and valsartan, indicating a more effective AT 1 receptor blockade with candesartan cilexetil. In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil is a vasodilator providing long-term blood pressure control without initial reflex tachycardia. Long-term renal adaptation is characterised by a reduction in filtration fraction. The superior blood pressure control and more pronounced inhibition of exogenous angiotensin II-induced effects with candesartan cilexetil compared with losartan and valsartan might be explained by the binding properties of candesartan cilexetil, especially the slow dissociation from the receptor...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundColour duplex {{ultrasonography}} (CDU) {{is widely}} recommended before varicose vein surgery, combined with quantification of venous reflux by plethysmography where required. This study assessed venous haemodynamics {{before and after}} varicose vein surgery by venous outflow plethysmography (VOP), venous reflux plethysmography (VRP) and by adoption of a modified segmental venous reflux score (VRS). The effect of wearing one or two class I medical compression stockings was also assessed. The aim {{of the study was}} to identify parameters which reflect the outcome of treatment using medical compression stockings or surgical intervention. Methods 24 legs of 21 patients with superficial vein incompetence of clinical grade C 2 – 4 a (CEAP) were assessed before and a mean of 8 S. D. 4 months after superficial vein surgery. Investigations were CDU, as well as VOP and VRP using <b>mercury</b> in rubber <b>gauges</b> fitted either around the calf or the forefoot. Venous reflux was semi-quantitatively graded by CDU in relation to the actual vein diameter and transformed into a VRS with respect to the number of involved serial vein segments. The venous reflux rates were measured in standing patients after knee bending before and after application of one or two superimposed compression stockings (class I). ResultsAccording to VRP, one compression stocking reduced the maximum venous reflux rates (VRmax) by about 30 % which was comparable with the effect of surgery on VRmax. Two superimposed compression stockings were almost twice as effective and diminished VRmax pre- and post operatively by around 60 %. Varicose surgery reduced the maximum venous outflow rates significantly (pre-op: 166 S. D. 77 ml/min× 100 ml tissue, post op: 120 S. D. 34) and improved VRS (pre-op median 5. 0 IQR: 4. 5 – 5. 5, post-op median 0. 5 IQR: 0 – 1. 0). Surgery had no effect on venous refilling time or venous reflux rates when measured without compression stockings. ConclusionVenous reflux assessed by plethysmography was moderated by the use of compression stockings pre-operatively but did not reflect the outcome of surgical treatment of superficial venous reflux. Increased venous volume and venous outflow were restored to the levels of normal contralateral limbs by surgery. The VRS decreased considerably following surgery, reflecting the effect of surgical treatment on the number of incompetent venous segments. Changes in this parameter did not correlate with any of the plethysmographic measurements...|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{starting}} the research {{described in this}} thesis I had completed {{the first year of}} a residency programme in internal medicine. During this time I became interested in epidemiology and wished to learn more about how this approach could be used to examine problems in clinical medicine. When the opportunity arose to study in Oxford I considered a number of possible topics for my research but decided to study some aspects of atherosclerotic vascular disease because this was an important subject and also relevant to a possible future career in cardiovascular medicine. A preliminary review of the literature revealed that there was a vast amount of information concerning coronary artery and cerebral vascular disease. In contrast, few data were available concerning the epidemiology of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), possibly because this condition was rarely a primary cause of death, symptoms of PVD were often tolerated by patients who did not seek medical attention, or because serious complications such as amputation were infrequent. Another reason for this lack of data may have been the assumption that the factors leading to an increased risk of developing PVD were the same as those which caused coronary artery and cerebral vascular disease. It seemed that research concerning risk factors for PVD, and the natural history of this condition, might provide new information of clinical importance, and would at the same time permit me to learn some of the techniques of epidemiology. When I began I felt that there were several basic questions which needed to be answered. The first concerned the frequency of PVD. Few studies had attempted to determine the prevalence of PVD or that of its most common symptom, intermittent claudication (IC). Most data came from selected groups of people which were not representative of a general population. The techniques used to identify cases were poorly standardized, and few studies included an examination of the peripheral circulation. I decided, therefore, that the first stage of my research would be to determine the frequency of IC in a general population using a standardized questionnaire to identify cases and a physical examination to confirm the diagnosis. One advantage of starting with a prevalence survey was that the cases identified could then be compared with controls selected at random from the same population, and a second important question could then be answered: what factors are associated with an increased risk of developing IC? A survey to determine the prevalence of IC and a case-control study to examine risk factors for this condition are presented in Section 2 of the thesis. The prevalence of IC in men aged 45 to 70 years was 3. 0 per cent, and that of women 50 to 70 years was 0. 8 per cent. A total of 54 cases of IC were identified, and the over-all prevalence in the population was 2. 0 per cent. Factors associated with an increased risk of developing IC were age, smoking, a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or hyperlipidaemia, and elevations of blood pressure, serum triglyceride, plasma fibrinogen, and serum uric acid. Of these factors, smoking was associated with the greatest relative risk of IC and was the main risk factor for this condition. Elevated blood pressure, the chief risk factor for cerebral vascular disease, did not have the same degree of importance in the aetiology of PVD. Serum cholesterol, {{which is one of the}} main risk factors for coronary artery disease, was not elevated in the patients with IC compared with their controls. Nor was the blood glucose elevated in the cases despite a higher prevalence of diabetes. There was significant synergism among the risk factors, and the relative risk of developing IC rose sharply in people with multiple risk factors. Evidence of coronary artery disease was found very frequently among the patients with IC. In addition to defining risk factors for IC, I also wanted to examine the natural history of patients with PVD. Data was available from a number of studies which had examined series of patients referred to hospital, but few of these had investigated the effect on prognosis of removing correctable risk factors such as smoking and hypertension. I was fortunate in having the opportunity to examine a group of 60 patients with IC referred to hospital in 1971 and 1972 who had been extensively investigated to determine risk factors for PVD. I undertook a follow-up study of these patients in order to determine whether any of the risk factors identified at the initial examination had had a significant effect on prognosis. The results of this investigation are presented in Chapter 5. A number of the patients had died since the first referral for IC, and, in agreement with other studies, the chief causes of death were coronary artery and cerebral vascular disease. The only correctable risk factor which significantly affected prognosis was smoking. Most of the patients who stopped or reduced smoking after referral completed the follow-up period without significant complications from their PVD, whereas the majority of patients who continued to smoke had a deterioration in their symptoms and a clinical course which was punctuated with frequent hospital admission, reconstructive surgery, amputation, and death. This effect was not due to other risk factors since the smoking groups were comparable with respect to age, severity of PVD at referral, and the prevalence of other medical conditions such as ischaemic heart disease. Thus the improved prognosis associated with abstinence from tobacco could reasonably be attributed to elimination of this risk factor. Elevated blood pressure did not significantly worsen the prognosis except in those who continued to smoke, suggesting a synergistic effect of smoking and blood pressure. The only other factor which had a significant effect was a history of stroke; these people had a very high mortality rate. Patients with elevated glucose, cholesterol, or triglyceride, did not have a worse prognosis than people with normal levels. The follow-up study described in Chapter 5 examined a small number of patients for a relatively short period of time. In order to provide further information about the prognosis of patients with PVD, I decided to identify a larger patient group and follow them for as long as possible. The presence of a unique computer-based information system, the Oxford Record Linkage Study (ORLS), enabled me to identify all people admitted for the first time to hospitals in the Oxford area in 1965 and 1966 because of PVD and to determine the frequency of subsequent hospital admissions, operations and death by means of the linked records maintained by the ORLS. This study is described in Chapter 6. The 160 patients included in this study had a five-year mortality rate which was twice that of the general population, controlling for age and sex. Factors which worsened the prognosis were increasing age at referral, ischaemic heart disease, cerebral vascular disease, and diabetes. The patients had frequent and prolonged admissions to hospital because of deterioration in their condition, and many had reconstructive surgery or amputations. The degree of morbidity associated with PVD was striking, and the disease had a great impact not only on the patients but also on the financial resources of the health services. Thus the observation made in Chapter 5 that patients who stop or reduce smoking have a better prognosis than those who continue to smoke was seen to be relevant not only to the individual with PVD but also to have practical significance for the community as a whole. The final chapter of my thesis contains the results of a trial of Cinnarizine in the treatment of 18 patients with IC. I chose to investigate this drug because other studies have shown an improvement in the symptoms and blood flow (measured by plethysmography) of patients with PVD who were treated with Cinnarizine. Unlike most of the drug preparations being investigated at the time, Cinnarizine was not a vasodilator and did not cause changes in blood pressure, pulse, or cause the "steal" effect which is so often reported. The trial protocol included measurements of blood flow using a <b>mercury</b> strain <b>gauge</b> plethysmograph. This enabled me to compare the plethysmograph with another objective variable, the ankle systolic blood pressure measured with a Doppler ultrasound flow meter, and to determine their usefulness in the evaluation of patients with PVD. It was planned initially to treat 20 patients with IC for four months and then to proceed with a double-blind trial if the results were promising. Unfortunately there was little evidence of subjective improvement in patient symptoms at the end of the preliminary study and no evidence of improved blood flow to the legs as measured by plethysmography. Thus it was decided that a double-blind trial was not indicated. The objective measurement which was most strongly correlated with patients' symptoms was the ankle systolic pressure measured after exercise, and since this test was far easier to perform than plethysmography I concluded that the Doppler flow meter was the better method of evaluating PVD. In summary, I have found that intermittent claudication occurs in approximately two per cent of adults. Peripheral vascular disease is, therefore, a fairly common disorder, and since it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality its prevention and treatment are major concerns for the medical profession. Peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and cerebral vascular disease have several risk factors in common, but smoking seems to be particularly important in promoting atherosclerosis in the peripheral circulation. Every effort should be made to encourage patients with peripheral vascular disease to stop smoking, since continuation of this habit significantly worsens the prognosis and may increase the likelihood of costly medical intervention. At the present time surgical correction of arterial lesions is the only accepted form of treatment for peripheral vascular disease. Since atherosclerosis is a generalized process, it is possible that removal of correctable risk factors may be a more effective way of preventing ischaemic complications. The peripheral circulation is uniquely accessible to examination with non-invasive techniques, and I believe that further investigations in which patients with peripheral vascular disease are observed and the effect of risk factor control are evaluated may provide new information concerning the aetiology and treatment of atherosclerosis. </p...|$|R
