5000|$|There is no {{metallurgical}} {{standard for}} <b>pot</b> <b>metal.</b> Common <b>metals</b> in <b>pot</b> <b>metal</b> include zinc, lead, copper, tin, magnesium, aluminium, iron, and cadmium. The primary advantage of <b>pot</b> <b>metal</b> {{is that it}} is quick and easy to cast. Because of its low melting temperature, it requires no sophisticated foundry equipment or specialized molds. Manufacturers sometimes use it to experiment with molds and ideas (e.g., prototypes) before casting final products in a higher quality alloy.|$|R
25|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>pots</b> {{are made}} from a narrow range of <b>metals</b> because <b>pots</b> and pans need to conduct heat well, but {{also need to be}} {{chemically}} unreactive so that they do not alter the flavor of the food. Most materials that are conductive enough to heat evenly are too reactive to use in food preparation. In some cases (copper pots, for example), a pot may be made out of a more reactive metal, and then tinned or clad with another.|$|R

40|$|Traditionally certain <b>metal</b> <b>pots</b> {{are used}} to store {{drinking}} water {{in order to ensure}} safety. A study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the effect of oligodynamic metals such as copper, silver and brass against enteric gram negative drinking water isolates such as Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella spp., E. coli (MDR), E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and Klebsiella spp. in Kathmandu. The study was conducted at the microbiology laboratory of National College, Kathmandu during September 2007 to January 2008. The test was carried out by preparing broth of the respective microorganisms followed with contaminating autoclaved distilled water with 1 % (by volume) of the prepared broth culture and incubating the contaminated water in the respective <b>metal</b> <b>pots</b> up to 48 h (holding time). Reduction in the microbial load was assessed by pour plating the water content in the <b>metal</b> <b>pots</b> on Nutrient agar medium in every 0, 4 th, 8 th, 12 th, 24 th and 48 th h of incubation (holding time). Among three test pots, copper pot showed the maximum bactericidal action compared to silver and brass pots towards most of the enteric gram negative bacterial isolates of water. Complete inhibition of tested organism was recorded within 4 to 48 hours of holding time. This study suggested the promotion of use of water pots made of oligodynamic metals such as silver and copper, and alloy such as brass to control the gram negative enteric pathogens in drinking water.

These have character shapes cut into them, so the result is a cast slug with the character shapes of the line on its front face. The mold disk is sometimes water-cooled, and often air-cooled with a blower, to carry away the heat of the molten type metal and allow the cast slugs to solidify quickly.|$|R
