50|$|At Selznick's insistence, {{the film}} {{faithfully}} adapts {{the plot of}} du Maurier's novel Rebecca. However, at least one plot detail was altered {{to comply with the}} Hollywood Production Code, which said that the <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> a <b>spouse</b> had to be punished. In the novel, Maxim shoots Rebecca, while in the film, he only thinks of killing her as she taunted him into believing that she was pregnant with another man's child, and her subsequent death is accidental. However, Rebecca was not pregnant but had incurable cancer and had a motive to commit suicide, that of punishing Maxim from beyond the grave. Therefore, her death is declared a suicide, not murder.|$|R

40|$|According to Hemingway {{all good}} prose has {{the dignity and}} draught of an iceberg. This is {{especially}} true of Hemingway's short stories. "Francis Macomber" counts among the best composed short stories in English. Interpretation sways between Hemingway's idealisation of the male code and its deconstruction. Is the White Hunter a British scourge of American values or is Margot the tragic victim of a newly founded male friendship? Is the open ending rather a hunting accident or the mean <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> an unloved <b>spouse?</b> Hemingway gives hitherto uninterpreted clues by mentioning strategies of big game hunting and ballistics. Carter's magic story "Master"; deals with the regression of a White Hunter who has become 'his own negative'. An Englishman dissolves into the Amazonian jungle and is killed by his own victim.

40|$|After {{years in}} which she and her {{children}} were physically abused by her adulterous husband, a woman in Talladega County, Alabama, arranged to have him killed. Tragically, <b>murders</b> <b>of</b> abusive <b>spouses</b> are not rare in our violent society, but seldom are they punished by the death penalty. Yet this woman was sentenced to death. Why? It {{may have been in}} part because one of her court-appointed lawyers was so drunk that the trial had to be delayed for a day after he was held in contempt and sent to jail. The next morning, he and his client were both produced from jail, the trial resumed, and the death penalty was imposed a few days later. It may also have been in part because this lawyer failed to find hospital records documenting injuries received by the woman and her daughter, which would have corroborated their testimony about abuse. And it may also have been because her lawyers did not bring their expert witness on domestic abuse to see the defendant until 8 p. m. on the night before he testified at trial. Poor people accused of capital crimes are often defended by lawyers who lack the skills, resources, and commitment to handle such serious matters. This fact is confirmed in case after case. It is not the facts of the crime, but the quality of legal representation, that distinguishes this case, where the death penalty was imposed, from many similar cases, where it was not...|$|R

40|$|Community {{property}} <b>of</b> <b>spouses</b> - termination {{and settlement}} The topic of my thesis is called Community property between spouses, its termination and settlement. I have chosen this particular topic because I {{am interested in}} this area and in civil law in general and also I find it very important.
