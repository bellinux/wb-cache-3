Dynamics of manufacturing output, employment, exports and sales as well as structural changes regarding output, employment and sales structure are examined. As mainstream view of economists suggests that the current economic recovery is due to sharp increase in exports of goods that are, as a rule, mainly produced in manufacturing sector, hence the study examines the dependence of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>on</b> global <b>demand</b> changes.

40|$|Semiconductor {{capacity}} {{planning is}} a cross- functional decision that requires coordination between the marketing and manufacturing divisions. We examine main issues of a decentralized coordination scheme {{in a setting}} observed at a major US semiconductor manufacturer: marketing managers reserve capacity from <b>manufacturing</b> based <b>on</b> product <b>demands,</b> while attempting to maximize profit; manufacturing managers allocate capacity to competing marketing managers so as to minimize operating costs while ensuring efficient resource utilization. This cross- functional planning problem has two important characteristics: (1) bothdemands and capacity are subject to uncertainty, and (2) all decision entities own private information while being self- interested. To study the issues of coordination we first formulate the local marketing and the manufacturing decision problem as separate stochastic programs. We then formulate a centralized stochastic programming model (JCA), which maximizes the firm's o [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} their competitiveness, companies optimize their manufacturing by adapting structures {{to the requirements of}} technology and market. On the other hand, they try to fulfil specific requirements by extreme customer orientation and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> This leads to new organizational structures and manufacturing systems. Appropriate organization forms, such as the fractal company, are distinguished by high flexibility, rapid adaptability and exploitation of human potentials. However, they also require appropriate PPC-systems (Production Planning and Control) or rather new methods of PPC. In addition to a high planning reliability these systems have to ensure high flexibility, distributed processes of planning and decision-making, general orientation towards common goals and an information flow conform to the requirements. The most important elements of such a PPC-system are long-range analysis of the production structure, medium- and long-range planning for the entire production area, short- and medium-range coordination among production fractals and short-range shop-control inside the fractals. At the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation simulation-based systems are being developed to support the planning and control of such organization forms within the production. Thereupon the user is put into the position of planning job orders reliably and optimizing production, concerning cost and schedule reliability, by making use of the advantages of decentralized structures...|$|E
40|$|The general {{consensus}} is that 3 D-printing technologies can help to render industrial production more sustainable, e. g. by shortening process chains, by allowing more efficient production processes or by providing benefits resulting from light-weight construction. In this paper, we aim to quantify the impact of additive <b>manufacturing</b> processes <b>on</b> energy <b>demand</b> by taking the example of selective laser-sintering (SLS). For this purpose,we suggest and apply a model that distinguishes three important phases in the life-cycle of additively manufactured components and which allows to compare them to conventional manufacturing processes. The three phases under consideration include {{the production of the}} required raw material, the actual manufacturing process of specific components as well as their utilization. The analysis focuses on the automotive and aircraft industries. In the paper, we analyze and discuss main factors influencing energy demand and estimate the impact of additive <b>manufacturing</b> <b>on</b> a national level, taking Germany as an example. The analysis indicates that despite replacing only a small component, substantial energy savings can be achieved. Furthermore, the utilization phase appears to be very relevant for achieving energy savings in the considered industries as compared to the other two phases...|$|R
40|$|Managing {{the global}} {{competition}} within the manufacturing industry {{emphasizes the need}} for more flexible production capacity. One way to achieve improved flexibility is to implement a mobile manufacturing system. The authors participate in the research project “Factory-in-a-Box”, which key performance indicators are: mobility, flexibility, and speed. The objective of the Factory-in-a-Box concept is to develop mobile <b>manufacturing</b> capacity <b>on</b> <b>demand,</b> which can either be moved between different productions sites or within a plant. There are several reasons for introducing a mobile manufacturing system, such as: • Entering new markets where there is a necessity to have local production. • Being able to share low frequent used production capacity with other companies. • Covering occasional peaks in production. Principally, the <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> a mobile <b>manufacturing</b> system are high in terms of reconfiguration ability, generality, and an efficient knowledge and information handling system. By increasing the mobility of the manufacturing system, both small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as larger companies could increase their competitiveness. By conducting semi-structured interviews at several companies of different type and size, both market and individual company requirements concerning mobile manufacturing systems have been identified. This paper describes the Factory-in-a-Box concept, and results discovered during a multiple case study. By explaining existing manufacturing theories and relating the Factory-in-a-Box concept to some of these theories, the authors give practical examples of how the concept can be applied. This paper gives an overview of the requirements set <b>on</b> the mobile <b>manufacturing</b> system, and enlightens practical examples of how, and under which circumstances, the Factory-in-a-Box concept could be applied...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the mobile}} {{manufacturing}} concept is to provide solutions for mobile and flexible <b>manufacturing</b> capacity <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> The idea with the concept is that a mobile manufacturing unit (MMU) could sent {{to the place where}} it is needed, either within the company, to a local supplier, to a customer, or to a partner, in order to, for example, cover a temporary volume peak. Within the research project Factory-in-a-Box, five fully operative MMUs have been designed and realized in close contact with Swedish manufacturing industries. The main logistic focus within the research project has been put on optimizing the transport solutions, while the implications on the relations in the supply chain have still not been analyzed. It is however, important to clarify that the geographical and organizational distance between the stationary site and the site where the MMU temporarily is located, affects the complexity of the information and material flow. In order to secure MMU productivity, both information and material flow to and from the stationary factory, the stationary factory’s sub-suppliers, the local suppliers, and the customer, must be handled. In order to use the MMU’s resources efficiently, the level of interaction with all these actors has to be selected wisely. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the information flow and material flow in one of the demonstrators within the Factory-in-a-Box project, in order to highlight the importance of selecting appropriate level of interaction and how mobility affects the supply chain relations...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} stay {{competitive}} in today's markets corporations are constantly searching for areas of improvement within their products and processes and the available technologies {{in order to be}} more efficient and produce products more cost effective. In addition companies try to create distinctions of their products to maintain and gain market share by offering superior products and services. This is not only true for first time parts but also increasingly important for secondary products. These secondary products also called spare parts and their management is becoming a production factor, which is gaining more and more importance. Manufacturers are required to provide spare parts pending on the type of spare parts (consumer products or industrial products) in varying quantities making it more complex for the manufactures to maintain these systems. This paper is presenting an alternative solution for the growing quantity of product types on the market requiring currently enormous warehouses to keep stock for spare parts, with corresponding high costs and complex logistics. This emerging problem is caused by the continuously decreasing product life time, decreasing time-to-market and increasing regulatory affairs.

40|$|The {{reality of}} the present global market {{is that it is}} unpredictable. One {{component}} of ideal action by successful industrial enterprises will therefore make a conscious effort to master the ever-changing markets by <b>manufacturing</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> This will be an increasingly complex task in a global market with global competition, internationalization of technology development and research, shorter product life cycles, fluctuating sophisticated demand, short reaction times, lower costs, higher quality and diversification. A wide range of experience has shown that it helps to form small but powerful and dynamic manufacturing units, which operate in a customer-oriented manner within a manufacturing network. Manufacturing on customer demand requires flexible production facilities which can be rapidly adjust to market changes. This can only be realized by enterprises which operate in networks of complementary capacities. This significantly defuses coordination problems in the short-term resource planning and order management. The manufacturing units have to be autonomous and self-optimizing. To increase their productivity, they have to work with capable and safe processes. The logistics have to ensure short distances and flexible response. Standardized interfaces are needed to ensure good communication and information flow. The objectives of the manufacturing units have to be in line with the higher objectives of the manufacturing network. This paper will characterise types of manufacturing networks to reach synergistic effect...|$|E

40|$|Spare {{parts for}} {{products}} {{that are at the}} end of their life cycles, but still under warranty, are logistically difficult because they are commonly not stored in the central warehouse. These uncommon spare parts occupy valuable space in smaller inventories and take a long time to be transported to the point of need, thus delaying the repair process. This paper proposes that storing the spare parts on a server and producing them with additive <b>manufacturing</b> (AM) <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> can shorten the repair cycle by simplifying the logistics. Introducing AM in the repair supply chain lowers the number of products that need to be reimbursed to the customer due to lengthy repairs, improves the repair statistics of the repair shops, and reduces the number of items that are held in stock. For this paper, the functionality of the concept was verified by reverse engineering a memory cover of a portable computer and laser sintering it from polyamide 12. The additively manufactured component fit well and the computer operated normally after the replacement. The current spare part supply chain model and models with AM machinery located at the repair shop, the centralized spare part provider, and the original equipment manufacturer were provided. The durations of the repair process in the models were compared by simulating two scenarios with the Monte Carlo method. As the biggest improvement, the model with the AM machine in the repair shop reduced the duration of the repair process from 14 days to three days. The result points to the conclusion that placing the machine as close to the need as possible is the best option, if there is enough demand. The spare parts currently compatible with AM are plastic components without strict surface roughness requirements, but more spare parts will become compatible with the development of AM.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} {{for studying the}} effects of automobile emission policies on the design decisions of profitseeking automobile producers in a free-entry oligopoly market. The study does not attempt to model short-term decisions of specific producers. Instead, mathematical models of engineering performance, consumer demand, cost, and competition are integrated to predict the effects of design decisions <b>on</b> <b>manufacturing</b> cost, <b>demand,</b> and producer profit. Game theory is then used to predict vehicle designs that producers would have economic incentive to produce at market equilibrium under several policy scenarios. The methodology is illustrated with three policy alternatives for the small car market: {{corporate average fuel economy}} (CAFE) regulations, carbon dioxide emissions taxes, and diesel fuel vehicle quotas. Interesting results are derived, for example, it is predicted that in some cases a stiffer regulatory penalty can result in lower producer costs because of competition. This mathematical formulation establishes a link between engineering design, business, and marketing through an integrated optimization model that is used to provide insight necessary to make informed environmental policy...|$|R

We conclude, in general, that in establishing market dominance, firms should focus on timely entry to capture first-buyers, high responsiveness and predatory pricing. Scale advantages and resilience through responsiveness are essential in obtaining and subsequently retaining the market share when other firms already provide or are about to enter with technically superior products.
