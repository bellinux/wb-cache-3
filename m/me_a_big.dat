500|$|Gaga {{recruited}} artist Jeff Koons for {{the project}} in early 2013; the two had met previously at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga had a live performance. According to Koons, Gaga [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me and gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work'." [...] In addition to Interscope Records notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a multimedia software application which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romário {{was left}} out of the 1998 World Cup squad. Medical exams had {{revealed}} that he had a muscular injury, and he received intensive treatment leading up to the tournament, but he did not recover completely and was dismissed the day of the deadline for the World Cup squad submissions. Just after the decision was announced, Romário held a press conference where he broke down in tears while saying that [...] "this is very sad for <b>me,</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> disappointment. This is a very difficult moment in my life". Brazil lost the World Cup final against hosts France.|$|E
2500|$|A survey {{published}} by Radio Times magazine in March 2004 revealed that Casualty has featured more future stars {{than any other}} UK soap or drama series. Actors who appeared in the show prior to becoming famous include Kate Winslet, Orlando Bloom, Minnie Driver, Christopher Eccleston, Tom Hiddleston, Parminder Nagra, Sadie Frost, Ray Winstone, David Walliams, Jonny Lee Miller, Martin Freeman, Helen Baxendale, Robson Green and Brenda Fricker. Discussing her 1993 appearance in Casualty, Winslet told the Radio Times: [...] "In England, it almost seems {{to be part of}} a jobbing actor's training [...] As far as I was concerned it was a great episode, a great part. Appearing in Casualty taught <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> lesson in how to be natural in front of the camera." [...] In addition, the series has featured a variety of more established stars, including Norman Wisdom, Amanda Redman, Anita Dobson, Jenny Seagrove, Rula Lenska, Prunella Scales, [...] Celia Imrie, Toyah Willcox, Maureen Lipman, [...] Frances Barber, Andrew Sachs, Russ Abbot, Stephanie Beacham, Honor Blackman and Michelle Collins in cameo roles.|$|E

2500|$|Tracht {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} the South Bronx (New York City) with his younger sister, Diana, and parents, Alfred and Gertrude Tracht. His father was a native New Yorker who sold dental supplies; his mother was a Lutheran {{immigrant}} from Germany who stayed home to raise her two children until they were in high school, then became a noted educator. Tracht attended DeWitt Clinton High School and graduated in 1968. He majored in broadcasting at Ithaca College and landed a job at the college radio station. [...] "From the first day I got on the air, I was trying to do comedy bits and tell jokes. After my first year in college, I had this station (WYSL) in Buffalo, New York, offer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> time job." [...] Tracht got a job at WTKO, a low-power top-40 station in Ithaca. The following year, he had moved up to night DJ at a larger station in Binghamton, New York, WENE. Tracht graduated from Ithaca College in 1972 ...|$|E
2500|$|Gaga {{recruited}} Jeff Koons {{into the}} project in early 2013, with the two having previously met at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga provided a live performance. According to Koons, she [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me and gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hug around my waist [...] " [...] and replied, [...] "You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work." [...] Following her hip surgery in February 2013, the singer was forced into a six-month hiatus, during which she studied literature and music with the Haus of Gaga in addition to sharing [...] "creative gifts". This stage allowed her to review and enhance her creative direction, which she admitted to be a meticulous [...] "gazing process". [...] "I have to gaze into the work {{for long periods of}} time for it to be good," [...] adding that upon analyzing her ideas, she received [...] "that wonderful feeling" [...] which told her [...] "that's the one".|$|E
2500|$|More {{outrageous}} {{still was}} a sketch written by Arch Oboler, starring Don Ameche and West as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden on NBC. She told Ameche {{in the show}} to [...] "get <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> one... I feel like doin' a big apple!" [...] This ostensible reference to the then-current dance craze {{was one of the}} many double entendres in the dialogue. Days after the broadcast, the studio received letters calling the show [...] "immoral" [...] and [...] "obscene" [...] by societies for the protection of morals. Several conservative women's clubs and religious groups admonished the show's sponsor, Chase & Sanborn Coffee Company, for [...] "prostituting" [...] their services for allowing [...] "impurity [...] invade the air". [...] Under pressure, the Federal Communications Commission later deemed the broadcast [...] "vulgar and indecent" [...] and [...] "far below even the minimum standard which should control in the selection and production of broadcast programs". Some debate existed regarding the reaction to the skit. Conservative religious groups took umbrage far more swiftly than the mainstream. These groups found it easy to make West their target. They took exception to her outspoken use of sexuality and sexual imagery, which she had employed in her career since at least the Pre-Code films of the early 1930s and for decades before on Broadway, but which was now being broadcast into American living rooms on a popular family-friendly radio program. [...] The groups reportedly warned the sponsor of the program they would protest her appearance.|$|E
