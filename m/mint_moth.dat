50|$|The Orange <b>Mint</b> <b>Moth</b> or Orange-spotted Pyrausta (Pyrausta orphisalis) is {{a species}} of moth of the Crambidae family. It is found from Newfoundland west to British Columbia, south to Florida and New Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|It flies both at day and at night. [...] As {{the name}} suggests, the <b>mint</b> <b>moth</b> often uses mint (Mentha spicata. Mentha rotundifolia) {{as a food}} plant, though {{it can also be}} found on other species such as marjoram, Salvia pratensis, Melissa officinalis, Nepeta cataria and Calamintha species.|$|E
50|$|Fumibotys is a genus of moths of the Crambidae family {{which was}} {{described}} in Guen√©e by 1854. It contains only one species, Fumibotys fumalis, the <b>mint</b> root borer <b>moth,</b> which is found in most of North America.|$|R
50|$|Pyrausta laticlavia, the {{southern}} purple <b>mint</b> <b>moth,</b> is {{a species of}} moth of the Crambidae family. It is found from New Jersey south to Florida, west to Texas, Oklahoma and California. In California, the species has expanded its range northward into the San Francisco Bay area (1990) and Sacramento Valley (1993) recently.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flowers of}} Monarda bradburiana produce copious {{quantities}} of nectar and are attractive to bumblebees and other long-tongued bees, butterflies, hummingbird moths, beeflies and hummingbirds. Pollen is harvested by halictid bees which cannot reach the nectar, and a specialist pollinator is Doufourea monardae, {{a small black}} bee. This is a food plant for the caterpillars of the hermit sphinx, the gray marvel, the orange <b>mint</b> <b>moth</b> and the raspberry pyrausta moth. Herbivorous mammals tend to avoid the foliage, perhaps because it has an odour of oregano.|$|E
50|$|Since crambids are {{relatively}} common throughout human settlements, the moths tend to affect crops and gardens, whether harmfully, beneficially or harmlessly. Beneficial crambids include the water hyacinth moth (Niphograpta albiguttalis), {{used to control}} its host (Eichhornia crassipes), the water veneer (Acentria ephemerella), a biocontrol agent used against Eurasian watermilfoil), and the bamboo borer (Omphisa fuscidentalis), of which the caterpillars are used for human consumption (see entomophagy). The <b>mint</b> <b>moth</b> (Pyrausta aurata) {{is an example of}} a harmless crambid. Crambid larvae are typically stem borers in plants of the grass family. As this family contains many important crops, some Crambidae species achieve pest status. The European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis is perhaps the best known; introduced to the United States in the early 1900s, it is now widespread in all but the westernmost states. Other pest species include the spotted stalk borer (Chilo partellus), the Asiatic rice borer (Chilo suppressalis), sod webworms (Crambus spp.), Duponchelia fovealis, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), bean pod borers (Maruca spp.), the rice white stemborer (Scirpophaga innotata), the southwestern corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella), and the grape leaffolder (Desmia maculalis).|$|E
