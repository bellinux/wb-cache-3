40|$|AbstractThe railway {{transport}} is {{considered as a}} {{one of the most}} environmentally friendly type of transport. With future prediction of increasing freight transport there are lines facing problems with demanded capacity. Increase of the track capacity could be achieved by infrastructure constructive adjustments. The contribution shows how the travel time can be minimized and the track capacity increased by changing some of the basic infrastructure and operation parameters, for example the <b>minimal</b> <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> of the track, the number of tracks, or the usable track length at stations. Calculation of the necessary parameter changes is based on the fundamental physical laws applied to the train movement, and calculation of the occupation time is dependent on the changes of controlling the traffic between the stations...|$|E
50|$|The German Class 87 was a {{standard}} (see Einheitsdampflokomotive) goods train tank locomotive with the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG). It was specifically {{designed by the}} firm of Orenstein & Koppel for use in Hamburg Harbour. The harbour lines had <b>minimal</b> <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> of only 100 m and high train loads to be moved. The axle load had {{to be no more}} than 17,5 tons. These requirements resulted in an axle count of five axles. In order to keep wear and tear on the running gear within acceptable limits only the middle three wheelsets were linked by coupling rods, the two Luttermöller outside axles were driven by cogs.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{characteristics}} of wheel-rail vibration of the vertical section in a high-speed railway, a vehicle-line dynamics model is established using the dynamics software SIMPACK. Through this model, the paper analyzes the influence of vertical section parameters, including vertical section slope and vertical <b>curve</b> <b>radius,</b> on wheel-rail dynamics interaction and the acting region of wheel-rail vibration. In addition, the characteristics of wheel-rail vibration of the vertical section under different velocities are investigated. The {{results show that the}} variation of wheel load is not sensitive to the vertical section slope but is greatly affected by the vertical <b>curve</b> <b>radius.</b> It was also observed that the smaller the vertical <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> is, the more severe the interaction between the wheel and rail becomes. Furthermore, the acting region of wheel-rail vibration expands with the vertical <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> increasing. On another note, it is necessary to match the slope and vertical <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> reasonably, on account of the influence of operation speed on the characteristics of wheel-rail vibration. This is especially important at the design stage of vertical sections for lines of different grades.|$|R

40|$|For more {{efficient}} railway maintenance {{there is a}} need to increase the understanding of the influence of operational conditions on wheel and rail degradation. To this end, the chosen primary investigation strategy is to employ dynamic multibody simulations, where operational conditions are altered, to estimate the influence on material deterioration. Operational conditions considered are track, wheel and rail geometries; and types of material deterioration that are considered are rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear. Track geometry, especially the <b>curve</b> <b>radius,</b> has a large influence on wheel/rail degradation. Smaller <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> lead to higher degradation. By also considering the influence of lateral track irregularities in curves, a more complicated relationship emerge. Large <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> and a high level of lateral irregularities lead to an increase in RCF over the length of a <b>curve.</b> For small <b>radius</b> <b>curves,</b> where wear is the dominating damage mechanism, an increase in the level of lateral irregularities leads to a transition towards a mixed RCF/wear regime for the outer (high) rail.

40|$|The {{relation}} between speed choice and steering performance during curve negotiation was studied in a driving simulator. The hypothesis was that <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> and steering competence both affect steering error during curve driving, resulting in compensatory speed choice. In this, {{the control of}} safety margins was assumed to operate as a regulatory mechanism. Smaller <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> resulted in a larger required steering wheel angle, and steering error increased linearly with required steering wheel angle. Participants compensated for this by choosing a lower speed, such that the time to line crossing to the inner lane boundary was constant over all <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> examined. Steering competence was measured during straight-road driving. Poorer steering competence also resulted in larger steering errors, which were compensated for by choosing a lower speed, such that the safety margin to the inner lane boundary was unaffected by steering competence...|$|R

Much research has been conducted in recent years {{to examine the relationship between}} design speed and operating speed at tangent and horizontal curve sections. The majority of previous research has focused on rural two-lane highways and urban residential streets and collectors. Little if any research has considered the problems related to horizontal curves on suburban arterials. Lack of information and the results of previous studies prompted this research focusing on current design practices on suburban four-lane arterials. Roadways of the suburban arterial functional class were identified and reviewed to decide their appropriateness for inclusion in the study. The experimental design included a procedure for collecting speed data on both tangent and horizontal curve sections to examine driver behavior associated with these curves. Two primary independent variables, <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> and approach density, were examined throughout this study. Regression analyses were performed to examine their effect on 85 th percentile speeds on tangents and curves. The results indicated that the 85 th percentile speeds on tangents decreased as approach density increased. Comparisons were made between design and operating speeds for the curves examined. For the comparisons made on suburban arterials, the 85 th percentile driver usually exceeds the design speed and corresponding side-friction factor on curves with inferred design speeds less than 70 km/h (43. 5 mi/h). The evaluations of driver speed behavior on horizontal curves suggested that <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> is a good predictor of 85 th percentile speed on curves. It was determined that a curvilinear relationship exists between <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> and 85 th percentile speed on curves. For the curves examined, the 85 th percentile speed on curves increased as <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> increased. The results also show that approach density is significant in contributing to the explanatory power of the relationship. Additional analyses were performed to examine the effect of <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> and approach density on mean speed reductions at curves. Previous research suggests that mean speed reductions decrease as <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> increases. The regression results do not indicate a statistically significant effect of <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> and approach density on mean speed reductions. The combined variability of speeds on curves and speeds on tangents probably caused the poor results, given the small number of sites examined...|$|R
