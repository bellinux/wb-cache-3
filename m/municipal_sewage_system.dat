40|$|Problems {{related to}} content of fat, {{oil and grease}} (FOG) in {{wastewater}} is an increasing problem in Sweden. FOG can cause clogging in the <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> and subsequent flooding and disturbance of processes in waste water treatment plants. The problem has previously been mostly been related to release of large quantities of FOG from restaurants and large scale industries which has caused problems in <b>municipal</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>systems.</b> However, similar problems have more recently been detected more frequently in relation to disposal of FOG from households into the sewage. This study evaluated a full-scale experiment with source-separation of FOG from households in a residential area in Malmö, Sweden.

40|$|Abstract. Fat, oil {{and grease}} are the three {{elements}} usually found in the <b>municipal</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> as the results of improper disposal from the sink. These elements come from domestic and commercial kitchens. The absent or inefficient of a plumbing device known as grease trap has caused the trapped of fat, {{oil and grease}} in the <b>sewage</b> <b>systems.</b> There {{are two types of}} grease trap, namely Passive Grease Trap and Active Grease Trap. These grease types are collected and they can be recycled and used to produce an energy source, for example biodiesel. In Malaysia, the usages of passive grease traps are exercised. There are two parameters that govern the construction of the grease trap, namely retention time and flow rate. The ratio of sizing including the empirical formulations regarding the flow rate and the retention time will be discussed thoroughly in this paper. Furthermore, the {{understanding of the nature of}} the fat, oil and grease and the construction guideline for grease trap will be covered in this paper...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThere {{is growing}} concern about {{bacterial}} resistance to antimicrobials. The majority of antibiotics used are only partially metabolized after administration, and are released via patient excreta into the <b>municipal</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>system.</b> Data {{on the use}} of antibiotics and their emission into hospital effluent are not available. MethodsAntibiotic consumption in Germany was calculated on the basis of five hospitals of varying size and medical service spectrum and on prescriptions issued by medical practitioners. The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) was calculated for hospital effluent and for municipal sewage. The PECs were compared both with published minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC 50) for sensitive pathogenic bacteria and with the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs). ResultsThe amount of antibiotics emitted into hospital effluent may reach and exceed the MIC 50 of susceptible pathogenic bacteria. The PEC/PNEC ratio is highest for hospital effluent (in some cases 10 – 20 times the MIC 50) and frequently > 1 for municipal sewage. PECs are high enough for some compounds to have a PEC/PNEC ratio > 1 even in surface water. ConclusionThe volume of antibiotics used in hospitals and private households and released into effluent and municipal sewage indicates a selection pressure on bacteria. Steps should be taken to reduce the risk by proper handling of antibiotics and their residues both in hospitals and by private users...|$|E
40|$|Background: Healthcare {{effluent}} acts as {{the store}} house of harmful infectious agents such as the pathogens and microorganisms possessing multiple drug resistant genes. Potential health risk includes spreading of diseases by these pathogens and wide dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes. Gram-negative bacteria are particularly important for causing most of the hospital and community acquired infections. Aim: This study was carried out to highlight the incidence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospital generated effluent discharged into <b>municipal</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> of Sylhet city, Bangladesh. Methodology: Standard biochemical tests were used to isolate and identify 29 gram negative bacteria from 6 effluent samples. Antibiotic susceptibility test was assessed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Plasmid isolation and gel electrophoresis were performed using standard protocols. Results: Antibiogram study showed {{that the percentage of}} isolates resistant to amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, azithromycin, andsulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim were 93. 10 %, 55. 17 %, 27. 6 %, 24. 14 %, 20. 7 %, 13. 8 % and 10. 34 % respectively. Ten of the isolates showed resistance to three or more commonly used antibiotics. Plasmid profiles of the multi-drug resistant isolates showed to harbor two or more plasmids and almost all of them showed a common band for plasmid DNA size of 24. 5 kb. Conclusion: Resistance to the bacterial pathogens causing community acquired infections may, thus, exert a serious public health threat through confining the antibiotic pool. Hospitals should follow, monitor and regulate proper sanitary measures of hospital generated effluents to forestall the dissemination of multi drug resistant bacteria transfer from hospital waste to the environment...|$|E

Transition {{from high}} to lower {{endemicity}} of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection may portend increased public health burden with {{the shift of}} infection to older ages and increasing morbidity and mortality. This report describes age-specific prevalence of antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) among {{children and young adults}} in Santiago, Chile, compared with previous prevalence data and assesses factors predictive for anti-HAV. In 1998, a serosurvey was performed in Metropolitan Santiago, designed to enroll a representative, age-stratified population on the basis of area of residence. A total of 784 individuals (age range, 1 – 24 years) were enrolled. Anti-HAV prevalence by year of life was as follows: ages 1 to 4, 12. 5 %; 5 to 9, 26. 2 %; 10 to 14, 43. 4 %; 15 to 19, 57. 4 %; 20 to 24, 73. 9 %. Adjusting for age, factors associated (inversely) with anti-HAV included residential areas of higher socioeconomic status (SES), parental educa-tion, and household characteristics of potable water, <b>municipal</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>system,</b> and the presence of a toilet or refrigerator in the house. In logistic regression analysis, only maternal years of education and residence in areas of higher SES remained independently associated with anti-HAV. Excluding those from higher SES areas, comparison of the age-specific anti-HAV prevalence data from previous studies of similar methodology in areas of lower SES revealed consistent decreases across all age groups; the age-standardized prevalence for this age range (1 – 24 years) dropped from 53. 7 % in 1990 to 40. 6 % in 1998. In light of the growing pool of susceptible individuals at older ages, with HAV continuing to circulate in the communities, evaluation of the feasibility of vaccination programs would be judicious...|$|E

30|$|For several years, the {{occurrence}} of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment has been {{recognized as one of}} the emerging issues in environmental risk assessment [1 - 4]. Pharmaceuticals used in human medical care are not completely eliminated in the human body and can enter the <b>municipal</b> <b>sewage</b> sludge <b>system</b> both as the parent compound and as their biologically active metabolites. These compounds have a large potential for unwanted effects on nontarget organisms in the environment. Several investigators have examined the removal of pharmaceutical compounds during the passage through <b>municipal</b> <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>systems</b> [5 - 8]. Effluent concentrations and elimination rates for different compounds vary significantly. Various pharmaceutical compounds have been detected in concentrations up to μg L− 1 in sewage effluents, downstream of sewage treatment plants and in surface and groundwater [2, 9, 10]. In addition to sewage treatment plants, landfill sites where unused drugs and different personal care products have been disposed may release these compounds into the environment. There are several old landfill sites that were established when the disposal of such compounds through garbage was tolerated, and drugs have been detected in leachates from such municipal landfills [11].
