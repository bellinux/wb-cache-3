5000|$|According to the Smithsonian Institution, {{a record}} is [...] "any official, {{recorded}} information, regardless of medium or characteristics which are created, received, and maintained" [...] {{by an individual}} collector or institution. As every object within a collection must have accompanying documentation, records management functions as {{the primary focus of}} collections management, and covers a wide range of documentation and policy standards. Topics covered under the umbrella of records management include collection information management systems, collections accession and deaccession policies, collection management policies, cataloging, and curation. The lack of appropriate record keeping systems in museums compromises the security of museum collections and threatens the role of museums as information centres. Planned and systematised <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> im-proves museums’ programmes and activities thereby leading to effective governance and operation of the museum.|$|E
5000|$|ICA's mission {{statement}} reads: [...] "The International Council on Archives (ICA) {{is dedicated to}} the effective <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> and the preservation, care and use of the world's archival heritage through its representation of records and archive professionals across the globe. Archives are an incredible resource. They are the documentary by-product of human activity and as such are an irreplaceable witness to past events, underpinning democracy, the identity of individuals and communities, and human rights. But they are also fragile and vulnerable. The ICA strives to protect and ensure access to archives through advocacy, setting standards, professional development, and enabling dialogue between archivists, policy makers, creators and users of archives. The ICA is a neutral, non-governmental organisation, funded by its membership, which operates through the activities of that diverse membership. For over sixty years ICA has united archival institutions and practitioners across the globe to advocate for good archival management and the physical protection of recorded heritage, to produce reputable standards and best practices, and to encourage dialogue, exchange, and transmission of this knowledge and expertise across national borders." ...|$|E
5000|$|Drawing {{from the}} above {{theoretical}} foundations, the RCM as a framework acknowledges the central role that recordkeeping activities have on the creation, capture, organization and ongoing <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> over time and throughout spaces such as organizations and institutional archives. Recordkeeping is a practice and a concept clearly defined in the archival and records literature by continuum writers as [...] "a broad and inclusive concept of integrated recordkeeping and archiving processes for current, regulatory, and historical recordkeeping purposes". Recordkeeping refers to the activities performed on records that add new contexts such as capturing a record into a system, adding metadata, or selecting it for an archive. In the RCM records are therefore not defined according to their status as objects. Rather, records are understood as {{being part of a}} continuum of activity related to known (as well as potentially unknown) contexts. A record (as well as records, collections and archives) are therefore part of larger social, cultural, political, legal and archival processes. It is these contexts that are vital to understanding the role, value and evidential qualities of records in and across spacetime (past, present and potential future).|$|E

The model is {{used to evaluate the}} trade-off between manual <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> programs to a PVR archive and automatic <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording.</b> We show that a tradeoff exists between manual management in which the utility of a program is perfectly known but user awareness of available programs is limited versus automatic management in which utility estimates contain error but aware-ness is perfect. Experiments with the model show that the shape of this tradeoff is most governed by the shape of the distribution of user utility. As the percentage of programs with high user utility decreases relative to the average, the more effective automatic recording is likely to be despite er-rors in utility estimation. The shape of this tradeoff, however, is highly inelastic. Thus, improving utility estimates will not make automatic recording more effective if user awareness is sufficiently high. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The RCM {{is often}} {{described}} as being in contrast or at odds with the lifecycle records model. While the RCM is inclusive of multiple ways of conceptualizing and performing recordkeeping, including a lifecycle approach, there are some significant differences. Firstly, where the lifecycle approach shows clearly demarcated phases in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>records,</b> a continuum approach conceptualizes elements as continuous with no discernable parts. Secondly, the lifecycle approach identifies clear conceptual and procedural boundaries between active or current records and inactive or historical records, but a continuum approach sees records processes as more integrated across spacetime. In the continuum it is recordkeeping processes that carry records forward through spacetime to enable their use for multiple purposes. What this means is that records are always [...] "in a state of always becoming...", and able to contribute new contexts via the recordkeeping processes that occur with them. Archival records are therefore not just historical, but are able to be re-interpreted, re-created, and re-contextualized according to their place and use in spacetime. In this way, archival institutions are nodes in the network of recorded information and its contexts, rather than the end point in a lifecycle stage for records that are managed as [...] "relics".|$|E
