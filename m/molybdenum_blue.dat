These single molecules are quite large; this can be shown by taking the length of an oxygen molecule with two atoms (length 0.12 nm) as a unit, then considering Mo368 which is 50 times larger. Müller's related work shows many applications (see above), for example, how cellular processes like ion-transport can be modelled based on the spherical porous capsules and how the latter {{can be used to}} remove toxic compounds from water.

One aspect is modelling of the Lotus effect, another one chemical adaptability as a new phenomenon. An interesting mathematical treatment of the Keplerates could be developed in relation to spherical viruses and Buckminster Fuller Domes based on Archimedean and Platonic solids. The unique range of potential applications of the Mo132 Keplerates has also been highlighted by several other authors, e.g.: [...] "Thus, Keplerate-type capsules represent unique supramolecular objects offering a tunable spatially-restricted environment and promising in many domains such as catalysis, electric conductivity, non-linear optics, liquid crystals, vesicles and [...] "blackberry" [...] aggregates. ...a key point to promote confined space engineering."

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} a paper on phos-pholipid analysis in this journal (1) but deferred comment until the publication of our own paper on the subject, which we believe contains relevant material (2). Sandhu refers {{to the formation of}} a Prussian blue complex {{as the result of a}} reaction between phospholipids and a chromogenic reagent containing mo-lybdenum. Clearly this cannot be so, as Prussian blue is the color produced by the ferroferricyanide ion (Fe(III) [Fe(H) (CN) 6]). In a previous publication (3) a similar procedure was described and the spectrum of the resulting color complex shown. This spectrum is iden-tical with that of <b>molybdenum</b> <b>blue,</b> which is the color that would be ex-pected from Sandhu’s method. Molyb-denum blue is a colloidal solution of a complex, the exact structure of which is unknown, but which contains Mo(V) and Mo(VI). Because <b>molybdenum</b> <b>blue</b> is the end-point color in many phos-phate analyses it is often assumed that phosphate is essential to its formation. This is not so; it merely has a high af-finity for Mo(VI). We therefore suggest that in the re-action described by Sandhu some of the molybdate is reduced to Mo(V) by me-tallic mercury and that his chromogenic reagent is <b>molybdenum</b> <b>blue.</b> This is borne out by its color. We further suggest that when this reagent reacts with phospholipids, a further complex occurs involving either the lipid phos-phorus or quaternary nitrogen. Because of the lipophilic nature of the lipid molecule, this complex is transferred to the organic phase in the manner we de-scribed (2). In our method, complexing occurs through the quaternary nitrogen, whereas in Sandhu’s method it would appear that the phosphorus is involved. In a similar procedure, Raheja et al.
