40|$|A 30 day {{contiguous}} photometric {{run with}} the Microvariability and Oscillations of STars (MOST) satellite on the WN 5 - 6 b star WR 110 (HD 165688) reveals a fundamental periodicity of P = 4. 08 +/- 0. 55 days along {{with a number of}} harmonics at periods P/n, with n approximate to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and a few other possible stray periodicities and/or stochastic variability on timescales longer than about a day. Spectroscopic radial velocity studies fail to reveal any plausible companion with a period in this range. Therefore, we conjecture that the observed light-curve cusps of amplitude similar to 0. 01 mag that recur at a 4. 08 day timescale may arise in the inner parts, or at the base, of a corotating interaction region (CIR) seen in emission as it rotates around with the star at constant angular velocity. The hard X-ray component seen in WR 110 could then be a result of a high velocity component of the CIR shock interacting with the ambient wind at several stellar radii. Given that most hot, luminous stars showing CIRs have two CIR arms, it is possible that either the fundamental period is 8. 2 days or, more likely in the case of WR 110, there is indeed a second weaker CIR arm for P = 4. 08 days, that occurs similar to two-thirds of a rotation period after the <b>main</b> <b>CIR.</b> If this interpretation is correct, WR 110 therefore joins the ranks with three other single WR stars, all WN, with confirmed CIR rotation periods (WR 1, WR 6, and WR 134), albeit with WR 110 having by far the lowest amplitude photometric modulation. This illustrates the power of being able to secure intense, continuous highprecision photometry from space-based platforms such as MOST. It also opens the door to revealing low-amplitude photometric variations in other WN stars, where previous attempts have failed. If all WN stars have CIRs at some level, this could be important for revealing sources of magnetism or pulsation in addition to rotation periods. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a chart book of {{selected}} immigration trends that {{touch on the}} main elements of comprehensive immigration reform (CIR). Most policymakers agree that the <b>main</b> issues in <b>CIR</b> include increased border security and immigration enforcement, improved employment eligibility verification, revision of legal immigration, and options to address the millions of unauthorized aliens residing in the country. The report offers snapshots of time series data, using the most complete and consistent time series currently available for each statistic. The key findings and elements germane to the data depicted are summarized with the figures. The summary offers the highlights of key immigration trends...|$|R
40|$|This report {{opens with}} brief {{legislative}} histories of "comprehensive immigration reform" (CIR) in the 109 th and 110 th Congresses. A comparative overview of key CIR {{provisions in the}} three bills that received floor action in the 109 th and 110 th Congresses follows. In addition to a narrative discussion of how the bills addressed the <b>main</b> provisions of <b>CIR,</b> the report provides a table that presents a comparative summary of the key features of the bills. The report concludes with observations contrasting the 2006 - 2007 period with the context of today's CIR debate. The report also provides an appendix that summarizes the three major CIR bills...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{beta-lactam}} agents containing iron-chelating moieties, such as E 0702, {{which contains}} catechol, and pirazmonam and U- 78, 608, which contain 3 -hydroxypyridone, have been developed. By determining the susceptibility to these agents of Escherichia coli mutants lacking various iron-repressible outer membrane proteins, {{we showed that}} two of these proteins with hitherto unknown functions, Fiu and Cir, were apparently involved in the transport of monomeric catechol and its analogs. These results confirm the conclusion of Curtis and co-workers, which was obtained by using {{a different set of}} catechol-containing antibiotics (N. A. C. Curtis, R. L. Eisenstadt, S. J. East, R. J. Cornford, L. A. Walker, and A. J. White, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 32 : 1879 - 1886, 1988). E 0702 was shown to enhance the uptake of radioactive ferric iron into wild-type cells but not into cir fiu double mutants. By combining the influx of E 0702 with its hydrolysis by a periplasmic beta-lactamase, we showed that the wild-type cells transported unliganded E 0702 at a rate comparable to or even higher than the rate of transport of the E 0702 -Fe 3 + complex. We postulate that the <b>main</b> function of <b>Cir</b> and Fiu may be to recapture the hydrolytic products of enterobactin, such as 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoylserine...|$|R
