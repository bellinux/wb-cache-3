5|$|Monster Inc. is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} and markets about 6,000 products, but {{is best known}} for audio and video cables. It also produces speakers, headphones, power strips, mobile accessories and audio devices for automobiles. The company was founded by an audiophile and engineer, Noel Lee, in 1979 by experimenting with different ways to build audio cables. It grew by doing demonstrations to convince the industry that audio cables <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in audio quality and by establishing relationships with retailers that were attracted to the cable's profit margins.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Volunteers {{entered the}} 2009 season {{following}} a 2008 campaign {{that ended with}} a bowl-ineligible 5-7 record. After the 2008 season ended, Tennessee fired head coach Phillip Fulmer and replaced him with Lane Kiffin, who promised to turn the program around. Kiffin made an offseason splash by breaking the social norms among SEC head football coaches and violating a handful of NCAA rules. In a season-opening win over Western Kentucky, Kiffin appeared to have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> for Tennessee, as the Volunteers had their largest margin of victory in nine years.|$|E

5|$|When the {{projects}} begin, {{the work is}} done without machines, with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by hand from the beach. Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in a worst-case scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in their lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant {{preference for the}} letters of one's own name over {{those of the other}} person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference.</b> Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{accelerating}} change in Australia {{in the form}} of devolution of authority, democratic decision making, school accountability, and central reorganization. This paper presents findings of a study that investigated transformational and transactional conceptualizations of leadership and their usefulness in predicting school outcomes within a context of change and educational reform. Specifically, the study examined the effects of transformational and transactional leadership practices on student-performance outcomes, curriculum outcomes, teacher outcomes, and school culture. Data were derived from a survey that was administered to 291 primary teachers from 58 South Australian schools. Partial least-squares path analysis (PLSPATH) was used to develop a path model. Findings indicate that each of the leadership characteristics [...] visionary, individual consideration, collaborative problem solving, goal achievement, and ethos [...] were perceived by teachers to promote particular outcomes. Individual consideration and support and collaborative problem solving <b>made</b> <b>a</b> major <b>difference</b> to teacher outcomes, collaborative problem solving <b>made</b> <b>a</b> major <b>difference</b> to curriculum outcomes, ethos <b>made</b> <b>a</b> major <b>difference</b> to school culture, and goal achievement <b>made</b> <b>a</b> major <b>difference</b> to student performance. The data suggest that if the areas of school performance to be improved can be identified, then the leadership behaviors that are most likely to contribute to the improvement of specific outcomes can also be identified.
