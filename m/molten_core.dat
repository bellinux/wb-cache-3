5|$|Jupiter {{is thought}} to consist of a dense core {{with a mixture of}} elements, a {{surrounding}} layer of liquid metallic hydrogen with some helium, and an outer layer predominantly of molecular hydrogen. Beyond this basic outline, there is still considerable uncertainty. The core is often described as rocky, but its detailed composition is unknown, as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths (see below). In 1997, the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements, indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times that of Earth, or roughly 4%–14% of the total mass of Jupiter. The presence of a core during at least part of Jupiter's history is suggested by models of planetary formation that require the formation of a rocky or icy core massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the protosolar nebula. Assuming it did exist, it may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mixed with the <b>molten</b> <b>core</b> and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior. A core may now be entirely absent, as gravitational measurements are not yet precise enough to rule that possibility out entirely.|$|E

Both of these have since dissipated.

5000|$|Inge Lehmann [...] (13 May 1888 - 21 February 1993) was a Danish seismologist and geophysicist. In 1936, she {{discovered}} that the Earth has a solid inner <b>core</b> inside a <b>molten</b> outer <b>core.</b> Before that, seismologists believed Earth's core to be a single molten sphere, being unable, however, to explain careful measurements of seismic waves from earthquakes, which were inconsistent with this idea. Lehmann analysed the seismic wave measurements and concluded that Earth must have a solid inner <b>core</b> and a <b>molten</b> outer <b>core</b> to produce seismic waves that matched the measurements. Other seismologists tested and then accepted Lehmann's explanation. Lehmann was also the longest-lived woman scientist, having lived for over 104 years.|$|R
25|$|Dual Technique Magnetometer (MAG): The MAG is {{a direct}} sensing {{instrument}} that measures the strength {{and direction of the}} magnetic field around Saturn. The magnetic fields are generated partly by the <b>molten</b> <b>core</b> at Saturn's center. Measuring the magnetic field is one of the ways to probe the core. MAG aimed to develop a three-dimensional model of Saturn's magnetosphere, and determine the magnetic state of Titan and its atmosphere, and the icy satellites and their role in the magnetosphere of Saturn.|$|E
25|$|Mary Cartwright was a British {{mathematician}} who was {{the first}} to analyze a dynamical system with chaos. Inge Lehmann, a Danish seismologist, first suggested in 1936 that inside the Earth's <b>molten</b> <b>core</b> there may be a solid inner core. Women such as Margaret Fountaine continued to contribute detailed observations and illustrations in botany, entomology, and related observational fields. Joan Beauchamp Procter, an outstanding herpetologist, was the first woman Curator of Reptiles for the Zoological Society of London at London Zoo.|$|E
25|$|By {{proposing that}} the earth has a <b>molten</b> <b>core,</b> he {{anticipated}} modern geology. In embryology, he was a preformationist, but also proposed that organisms are {{the outcome of a}} combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers. In the life sciences and paleontology, he revealed an amazing transformist intuition, fueled by his study of comparative anatomy and fossils. One of his principal works on this subject, Protogaea, unpublished in his lifetime, has recently been published in English for the first time. He worked out a primal organismic theory. In medicine, he exhorted the physicians of his time—with some results—to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments, and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view.|$|E
50|$|Its name, S for secondary, {{comes from}} the fact that it is the second direct arrival on an {{earthquake}} seismogram, after the compressional primary wave, or P-wave, because S-waves travel slower in rock. Unlike the P-wave, the S-wave cannot travel through the <b>molten</b> outer <b>core</b> of the Earth, and this causes a shadow zone for S-waves opposite to where they originate. They can still appear in the solid inner core: when a P-wave strikes the boundary of <b>molten</b> and solid <b>cores,</b> S-waves will then propagate in the solid medium. And when the S-waves hit the boundary again they will in turn create P-waves. This property allows seismologists to determine the nature of the inner core.|$|R
25|$|The <b>molten</b> reactor <b>core</b> {{releases}} volatile {{elements and}} compounds. These may be gas phase, such as molecular iodine or noble gases, or condensed aerosol particles {{after leaving the}} high temperature region. A high proportion of aerosol particles originate from the reactor control rod materials. The gaseous compounds may be adsorbed {{on the surface of}} the aerosol particles.|$|R
50|$|Volcanoes are {{not limited}} to Earth; they can exist on any rocky planet or moon large or active enough to have a <b>molten</b> inner <b>core,</b> and since probes were first {{launched}} in the 1960s, volcanoes have been found across the solar system. Shield volcanoes and volcanic vents have been found on Mars, Venus, and Io; cryovolcanoes on Triton; and subsurface hotspots on Europa.|$|R
25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the <b>molten</b> <b>core</b> and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E
2500|$|In Minnesota, a [...] "Juicy Lucy" [...] (also spelled [...] "Jucy Lucy"), is a {{hamburger}} having cheese inside the meat patty {{rather than on}} top. A piece of cheese is surrounded by raw meat and cooked until it melts, resulting in a <b>molten</b> <b>core</b> of cheese within the patty. This scalding hot cheese tends to gush out at the first bite, so servers frequently instruct customers to let the sandwich cool {{for a few minutes}} before consumption.|$|E
2500|$|... "Low mass" [...] {{is partly}} a {{relative}} label: the Earth is low mass {{when compared to the}} Solar System's gas giants, but it is the largest, by diameter and mass, and the densest of all terrestrial bodies. It is large enough to retain an atmosphere through gravity alone and large enough that its <b>molten</b> <b>core</b> remains a heat engine, driving the diverse geology of the surface (the decay of radioactive elements within a planet's core is the other significant component of planetary heating). Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere. Thus it would be fair to infer that the lower mass limit for habitability lies somewhere between that of Mars and that of Earth or Venus: 0.3 Earth masses has been offered as a rough dividing line for habitable planets. However, a 2008 study by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics suggests that the dividing line may be higher. Earth may in fact lie on the lower boundary of habitability: if it were any smaller, plate tectonics would be impossible. Venus, which has 85% of Earth's mass, shows no signs of tectonic activity. Conversely, [...] "super-Earths", terrestrial planets with higher masses than Earth, would have higher levels of plate tectonics and thus be firmly placed in the habitable range.|$|E
40|$|It {{is usually}} {{believed}} that the geo-dynamo of the Earth or more generally of other planets, is created by the convective fluid motions inside their <b>molten</b> <b>cores.</b> An alternative to this thermal or compositional convection can however {{be found in the}} inertial waves resonances generated by the eventual precession of these planets or by the possible tidal distorsions of their liquid cores. We will review in this paper some of our experimental works devoted to the elliptical instability and present some new results when the experimental fluid is a liquid metal. We show in particular that an imposed magnetic field is distorted by the spin- over mode generated by the elliptical instability. In our experiment, the field is weak (20 Gauss) and the Lorenz force is negligible compared to the inertial forces, therefore the magnetic field does not modify the fluid flow and the pure hydrodynamics growth rates of the instability are recovered through magnetic measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} IAB iron meteorites {{is still a}} matter of debate. It is {{generally}} believed that iron meteorites originated from <b>molten</b> <b>cores</b> in small planetesimals because the fractionation trend of trace elements (e. g., Ir, Ge, Ga, etc. vs. Ni) for most iron meteorites can {{be more or less}} explained by fractional crystallization from metal melts. However, this process cannot produce trace element characteristics of the IAB (and other) iron meteorites. To explain these trace element abundance patterns, several models have been proposed. Although most of these models require a high temperature, clear evidence has recently been obtained for a sub-solidus formation of IAB iron meteorites from noble gas analyses. Moreover, heterogeneous distributions of some trace elements in metal and other phases also suggest a low temperature origin of at least some IAB iron meteorites. Here we use the carbon isotopic compositions of graphite to constrain the origin of IAB iron meteorites. Our data confirm a possible low temperature origin of IAB iron meteorites...|$|R
40|$|Various {{theories}} regarding lunar and Mercurian {{magnetic properties}} {{are discussed in}} terms of the thermal evolutions of these bodies. In particular, the extinct dynamo, the primordial field of external origin, local mechanisms, and the active dynamo hypotheses are reviewed. The theory involving magnetization by an internal dynamo is applied to Mercury, noting that it implies the existence of a <b>molten</b> metallic <b>core,</b> or shell. Possible sources of the energy required for core differentiation are discussed, including accretional heating, long-lived radioactive isotopes, and other radioactive heat sources. Thermal processes which might keep the <b>core</b> <b>molten</b> are suggested along with processes permitting the flow of heat through the mantle. Conclusions suggested by the dynamo hypothesis are reviewed in terms of current models of the thermal evolution of Mercury and the moon...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the curiosity}} {{is coming from}} how {{to bring out the}} fluidic {{capability}} of nanofluids (fluid itself) for critical heat flux (CHF) enhancement away from surface deposition effects such as improved wettability. The pool boiling characteristics of dilute dispersions of alumina and the microencapsulated C 19 H 40 phase change material (MPCM) in R- 123 were studied. Whereas other nanofluid studies only reported that a significant enhancement of CHF was achieved by buildup of a porous layer of nanoparticles on the heater surface during nucleate boiling, {{it was found that the}} additional CHF enhancement of 24 % occurred with the MPCM compared to alumina nanomaterials. With solid-liquid phase changes. PCMs in suspension delay the occurrence of CHF by absorbing heat around from the heater, nucleate bubbles and merged bubbles while PCM shells prevent leakage of <b>molten</b> <b>cores</b> and allows the return to solid with exchanges of heat at some distances.

40|$|Recently, Creaser et al., and Volkening and Heumann, have {{demonstrated}} the efficient production of large (approximately 10 exp - 11 A) ion beams by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry (NTIMS) using standard laboratory solutions of Os compounds. Horan et al., have applied NTIMS {{to a group of}} 7 IIA iron meteorites and obtained a Re-Os closure age of 4596 +/- 152 million years. The initial Os- 187 /Os- 186 ratio was 0. 8007 plus or minus 0. 0029. In addition they analyzed 3 IIIA meteorite samples which indicated an age of 4554 +/- 180 million years and Os initial of 0. 8120 +/- 0. 0075 which does not overlap with the initial for the IIA irons. We have been independently pursuing a similar program with the direct aim of determining possible variations in the initial (Os- 187) /(Os- 186) ratio or Re-Os closure age of different classes of iron meteorite. We have applied NTIMS to Os extracted from the most common group of iron meteorites the IIIAB.

40|$|Used {{nuclear fuel}} is a redox-sensitive {{semiconductor}} consisting of uranium dioxide containing a few percent of fission products {{and up to}} about one percent transuranium elements, mainly plutonium. The rapid increase in temperature in the cores of the Fukushima reactors {{was caused by the}} loss of coolant {{in the aftermath of the}} damage from the tsunami. Temperatures probably well above 2000 °C caused melting of not only the UO 2 in the fuel but also the zircaloy cladding and steel, forming a quenched melt, termed corium. Substantial amounts of volatile fission products, such as Cs and I, were released during melting, but the less volatile fission products and the actinides (probably > 99. 9 %) were incorporated into the corium as the melt cooled and was quenched. The corium still contains these radionuclides, which leads to a very large long-term radiotoxicity of the <b>molten</b> reactor <b>core.</b> The challenge for environmental scientists is to assess the long-term interactions between water and the mixture of corium and potentially still-existing unmelted fuel, particularly if the <b>molten</b> reactor <b>core</b> is left in place and covered with a sarcophagus for hundreds of years.
