40|$|ABSTRACT: Dynamical {{effects on}} the <b>mechanochemistry</b> of linear alkane chains, {{mimicking}} polyethylene, are studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Butane and octane are studied using density-functional theory (DFT), whereas higher homologues are studied using a simple one-dimensional model in which the molecules are represented by a linear chain of Morse potentials (LCM). The application of a fixed external force to a thermodynamically pre-equilibrated molecule leads to a preference for cleavage of the terminal C−C bonds, whereas a sudden application of the force favors bond breaking in {{the central part of}} the chain. In all cases, transition-state theory predicts higher bond-breaking rates than found from the more realistic molecular dynamics simulations. The event of bond dissociation is related to dynamic states involving symmetric vibrational modes. Such modes do in general have lower frequencies of vibration than antisymmetric modes, which explains the deviation between the statistical theory and the dynamics simulations. The good qualitative agreement between the DFT and LCM models makes the latter a useful tool to investigate the <b>mechanochemistry</b> of long polymer chains.

40|$|AbstractTo better {{understand}} how skeletal muscle myosin molecules move actin filaments, we determine the motion-generating biochemistry of a single myosin molecule and study how it scales with the motion-generating biochemistry of an ensemble of myosin molecules. First, by measuring the effects of various ligands (ATP, ADP, and Pi) on event lifetimes, τon, in a laser trap, we determine the biochemical kinetics underlying the stepwise movement of an actin filament generated by a single myosin molecule. Next, by measuring {{the effects of these}} same ligands on actin velocities, V, in an in vitro motility assay, we determine the biochemistry underlying the continuous movement of an actin filament generated by an ensemble of myosin molecules. The observed effects of Pi on single molecule <b>mechanochemistry</b> indicate that motion generation by a single myosin molecule is closely associated with actin-induced Pi dissociation. We obtain additional evidence for this relationship by measuring changes in single molecule <b>mechanochemistry</b> caused by a smooth muscle HMM mutation that results in a reduced Pi-release rate. In contrast, we observe that motion generation by an ensemble of myosin molecules is limited by ATP-induced actin dissociation (i. e., V varies as 1 /τon) at low [ATP], but deviates from this relationship at high [ATP]. The single-molecule data uniquely provide a direct measure of the fundamental <b>mechanochemistry</b> of the actomyosin ATPase reaction under a minimal load and serve as a clear basis for a model of ensemble motility in which actin-attached myosin molecules impose a load...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIf, {{contrary}} to conventional models of muscle, {{it is assumed}} that molecular forces equilibrate among rather than within molecular motors, an equation of state and an expression for energy output can be obtained for a near-equilibrium, coworking ensemble of molecular motors.

The free energy available for work is localized to this step, and the rate at which this free energy is transferred to work is accelerated by the free energy of a motor-catalyzed reaction.
