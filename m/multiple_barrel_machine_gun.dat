5000|$|The term [...] "Hotchkiss gun" [...] also {{refers to}} the Hotchkiss Revolving Cannon, a Gatling-type {{revolving}} <b>barrel</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> invented in 1872 by Benjamin B. Hotchkiss (1826-1885), founder of Hotchkiss & Co. It was a built-up, rifled, rapid-fire gun of oil-tempered steel, having a rectangular breechblock which moved in a mortise cut completely through the jacket. It {{was designed to be}} light enough to travel with cavalry, and had an effective range beyond that of rifled small-arms.|$|R

5000|$|After the American Civil War, the U.S. {{government}} {{showed little}} interest in funding new weapons. In 1867, Hotchkiss moved to France {{and set up a}} munitions factory, first in Viviez, near Rodez, then in Saint-Denis, near Paris, named Hotchkiss et Cie. At about this time, he developed a revolving <b>barrel</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> (in French: [...] "canon-revolver") known as the Hotchkiss gun; the gun was made in four sizes from 37 mm to 57 mm, the largest intended for naval use. After his death, the Hotchkiss company also developed in 1897 and later manufactured in large numbers an air-cooled, gas-actuated infantry <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> which was widely used by several countries, particularly France and the United States during World War I.|$|R
50|$|Water jackets {{are often}} used in watercooling. They are also used in {{laboratory}} glassware: Liebig, Graham, and Allihn condensers. Water jackets were used to cool the <b>barrels</b> of <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> {{at the time of}} the First World War, but modern <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> are air-cooled to conserve weight and hence increase portability.|$|R
50|$|Guns for Z-10 {{can also}} be mounted in the turret form, but this is limited to small caliber <b>machine</b> <b>guns.</b> The largest type of <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> that may be fitted to the Z-10 turret is a single 14.5 mm Gatling gun, while the smaller caliber 12.7 mm or 7.62 mm <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> may be mounted either in single barrel or twin barrel forms. When armed with these smaller caliber <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> the {{coverage}} is increased to 180 degrees {{as opposed to the}} 130 degrees of larger caliber autocannons. The turret is flexible enough to incorporate configurations such as a single <b>barrel</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and an automatic grenade launcher with calibers ranging from 30 mm to 40 mm, as in the AH-1 Cobra. Grenade launchers are only effective against ground targets, while <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> may be effectively used on both ground and air targets; however, the autocannon gun mounting is the primary configuration for production units.|$|R
50|$|Apollo carried two QF 6 in guns, {{one on the}} {{forecastle}} and {{the other}} on the poop and six QF 4.7-inch (120 mm) guns mounted in the waist. Four single QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns were carried in the waist, two more on the forecastle and two on the poop. Two 0.45 in Nordenfelt 5 <b>barrel</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> were mounted in the forecastle and two in the poop. One QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun was carried for use in the ship's boats, although it was provided one mount {{on each side of the}} after end of the waist. Four 14 in torpedo tube were fitted, two fixed on the stem and stern, and two broadside training tubes on the upper deck aft.|$|R
50|$|The ELC 90 {{was armed}} with a single {{low-pressure}} 90mm Mecar gun fitted {{on the right side}} of a pedestal-type turret, with a single smooth <b>barrel.</b> A co-axial <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> is mounted on the left side of the turret, and the gunner's hatch is located on the top of the turret.|$|R
50|$|While {{electric}} motors {{were used to}} rotate the Vulcan barrels, {{a few examples of}} self-operated Gatling-derived weapons use the blow-forward, recoil or gas impulse from their ammunition. The Bangerter <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> uses a blow-forward operation and is the most complex example. The Slostin <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> uses a similar operation but with gas pistons on each <b>barrels.</b> The GShG-7.62 <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and GSh-6-23, both use a more effective, simpler gas piston drive in the centre of the barrel cluster.|$|R
50|$|Water cooling is {{a method}} of heat removal from {{components}} and industrial equipment. As opposed to air cooling, water is used as the heat conductor. Water cooling is commonly used for cooling automobile internal combustion engines and large industrial facilities such as steam electric power plants, hydroelectric generators, petroleum refineries and chemical plants. Other uses include cooling the <b>barrels</b> of <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> cooling of lubricant oil in pumps; for cooling purposes in heat exchangers; cooling products from tanks or columns, and recently, cooling of various major components inside high-end personal computers. The main mechanism for water cooling is convective heat transfer.|$|R
50|$|The Belgian name Mitrailleuse d'Appui General, or {{general-purpose}} <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> (GPMG) {{became popular}} for describing medium <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> used in multiple roles. The mediums fired full-power rifle-caliber ammunition, but had some concessions for more extended firing and more general usage. This generally included both bipod and tripod/pintle mounting options and quick-change <b>barrels.</b> Water-cooled <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> {{of the same}} caliber as the existing mediums were no longer useful, as {{the situation in which}} they excelled (non-stop firing) was regarded as no longer being needed in modern warfare. This is because mass charges by infantry are rarely done, replaced by ARV-based thrusts, and that a static MG position is a high-priority target for infantry rocket launchers. Modern medium <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> do not match the sustained firing ability of many older mediums; {{there is no longer a}} need for it. Most medium <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> that use <b>barrel</b> replacement overheat after about 200 rounds, and then a quick barrel replacement is needed (such as was done on the Bren). They can only keep firing if they have spare barrels. However, barrels are expensive and heavy, so only a limited amount are kept. As a result, even if 2-3 barrels were carried and rotated in and out, it would not allow non-stop fire; the removed barrel does not cool down before the next must be replaced. This has become a moot point, since situations where non-stop fire is needed is rare, and other tactics and weapons can deal with an emergency.|$|R
50|$|Superficially, the Bailey <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> {{resembled the}} Gatling gun, as {{it also had}} <b>multiple</b> <b>barrels</b> and was hand cranked. The {{similarity}} was only superficial though, as the firing mechanism of the Bailey <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> was significantly different {{than that of the}} Gatling gun.|$|R
5000|$|Federal law defines guns {{manufactured}} in or before 1898 as [...] "antique", (27 CFR §478.11) {{and they are}} generally unregulated in federal law. They may be bought and sold across state lines without an FFL. The only exceptions are short-barreled rifles, short <b>barreled</b> shotguns, and <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> which are regulated under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Unlike C&R guns, antique guns can be re-arsenalized, sporterized, re-barreled, or re-chambered, yet they will still retain their Federally exempt status. Even if every part except the receiver is replaced, a pre-1899 firearm still qualifies as an antique. FFL holders have been directed not to enter Pre-1899 guns into their Bound Books.|$|R
5000|$|On October 6, 2014, Rathner {{announced}} {{the formation of}} the NFA Freedom Alliance (NFAFA), an organization dedicated to protecting NFA gun owners, dealers, and manufacturers interests by influencing public policy primarily through lobbying. One of the primary stated goals of the NFAFA is to enact [...] "Shall Certify" [...] legislation in all 50 states to mitigate the effects on NFA gun owners of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives 41P Proposal. NFA gun owners are defined as those who own silencers, short barreled rifles, short <b>barreled</b> shotguns and <b>machine</b> <b>guns.</b> [...] Rather talked at length in regard to the NFAFA, the organization's aims, and accomplishments on the Arizona-based Gun Freedom Radio show that aired on 06/25/16 ...|$|R
50|$|The Bailey <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> was a rapid-fire weapon {{developed}} in the late 19th century. It was a <b>multiple</b> <b>barrel</b> weapon similar to the much more commonly known Gatling gun, {{and was the first}} weapon of this type to be belt-fed. Although commonly referred to as the Bailey <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun,</b> it is technically not a <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> since it is externally powered using a hand crank. However, rapid-fire weapons of this type are commonly referred to as <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> even though this usage of the term is technically incorrect.|$|R
50|$|A rotary cannon, rotary autocannon, or Gatling-type cannon is a rapid-firing {{weapon that}} {{utilizes}} <b>multiple</b> <b>barrels</b> in a rotating cluster {{to provide a}} sustained rate of fire greater than single-barreled <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> or automatic cannon of equivalent caliber. The loading, firing, and unloading functions are performed simultaneously in different barrels as they rotate, and the rotation also permits the barrels some time to cool. The rotating barrel cluster on most Gatling-type guns is powered by an external force such as an electric motor, although gas-operated versions have also been developed.|$|R

50|$|After the Gatling gun was {{replaced}} in service by newer recoil- or gas-operated non-rotating <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> {{the approach of}} using <b>multiple</b> rotating <b>barrels</b> fell into disuse for many decades.
