This optimization method leverages multicatalog-brand effects including the utilization of prior customer ordering behavior, maximization of customer value and customer share, and economies of scale and scope in printing and mailing. This enhancement of the original DMLM-approach is called Dynamic Multidimensional Marketing (DMDM). With DMLM alone, Rhenania, a German direct mail order company, turned its catalog <b>mailing</b> <b>practices</b> around and consequently rose from the number 5 to the number 2 market position. The DMLM approach was so effective that two major competitors could be bought out. Improvements provided by DMDM were threefold: more efficient resource allocation across all catalog brands, more accurate customer microsegmentation, and more effective reactivation. Presently, the company's target is to transform single-brand customer relationships into two- or three-brand relationships with higher revenue per customer. As a consequence, the Rhenania group's performance was decoupled from the overall market trend. customer value analysis, database marketing, direct marketing, dynamic investment analysis, mail-order business, managerial decision making, Markov processes...|$|R

5000|$|Advertisers often refine direct <b>mail</b> <b>practices</b> into {{targeted}} <b>mailing,</b> {{in which}} mail is sent following database analysis to select recipients considered {{most likely to}} respond positively.

This use of database analysis is a type of database marketing. Alternatively, unaddressed direct mail may be sent on a neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood basis. Whether at the individual or neighbourhood level, direct mail marketing allows recipients to be targeted, attempting to match the demographic profile of the recipients to one most closely matching that of likely customers. Individually targeted direct mail may be tailored based on previous transactions and gathered data. For example, all male recipients of an offer may receive a personalized package with a man’s picture on the cover, while all female recipients receive a picture of a woman.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two threads in {{the history}} of mail art: a networking approach dedicated to open participation and a crafted approach dedicated to the art object. It then follows these two threads across three generations. Mail art is an international phenomenon that evolved over the past sixty odd years due to the efforts of a dedicated and growing group of individuals. American artist Ray Johnson and the international artistic group operating under the banner of Fluxus are discussed as establishing mail art as a separate form through their creation of the mail art network. The generation that followed Johnson and Fluxus expanded on the free and open ethos of the mail art network, making it a cornerstone of <b>mail</b> art <b>practice</b> and embracing new technology. Finally, this study examines work by contemporary mail artists who have not yet been historicized and who return to a craft approach in the production of mail art. Using Glenn Adamson 2 ̆ 7 s theory of craft, this thesis concludes that craft is an equally pertinent aspect of <b>mail</b> art <b>practice</b> and that, although it is underemphasized in mail art 2 ̆ 7 s first two generations, it is a dominant factor in the production of mail art today...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{audience}} members arrive {{early on the}} day of a taping, and often camp out the night before to attend. Most have already received tickets for that day's show, although some hope to get same-day tickets. Audience members are then given the iconic name tags with a temporary identification number, which is also written on the person's ticket. A Social Security Number (or some national I.D. number for non-U.S. {{audience members}}) is also required to be submitted. Audience members are eventually brought through in groups of twelve for brief interviews with the production staff. Contrary to popular belief, contestant names are not chosen at random; rather, the interviews determine possible selections for the nine contestants per taping from among the pool of approximately 325 audience members. Since 1988, the minimum age for audience members has been 18; prior to 1988, teenagers and children as young as 12 were present in the audience. With few exceptions, anyone at least 18 years old who attends a taping of the show has the potential to become a contestant. Those ineligible include current candidates for political office, employees of CBS Corporation or its affiliates, RTL Group or any firm involved in offering prizes for the show. Contestants who have appeared on a different game show within the previous year or either two other game shows or any version of The Price Is Right itself within the past ten years are also ineligible. The show's staff alerts potential contestantsin person, on the show's website and on the tickets themselvesto dress in [...] "street clothes" [...] and not to wear costumes, such as those used to attract attention on Let's Make a Deal, another show that featured contestants selected from the audience. Those who have attended tapings in June 2008 noted that producers disallowed audience members from wearing fake eyeglasses designed to look similar to those worn by Carey, a restriction that has since been relaxed. Instead, contestants will often wear shirts with hand-decorated slogans. Members of the Armed Forces are often in uniform. Cell phones, tape recorders, backpacks, price lists and portable electronic devices are not allowed in the studio. Prospective contestants obtain tickets by contacting a third-party ticketing operator via the show's website, which is promoted on-air during the broadcast. Prior to 2011, ticketing was directly through CBS, originally via mail, with online ticket access added in 2005. The <b>mail</b> <b>practice</b> ended after CBS began outsourcing ticketing to the third-party operator.|$|R

40|$|Contemporary media theory {{argues that}} {{emerging}} forms of socio-technical practice are reconfiguring {{the public and}} private spheres to produce what has been called 'public privacy' (Kitzmann, 2004; Senft, 2008; Boyd, 2010). This term gestures {{to the ways in which}} subjects use public signifying systems, such as social networking sites, to articulate highly personal messages. However, these performances are not without complexity. A recent study from Columbia University, for example, reported significant 'privacy problems' for users of Facebook, since 93 % of participants displayed information that they did not intend to disclose and 84 % of the cohort were hiding data they had wanted to share (Madejskiy et al, 2011). Rather than to suggest, as Mark Zuckerberg hyperbolically did recently, that privacy is 'dead', such evidence demonstrates that users of social networking deploy highly sophisticated and finely calibrated strategies of disclosure. Yet such rhetorical strategies are not unique to distributed digital platforms. After all, the eighteenth century epistolary network of production, often called 'The Republic of Letters', was responsible for reformulating {{the public and private}} domain (Cook, 1996; Goodman, 1994). This paper traces the historical settings of 'public privacy' across postal networks. It focuses on the ways in which these public signifying systems become the vehicle for intimate performance through the sharing of images.

Objectives: To develop a list of key questions evaluating QoL in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy (IE) and their carers. Animals: One hundred fifty-nine dogs with IE. Methods: Cross-sectional study. An online project questionnaire was developed containing 90 QoL-associated questions that were initially allocated to 14 themes representing specific areas associated with the treatment and care of an epileptic dog. Principal component analysis was applied with the aim of refining the questionnaire to the least number of questions representing useful themes without loss of descriptive value. Carers were recruited by paper <b>mail,</b> primary <b>practices,</b> and canine epilepsy websites. Data were acquired from January to November 2011. Results: Principal component analysis removed 54 questions, leaving 7 themes with 36 questions with a minimum Cronbach's alpha value of 0. 7 indicating a good internal consistency: “Seizure severity and frequency”, “Adverse effects of antiepileptic drug (AED) ”, “Restrictions on the carer's life”, “Frustrations over caring for a dog with IE”, “Carer distaste of AED adverse effects”, “Carer anxiety around the seizure event”, “Perceptions on rectal diazepam use”.

40|$|Abstract Background Sample {{sizes for}} {{obstetrical}} trials are {{often based on}} the opinion of investigators about clinically important effect size. We surveyed Canadian obstetricians to investigate clinically important effect sizes required before introducing new treatments into practice to prevent preterm birth. Methods Questionnaires were <b>mailed</b> to <b>practicing</b> obstetricians, asking the magnitude of pregnancy prolongation required to introduce treatments into practice. The three prophylactic treatments were of increasing invasiveness: vaginal progesterone, intramuscular progesterone, and cervical cerclage. We also asked about the perceived most relevant outcome measures for obstetrical trials and current obstetrical practice in preterm birth prevention. Results 544 / 1293 (42. 1 %) completed questionnaires were received. The majority of respondents required one or two weeks' increase in length of gestation before introducing vaginal (372, 77. 1 %), and intramuscular progesterone(354, 67. 9 %). At least three weeks increase was required before introducing prophylactic cervical cerclage(326, 62. 8 %). Clinicians who already used a treatment required a smaller difference before introducing it into practice. Decreasing neonatal morbidity was cited {{as the most important}} outcome for obstetrical trials (349, 72. 2 %). Conclusion Obstetricians would require a larger increase in treatment effect before introducing more invasive treatments into practice. Although infant morbidity was perceived as a more important outcome, clinicians appeared willing to change practice on the basis of prolongation of pregnancy, a surrogate outcome. We found {{that there is not a}} single minimum clinically important treatment effect that will influence all practising clinicians: rather the effect size that will influence physicians is affected by the nature of the treatment, the reported outcome measure and the clinician's own current clinical practice. </p...|$|R
