Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium <b>metavanadate.</b> This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5).

Rb 2 Zn(VO 3) 4 has been prepared by solid-state reaction (350 C) between presynthesized RbVO 3 and ZnV 2 O 6 powders, and Cs 2 Zn(VO 3) 4 has been prepared by the Pechini method (sol-gel process). Both <b>metavanadates</b> crystallize in monoclinic symmetry (sp. gr. P 21 /m). Thermochemical characterization results demonstrate that the vanadates undergo complex transformations during heating to 450 C and subsequent cooling. As a result, the materials are in a nonequilibrium state at room temperature and consist of both the parent double <b>metavanadates</b> and their peritectic decomposition products. We believe that {{the formation of the}} structure of the M 2 Zn(VO 3) 4 compounds from their melts is a kinetically hindered process. These compounds are structurally stable only at temperatures below 369 (Rb 2 Zn(VO 3) 4) or 420 C (Cs 2 Zn(VO 3) 4). We have measured for the first time the diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence excitation spectra of the two tetrametavanadates in their emission range and their photoluminescence spectra at various excitation wavelengths and determined their chromaticity coordinates. Their X-ray luminescence and scintillation decay characteristics have been determined for the first time under pulsed electron beam excitation. The electron excitation dissipation processes in the cesium and rubidium compounds are shown to be similar.

Additionally, in vitro studies have shown that mitochondrial depolarization (IC 50, 40 nM) and oxygen consumption (IC 50, 99 nM) are strongly affected by decavanadate, which causes reduction of cytochrome b (complex III).

40|$|This work {{contributes}} {{to the establishment of}} a scientific basis for the understanding of the effect of shaping on the physicochemical properties and functionalities of catalytic powders. In particular, the influence of graphite (G) as a shaping agent for vanadium–aluminum mixed (hydr) oxides, VAlO, is presented herein. Graphite was added in different loadings (x = 1, 3, and 7 wt %). VAlO-xG hydroxides were tableted and then calcined as to obtain VAlO-xG mixed oxides. Both series of materials were characterized and tested in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). Correlation of X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and Raman data permitted establishing that VAlO-xG hydroxides are constituted by graphite particles physically attached to the amorphous VAlO structure. The VAlO hydroxide structure was found to be composed of Al(OH) 3 and AlOOH linked to decavanadates-, <b>metavanadates,</b> and isolated or cluster vanadyl V═O species. Calcination of VAlO-xG caused further polymerization of vanadium species into decavanate chains and V 2 O 5 -like structures connected to a γ-Al 2 O 3 -like matrix. Though graphite was not incorporated into the structure of VAlO, XPS analysis showed that it actively interacts with the VAlO surface. Such interaction favored propylene selectivity in ODH. Particularly, graphite containing VAlO-xG displayed higher production of propene over COx at high propane conversion. On the other hand, though graphite boosts the mechanical resistance of the VAlO-xG tablets, the surface area of the materials, as determined by the application of χ-theory, was found to significantly decrease after shaping and further calcination. This trend was explained considering pore widening during tableting. Finally, characterization performed on particles recovered from crushed VAlO-xG tablets showed that graphite particles were randomly distributed within the shaped catalysts...|$|R

Ammonium <b>metavanadate</b> in the dose- range 0 - 6 mg/kg caused a bi-phasic and time-dependent response on the acid (total and prostate) phosphatase [...] Furthermore ammonium <b>metavanadate</b> caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the serum alkaline phosphatases. The maximal inhibitory response at 5 mg/kg of ammonium <b>metavanadate</b> was 40. 0 ± 1. 69 compared to 65. 0 ± 0. 94 control values. Ammonium <b>metavanadate</b> also caused a positively correlated biphasic {{response in the}} serum female hormonal concentrations with an initial increase, followed by a time-dependent decrease in the serum values of luteinizing (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin. Furthermore ammonium <b>metavanadate</b> also caused time- and dose- dependent effects on the haematological parameters. The effects were biphasic-increase within 72 hours {{and a reduction in}} the values of haemoglobin and packed cell volume within 7 - 28 days. The white blood count and lymphocyte counts were also reduced significantly at P ≤ 0. 05. However the neutrophil counts were increased dose- and time-dependently. Finally, ammonium <b>metavanadate</b> caused a dose-dependent destruction of the liver and female reproductive organs namely the uterus, ovary and fallopian tubes.

40|$|The {{sodium salt}} {{roasting}} process was widely used for extracting vanadium {{due to its}} high yield rate of vanadium. However, the serious pollution was a problem.

Focusing on the calcium <b>metavanadate</b> produced in the calcium roasting process of vanadium minerals, the mechanism of the carbonate leaching for calcium <b>metavanadate</b> and its leaching kinetics of calcium <b>metavanadate</b> were studied. With the increase of the leaching agent content, the decrease of the particle size, the increase of the temperature and the increase of the reaction time, the leaching rate of vanadium increased, and the constant of reaction rate increased.

The rate of attack was found to be quite sensitive to the mole fraction of vanadate in the molten salt solution and the partial pressure of sulfur trioxide in equilibrium with the salt melt. The observed parabolic rate of attack is interpreted to be caused by a reaction controlled by diffusion in the salt that penetrates into the porous layer formed by the destabilization. The parabolic rate constant in mixed sodium <b>metavanadate</b> - sodium sulfate melts was found to be proportional to the SO 3 partial pressure and the square of the <b>metavanadate</b> concentration. In-situ Raman spectroscopic measurements allowed simultaneous observations of the ceramic phases and salt chemistry during the attack process...|$|E

In titrimetry, aq. soln. acidified with H 2 SO 4 and contg. 3 - 10 mg of drug {{is treated}} with a known excess of <b>metavanadate</b> and the excess of the oxidant is back titrated with Mohr's salt soln. using N-Ph anthranilic acid as indicator. The spectrophotometric method is also based on the oxidn. of the drug by a known excess of <b>metavanadate</b> in H 2 SO 4 followed by the estn. of unreacted oxidant by reacting with diphenylamine. The reacted <b>metavanadate</b> amt. corresponds to the drug content. The oxidn. reaction used for titrimetry proceeds at 303 Â± 2 K with a molar ratio of 1 : 3 (drug:oxidant). The colored species used for spectrophotometric detn. shows the absorption max. at 560 nm. Beer's law is obeyed over the concn. range 0. 00 - 4. 00 Î¼g ml- 1 the molar absorptivity and Sandell sensitivity of the system being 5. 33 Ã� 104 1 mol- 1 cm- 1 and 5. 56 ng cm- 2, resp. The limits of detection and quantification were 0. 082 and 0. 275 Î¼g mL- 1, resp. Both methods were applied to the detn. of propranolol in tablets {{and the results were}} statistically evaluated.
