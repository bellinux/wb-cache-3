500|$|Ogre called {{style of}} the music on Mythmaker [...] "simplified" [...] and said the band [...] "stayed truer to cEvin's compositions". [...] He {{continued}} that the album had a new sound, but also retained elements of the [...] "archetypal" [...] Skinny Puppy sound, and the production was superior to previous albums. [...] Key stated that he would write songs, and then send them to Mark Walk, who would make changes and send them back. [...] Key said that it [...] "open a door for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it differently". Ogre said that album's themes were control and mythology.|$|E
500|$|Late in his life, Alf wrote a {{manuscript}} detailing {{his life story}} which he bequeathed to John. It was Alf's attempt {{to fill in the}} lost years when he had not been in contact with his son, and to explain that it was Julia, and not Alf, who had broken up their marriage. John later commented: [...] "You know, all he wanted was for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> his side of the story, which I hadn't heard." [...] By 1976, Alfred was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer and Pauline contacted John via Apple Corps {{to make sure that he}} was aware that his father was dying. John sent a large bouquet of flowers to the hospital and phoned Alf on his deathbed, apologising for his (John's) past behaviour. On 1 April 1976, Alf Lennon died in Brighton.|$|E

500|$|Handel's {{decision}} {{to give a}} season of concerts in Dublin {{in the winter of}} 1741â€“42 arose from an invitation from the Duke of Devonshire, then serving as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. A violinist friend of Handel's, Matthew Dubourg, was in Dublin as the Lord Lieutenant's bandmaster; he would look after the tour's orchestral requirements. [...] Whether Handel originally intended to perform Messiah in Dublin is uncertain; he did not inform Jennens of any such plan, for the latter wrote to Holdsworth on 2 December 1741: [...] "...it was some mortification to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that instead of performing Messiah here he has gone into Ireland with it." [...] After arriving in Dublin on 18 November 1741, Handel arranged [...] a subscription series of six concerts, to be held between December 1741 and [...] February 1742 at the Great Music Hall, Fishamble Street. These concerts were so popular that a second series was quickly arranged; Messiah figured in neither [...] series.|$|E
500|$|In June 1911 Heseltine {{learned that}} Thomas Beecham was {{to conduct an}} all-Delius concert at London's Queen's Hall on the 16th of that month, at which the {{composer}} would be present, and his Songs of Sunset would be given its first performance. Colin Taylor, a sympathetic Eton piano tutor, secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event. Prior to this, his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home; as a consequence, during the concert intermission Heseltine {{was introduced to the}} composer. The next day he wrote Delius a long appreciative letter: [...] "I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it was to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> such perfect performances of such perfect music". He told his mother that [...] "Friday evening was the most perfectly happy evening I have ever spent, and I shall never forget it". Delius became the first strong formative influence of Heseltine's compositional career, and although the initial adulation was later modified, a friendship began that would largely endure for the remainder of Heseltine's life.|$|E
500|$|During the {{non-stop}} {{protests in}} Ottawa, Lawrence Cannon requested the Government of Sri Lanka {{for an immediate}} ceasefire. He also rejected calls from the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Canada to stop all protests in Ottawa. Cannon condemned the LTTE for preventing civilians from leaving areas being attacked and using them as human shields. Bev Oda and the Conservative Party of Canada both condemned the use of LTTE flags, insisting that they symbolize connection with a terrorist organization. David Miller and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty also condemned the Gardiner Expressway blockade. Liberal Party of Canada leader Michael Ignatieff had made statements on the protests in a few occasions. Ignatieff urged the Harper government to break its silence and take initiative in condemning the violence. He stated {{that there are no}} military solutions to the conflict and that the war must stop under a worldwide initiative and internationally coordinated diplomatic strategy. On 21 April, Ignatieff met with a few Tamil leaders in Ottawa to discuss the humanitarian crisis. On the occasion, he said the following: [...] "I am deeply concerned about escalating violence in Sri Lanka, and the resulting deaths of thousands of civilians. It was important for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from Tamil Canadians, whose family and friends in Sri Lanka are suffering first hand from this crisis. We cannot sit back and watch as thousands of innocent lives are lost in the cross-fire, and we condemn any attempt to use civilians as human shields." ...|$|E

2500|$|Saccharin was {{produced}} first in 1879, by Constantin Fahlberg, a chemist working on coal tar derivatives in Ira Remsen's laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University. Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste {{on his hand}} one evening, and connected this with the compound benzoic sulfimide on {{which he had been}} working that day. Fahlberg and Remsen published articles on benzoic sulfimide in 1879 and 1880. In 1884, then working on his own in New York City, Fahlberg applied for patents in several countries, describing methods of producing this substance that he named saccharin. Two years later, he began production of the substance in a factory in a suburb of Magdeburg, Germany. [...] Fahlberg would soon grow wealthy, while Remsen merely grew irritated, believing he deserved credit for substances produced in his laboratory. On the matter, Remsen commented, [...] "Fahlberg is a scoundrel. It nauseates <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> my name mentioned in the same breath with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this reminds me of my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the podium}} {{ceremony}} following the race, Rosberg was booed by the crowd, mirroring a similar incident towards {{him at the}} previous race in Belgium. Hamilton later told the press {{that he did not}} feel comfortable about the fans behaving in such a manner: [...] "I've had it here, years and years ago, and it's great personally for me to have such great support, from the Ferrari fans and the Mercedes fans. But when I was up there, it was awkward for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> them booing Nico because I just don't like that in sport." [...] Wolff affirmed that booing should not be heard on the podium but acknowledged Formula One is an emotional sport for its fan base while also saying: [...] "It's a sport and sport should unite." [...] When asked about the booing in the press conference, Rosberg replied while it was [...] "not nice" [...] he hoped over time the fans would forgive him for his past actions. In the podium interviews, conducted by former driver Jean Alesi, Massa expressed his happiness on standing on the podium and was certain luck was beside him and that there was [...] "a lot more to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving in}} the Royal Navy, Guinness had planned to become an Anglican priest. In 1954, while he was filming Father Brown in Burgundy, Guinness, who was in costume as a Catholic priest, was mistaken for a real priest by a local child. Guinness was far from fluent in French, and the child {{apparently}} did not notice that Guinness did not understand him but {{took his hand and}} chattered while the two strolled; the child then waved and trotted off. The confidence and affection the clerical attire appeared to inspire in the boy left a deep impression on the actor. When their son was ill with polio at the age of 11, Guinness began visiting a church to pray. A few years later in 1956, Guinness converted to the Roman Catholic Church. His wife, who was of paternal Sephardi Jewish descent, followed suit in 1957 while he was in Sri Lanka filming The Bridge on the River Kwai, and she informed him only after the event. Every morning, Guinness recited a verse from Psalm 143, [...] "Cause <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> your loving kindness in the morning".|$|E
