5000|$|Beginning in February 1969, Chemical Waste Storage and Disposition, a Beaverton company, stored roughly 25,000 55-gallon drums of {{chemical}} waste near {{the shore of}} the playa with a permit from the Oregon Department of Agriculture. The drums contained pesticides including 2,4-D and MCPA herbicide residue containing chlorophenols, polymeric chlorophenoxyphenols and dioxins/furans (including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin); <b>metallic</b> <b>chloride</b> waste, and paints and paint solvent. Chemical Waste Storage was contracted for waste disposal by the Chipman division of Rhodia, a Portland herbicide manufacturer, and by Oregon Metallurgical Corporation, a titanium producer. Further shipments were prohibited in 1971, due to improper waste handling practices. [...] The State of Oregon took over the site in 1974, after losing legal actions against Chemical Waste Storage to force their compliance with new hazardous waste laws. [...] First the Circuit Court and then the Court of Appeals determined that the company was financially unable to comply with the new regulations and that the State was to some extent complicit. [...] In 1976, at a cost of $84,000, the state used bulldozers to push, crush and compact the leaking barrels into a dozen shallow, unlined, 400' long trenches, then covered them with soil.|$|E

Coriandrum sativum and M. oleifera have polyphenolic groups that can reduce the <b>metallic</b> <b>chloride</b> salts into metallic oxides and precipitate as nano particles {{with the increase of}} pH by NaOH. Phenolic groups on donating the OH− to the solution catalyze the reduction of metallic salts into metallic hydroxides which on further condensation forms the metallic oxide nanoparticles [24, 25]. The color change from crimson red to blackish red precipitate marked the formation of ferric nano particles while the pale green precipitate marked the formation of magnesium oxide nanoparticles, both surface amended with plant extracts respectively.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} air blowing on paving grade vacuum residue to produce high {{softening}} point industrial grade asphalt {{have been studied}} in a gas-liquid reactor. Factors such as reactor design, temperature, air flow rate and time were investigated. Response of different feedstock sot <b>metallic</b> <b>chloride</b> catalysts were examined. The course of reaction was followed by measuring penetration and softening point of the blown product at regular intervals. It {{was found that the}} catalytic activity of <b>metallic</b> <b>chloride</b> could be enhanced by combining the chloride with manganese dioxide. Quantity of chloride catalyst, the amount of blown distillate and acidic gases are considerably reduced, by the addition of manganese dioxide for a given degree of hardness of the blown product. Chemical changes occurring during asphalt air blowing has been evaluated by adsorption-adsorption chromatography. The amount of asphaltene increases at the expense of saturate, namphthene aromatic and polar aromatic. Identical fractional chemical composition of different asphalts results in identical penetration and softening point. However, high molecular weight hydrocarbons may also be connected with hardening of asphalt. N. m. r. studies show transformation of straight chain hydrocarbons to cyloparaffins which in turn, are dehydrogenated to form aromatic hydrocarbons during air blowing. Dehydrogenation of asphalt molecules is supported by elemental analysed. U. v spectra show the formation of polycondensed aromatic, while f. t. i. r. spectra indicate incorporation of oxygen and cross linking in blown asphalt. Structural characterization of asphalt by instrumental methods, suggest that the blown product becomes more complex and condensed leading to increase in molecular weight. These changes are accelerated by active catalysts. The air blowing induces a movement of components from non-polar to more polar fractions. A general transformation mechanism has been proposed. Quantity and characteristics of the effluents {{have been found to be}} dependent on the chemical nature and physical properties of feed as well as on the catalyst used...|$|E
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium model {{was used to}} determine the major species of chromium, lead, cadmium, copper, and zinc formed under various incineration conditions. The effects of temperature and oxygen, chlorine, sulfur, and hydrogen content on the speciation were established by the minimum Gibbs free energy method. Sixty-seven compounds of five metallic species were determined in this study. The simulation conditions included: 1) single metal with oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur system; 2) different chlorine and hydrogen content; and 3) comparisons of a single combustion chamber and a two-stage combustion chamber. The simulation results indicated that the oxides were the dominant forms in a single metal-oxygen system, while the <b>metallic</b> <b>chlorides</b> were the major species in a metal-chlorine-oxygen system. When sulfur was present, in the case of all metals other than Pb, the metallic sulfates were the major species at temperatures below 1000 K, and metallic oxides were the dominant species above 1000 K. Increasing the temperatures caused a decrease of lead chloride, but increased the formation of other <b>metallic</b> <b>chlorides.</b> The concentrations of <b>metallic</b> <b>chlorides</b> decreased significantly as the hydrogen moles were 2 similar to 3 orders higher than those of chlorine. The level of difference between one-stage and two-stage simulations depends on the species formed in the one-stage simulation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{current work}} was {{performed}} to relate the waste composition and operating temperature to the metal partition in the sand bed, the fly ash and in the gas phase by conditioning an indicating experiment (1) the organic chloride (PVC) additive, (2) inorganic chloride (NaCl) additive and (3) NaNO 3 and PVC additives, under various operating temperatures. Furthermore, the fly ash was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to identify the metallic compound for understating the mechanism of metal partition. The findings indicated that when the feedstock contains organic <b>chloride</b> (PVC), the <b>metallic</b> <b>chlorides</b> of lead and cadmium were the major compounds under XRD analysis results. The <b>metallic</b> <b>chlorides</b> decrease the absorption efficiency of heavy metals in the sand bed and increase that in the fly ash.

40|$|High {{chloride}} concentrations {{are normally}} found in municipal waste. Most chloride resources are originally derived from organic chlorides, e. g., PVC and inorganic chlorides, or chloride salt from kitchen waste. Heavy metals can easily react with chlorides during incineration, thus, producing related metallic chlorides. These factors make the combustion products more complicated (such as <b>metallic</b> <b>chloride,</b> metallic oxide, or heavy metal). This study evaluates {{the effects of}} operating conditions on the stability of heavy metals (Pb, Cd and Cr) in bottom ash and fly ash. The parameters evaluated include (1) the additives of inorganic chloride (CaCl 2 and NaCl) and organic chloride (PVC), and (2) various operating temperatures. The experimental results indicate that adding organic chloride (PVC) increased the leaching rates of Cr, Pb and Cd in bottom ash, but decreased this rate in fly ash. The addition of sodium chloride (NaCl) increased the leaching rates of the three metals in fly ash, but only Cr and Cd increased in bottom ash. The other inorganic chloride (CaCl 2) increased the leaching rate of Cr in bottom ash and fly ash, but for Pb and Cd decrease. In addition, the TCLP leaching rates of these three metals {{did not have an}} obvious relation between the total amount of original metals existed in bottom ash and fly ash and operating temperatures of incinerator, but did relate to the chemical species of the formed products.

40|$|International audienceTreatment of {{polluted}} {{industrial wastes}} {{is one of}} the challenging research topics that occupy an important position in various chemical processes. Among the various types of processes which can be used for treating aqueous wastes polluted with organic matter, the biological and chemical treatments, as well as the incineration are the most commonly used techniques. Each of the mentioned techniques can be used separately or combined with other procedures in order to optimise the global operating conditions. The choice of the process depends upon the nature of the waste and its final destination. Although, the operating cost is an important factor which determines the possibility to exploit the process in large scale. Wet air oxidation is a destructive technology based upon the oxidation of organic and inorganic pollutants in aqueous solutions. The system uses molecular oxygen or air as a potential source of oxidant. Wet air oxidation can be either a non-catalysed process or can occur in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. Destruction of Methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (MTBE) is a research subject of growing concern since the recognition of this compound as an environmental pollutant. MTBE is commonly added to gasoline as an octane enhancer and has been used for the last two decades. It is highly soluble in water and transports easily in ground and surface water. As a result, it is found frequently in groundwater and some surface water. We have focused our research on the catalytic decomposition of this compound using a wet air oxidation process. Some typical results are presented, pointing out the most important parameters of the process and showing the specific behaviour of a Ruthenium/Cerium catalyst during the oxidation of MTBE. The main part of the process consists of one fixed bed tubular reactor centred in an electrical automated oven. The substrate mixed to pure oxygen is oxidised over the catalyst bed and the emergent effluent is therefore cooled into a condenser thus liquid and gas phases could be separated hereafter. Catalysts are prepared by co-impregnation process of <b>metallic</b> <b>chloride</b> precursors (RuCl 3. H 2 O and CeCl 3. 7 H 2 O) onto commercial alumina (Merck-Prolabo; BET = 331 m²/g) support commonly used in the industrial catalytic processes. Therefore, catalysts are calcinated at 450 °C under airflow in order to remove impurities at the surface, then reduced at the same temperature under pure hydrogen flow for 3 hours. Feed solution of MTBE giving 2500 ppm of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) was prepared in distilled water. The oxidation runs have been carried out at 150 °C under 2 bar of pure oxygen pressure during 3 hours. The catalyst presenting 3 % of Cerium concentration showed the best result regarding the abatement of COD and TOC (Total Organic Carbon). Higher concentrations of cerium have negative effects on the oxidation reaction. This could be explained by the presence of chlorine which inhibits the active metallic sites. AOSC (Average Oxidation State of Carbon) has been calculated according to the measured COD and TOC values. Here again, the optimal oxidation state was obtained with the catalyst of 3 % of Cerium concentration...|$|E

Chemical composition of oxide scales and scale morphologies were determined by means of X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopic studies. The oxide scales of KCl- and K 2 CO 3 - coated alloys showed complex microstructures and compositions. This behaviour was ascribed to the release of volatile <b>metallic</b> <b>chlorides,</b> evolution of CO/CO 2 gas as well as formation of fluxing products.

40|$|Benefiting {{from good}} {{specific}} mechanical properties, exceptional oxidation resistance, and high temperature capability, Titanium Alloys {{are used in}} Gas Turbine Engines, especially {{in the early stages}} of the compressor. However they are subject to stresscorrosion cracking in the laboratory when subjected to stresses and contaminated with salts at elevated temperatures. The lack of in-service failures of titanium components due to Hot-Salt Stress-Corrosion Cracking (HSSCC) is not yet understood. The parameters influencing the HSSCC of titanium alloys (temperature, load, stress and temperature cycling, quantity and kind of salt, air velocity, water vapour or oxygen content of the atmosphere, composition, texture, and microstructure of the alloy, surtace conditions), cannot account for the lack of in-service failure. After an examination of the service conditions within a typical gas turbine engine compressor, it was considered that the high pressures prevailing may extend the life of titanium alloys subjected to HSSCC. This work used a unique high temperature, high pressure, servo-hydraulic facility in order to carry out hot-salt stress-corrosion testing on titanium alloy 1 M! 834 at high pressure. The results obtained show that high oxygen partial pressures extend significantly the life of 1 M! 834 subjected to HSSCC. Continuous thermogravimetric measurements both in oxidising and salt-corroding environments were carried out to study the kinetics of the hot-salt attack of IMI 834. Basic metallography revealed the formation of channels which extend deep into the metal during the initial stages of hot-salt-corrosion. Theoretical thermodynamic studies highlighted the role of alloying elements and vapour phase <b>metallic</b> <b>chlorides</b> in the mechanisms of the HSSCC of titanium alloys. A new model for the hot-salt stress-corrosion of titanium alloys is proposed. It is based on the establishment of a self sustaining cycle where vapour phase <b>metallic</b> <b>chlorides</b> act as hydrogen carriers and can diffuse quickly into the material through channels...|$|R

Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy also confirmed the standard ZnO profiles at lower doping ratios but additional phases at higher doping.

40|$|The {{differential}} {{capacity of}} a number of tenth-normal queous olutions of <b>metallic</b> <b>chlorides</b> has been measured as a function of potential.

New explanations are given for several well-known phenomena connected with the double layer. The surface charge density and integral capacity of the non-diffuse part of the electrical double layer have been calculated from these data. The ratios of the differential capacities have been found to approach unity at potentials where the concentration of cations within the double layer is at a minimum.

40|$|The {{agglomeration}} {{that occurs}} in a fluidized bed incineration system results in the unexpected shutdown {{of the system and}} causes secondary polluants such as heavy metal to be generated. Addition of Al and Ca-based additives is an efficient method to control the particle agglomeration. However, emission behavior of heavy metals in inciricration processes could be influenced by the addition of agglomeration inhibitors due to both chemical reaction with metals and the fluidization behavior being changed. Accordingly, the aim {{of this study is to}} show the emission characteristies of heavy metals (Pb, Cr, and Cd) under various waste compositions (Cl and S) and the addition of agglomeration inhibitors (Al and Ca) during the defluidization process. A thermodynamic equilibrium simulation wits used to predict heavy metal formation and to compare the experimental results. The results showed that the emission concentration of heavy metals increased as a result of the reduction of combustion efficiency caused by Al and Ca during agglomeration inhibition processes. In particular, the heavy metal Cr vaporized easily at the initial stage of the defluidization process, indicating that the chemical reactions changed between Na and Cr by adding At into the system at high temperature. The different affinities of both Al and Cr reacting with Na in the fluidized bed were considered the main reason for the Cr emission. Oil the other hand, when the wastes contained Cl, the emission concentration of heavy metals increased because of the formation of low-boiling point <b>metallic</b> <b>chlorides.</b> The addition of Na caused. bed agglomeration and decreased the emission of Cd and Cr, compared to when Cl was added. However, Cl was the dominant factor on heavy metal Pb. The emission concentration of heavy metals also decreased evidently when both Na and S were added during defluidization. The formation of high-boiling point sulfates was observed on the surface of the sand bed while heat energy accumulated during defluidization by Na.

Neither an adequate type of coagulant nor an optimal dose could be found. The removal of contaminants was measured as total and dissolved chemical oxygen demand (COD). Soluble COD removal efficiencies were low, from 0 to 47 %, with a 4 % average value only. These low values of organic material removal were attributed to the particular characteristics of the Merida landfill leachate (low suspended solids concentra-tion), so even with sweep-floc coagulation (300 mg L– 1 dose) only low COD removal efficiencies were obtained.
