40|$|Abstract-A fixture is a {{work holding}} device which holds and {{positions}} the work, but does not in itself guide, locate or position the cutting tool. The milling fixtures so far are generally used on milling machines. The present volume of this paper includes the unique aspect of designing of a 4 axis – 360 o indexing <b>milling</b> <b>fixture</b> for CNC. This fixture provides locating and clamping provisions for as large as 28 numbers of operations to be performed on support plate, one {{of the components of}} color mixing machine. The real time application of the research reflects from the fact that a real industrial component is taken for fixture designing. The designed fixture has the important characteristic of allowing all 28 operations to be performed on component in a single set up. Time estimation sheet for each operation is included, which also covers the details of type of tool & inserts to be used with data of cutting speed, spindle speed, feed & no. of passes required to accomplish the operations. 3 D exploded view of fixture in addition to 2 D & 3 D drawings of component and fixture using Pro/Engineer are also included. Index terms- 28 operations, 4 axis – 360 o indexing <b>milling</b> <b>fixture,</b> adjustable clamping lever, CNC I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the machinability of a novel composite material which is textile fabric reinforced composite. In this study, four different cutting tools with different geometries were used {{due to the lack}} of information on tool selection for thermoplastic matrix composites. During machining of this novel composite, the fixture design is essential due to the very low elastic modulus of composite plates about 0. 5 GPa. After designing special <b>milling</b> <b>fixture,</b> tests were performed in two limit values of cutting parameters, cutting speed and feed rate. Cutting force results, chip and burr formation were evaluated to determine suitable tool and cutting parameter selection...|$|E
50|$|Fixtures {{are usually}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} machine {{for which they were}} designed. The most common two are <b>milling</b> <b>fixtures</b> and drill fixtures.|$|R
50|$|Drilling {{fixtures}} cover a {{wider range}} of different designs and procedures than <b>milling</b> <b>fixtures.</b> Though workholding for drills is more often provided by jigs, fixtures are also used for drilling operations.|$|R
50|$|Milling {{operations}} tend {{to involve}} large, straight cuts that produce lots of chips and involve varying force. Locating and supporting areas must usually be large and very sturdy {{in order to}} accommodate milling operations; strong clamps are also a requirement. Due to the vibration of the machine, positive stops are preferred over friction for securing the workpiece. For high-volume automated processes, <b>milling</b> <b>fixtures</b> usually involve hydraulic or pneumatic clamps.|$|R
50|$|Tool making {{typically}} means making tooling used {{to produce}} products. Common tooling includes metal forming rolls, cutting tools (such as tool bits and <b>milling</b> cutters), <b>fixtures,</b> or even whole machine tools used to manufacture, hold, or test products during their fabrication. Due to the unique nature of a tool maker's work, it is often necessary to fabricate custom tools or modify standard tools.|$|R

5|$|Mills captained the Leicester {{team that}} reached the First Division play-offs in 1992–93 with a sixth place league finish, and they beat Portsmouth 3–2 on {{aggregate}} in the semi-final. However, they {{lost in the}} final for the second successive season, being beaten 4–3 by Swindon Town at Wembley Stadium. He made 53 appearances this season, missing only three of Leicester's <b>fixtures.</b> <b>Mills</b> featured regularly in 1993–94 before missing {{the last few months}} of the season with a foot injury, having made 25 appearances by then. By finishing fourth in the table Leicester made the First Division play-offs for the third successive season, and Mills led the team out before the final despite being unable to play. Leicester beat Derby County 2–1 and thus earned promotion to the Premier League.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that slender rod {{machining}} operation is a very difficult problem due to its low stiffness. During slender rod machining process, the deflection, vibration, cutting heat and cutting force of the machined part are the main reasons affecting the product quality. Based on the analysis of current research status of slender rod milling technology, process scheme, <b>milling</b> strategy, clamping <b>fixture</b> and tool designing is carried out in this work. In a roughing milling stage, we create a new strategy of square rod milling, called “equilateral milling strategy ” to eliminating deflection. In finish-milling top waveform stage, a way using semicircle profile cutter to finish was applied. Complex interpolated movement is transform into simple two-dimension curved movement to shorten machine time and increase of efficiency in the way. In addition, machined surface with burnishing effect, high precision and high surface quality is obtained...|$|R
40|$|In {{this modern}} period, {{the world of}} industri has an {{important}} role fore life. All companies in the world compete to increase the efficiencies in order to endure the existence {{in the field of}} difficult competition. Job shop is one of the production systems that is used by industries which the basis of make to orde. In the job shop system sometime there is a waste such as a waiting time of product and transportation because the work thing (product) has been to delivered from the first department (machine) to the other department. To less a waste that happen at the time, it iscreated a fixture which is aplied for a turning machine, so the turning machine has a base role as a <b>milling</b> machine. The <b>fixture</b> that is called jig clamping is created in order to able to clamp diameter 15 – 55 mm. This creating process is made from two kinds of prototipes, namely: analytical prototipe and physical prototipe. Analytical prototipe is made by using software solid works,physical prototipe is made by using material SS 41 that purpose to press the material cost. To know whether the tool can work or not and answer the question how big the efficiency that is given, so it has been done an accuracy examination, an efficiency and a surface roughness examination. Based on the examination has been done, jig clamping proves that able to create a good product in more efficiency time than the old way, eventhough the quality of the surface is not yet good...|$|R
