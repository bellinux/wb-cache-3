40|$|The {{assumption}} that female <b>manic-depressives</b> have similar personality characteristics to those reported for male <b>manic-depressives</b> was tested. Besides using previously employed self-report measures from which personality attributes related to conformity and value achievement have been inferred, a peer conformity experiment was carried out. 16 remitted female manicdepressives were matched with 16 nonpsychiatric controls. The {{groups did not}} differ on the self-report personality measures. Experimental conformity scores were analyzed as a function of direction and intensity of confederate endorsement of authoritarian statements. <b>Manic-depressives</b> were generally less conforming than controls (p <. 01). Endorsement conditions yielded varying amounts of conformity, with extremely positive confederate endorsement evoking significant anticonformity in remitted <b>manic-depressives.</b> Previous studies of remitted male manicdepressives and nonpsychotic female cyclothymics have tested clinically derived hypothese...|$|R

He then tested lithium on himself, before using it to treat recurrent mania. The introduction of lithium revolutionized the treatment of <b>manic-depressives</b> by the 1970s.

25|$|Particularly strong links {{have been}} {{identified}} between creativity and mood disorders, particularly <b>manic-depressive</b> disorder (a.k.a. bipolar disorder) and depressive disorder (a.k.a. unipolar disorder). In Touched with Fire: <b>Manic-Depressive</b> Illness and the Artistic Temperament, Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers, poets, and artists. She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway (who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment), Virginia Woolf (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer Robert Schumann (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo.|$|E
25|$|The DSM-I (1952) {{contained}} depressive {{reaction and}} the DSM-II (1968) depressive neurosis, {{defined as an}} excessive reaction to internal conflict or an identifiable event, and also included a depressive type of <b>manic-depressive</b> psychosis within Major affective disorders.|$|E
25|$|The {{influential}} system {{put forward}} by Kraepelin unified nearly all types of mood disorder into <b>manicâ€“depressive</b> insanity. Kraepelin worked from an assumption of underlying brain pathology, but also promoted a distinction between endogenous (internally caused) and exogenous (externally caused) types.|$|E
5000|$|Mike Figgis based Leaving Las Vegas on a 1990 autobiographical {{novel by}} John O'Brien, who {{committed}} suicide in April 1994, shortly after finding out his novel was being made into a film. Despite basing most of his screenplay on O'Brien's novel, Figgis spoke of a personal attachment with the novel, stating [...] "Anything I would do would be because I had a sympathetic feeling towards it. That's why I did Mr. Jones, because I think manic-depression is a fascinating, sad, and amazing phenomenon. It's not a coincidence {{that some of the}} greatest artists have been <b>manic-depressives.</b> That made it, to me, a fascinating subject that, alas, did not come out in the film".|$|R
40|$|A psychoticism {{questionnaire}} in Hindi {{consisting of}} 60 items was standardised by administering it to 100 psychotics (schizophrenics and <b>manic-depressives),</b> 100 neurotics, 100 psychiatrically normal relatives of psychotics and 100 normals. The mean psychoticism score (P-score) of psychotics, neurotics, relatives and normals were 30. 69, 13. 63, 13. 85 and 8. 83 respectively, {{were significantly different}} from one another except for the difference between neurotics and relatives.

40|$|Holistic {{medicine}} {{treats the}} whole human being. It rejects the Cartesian-inspired, mind-body dualism, and rather sees the person organized {{at various levels}} from the cellular out to his entire society, much like the "Bulls eye" representation of Dr. Aldwyn Stokes, an unashamed Myerian and a great name in Canadian Psychiatry. In this scheme, things can go wrong at various levels, and-affect the whole person's ability to function. Psychiatry has always prided itself in treating the whole person {{rather than focusing on}} a symptom or a diagnosis for which there is a specific, rigid treatment regime. However, with our roots and associations in the medical profession, we have a too obvious tendency to let a certain diagnosis lead us straightaway to a therapeutic formula. Thus we have practitioners who automatically place all schizophrenics on haldol, all <b>manic-depressives</b> on lithium, all alcoholics on antabuse and librium, and all obsessionals on anafranil. The holistic practitioner is skeptical of modern medical orthodoxy. He recalls how Medicine was wrong in the humoral theory of disease, wrong in the therapeutic value of bleeding, and more recently, wrong in the use of thalidomide, wrong in the condemnation of vitamin E for vascular disease, wrong in its theories on eggs, butter, cholesterol levels and heart disease, and possibly wrong in its condemnation o...|$|R

25|$|Otto Klemperer became Music Director in 1933, part of {{the large}} group of German emigrants fleeing Nazi Germany. He {{conducted}} many LA Phil premieres, and introduced Los Angeles audiences to important new works by Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg.

25|$|Although the Goons {{elevated}} Milligan {{to international}} stardom, {{the demands of}} writing and performing the series took a heavy toll. During Series 3 he suffered {{the first of several}} serious mental breakdowns, which also marked the onset of a decades-long cycle of <b>manic-depressive</b> illness. In late 1952, possibly exacerbated by suppressed tensions between the Goons' stars, Milligan apparently became irrationally convinced that he had to kill Sellers but when he attempted to gain entry to Sellers's neighbouring flat, armed with a potato knife, he accidentally walked straight through the plate-glass front door. He was hospitalised, heavily sedated for two weeks and spent almost two months recuperating; fortunately for the show, a backlog of scripts meant that his illness had little effect on production. Milligan later blamed the pressure of writing and performing The Goon Show, for both his breakdown and the failure of his first marriage.|$|E
40|$|Conformity and achievement-related {{characteristics}} of 10 hospitalized depressed patients and 11 matched acute schizophrenics were studied in an Asch-type conformity situation, {{and by the}} use of self-report inventories. It was found that in the conformity situation, depressed Ss showed a greater tendency to conform to social pressure than did the controls. When conformity and achievement were assessed {{by the use of}} self-reports, the results were either nonsignificant or opposite to those found in the conformity situation. The results were compared with recent theory and research dealing with cyclical affective disorders. The goal {{of the present study was}} to extend recent theory and research concerning manicdepressive disorders to depressed patients. On the basis of information obtained from intensive psychoanalysis of 12 manicdepressives, Cohen, Baker, Cohen, Fromm-Reichmann, and Weigert (1954) concluded that these patients shared common {{characteristics of}} excessive conformity, dependency, and need for social approval. Furthermore, Cohen et al. suggested that <b>manic-depressives</b> were frequently used by their families as "esteem-getting " instruments; consequently they developed a sense of the importance of achievement as an instrumental act, without incorporating an internalized need for achievement. A follow-up study by Gibson, Cohen, and Cohen (1959) confirmed the findings of Cohen et al. and suggested that manicdepressive patients were characterized as possessing an excessive need for social approval, 1 This study was supported in part by a grant-inaid (50 - 591 -A) from the Research Foundation of the State University of New York. The authors are indebted to David Cavenaugh and W. J. Stryjewski of Buffalo State Hospital for their cooperation in carrying out this study and to J. S.

25|$|In 1933, {{once the}} Nazi Party had reached power, Klemperer left Germany {{and moved to}} the United States. He had {{previously}} converted to Catholicism, but returned to Judaism {{at the end of his}} life. In the U.S. he was appointed Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He was granted United States citizenship in 1937. In Los Angeles, he began to concentrate more on the standard works of the Germanic repertoire that would later bring him greatest acclaim, particularly the works of Beethoven, Brahms and Gustav Mahler, though he gave the Los Angeles premieres of some of fellow Los Angeles resident Arnold Schoenberg's works with the Philharmonic. He also visited other countries, including England and Australia. While the orchestra responded well to his leadership, Klemperer had a difficult time adjusting to Southern California, a situation exacerbated by repeated <b>manic-depressive</b> episodes, reportedly as a result of severe cyclothymic bipolar disorder. He also found that the dominant musical culture and leading music critics in the United States were largely out of sympathy with his taste for modern music from Weimar's Golden Age, and he felt he was not properly valued.|$|E

500|$|The elder Southard's {{life was}} often busy and sleepless. According to L. Vernon Briggs, a {{colleague}} at Boston Psychopathic Hospital, Southard considered himself hypomanic. [...] "He himself said {{that most people}} fell within one of the classifications of mental disease, and he felt himself {{to be of the}} <b>manic-depressive</b> type.

500|$|Mormons and ex-Mormons have {{produced}} {{a large amount of}} scholarly work about Smith, and to a large extent the result has been two discordant pictures of very different people: a man of God on the one hand, and on the other, a fraud preying on the ignorance of his followers. Believers tend to focus on his achievements and religious teachings, deemphasizing his personal defects, while detractors focus on his mistakes, legal troubles, and controversial doctrines. During {{the first half of the}} 20th century, some writers suggested that Smith might have suffered from epileptic seizures or from psychological disorders such as paranoid delusions or <b>manic-depressive</b> illness that might explain his visions and revelations. Many modern biographers disagree with these ideas. More nuanced interpretations include viewing Smith as: a prophet who had normal human weaknesses; a [...] "pious fraud" [...] who believed he was called of God to preach repentance and felt justified inventing visions in order to convert people; or a gifted [...] "mythmaker" [...] who was the product of his Yankee environment. Biographers, Mormon and non-Mormon alike, agree that Smith was one of the most influential, charismatic, and innovative figures in American religious history.|$|E

2500|$|The 5-HT2C receptors are G proteinâ€“coupled receptors {{that are}} coupled to {{phospholipase}} C (PLC) via GÎ±q, phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and possibly GÎ±13. PLC metabolizes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which regulates cellular Ca2+ flux by binding to IP3 receptors, thereby inducing {{the release of}} Ca2+. In addition, the activation of PLA2 also results in recruitment of a RhoA/PLD pathway through RhoA, an enzyme that regulates {{a wide spectrum of}} cellular functions through PLD (phospholipase D) target protein. The 5-HT2C receptors can also stimulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway which is activated by neurotrophins and other neuroactive chemicals. Production of these chemicals effects neuronal differentiation, survival, regeneration, and structural and functional plasticity. Early studies of the ERK pathway showed that mood stabilizers for the treatment of <b>manic-depressive</b> illness stimulated the pathway. This led to the understanding that stimulation of the 5-HT2C receptors could regulate <b>manic-depressive</b> conditions {{in a manner similar to}} mood stabilizers.

Female victimization remains the overall theme, this time depersonalized into odd, accusatory mini-narratives in which a variety of female characters receive the protection of Love's tense, <b>manic-depressive</b> singing.

In a book by Stephen Trombley, Woolf is described as having a confrontational relationship with her doctors, and possibly being a woman who is a [...] "victim of male medicine", referring to the contemporary relative lack of understanding about mental illness.|$|E

Their stays ranged from 7 to 52 days, and the average was 19 days.

2500|$|In November 1947, the CPC Politburo {{assigned}} Kang {{to inspect}} land reform {{in his home}} province of Shandong. [...] Early in 1948, he was appointed deputy chief of the Party's East China Bureau, under Rao Shushi. [...] Some commentators speculate that the private humiliation of being placed under a former subordinate {{may be one reason}} why Kang [...] "fell ill" [...] and largely disappeared from view until after Rao's fall in 1954. [...] Of course, Kang may really have been ill. [...] Mao's personal physician, Li Zhisui, later recorded that doctors responsible for Kang's treatment at Beijing Hospital told him that Kang was suffering from schizophrenia. [...] Writing before Li's book was published, Byron and Pack offered other possible diagnoses based on symptoms Kang seems to have displayed, including <b>manic-depressive</b> psychosis and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
2500|$|Influenced by the {{approach}} of Kahlbaum and others, and developing his concepts in publications spanning {{the turn of the}} century, German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin advanced a new system. He grouped together a number of existing diagnoses that appeared to all have a deteriorating course over timeâ€”such as catatonia, hebephrenia and dementia paranoidesâ€”under another existing term [...] "dementia praecox" [...] (meaning [...] "early senility", later renamed schizophrenia). Another set of diagnoses that appeared to have a periodic course and better outcome were grouped together under the category of <b>manic-depressive</b> insanity (mood disorder). He also proposed a third category of psychosis, called paranoia, involving delusions but not the more general deficits and poor course attributed to dementia praecox. In all he proposed 15 categories, also including psychogenic neurosis, psychopathic personality, and syndromes of defective mental development (mental retardation). He eventually included homosexuality in the category of [...] "mental conditions of constitutional origin".|$|E
2500|$|Jean Webster {{began an}} affair with Ethelyn McKinney's brother, Glenn Ford McKinney. A lawyer, he had {{struggled}} {{to live up to}} the expectations of his wealthy and successful father. Mirroring a subplot of Dear Enemy, he had an unhappy marriage due to his wife's struggling with mental illness; [...] McKinney's wife, Annette Reynaud, was frequently hospitalized for <b>manic-depressive</b> episodes. The McKinneys' child, John, also showed signs of mental instability. McKinney responded to these stresses with frequent escapes on hunting and yachting trips, as well as alcohol abuse; he entered sanatoriums on several occasions as a result. The McKinneys separated in 1909, but in an era when divorce was uncommon and difficult to obtain, they were not divorced until 1915. After his separation, McKinney continued to struggle with alcoholism but had his addiction under control in the summer of 1912, when he traveled with Webster, Ethelyn McKinney, and Lena Weinstein to Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|The University of Colorado at Boulder {{accepted}} Van Zandt as {{a student}} in 1962. In the spring of his second year, his parents flew to Boulder to bring Townes back to Houston, apparently worried about his binge drinking and episodes of depression. They admitted him to the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, where {{he was diagnosed with}} manic depression. He received three months of insulin shock therapy, which erased much of his long-term memory. Afterwards, his mother claimed her [...] "biggest regret in life was that she had allowed that treatment to occur". In 1965, he was accepted into the University of Houston's pre-law program. Soon after he attempted to join the Air Force, but was rejected due to a doctor's diagnosis that labelled him [...] "an acute <b>manic-depressive</b> who has made minimal adjustments to life". He quit school around 1967, having been inspired by his singer-songwriter heroes to pursue a career in playing music.|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} first used by analogy in {{psychiatry}} with a slightly different connotation, to identify a group of conditions that is qualitatively distinct in appearance but believed to be related from an underlying pathogenic point of view. It has been noted that for clinicians trained {{after the publication of}} DSM-III (1980), the spectrum concept in psychiatry may be relatively new, but that it has a long and distinguished history that dates back to Emil Kraepelin and beyond. A dimensional concept was proposed by Ernst Kretschmer in 1921 for schizophrenia (schizothymicâ€“ schizoidâ€“ schizophrenic) and for affective disorders (cyclothymic temperamentâ€“ cycloid 'psychopathy'â€“ <b>manic-depressive</b> disorder), as well as by Eugen Bleuler in 1922. The term [...] "spectrum" [...] {{was first used}} in psychiatry in 1968 in regard to a postulated schizophrenia spectrum, at that time meaning a linking together of what were then called [...] "schizoid personalities", in people diagnosed with schizophrenia and their genetic relatives (see Seymour S. Kety).|$|E
