Eurogamer stated that Opposing Force still had similar problems to other expansion packs, commenting that [...] "χ amount of new content has been created {{and it is going}} to be cut into the old content in a linear way to make it look like an all new game", but noted that [...] "fortunately though the new stuff in Opposing Force... is pretty damn good". Although praising the level design as the game's strongest point, the reviewer felt that [...] "towards the end of the game... they were running out of development time". Reviewing for IGN, Vincent Lopez stated that the game [...] "does a fantastic job of making you remember exactly why you enjoyed the original so much", but criticized this as the biggest drawback, commenting that [...] "you <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> wishing for a more original experience", but concluded that [...] "for good, and bad: it's good to be back".|$|E

500|$|Despite being a [...] "critically acclaimed" [...] film, {{according}} to Rotten Tomatoes, {{not all of}} its reviews were this positive. Anna Smith of Empire called it [...] "formulaic and all-American", commenting that many scenes [...] "appear functional rather than inspirational", and that the film focused on the racial issue [...] "a little too heavily". Smith stated, [...] "clunky plotting and characterisation mean it has 'telemovie' written all over it." [...] Marc Mohan from The Oregonian stressed it {{can be compared to}} after-school specials due to its [...] "lack of originality in plot and character." [...] Time Outs Jessica Winter also drew a comparation to after-school specials, saying [...] "on the big screen ... its clichés seem bigger and its characterisations broader than they would on the more forgiving telly." [...] Nick Schager's of Slant Magazine lamented that the [...] "clichés are too numerous to mention", while Neil Smith from BBC asserted it has [...] "as much ... fantasy as Lord of the Rings." [...] Jan Stuart of Newsday deemed it [...] "virtually suspense-free, while Robert Hanks of The Independent stated it has an important message but that is a [...] "shame it couldn't be encased in a less faked-up story". Commenting on The Times, Chris Ayres stressed that although it has good [...] "visual flair" [...] it [...] "is ruined by its Oprah-style emotional manipulation."

[...] Daphne Gordon of the Toronto Star gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "One of the strongest releases from Disney in years, thanks to the work of Andrew Stanton, possibly {{one of the most successful}} directors you've never heard of." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Finding Nemo isn't quite up there with the company's finest work -- there's finally a sense of formula setting in -- but it's hands down the best family film since Monsters, Inc." [...] C.W. Nevius of The San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The visuals pop, the fish emote and the ocean comes alive. That's in the first two minutes. After that, they do some really cool stuff." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Finding Nemo will engross kids with its absorbing story, brightly drawn characters and lively action, and grown-ups will be equally entertained by the film's subtle humor and the sophistication of its visuals." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "A visual marvel, every frame packed to the gills with clever details, Finding Nemo is the best big-studio release so far this year." ...|$|E
