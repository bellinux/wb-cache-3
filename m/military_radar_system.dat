Modern communications require high linear power amplifiers and {{in order to reduce the}} complete system cost, it is necessary to have a single broadband power amplifier, which can amplify multiple carriers. The improvement in the efficiency of the power amplifier increases the battery life and also reduces the cooling requirements for the same output power.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceSpectrum sharing is an {{approach}} to solving the congestion problem in radio frequency (RF) bands. The 3500 - 3650 MHz band has been allocated in the United States for spectrum sharing between <b>military</b> <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> and cellular systems. Hence, this paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> and a MIMO communication system sharing the same spectrum band. The performance of the communications system {{is analyzed by considering}} interference from the radar with regard to signals reflected at the radar's target. A majority of papers prefer to omit the effect of the target reflection coefficient, which depends on the scattering characteristic of the target. Therefore, in this paper, the target reflection coefficient is integrated, and the scattering effect to the MIMO communications system is analyzed. Also, the power of the transmitted radar waveforms is varied. The direction of the targets is considered, and their impact on the MIMO communication system is analyzed.
