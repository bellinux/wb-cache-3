5|$|Sociology is the {{scientific}} study of society, including patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, acceptance, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the <b>micro-sociology</b> level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim had an {{important}} impact {{on the development of}} Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as Marcel Mauss, but also later thinkers, such as Maurice Halbwachs, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Levi-Strauss. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of Ziya Gökalp, the founding father of Turkish sociology. Randall Collins has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with Erving Goffman's <b>micro-sociology.</b> Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the interaction order.|$|E
500|$|Goffman made {{substantial}} {{advances in}} the study of face-to-face interaction, elaborated the [...] "dramaturgical approach" [...] to human interaction, and developed numerous concepts that have had a massive influence, particularly in the field of the <b>micro-sociology</b> of everyday life. Many of his works have concerned the organization of everyday behavior, a concept he termed [...] "interaction order". He contributed to the sociological concept of framing (frame analysis), to game theory (the concept of strategic interaction), and to the study of interactions and linguistics. With regard to the latter, he argued that the activity of speaking must be seen as a social rather than a linguistic construct. From a methodological perspective, Goffman often employed qualitative approaches, specifically ethnography, most famously in his study of social aspects of mental illness, in particular the functioning of total institutions. Overall, his contributions are valued as an attempt to create a theory that bridges the agency-and-structure divide – for popularizing social constructionism, symbolic interaction, conversation analysis, ethnographic studies, and the study and importance of individual interactions. His influence extended far beyond sociology: for example, his work provided the assumptions of much current research in language and social interaction within the discipline of communication.|$|E
40|$|On 28 January 2011 the Egyptian {{army was}} {{deployed}} onto Cairo's streets following {{three days of}} escalating protests. Upon entering Midan al-Tahrir, a column of newly arriving army tanks and APCs was attacked by protestors. Throwing stones and dousing the vehicles in petrol before setting them alight, protestors pulled soldiers out of their vehicles and beat them. Seizing ammunition and supplies, protestors even commandeered a tank. Minutes later those same protestors were chanting pro-army slogans, posing for photographs with soldiers and sharing food. How protestors respond to the deployment of security forces assumed loyal to a regime determined to end protest is often summed-up in the dyad of “fight or flight. ” In this paper, I consider a third option: fraternization. Through a social interactionist lens, I explore the prevalence of pro-army chants, graffiti, the mounting of military vehicles, physical embraces, sleeping in tank tracks and posing for photographs with soldiers in and around Midan al-Tahrir during the 25 th January Egyptian Revolution. I draw on the contentious politics literature, as well as <b>micro-sociologies</b> of violence and ritual, to suggest that fraternizing protestors developed a repertoire of contention that made immediate, emotional claims on the loyalty of regime troops. From initial techniques of micro-conflict avoidance, protestors and their micro-interactions with soldiers forged a precarious “internal frontier” that bifurcated governance from sovereignty through {{the performance of the}} army and the people as one hand in opposition to the Mubarak regime...|$|R

This differs from the views of many of his contemporaries who believed that an ethnic group was formed from biological similarities alone apart from social perception of membership in a group.|$|E

50|$|A major {{offshoot}} of existentialism as a philosophy is existentialist psychology and psychoanalysis, which first crystallized {{in the work}} of Otto Rank, Freud's closest associate for 20 years. Without awareness of the writings of Rank, Ludwig Binswanger was influenced by Freud, Edmund Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre. A later figure was Viktor Frankl, who briefly met Freud and studied with Jung as a young man. His logotherapy can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy. The existentialists would also influence social psychology, antipositivist <b>micro-sociology,</b> symbolic interactionism, and post-structuralism, with the work of thinkers such as Georg Simmel and Michel Foucault. Foucault was a great reader of Kierkegaard even though he almost never refers this author, who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive.|$|E
5000|$|Moreno is also {{credited}} for founding sociodrama. [...] Though sociodrama, like psychodrama, utilizes {{the theatrical}} form as means of therapy, the terms are not synonymous. While psychodrama focuses on one patient {{within the group}} unit, Sociodrama addresses {{the group as a}} whole. The goal is to explore social events, collective ideologies, and community patterns within a group in order to bring about positive change or transformation within the group dynamic. Moreno also believed that sociodrama {{could be used as a}} form of <b>micro-sociology</b> - that by examining the dynamic of a small group of individuals, patterns could be discovered that manifest themselves within the society as a whole, such as in Alcoholics Anonymous. Sociodrama can be divided into three main categories: crisis sociodrama, which deals with group responses after a catastrophic event, political sociodrama, which attempts to address stratification and inequality issues within a society, and diversity sociodrama, which considers conflicts based on prejudice, racism or stigmatization.|$|E

5000|$|Modern social {{anthropology}} {{was founded in}} Britain at the London School of Economics and Political Science following World War I. Influences include both the methodological revolution pioneered by Bronisław Malinowski's process-oriented fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands of Melanesia between 1915 and 1918 and Alfred Radcliffe-Brown's theoretical program for systematic comparison {{that was based on}} a conception of rigorous fieldwork and the structure-functionalist conception of Durkheim’s sociology. [...] Other intellectual founders include W. H. R. Rivers and A. C. Haddon, whose orientation reflected the contemporary Parapsychologies of Wilhelm Wundt and Adolf Bastian, and Sir E. B. Tylor, who defined anthropology as a positivist science following Auguste Comte. Edmund Leach (1962) defined {{social anthropology}} as a kind of comparative <b>micro-sociology</b> based on intensive fieldwork studies. Scholars have not settled a theoretical orthodoxy on the nature of science and society, and their tensions reflect views which are seriously opposed.A. R. Radcliffe-Brown also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the Andaman Islands in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists Émile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply The Andaman Islanders) that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as structural functionalism, which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French structuralism, which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.) ...|$|E

First, youth positively sensitize one another towards violence. Second, absorbed in the group action, they become ‘decontrolled by solidarity’: their behaviour is guided much more by the group (social constraint) rather than by internal monitoring (self-restraint). Third, a process of desidentification was identified, in which the identity of the victims was seen as merely futile, rather than bad or evil...|$|E

40|$|Some theoreticians {{state that}} the Ethnography and <b>micro-sociology</b> allow the {{researchers}} to ripen previously built even frequently obvious THEORIES, and constitute excellent tools to provide detailed descriptions or examples of processes, which were already {{in the center of}} Macro inquiry. Micro is, according to them, kind of picturesque supplement for the majority of Macro – studies – the supplement, which conﬁ rms (and when contradicts this is only for showing exception) the Macro– Knowledge. On the other hand, Grounded Theory practitioners follow an opposing method – from Micro to Macro – developing their own theories from their ﬁ elds. Other way of QM practice is simply using of Micro without Macro perspective: Ethnographers analyze the phenomenon doing <b>Micro-sociology,</b> strongly close to a chosen particular example – directly from their ﬁ eld– they avoid construction of theoretical models, because they believe that social processes are dynamic and depend on interaction (so each time different); as a consequence people’s behavior cannot be “modelized”.

My ethnographical ﬁ eld (started in 2003) – life-science researchers’ world – done in different countries (France, Poland, Germany, USA) gives me the data for showing that this obvious and largely practical perspective is not exact. Based on the results of my research on careers and mobility of life-science scientists, I showed that starting from Micro is not only one of the way of doing science but also it is the necessary method for providing the Macro Sociology.

It is shown that (1) micro-interactions constitute situational turning-points, towards or away from atrocities and that (2) local emotional dynamics shape the internal structure of atrocities, i. e. their internal dynamics of killings.

40|$|Beginning {{with the}} premise that the {{everyday}} is constitutionally elusive, a mobile structure is formulated and then deployed to, if not capture the everyday, at least corner it. Using Ian Hacking's notion that a formidable analytical apparatus could be created using Erving Goffman's "bottom-up" <b>micro-sociology</b> in combination with Michel Foucault's "top-down" macro-critique, a comprehensive approach is constructed to track the feints and parries of the everyday.

The paper also suggests that field theory could be usefully deployed in future research to explore how wider global trends or social forces, such as neo-liberalism or bio-power, are refracted through the crime control field in different national jurisdictions. We conclude by showing how this approach provides a bridge between society-wide analysis and <b>micro-sociology</b> by exploring how the operation of new surveillance technologies is mediated by the "habitus" of surveillance agents working in the crime control field and contested by surveillance subjects...|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} I discuss how a practice-based {{sensitivity}} {{can be used}} to address big issues and ‘large scale’ (social) phenomena. This is of importance because practice-based sensitivities are often pigeonholed as part of <b>micro-sociology</b> and therefore deemed unsuitable to deal with some of the big issues of our time. The chapter starts by contrasting the position of practice-based approaches vis-à-vis the idea of macro phenomena, levels of reality and localism. I then examine three ways in which practice oriented scholars have addressed large phenomena namely studying connections in action, examining the global within the local and engaging with scalography, the practice of assembling large scale phenomena. For each approach I discuss the main affordances and limitations. I conclude that practice theory helps us to reconsider what counts as large scale phenomena and contributes to doing away with some traditional dichotomies in social science, for example the presumed difference between micro and macro, local and global and the misplaced idea that large scale phenomena are better understood from a distance...|$|E
