40|$|Context: Ionizing {{radiation}} {{is a well-known}} carcinogen in humans. Chromosomal aberrations and formation of micronuclei in cell cytoplasm are early biological evidence of carcinogenesis. Aims: This study was undertaken to assess the genotoxic effect of panoramic radiography in the buccal epithelial cells. Materials and Methods: The study included 60 healthy individuals (median age 23. 5 years; age range 12 - 65 years) who underwent panoramic radiographic examination. Exfoliated buccal epithelial cells were obtained immediately before and 10 days after radiation exposure. The cells were stained with Giemsa and evaluated for micronuclei by scoring 1000 cells per sample. Statistical analysis used: The paired ′t ′ {{test was used to}} find out the significance of difference in the number of micronuclei before and after x-ray exposure. The Karl Pearson correlation coefficient was used to find out the correlation between age and <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cell</b> frequencies and number of micronucleus per 1000 cells. The ANOVA test was used to find out if there were significant differences in <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cell</b> frequencies between different age-groups. Student′s unpaired ′t′ test was used to find out the significance of difference in <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cell</b> frequencies and number of micronucleus per 1000 cells between genders. Results: The paired ′t′ test showed that <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cell</b> frequencies (P = 0. 02) and number of micronucleus per 1000 cells (P = 0. 047) were significantly higher after radiographic exposure. The mean number of micronucleated cells before and after radiation exposure were 0. 48 ± 0. 14 and 0. 51 ± 0. 15, respectively. There was statistically significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in buccal epithelial cells after exposure to panoramic radiography. The correlation of micronucleus frequency with age and gender was statistically nonsignificant. Conclusions: The results indicate that panoramic radiography may induce genotoxic effects in buccal epithelial cells. Considering this risk, panoramic radiography should be used cautiously...|$|E

The effects of concentration and exposure {{time on the}} micronuclei frequency were studied in blood smears obtained from tadpoles exposed to four concentrations (0. 02, 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 4 mg/L) of the compound for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h and 8, 15, 20 and 30 days. As a positive control, tadpoles were exposed to cyclophosphamide (5 mg/L). The <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cell</b> frequency was expressed per 1, 000 cells. R. catesbeiana tadpoles exposed to increasing concentrations of lambda-cyhalothrin showed {{an increase in the}} micronuclei frequency in peripheral blood. Tadpoles exposed to cyclophosphamide (CP) also showed a significant increase in micronucleated erythrocytes which peaked after 15 days.

40|$|Titanium dioxide {{nanoparticles}} (TiO 2 -NPs) continuously {{released into}} waters, may cause harmful effects to marine organisms {{and their potential}} interaction with conventional toxic contaminants represents {{a growing concern for}} biota. We investigated the genotoxic potential of nanosized titanium dioxide (n- TiO 2) (100 mg L 1) alone and in combination with CdCl 2 (100 mg L 1) in Mytilus galloprovincialis after 4 days of in vivo exposure. RAPD-PCR technique and Micronucleus test were used to study genotoxicity. The results showed genome template stability (GTS) being markedly reduced after single exposure to n- TiO 2 and CdCl 2. Otherwise, co-exposure resulted in a milder reduction of GTS. Exposure to n-TiO 2 was responsible for a significant increase of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cell</b> frequency in gill tissue, while no chromosomal damage was observed after CdCl 2 exposure as well as after combined exposure to both substances...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> and micronuclei in oral submucous fibrosis patients and to compare with healthy individuals. Study design: Twenty patients with oral submucous fibrosis and twenty age-sex-matched healthy individuals as control group participated in this study. Exfoliated cells were obtained by scraping from right and left buccal mucosa and were screened for <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> and micronuclei. Frequencies were compared between oral submucous fibrosis and control group. Also comparison was made between chewing site and non-chewing site of buccal mucosa. Results: Frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> and micronuclei in oral submucous fibrosis patients ranged from 0. 6 % to 5. 3 % and 0. 50 % to 5. 74 %, where as in control group ranged from 0. 5 % to 0. 9 % and 0. 22 % to 0. 88 % respectively. <b>Micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> and micronuclei in oral submucous fibrosis patients were statistically significantly elevated (p < 0. 05) as compared to control group. The mean percentage frequencies were higher on chewing site; however there was no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: The present study revealed an increase in micronuclei in oral submucous fibrosis patients compared to healthy individuals. With gutkha chewing habit in younger age, chances of malignant transformation are high relatively. Thus micronuclei test {{can be used as}} an early indicator of genotoxicity in oral submucous fibrosi...|$|R

40|$|Inactivation of p 53 tumor-suppressor {{leads to}} genetic {{instability}} and, in particular, to accumulation of cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes. In {{order to better}} define the role of p 53 function in maintaining genome integrity we investigated the involvement of p 53 in the control of proliferation of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> resulting from abnormal chromosome segregation. Using cell lines expressing temperature-sensitive (ts) p 53 or containing p 53 genetic suppressor element (p 53 -GSE) we showed that inhibition of p 53 function increases the frequency of cells with micronuclei. Immunofluorescence study revealed that in REF 52 cell cultures with both spontaneous and colcemid-induced micronuclei the proportion of p 53 -positive cells is considerably higher among micronucleated variants as compared with their mononuclear counterparts. Analysis of 12 (1) ConA cells expressing the beta-galactosidase reporter gene {{under the control of}} a p 53 -responsive promoter showed activation of p 53 -regulated transcription in the cells with micronuclei. Importantly, the percentage of cells manifesting specific p 53 activity in colcemid-treated cultures increased with an augmentation of the number of micronuclei in the cell. Activation of p 53 in <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> was accompanied by a decrease in their ability to enter S-phase as was determined by comparative analysis of 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (5 -BrdU) incorporation by the cells with micronuclei and their mononuclear counterparts. Inhibition of p 53 function in the cells with tetracycline-regulated p 53 gene expression, {{as well as in the}} cells expressing ts-p 53 or p 53 -GSE, abolished cell cycle arrest in <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells.</b> These results along with the data showing no increase in the frequency of chromosome breaks in REF 52 cells after colcemid treatment suggest the existence of p 53 -mediated cell cycle checkpoint(s) preventing proliferation of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> derived as a result of abnormal chromosome segregation during mitosis. status: publishe...|$|R

We examined whether it could damage DNA using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) and the micronucleus test in leukocytes and in bone marrow cells of mice. P. cattleyanum leaf extract was tested at concentrations of 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg/kg. N-nitroso-N-ethylurea {{was used as a}} positive control. Peripheral blood leukocytes were collected 4 and 24 h after the treatments for the comet assay, and bone marrow cells were collected after 24 and 48 h for the micronucleus test. Unlike N-nitroso-N-ethylurea, P. cattleyanum extract failed to induce a significant increase in cell DNA damage, in <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cell</b> frequency, and in bone marrow toxicity. The lack of mutagenicity and cytotoxicity with high doses of this plant extract means that it can be safely used in traditional medicine...|$|E
40|$|Background: Identifying {{malignant}} {{cells in}} effusion fluid is vital in staging {{and management of}} cancers. Differentiating reactive mesothelial cells from malignant cells in effusion fluid is a challenging task {{and there is an}} ongoing need for simpler and cost effective tool to aid the diagnosis. Micronucleus is an additional smaller nucleus in the cytoplasm, formed by chromosomes or chromosomal fragments formed during cell division. Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the significance of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cell</b> in effusion fluids to distinguish adenocarcinomatous from reactive mesothelial effusions. Materials and Methods: Thirty cases of unequivocal malignant effusion fluids and 30 benign cases with reactive mesothelial cells as control were studied. Number of microucleated cells present per 1000 well-preserved cells in Leishman-stained smears were counted. Results: Mean (±SD) micronucleated score in malignant and benign effusions were 15. 77 ± 9. 78 and 1. 87 ± 1. 78, respectively. The median scores were 13 and 2, respectively. Mann–Whitney test showed that this difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). This study revealed that there was a significant difference in micronucleus scoring between benign and malignant effusions. Conclusions: Micronucleus score can be used as an additional biomarker in the interpretation of routinely stained cytosmears...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether {{high dose}} vitamin C influenced {{the viability of}} human lymphocytes in plasma, in {{the presence or absence}} of hydrogen peroxide (512 microM) by scoring necrotic, apoptotic and micronucleated cells using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. The in vitro results showed that vitamin C (0. 57 - 2. 27 mM) on its own had no effect on the above parameters. However, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide vitamin C significantly reduced the number of dividing cells and apoptosis, and increased necrosis and micronucleated cells. A double-blind placebo controlled intervention, with a cross-over, involving 11 male subjects, aged 20 - 40 years, was performed to determine whether high plasma vitamin C concentration resulting from vitamin C supplementation promotes or protects against genetic damage and cell death ex vivo. Venous blood samples were collected before and after an anti-oxidant-poor diet which reduced plasma vitamin C concentrations by 15 % (P < 0. 05), and was followed with a 2 g vitamin C supplement, which raised plasma concentrations by 115 and 125 % (0. 12 mM) after 2 and 4 h, respectively (P < 0. 05). Plasma collected post-vitamin C ingestion did not alter micronucleus expression or apoptosis in control or hydrogen peroxide-treated lymphocytes, but it moderately increased necrosis (P < 0. 08). Analysis of combined data showed that necrotic cell frequency correlated positively with <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cell</b> frequency (r = 0. 66, P < 0. 0001) and negatively with apoptotic cell frequency (r = - 0. 81, P < 0. 0001). Overall, vitamin C supplementation did not appear to cause DNA damage under normal physiological conditions nor did it protect cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity.

40|$|Radiation-induced {{bystander}} effect {{refers to}} radiation responses which occur in non-irradiated cells. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare the level of bystander effect in a couple of tumor and normal cell lines (QU-DB and MRC 5). To induce bystander effect, cells were irradiated with 0. 5, 2, and 4 Gy of 60 Co gamma rays and their media were transferred to non-irradiated (bystander) cells of the same type. Cells containing micronuclei were counted in bystander subgroups, non-irradiated, and 0. 5 Gy irradiated cells. Frequencies of cells containing micronuclei in QU-DB bystander subgroups were higher than in bystander subgroups of MRC 5 cells (P < 0. 001). The number of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> counted in non-irradiated and 0. 5 Gy irradiated QU-DB cells was also higher than the corresponding values for MRC 5 cells (P < 0. 001). Another difference between the two cell lines was that in QU-DB bystander cells, a dose-dependent increase in the number of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> was observed as the dose increased, but at all doses the number of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> in MRC 5 bystander cells was constant. It is concluded that QU-DB cells are more susceptible than MRC 5 cells to be affected by bystander effect, and in the two cell lines there is a positive correlation between DNA damages induced directly and those induced due to bystander effect...|$|R

40|$|The fungal {{metabolite}} wortmannin (WM) is {{a potent}} and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a nuclear serine-threonine kinase, member of the phosphaditylinositol- 3 kinase related kinase family. WM {{has been used in}} the last few years as a promising radiosensitizer mainly throughout cell survival experiments. However, few studies have addressed the role of DNA-PK inhibition in the repair of DNA lesions generated by antitumor agents, Bleomycin (BLM) is an antitumor agent used in the treatment of various neoplasia with a unique genotoxicity profile that mimics the ionizing radiation effects. In this study, we evaluated the effect of different concentrations of WM on the DNA damage induced by BLM, The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN) in V 79 Chinese hamster cells was used as the end-point, WM significantly increased the frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> (%MNBN) by about 2. 2 -fold, the number of micronuclei per binucleated cell (MN/BN) by about 14 -fold, and also changed the pattern of the distribution of micronuclei induced by BLM, The frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> with 2 MN per cell and with greater than or equal to 3 MN per cell increased, whereas the frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> with 1 MN per cell decreased. WM was not genotoxic but decreased cell proliferation as assessed by the frequency of binucleated cells. Our results show that WM clearly enhances the efficacy of BLM in terms of DNA damage inflicted and therefore reinforces its use as a chemosensitizer. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Aim is {{to assess}} {{repeatedly}} cytogenetic effects of co- or monoinfection caused by Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis during the acute and convalescent periods {{of the disease}} depending on variants of glutathione-S-transferase (GSTM 1 or GSTT 1) genes in the patient’s genotype. Material and methods: The study included 186 patients and 166 healthy (control) residents of {{the north of the}} Tomsk and Tyumen regions, who were examined by clinical, laboratory and cytogenetic methods (micronucleus analysis). Among the 186 examined patients, Lyme borreliosis was diagnosed in 65 individuals, tick-borne encephalitis was in 59 patients, and coinfection was found in 62 individuals. The material for the study (smears of buccal cells) was obtained repeatedly during admission of patients to treatment, and also after 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months. Polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the alleles of the GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 genes. Results: significant increase in the frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> buccal <b>cells</b> in patients with coinfection, as compared with the groups of control and patients with monoinfection. The significantly increased frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> was associated with the mutant inactive alleles of the GSTM 1 (0 / 0) and GSTT 1 (0 / 0) genes. If the patients were carriers of the mutant allele of the GSTM 1 (0 / 0) gene, the cytogenetic instability could persist for half a year. It was found that chronic arthritis in the Lyme borreliosis patients was associated with a long persistence of an increased frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells.</b> Conclusion: Significant differences in the frequency and the lasting of persistence of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> between groups of patients with coinfection and monoinfections were found.

Different concentrations of BPA (0. 48, 1. 2 and 2. 4 mM) and different fluences of thermal neutrons were studied. Substantial genotoxic potential of alpha and lithium particles generated inside or near the malignant cell by the BNC reaction was observed in a dose-response manner {{as measured by the}} frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> binucleated melanoma <b>cells</b> and by the number of micronuclei (MN) per binucleated cell. The distribution of the number of MN per <b>micronucleated</b> binucleated <b>cell</b> was also studied. The BNC reaction clearly modifies this distribution, increasing the frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> with 2 and, especially, {{less than or equal to}} 3 MN and conversely decreasing the frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> with 1 MN. A decrease in cell proliferation was also observed which correlated with MN formation. A discrete genotoxic and anti-proliferative contribution from both thermal neutron irradiation and BPA was observed and should be considered secondary. Additionally, V 79 Chinese hamster cells (chromosomal aberrations assay) and human lymphocytes (CBMN assay) incubated with different concentrations of BPA alone did not show any evidence of genotoxicity.

A cytofluorimetric analysis was also performed. Colchicine significantly increased <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> at least up to 96 h {{from the end of}} treatment. As expected, among colchicine-induced <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> the majority contained at least one CREST + MN. MMC induced a significant increase in <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> up to 120 h from the end of treatment and the great majority of MN lacked kinetochore fluorescence, indicating that MMC-induced MN were derived from acentric fragments. However, colchicine and MMC at 48 and 72 h from the end of treatment induced a significant increase of CREST- and CREST + MN, respectively, suggesting an induction of clastogenicity by colchicine and aneuploidy by MMC. The clastogenic effect of colchicine after 48 h was also confirmed by the {{presence of}} chromatid fragments in metaphase cells. A cytofluorimetric analysis indicated that, as aspected, colchicine and MMC interfere with the G 2 /M and S phases, respectively; however, a slight interference of colchicine with the S phase was also observed. DNA synthesis was present in MN and it was in most cases synchronous with synthesis in the main nucleus. The frequency of cells with MN in S phase observed in untreated or MMC-treated cells is in agreement with the proportion of cells without MN showing DNA synthesis. On the contrary, the frequency of cells with MN in S phase observed in colchicine-treated cells was significantly lower than that observed in control and MMC-treated cells...|$|R

Here we investigated the possibility of gamma-ray hormesis during low-dose neutron irradiation, since a small contribution to the total radiation dose from neutrons involves gamma rays. Using binucleated <b>cells</b> with micronuclei (<b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells)</b> among in vitro monoenergetic-neutron-irradiated human lymphocytes as a measure of residual damage, we investigated the influence of the small gammaray contribution to the dose on suppressing residual damage. We used residual damage data from previous experiments that involved neutrons with five different energies (0. 22 -, 0. 44 -, 1. 5 -, 5. 9 -, and 13. 7 -million electron volts [MeV]). Corresponding gamma-ray contributions to the dose were approximately 1 %, 1 %, 2 %, 6 %, and 6 %, respectively. Total absorbed radiation doses were 0, 10, 50, and 100 mGy for each neutron source. We demonstrate {{for the first time a}} protective effect (reduced residual damage) of the small gamma-ray contribution to the neutron dose.

To identify possible relationships between CB and the nucleolus, the localization of coilin, a marker of CB, and {{of a set of}} nucleolar proteins was investigated in cultured PtK 2 cells undergoing micronucleation. Nocodazol-induced <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> were examined by double indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies against coilin, fibrillarin, NOR- 90 /hUBF, RNA polymerase I, PM/Scl, and To/Th. Cells were imaged on a BioRad 1024 -UV confocal system attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope. Since PtK 2 cells possess only one nucleolus organizer region, <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> presented only one or two micronuclei containing nucleolus. By confocal microscopy we showed that in most micronuclei lacking a typical nucleolus a variable number of round structures were stained by antibodies against fibrillarin, NOR- 90 /hUBF protein, and coilin. These bodies were regarded as CB-like structures and were not stained by anti-PM/Scl and anti-To/Th antibodies. Anti-RNA polymerase I antibodies also reacted with CB-like structures in some micronuclei lacking nucleolus. The demonstration that a set of proteins involved in RNA/RNP biogenesis, namely coilin, fibrillarin, NOR- 90 /hUBF, and RNA polymerase I gather in CB-like structures present in nucleoli-devoid micronuclei may contribute to shed some light into the understanding of CB function.

For each individual, 3000 exfoliated buccal cells were analyzed. There was a significantly higher frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> (MNC) in the exposed workers than in controls. Smoking and drinking habits, age, and working time did not represent significant factors in terms of increasing the production of micronuclei (MN), when the control and the exposed groups were compared.

40|$|The role of lime in the {{formation}} of reactive oxygen species (ROS), i. e, O ° H 202, and OH-, from betel-quid components (extracts of areca nut and catechu) was investigated in vitro using a chemiluminescence technique and an assay for oxidative DNA damage involving analysis of 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine. Of the various areca-nut extracts, the catechin fraction, at alkaline pH, was shown to be the most active producer of ROS. The free Ca(OH) 2 content and pH of lime samples (a component of betel quid and chewing tobacco) were highly correlated with the generation of ROS from areca-nut extract in vitro and with oxidative base damage to DNA in vitro. While Fe 2 + had an enhancing effect on ROS formation, Mg 2 + had a marked inhibitory effect. The cytogenetic effects of ROS generated in vivo were measured in Syrian golden hamsters in which the cheek pouch had been painted with lime and an areca-nut extract or catechu, singly or in combination. The frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> was increased only in animals that had received both the areca-nut extract and lime. The frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> in exfoliated oral mucosal cells from Indian chewers of betel quid with tobacco containing lime or of tobacco with lime was significantly higher than in a control (no habit) group. These studies demonstrate that addition of lime to betel quid constituents generates ROS, which induce cytogenetic damage in hamster cheek pouch and may contribute to the cytogenetic damage observed in the oral cavity of betel-quid chewers. These results implicate ROS in clastogenesis and probably in the etiology of oral cancer...|$|R

(1) {{describe}} small {{increases in}} <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> following 7 weekly oral treatments with lead acetate and con-clude {{that this is}} indicative of genotoxic effects. However, in the same paper, the authors describe the equivocal nature of earlier in vitro and in vivo experiments on lead salts as well as anaemia and increases in erythropoiesis in mammalian systems. The authors do not discuss indirect mechanisms of micro-nucleus formation. In particular, micronucleated erythrocytes can be induced by administration of erythropoietins without any corresponding increase in bone marrow chromosome damage [e. g. (2) ] presumably due to errors in enucleation or possibly decreased fidelity of DNA proof-reading in over stimulated erythroblasts.

Background: The present study was undertaken to find the various morphological changes {{that occur in the}} oral mucosa of habitual Pan masala eaters. Methods: Samples from 250 individuals who were eating pan masala for more than 6 months and 250 non-eaters by cotton tipped applicator by scraping the buccal mucosa. Smears were prepared and stained by papanicolou method Atleast 1000 cells were scanned per slide under high power. Result: Total 1, 76, 530 and 1, 26, 869 cells were counted in all Test slides and control slides respectively. Statistically high significant difference was found between user and control group. Conclusion: Finding are accumulating regarding the local genotoxic effect such as occurance of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells,</b> cells with multiple nuclei, cells with broken egg nuclei, binucleated, and hyperkeratotic cells. These cells were increased according to duration and frequency of pan masala eating. The significance of occurrence of these cells and development of oral cancers requires further studies.

40|$|A exposição de células meristemáticas de Allium cepa por dois ciclos de divisões (48 horas), em soluções contendo concentrações mais baixas de 5 -aminouracil (50, 100 e 150 μ M) do que as usualmente empregadas para proceder à sincronização da proliferação celular, mostrou que as concentrações usadas causam anormalidades cromossômicas e formação de micronúcleos, mas não bloqueiam a entrada destas células em mitose. As células em mitose e com micronúcleos podem prosseguir em divisão e assim contribuir para o crescimento das raízes de A. cepa expostas às concentrações de 5 -aminouracil estudadas. As células meristemáticas da raiz de A. cepa parecem suportar um certo nível de danos não reparados no DNA, os quais não impedem a divisão celular e o conseqüente crescimento dos tecidos. Esta flexibilidade genética do genoma de vegetais deve se constituir numa resposta metabólica adaptativa para sustentar condições ambientais adversas. Cytological {{preparations}} of Allium cepa meristematic {{cells were}} examined under a light microscope {{to evaluate the}} effect of prolonged exposure (at least two-cell cycle) to 5 -aminouracil (5 -AU) on mitotic cell division in the roots. The results are a cytological demonstration that a lower concentration of 5 -AU than usually employed for synchronizing proliferating cells in A. cepa root meristems induces chromosomal abnormalities and formation of micronucleus but does not fully block the cell flow into mitosis, and that <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> can proceed in mitosis {{and contribute to the}} enhancement of root length values reported by other authors. A. cepa root tip cells seems to support a certain damage level in DNA (around 10 % of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> in mitosis) without having any negative effect on cellular proliferation and growth of the roots. This genetic flexibility of vegetable genomes may permit an attenuation of the adaptative metabolic-response to sustained adverse environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The health {{complexities}} caused due {{to tobacco}} smoking {{has not been}} restricted to any geographic region and has spread worldwide. As the oral mucosal cells, which line the oral cavity are the first barrier, they represent the preferred target site for the early genotoxic events. Tobacco use {{is one of the}} most important aetiological factors in initiation of oral cancer as it increases the risk of cancer by exposing the buccal mucosal to the carcinogenic chemicals either through inhalation or by ingestion. Micronuclei are round to oval cytoplasmic chromatin mass, which occurs as a result of segregation defects due to chromosomal instability causing chromatin to be excluded from the reformed nucleus. Micronuclei assay in exfoliated buccal cells is a useful and less invasive method for monitoring genetic damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 100 male subjects (50 smokers, 50 non-smokers) were examined. Buccal smears were wet fixed and stained with pap stain. 100 cells per slide were counted and assessed for micronuclei count. T-test and Pearson correlation was used as a statistical tool for analysis. RESULTS Significantly, smokers had higher percentage of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> (T- 5. 865); P (0. 000), total number of micronuclei (T- 6. 713); P (0. 000) and mean micronuclei count (T- 5. 865); P (0. 000) than non-smokers. Pack years correlated significantly and positively with mean micronuclei count. However, pack year did not have significant relation with percentage of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> and total number of micronuclei. CONCLUSION The genotoxic effects of tobacco smoke cause chromosomal damage in the epithelial cells of buccal mucosa and are reflected in the increased micronuclei in smokers. Micronuclei assay can be used as a simple and reliable marker for genotoxic evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The clastogenic {{effects on}} DNA, proven by the {{presence}} of micronuclei (MN) and the protective cellular mechanisms normally used to stabilize DNA breaks were investigated in three subsets of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). The frequency of MN found in cultures of peripheral lymphocytes in patients with anticentromere and antitopoisomerase I antibodies was significantly higher than that in the control group. The group with anticentromere antibody showed a significantly higher frequency of MN than did the subjects with antitopoisomerase antibody (4. 22 % versus 2. 34 %, P < 0. 001). Patients with anti-RNA polymerase III, instead, had a low prevalence of typical <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> (0. 98 %), not significantly {{different from that of the}} healthy controls (0. 82 %). Moreover, when MN was characterized for the presence or absence of DNA fragments with free 3 '-OH ends by digoxigenin-dUTP (DIG-dUTP) using terminal deoxynucleotidil transferase, its frequency was found to be increased in the groups with anticentromere and antitopoisomerase I antibodies with respect to that in the controls. The increase was significantly higher in the lymphocytes of the patients with anticentromere than in those with antitopoisomerase I antibody (35 % versus 20. 08 %, P < 0. 001). Nonetheless, the prevalence of unstable DNA fragments in patients with anti-RNA polymerase III antibody was low (2. 05 %) and not significantly different from that of the control group (1. 18 %). Our results indicate that there is a clastogenic effect on DNA and an interference in the protective cellular mechanisms normally stabilizing DNA breaks only in some subsets of SSc patients. The clastogenic effects on DNA, proven {{by the presence}} of micronuclei (MN), and the protective cellular mechanisms normally used to stabilize DNA breaks were investigated in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). The frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> found in cultures of peripheral lymphocytes in patients was significantly higher than in the control group. The patient group with anti-centromere antibodies showed a significantly higher frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> than that observed in the patients with anti-topoisomerase I antibodies (4. 22 % versus 2. 34 %, p < 0. 001). Moreover, we attempted to characterize MN for the presence or absence of DNA fragments with free 3 '-OH ends by digoxigenin-dUTP (DIG-dUTP) using terminal deoxynucleotidil transferase. It was found that the frequency of MN containing DNA fragments with 3 '-OH free ends (unstable fragments) increased in SSc patients compared to that observed in the control group. Moreover, this increase was significantly higher in lymphocytes of the patients with anti-centromere antibodies than in those with anti-topoisomerase I antibodies (35 % versus 20. 08 %, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Phenols are a {{large and}} diverse class of compounds, many of which occur {{naturally}} {{in a variety of}} food plants; they exhibit a wide range of biological effects, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, hepatoprotective, antithrombotic, antiviral, anticarcinogenic, and vasodilatory actions. We examined the genotoxic and clastogenic potential of three phenolic compounds: caffeic, cinnamic and ferulic acids, using the comet and micronucleus assays in vitro. Drug-metabolizing rat hepatoma tissue cells (HTCs) were used. Three different concentrations (50, 500 and 1500 mu M) of these phenolic acids were tested on the HTCs for 24 h. The caffeic, cinnamic and ferulic acids were not genotoxic by the comet assay (P > 0. 05).

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{cytogenetic damage}} {{by measuring the}} frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> <b>cells</b> (MNC) in peripheral blood and buccal mucosa of head-and-neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. MNC frequencies were assessed in 31 patients before, during, and after radiotherapy, and in 17 C, healthy controls matched for gender, age, and smoking habits. Results showed {{no statistically significant difference}} between patients and controls prior to radiotherapy in cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes or buccal mucosa cells. During treatment, increased MNC frequencies were observed in both <b>cell</b> types. <b>Micronucleated</b> lymphocyte levels remained high in samples collected 30 to 140 days after the end of treatment, while MNC frequency in buccal mucosa decreased to values statistically similar to baseline values. There is controversy over the effects of age, smoking habit, tumor stage, and/or metastasis on MNC frequency. However, increased frequency of <b>micronucleated</b> buccal mucosa <b>cells</b> was seen in patients under 60 years old and in those with tumors > 4 cm. In conclusion, the data show that radiotherapy has a potent clastogenic effect in Circulating lymphocytes and buccal mucosa cells of head-and-neck cancer patients, and that the baseline MNC frequency in these two tissues is not a sensitive marker for head-and neck neoplasm...|$|R
