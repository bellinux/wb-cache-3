40|$|Knowledge {{regarding}} {{particle deposition}} {{processes in the}} nasal cavity is important in aerosol therapy and inhalation toxicology applications. This paper presents a comparative study of the deposition of micron and submicron particles under different steady laminar flow rates using a Lagrangian approach. A computational model of a nasal cavity geometry was developed from CT scans and the simulation of the fluid and particle flow within the airway was performed using the commercial software GAMBIT and FLUENT. The air flow patterns in the nasal cavities and the detailed local deposition patterns of micron and submicron particles were presented and discussed. It {{was found that the}} majority of <b>micron</b> <b>particles</b> are deposited near the nasal valve region and some <b>micron</b> <b>particles</b> are deposited on the septum wall in the turbinate region. The deposition patterns of <b>micron</b> <b>particles</b> in the left cavity are different compared with that in the right one especially in the turbinate regions. In contrast, the deposition for nanoparticles shows a moderately even distribution of particles throughout the airway. Furthermore the particles releasing position obviously influences the local deposition patterns. The influence of the particle releasing position is mainly shown near the nasal valve region for micron particle deposition, while for submicron particles deposition, both the nasal valve and turbinate region are influenced.

40|$|Examination of LDEF's various {{surfaces}} shows numerous craters {{and holes}} due to hypervelocity impacts of meteoroids and man-made orbital debris. In this paper, the crater numbers {{as reported by}} Humes have been analyzed {{in an effort to}} understand the orbital debris and natural meteoroid environment in LEO. To determine the fraction of man-made to natural impacts, the side to top ratio of impacts and results of the Chemistry of Micrometeoroids Experiment are used. For craters in the 100 micron to 500 micron size range, about 25 percent to 30 percent of the impacts on the forward-facing surfaces and about 10 percent of the impacts on the trailing surfaces were estimated due to man-made orbital debris. A technique has been developed to convert crater numbers to particle fluxes, taking the fact into account that the distributions of impact velocity and incidence angle vary over the different surfaces of LDEF, as well as the ratio of the surface area flux to the cross-sectional area flux. Applying this technique, Humes' data concerning craters with limiting lip diameters of 100 micron, 200 micron and 500 micron have been converted into orbital debris and meteoroid fluxes ranging from about 20 micron to 200 <b>micron</b> <b>particle</b> diameter. The results exhibit good agreement with orbital debris model and meteoroid model. The converted meteoroid flux is slightly larger than Grun's model (by 40 to 70 percent).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} influences of electrostatic charge, flow, delay, and multiple actuations on the in vitro delivery of salbutamol generated by a pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) from small volume spacers used in infants. METHODS: Ten actuations from a salbutamol pMDI were drawn at different flow rates after either single or multiple actuations, with or without delay, through either static or reduced static spacers. An ionic detergent was used to reduce the charge of plastic spacers (Babyhaler, Babyspacer, Aerochamber, Nebuhaler). Electrostatic charge was measured using an electrometer. A multistage liquid impinger {{was used to determine}} the particle size distribution of the output of the pMDI through the spacers. RESULTS: Electrostatic charge on the surface of plastic spacers had the greatest influence on delivery, causing a decrease in drug delivery. Reducing charge by coating the surface with ionic detergent resulted in an increase of 46. 5 - 71. 1 % (p < 0. 001) in small (< 6. 8 <b>microns)</b> <b>particle</b> delivery from small volume plastic spacers. Lower flow, delay, and multiple actuations resulted in decreased delivery from static spacers. Lower flow resulted in a decrease of 15 % in small (< 9. 6 <b>microns)</b> <b>particle</b> delivery. Delay and multiple actuations resulted in a decrease of 40. 7 % and 76. 0 %, respectively, in small (< 6. 8 <b>microns)</b> <b>particle</b> delivery. The influences of lower flow, delay, and multiple actuations were greatly reduced or even eliminated by reducing charge. However, multiple actuations still resulted in a significant decreased delivery (p < 0. 05). The reduced static Nebuhaler had a higher delivery than all small volume spacers. CONCLUSIONS: Electrostatic charge has a major influence on the delivery of salbutamol from small volume spacers. Using a metal spacer or ionic detergent coating of plastic spacers resulted in no or reduced charge and hence in improved delivery. Lower flow, delay, and multiple actuations played a major part only in static spacers...|$|R
