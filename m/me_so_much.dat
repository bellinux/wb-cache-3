500|$|Hull was {{remembered by}} his comrades as an {{exceptional}} pilot and an affable, jovial personality. Jimmy Beedle, in his 1966 history of No.43 Squadron, called Hull {{one of its}} all-time great characters, citing him as {{a major factor in}} the squadron's [...] "high standard of flying and... outstanding squadron spirit". John Simpson, who joined the unit as a pilot officer two months after Hull, recalled finding [...] "a confidence when flying with Caesar that was wholly lacking otherwise." [...] "I have never seen anyone who could throw a fighter about with so much confidence as old Caesar," [...] said another pilot, quoted by Beedle. [...] "Nobody gave <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> confidence to have a lead from, nobody gave <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> exhilaration and fun. Following Caesar you found yourself getting more out of your machine than you had ever imagined was possible, doing things that done by yourself would have made your hair stand on end." ...|$|E

"My {{makeup artist}} {{showed me the}} {{performance}} of Lorella Cuccarini a year ago, and it inspired <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> I then met with the talented people who worked on it. The technology and concept were so genius. She was inspired after discovering Cuccarini's performance online. Thank God for YouTube or I would have never been exposed to something so inspiring. I never worked so hard on anything in my life as that performance for the Billboard Awards." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson owed his vocal {{technique}} {{in large part}} to Diana Ross, especially his use of the oooh interjection, which he used from a young age; Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: [...] "I got to know her well. She taught <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang – just the way she was." [...] He told her: [...] "I want to be just like you, Diana." [...] She said: [...] "You just be yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with BBC's DJ Semtex, Jay said he didn't mean the verses as a personal attack. [...] "I didn't know that [...] wasn't {{on the table for}} discussion!" [...] he said. [...] "I didn't know I was the first person ever to say that..." [...] He continued, [...] "When I say things, I think people believe <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that they take it a different way — it's, like, not rap anymore at that point. I say some great things about him in the book I have coming out [...] — that's wasn't a cheap plug," [...] he laughed. [...] "He's gonna be embarrassed, I said some really great things about him and people's perception of him. But it is what it is, he took it that wrong way, and I didn't know I said anything wrong!" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] {{became a}} Radio Disney hit, {{remaining}} at number one for 12 weeks. The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> exposure. It's great because people have grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually inspired me to do my own musical animated artist {{because a lot of people}} thought I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, the Whitney Museum held a {{retrospective}} of her work, Yoko Ono: Objects, Films, marking Ono's reentry into the New York art world after a hiatus. At {{the suggestion of}} Ono's live-in companion at the time, [...] interior decorator Sam Havadtoy, she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. [...] "I realized that for something to move <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that I would cry, there's something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it's the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way - solidity, commodity, all of that. For someone who went through the 60s revolution, there has of course been an incredible change[...] [...] [...] I call the pieces petrified bronze. That freedom, all the hope and wishes are in some ways petrified." ...|$|E
500|$|Bodie Chandler {{directed}} {{music for}} Quest, and Gary Lionelli, Thomas Chase, Stephen Rucker, Lawrence H. Brown, Guy Moon, Kevin Kiner, Christophe Beck, and Mark Koval wrote incidental music and cues. Lionelli conceived a new main theme {{based on the}} original 1960s Jonny Quest theme by Hoyt Curtin. Composer Guy Moon considered working for the show the [...] "hardest thing I've done in my life" [...] due to the producers' demands for epic music: [...] "They want a big orchestra with a good synth rig... It's great because they push <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> I'll probably replace my whole demo reel with 'Jonny Quest' music... It's hip and it's current." [...] Stephen Rucker and Thomas Chase (who later composed in The Powerpuff Girls) used MIDI to facilitate composing. Chase appreciated the producers' commitment to scoring, noting, [...] "For many kids, animation music is their first exposure to orchestral music." ...|$|E

500|$|Wagner's {{fortunes}} took {{a dramatic}} upturn in 1864, when King Ludwig II succeeded {{to the throne}} of Bavaria {{at the age of}} 18. The young king, an ardent admirer of Wagner's operas, had the composer brought to Munich. The King, who was homosexual, expressed in his correspondence a passionate personal adoration for the composer, and Wagner in his responses had no scruples about counterfeiting a similar atmosphere. Ludwig settled Wagner's considerable debts, and proposed to stage Tristan, Die Meistersinger, the Ring, and the other operas Wagner planned. Wagner also began to dictate his autobiography, Mein Leben, at the King's request. Wagner noted that his rescue by Ludwig coincided with news of the death of his earlier mentor (but later supposed enemy) Giacomo Meyerbeer, and regretted that [...] "this operatic master, who had done <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> harm, should not have lived to see this day." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2001, {{during his}} {{extensive}} promotion for the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass, Harrison named [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] among his three favourite tracks on the album. The electronic press kit accompanying the release included {{a scene where}} Harrison plays back the song at his Friar Park studio and isolates {{certain parts of the}} recording in turn, such as the backing vocals and slide guitars. In the CD booklet, Harrison's liner notes conclude with a thank-you to [...] "the amazing Mr. Phil Spector" [...] and the acknowledgement: [...] "He helped <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to get this record made. In his company I came to realise the true value of the Hare Krishna Mantra." [...] The Pope-related lyrics in [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] were again omitted from the booklet; they similarly do not appear on the lyric sheet supplied with the 2014 Apple Years reissue.|$|E
500|$|On 19 September 1819, Keats walked near Winchester {{along the}} River Itchen. In {{a letter to}} his friend John Hamilton Reynolds written on 21 September, Keats {{described}} the impression the scene had made upon him and its influence on the composition of [...] "To Autumn": [...] "How beautiful the season is now [...] How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it [...] I never lik'd stubble fields so much as now [...] Somehow a stubble plain looks warm [...] {{in the same way that}} some pictures look warm [...] this struck <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in my sunday's walk that I composed upon it." [...] Not everything on Keats's mind at the time was bright; the poet knew in September that he would have to finally abandon Hyperion. Thus, in the letter that he wrote to Reynolds, Keats also included a note saying that he abandoned his long poem. Keats did not send [...] "To Autumn" [...] to Reynolds, but did include the poem within a letter to Richard Woodhouse, Keats's publisher and friend, and dated it on the same day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whom can I find?" [...] said Herbert. [...] "There's {{my father}} away, and Raymond ill, and Lipscombe waved <b>me</b> off--wouldn't <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as {{speak to me}} for fear I should be infectious." ...|$|R

500|$|... "East to West" [...] is a {{contemporary}} Christian song lasting four minutes and 26 seconds. It {{was written in}} common time in the key of F minor at a tempo of 73 beats per minute. The vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of D4 to the high note of F5. Lyrically, [...] "East to West" [...] deals {{with the concept of}} forgiveness, and the doubt that God forgives and forgets all sin. Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall explained that: [...] "We have a hard time with the concept of forgiveness. We cut ourselves and it heals, but the scar remains. Sometimes we think God treats sin like we would if we were God, and that he handles forgiveness like we would. We know he forgives, but we can't accept that God chooses to forget and relinquishes his right to avenge. That's what we're singing about in 'East To West'". In a separate interview, Hall elaborated on that theme, commenting that: [...] "I see forgiveness as God giving away His right to revenge in my life. He loved <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that He’s choosing to remember that against me no more, all because of Jesus".|$|E
500|$|After Myers had {{completed}} providing the {{voice for the}} character, when the film was well into production, he asked to re-record all of his lines with a Scottish accent, similar to that his mother used {{when she told him}} bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films, such as So I Married an Axe Murderer and [...] According to the DVD commentary, he had also tried using country and Canadian accents. After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, [...] "It was so good we took $4m worth of animation out and did it again." [...] A point Myers disputes, saying [...] "it didn’t cost the studio “millions of dollars,” as rumored. “What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, I went in for twenty sessions. I got paid the same.". [...] Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to come. There were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits. [...] "I got a letter from Spielberg thanking <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for caring about the character," [...] Myers said. [...] "And he said the Scottish accent had improved the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. James Hunt {{reviewed}} the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in January 2013. He was surprised by the episode as he [...] "went in expecting something that was typically season one awful, and got something that was actually a lot of fun". [...] He thought that the theme of symbiosis between man and machine was [...] "interesting", stating it was the best episode up until that point in season one and one of the best of the season overall. Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club in May 2010. He too was surprised by what he found. Handlen said that [...] "last time I saw it, I thought Riker and Minuet's interactions were cheesy as hell. They didn't bother <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> now, because they don't go on very long, and there's something hilarious about a man trying to seduce a computer simulation designed to respond to his seductions". But he said, [...] "I had fun with this, which I wasn't expecting", and [...] "thought this was solid". He gave the episode a B grade.|$|E

500|$|Several of the family's storylines were criticised and branded as {{unbelievable}} {{and poorly}} researched, {{and they were}} cited {{as one of the}} main reasons viewing figures for the show dropped to a low of 6.2 million. One columnist for the Daily Mirror wrote, [...] "Never has a family bored <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> During their transplant saga I nearly donated a kidney myself to end the turgid tale. Get rid of 'em." [...] Fans called for the family to be axed, and an editorial on the Daily Mirror stated: [...] "The Ferreiras' father, Dan, was probably not just the worst character in soap, but the most annoying, unlikeable person on all television. Inveterate gambler, Ash and daughter Kareena are mere ciphers while Adi is just weird – like a gay version of a character from Rainbow. Ronny Ferreira, meanwhile, [...] presided over the most boring storyline in EastEnders history when viewers spent several weeks watching him lying in bed growing a beard (i.e. waiting for a kidney transplant). The fact that the Ferreiras still haven't been axed shows how indecisive and complacent the show's executives have become." [...] However, a poll on radio station BBC Asian Network found that 75% of respondents wanted the family to stay.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Dev {{recorded}} {{two songs}} using the software GarageBand on her MacBook {{that a friend}} posted onto her Myspace page. Production duo The Cataracs, consisting of Niles Hollowell-Dhar and David Singer-Vine, came across the songs and asked Dev to come to Berkeley, California to produce music with them. Six months later, the first song they made together, [...] "2night", gained exposure on the television channel MTVU and local radio channels, {{which resulted in a}} debut on the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart. In 2009, Dev signed with Indie-Pop Records and moved to a loft in Los Angeles, California to begin working on her debut album. The Cataracs eventually made the beat for a song called [...] "Booty Bounce". Afterwards, a hook was written for the song and The Cataracs suggested to interpolate it into a track they were making for Far East Movement. Dev agreed to what would become [...] "Like a G6", and later said, [...] "It ended up being a massive song and gave <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> experience and opportunity and it was absolutely beautiful. Thank god I agreed to that!" [...] The song was released in April 2010 and reached the top ten on several charts worldwide, including the United States, where it reached the top position and sold over three million copies. In August 2010, Dev issued a viral music video for [...] "Booty Bounce" [...] and subsequently signed a record deal with Universal Republic two months later.|$|E
500|$|In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a {{line from}} a first night review of his {{performance}} as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: [...] "Mr Barrington is wonderful. [...] He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar." [...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one has just come out of the stalls to tell me you are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that I have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E
