40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fully experimental study on melting, flow and weld strength development during ultrasonic welding of CF/PPS composites with integrated triangular energy directors. The main {{goal of this}} research was assessing whether the heating time to achieve <b>maximum</b> <b>weld</b> strength could be significantly reduced as compared to ultrasonic welding with flat energy directors. The main conclusion is that, in the specific case under study, the triangular energy directors did heat up, melt and collapse approximately two times faster than the time it took for the flat energy directors to melt and significantly flow. However the heating time needed to achieve <b>maximum</b> <b>weld</b> strength for the integrated triangular energy directors did not differ drastically from that for flat energy directors. This was caused by the fact that a fully welded overlap was not directly achieved right after the collapsing of the triangular energy directors. Instead a solidified resin-rich interface was created which needed to be re-melted as a whole in order to achieve a fully welded overlap and hence <b>maximum</b> <b>weld</b> strength. </p...|$|R

40|$|In tandem {{gas metal arc}} (GMA) welding, it is {{important}} to prevent adverse effects caused by electromagnetic interference between the two adjacent arcs to create good metal transfer. In the tandem pulsed GMA welding system, newly developed by the authors, pulse peak currents are fed simultaneously to the leading and trailing electrodes in principle and a unique pulse timing control is employed in which the end of a pulse peak current for the trailing wire is delayed by 0. 5 ms from that for the leading wire to prevent the arc extinguishing By using the tandem pulsed GMA welding system, the effects of the inter-wire distance, inclination angle and welding current (wire feed rate) ratio between the two wires have been investigated to study the essential requirements for the welding torch configuration and the allocation of welding currents to obtain sound weld beads with the absence of undercut and humping in the high speed welding of steel sheets. When the welding speed was 3 m/min, a sound weld bead with uniform width was obtained with the trailing wire set at 9 -degree push angle regardless of the inclination angle of the leading wire. The inter-wire distance greatly affected the weld bead formation in high speed welding. That is, the <b>maximum</b> <b>welding</b> speed was improved with the proper inter-wire distance in the range 9 to 12 mm.
