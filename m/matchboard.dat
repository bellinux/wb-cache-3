500|$|Inside {{some of the}} houses, Bathurst writes, {{everyday}} objects {{still remain}} where they were left decades ago; [...] "the bed and the limed <b>matchboard</b> ceiling are intact, untouched even by the damp. The kitchen table still stands in the parlour and a framed and fading photograph gazes out {{from the top of}} the mantelpiece." [...] In another house seen 20 years earlier by Leslie Thomas, [...] "was a rank of family photographs, shades in Victorian dress staring out forever into a room now desolate and holed, but which had once held the life of a warm family." ...|$|E
60|$|A sort of solemn embarrassment {{had come}} over Mr. Travers. Mrs. Travers, leaning her chin on {{the palm of her}} hand, stared at the bare <b>matchboard</b> side of the hut.|$|E
60|$|I moved {{towards the}} parlour door. A voice discoursing {{on the other}} side (it was but a <b>matchboard</b> partition), rose so loudly that the {{concluding}} words became quite plain in all their atrocity.|$|E

50|$|Inside, the {{fireplace}} uses several colors of granite, flanked with original iron radiators. It is complemented by dark oak <b>matchboards</b> over the stucco, laid to simulate paneling {{and form a}} dado. Further ornamentation includes a double frieze at ceiling level.|$|R

[...] "Come on, boys! Kick it! Beat it! It's only <b>matchboarding,</b> and it is giving. Smash it down! Well done! Once more all together! There she goes! Now for the side! Out with it! Splendid!" ...|$|R
6000|$|An hour passed, and {{the downstairs}} {{rooms at the}} hotel grew dim and were almost deserted, while the little box-like squares above them were brilliantly irradiated. Some forty or fifty {{people were going to}} bed. The thump of jugs set down on the floor above could be heard and the clink of china, for there was not as thick a {{partition}} between the rooms as one might wish, so Miss Allan, the elderly lady who had been playing bridge, determined, giving the wall a smart rap with her knuckles. It was only <b>matchboard,</b> she decided, run up to make many little rooms of one large one. Her grey petticoats slipped to the ground, and, stooping, she folded her clothes with neat, if not loving fingers, screwed her hair into a plait, wound her father's great gold watch, and opened the complete works of Wordsworth. She was reading the [...] "Prelude," [...] partly because she always read the [...] "Prelude" [...] abroad, and partly because she was engaged in writing a short Primer of English Literature--Beowulf to Swinburne--which would have a paragraph on Wordsworth. She was deep in the fifth book, stopping indeed to pencil a note, when a pair of boots dropped, one after another, on the floor above her. She looked up and speculated. Whose boots were they, she wondered. She then became aware of a swishing sound next door--a woman, clearly, putting away her dress. It was succeeded by a gentle tapping sound, such as that which accompanies hair-dressing. It was very difficult to keep her attention fixed upon the [...] "Prelude." [...] Was it Susan Warrington tapping? She forced herself, however, to read {{to the end of the}} book, when she placed a mark between the pages, sighed contentedly, and then turned out the light.|$|E
50|$|<b>Matchboard</b> {{was most}} {{popular in the}} late Victorian period, when {{woodworking}} machinery had developed that could cut the edge joints quickly and cheaply. In the 1930s, further developments in glues and veneer-cutting machinery made plywood affordable. This also gave a cleanly smooth-surfaced Modernist look that suited the taste for new styles. <b>Matchboard</b> then became much less popular. In the 1970s there was a resurgence {{of interest in the}} style as a retro feature, but this was usually provided, for cost reasons, as a faux <b>matchboard</b> effect pressed into the surface of a plywood board.|$|E

50|$|So-named {{after the}} White Grit lead mines. This {{is to the}} North- East of the village and was built to serve the mining {{community}} which was just over the border in Shropshire. The Mission Church is a corrugated iron tabernacle of the later19th century. It has an apsidal east end, with Gothic windows and a corrugated iron bellcote. The <b>matchboarded</b> interior with its fittings survives.|$|R
50|$|The {{north and}} east {{elevations}} are dominated by the double storey verandah. The posts are timber although those on the extremities have been replaced with steel columns. At first floor level there is a two-rail dowel balustrade over a deep, scalloped, valance formed from tongue-and-groove <b>matchboards</b> and decorative fretwork brackets. Four bays of the balustrade have been replaced with galvanised iron sheet {{and most of the}} fretwork brackets are missing. Where the building has been extended the veranda is fully enclosed with adjustable timber louvres.|$|R
60|$|Marston lounged with languid {{satisfaction}} on {{a locker}} in the stern cabin. He had borne some strain {{and his body}} felt strangely slack although his brain was active. The cabin was small and very plain, because the yacht had been altered below decks when she was fitted for carrying cargo. Moisture trickled down the <b>matchboarded</b> ceiling, big warm drops fell from the beams, and a brass lamp swung about as she rolled. Marston, however, knew this was an illusion; the beams moved but the lamp was still.|$|R
50|$|<b>Matchboard</b> {{is a type}} {{of wooden}} board that connects with others using a tongue and groove or a half lap system.|$|E
50|$|Matchboarding {{has been}} used for both {{decorative}} wooden panelling indoors and also as outdoor cladding. The edge joints of <b>matchboard</b> are more waterproof than a crude butt joint and they also act to stabilise the board edges against warping.|$|E
50|$|The West Haven Baptist Church {{stands in}} an open field {{on the west side}} of Book Road, just south of its {{junction}} with Main Road, the principal east-west route through the rural community. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a mortared limestone foundation. A gabled vestibule projects from the front (east-facing) facade, with a center entrance flanked by Gothic arched windows. A squat two-stage square tower rises, straddling the line between the main block and vestibule, with a louvered belfry as the second stage, and a flat top above. The vestibule interior is finished in beadboard, while the main sanctuary has vertical <b>matchboard</b> below a chair rail, and horizontal <b>matchboard</b> above. Lines of stencilwork adorn the walls.|$|E
60|$|The {{hall was}} large and square, with <b>matchboarded</b> walls and a pointed roof. In an open hearth a log fire burned cheerily, {{although}} two large windows were opened wide to let in the September air. Bunches of wheat and oats of unusual growth hung upon the walls, suggesting the settlers' occupation; but it was significant that the grain was surmounted by a row of the heads of prairie antelope, as well as moose and caribou from the North. They were farmers at Allenwood, but they were sportsmen first.|$|R
60|$|Carlyon's {{room was}} unusually well furnished, and several fine London guns {{occupied}} a rack on the <b>matchboarded</b> wall. The cost of {{one would have}} purchased {{a dozen of the}} Massachusetts-made weapons which the prairie farmers used. The photograph of a horseman in English hunting dress with M.F.H. appended to the autograph was equally suggestive, and it was known that Carlyon's people had sent him to Canada with money enough to make a fair start. Unfortunately, he had not realized that success in farming demands care and strenuous work.|$|R
60|$|While Broadwood and Kenwyne were {{discussing}} {{him on the}} hillside, Colonel Mowbray sat in his study at the Grange, talking to the elder of his two sons. The room was small and plainly furnished, with {{a map of the}} territory on the <b>matchboarded</b> wall, a plain table on which lay a few bundles of neatly docketed papers, and a stove in one corner. Account-books filled a shelf, and beneath there was a row of pigeonholes. The room had an air of austere simplicity with which Colonel Mowbray's appearance harmonized.|$|R
50|$|Back in {{the early}} 2000s, when there was {{skepticism}} about online matrimony and fear about paying online, the company pioneered doorstep collections in India. The company introduced features on their website like <b>Matchboard,</b> SoulMate Search, AstroMatch, and Express Interest to help customers make the right matches.|$|E
50|$|Upstairs are the bedrooms. Generally more subdued, {{they are}} {{distinguished}} by their fireplaces. Each is {{in a different}} style, from Classical to Queen Anne. The bathroom has its original tile, with decorative bands under bull-nosed caps. The attic, designed as servants' quarters, is plain except for an elliptical room done in varnished <b>matchboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} hall {{is a simple}} space with a non-original door and sidelights. The walls are horizontal boards and the ceiling is tongue and groove <b>matchboard.</b> The staircase is comparatively elaborate with very large newel posts and contrasts with the general plainness of the building. The window at the landing is glazed with decorative glass.|$|E
60|$|There were {{confused}} noises. Water washed about inside the lurching hull, although a sharp clank overhead indicated that somebody was occupied at the pump; water gurgled, with a noise like rolling gravel, outside the planks. Timbers groaned, a seam in the <b>matchboarding</b> opened and shut, and a dull concussion shook the boat when her bows {{plunged into the}} swell. The swell was high, although the wind had dropped. Marston knew these noises and found them soothing. They belonged to the sea, and he loved the sea, although he had not long since fought it for his life. Now the strain was over, he felt the struggle with the tornado had braced and steadied him.|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} after the council, Beatrice, Colonel Mowbray's only daughter, sat talking with her mother in the drawing-room at the Grange. Beatrice had {{returned}} on the previous evening from a visit to England, and it struck her, perhaps by contrast with the homes of her mother's friends, that the room had a dingy, cheerless look. The few pieces of good furniture which Mowbray had brought with him had suffered during transport and showed signs of age; the others, sent out from Toronto, were crudely new. Rugs and curtains were faded, and there were places that had been carefully mended. The <b>matchboarded</b> walls looked very bare. More than all, it struck the girl that her mother seemed listless and worn.|$|R
50|$|The Smith House {{is set on}} the {{northwest}} side of Summer Street, between it and Main Street (United States Route 202), overlooking Bangor's historic waterfront area. The house is a 2-1/2 story structure, with brick side walls, a <b>matchboarded</b> front facade, and clapboarded rear. It has a roof with the gable oriented toward the front, projecting over the front facade with four large fluted Ionic columns supporting it and an entablature. The gable end is fully pedimented, and is detailed with dentil moulding. A semi-oval fanlight window {{is located in the}} center of the recessed tympanum at the gable's center. The front facade behind this temple front has pilasters at the corner and dividing its three bays, with its center entrance flanked by sidelight windows. The side walls are essentially identical, each with a pair of brick chimneys rising above.|$|R
5000|$|Queens Parade {{was built}} in 1897 by James Edmundson. The shop front dates from the 1930s. It was {{designated}} as a listed building with Historic England in 2009 as a [...] "rare example of a late-Victorian or Edwardian grocery shop interior with <b>matchboard</b> panelling, mahogany shelving and counter and metal storage bins with mahogany lids".|$|E
5000|$|English Heritage {{note that}} in the {{original}} building (the unexpanded pub), the lower bars, named the [...] "Snug" [...] and [...] "Committee Room" [...] respectively contain 1930s fireplaces and <b>matchboard</b> panelling, and that between these two areas lies a central bar, which is enclosed by sliding sashes with glazing bars, and are [...] "perhaps a mixture of late C18 and 1930s work". Behind this lies a circa 1700 dog-leg stairway [...] "with turned balusters on a closed string".|$|E
5000|$|Porter Hall, {{built in}} 1902, {{is a fine}} example of Greek Revival architecture. It has a colonnaded temple front, <b>matchboard</b> siding, and gable roof. Four Corinthian columns support a frieze with words [...] "Hall in the Grove", above which the fully pedimented gable end has the words [...] "Porter Hall" [...] above a lamp motif. The facade is three bays wide, with a center {{double-door}} flanked by sash windows. This building houses the association's library and research facilities.|$|E
50|$|The Cutting-Kent House {{is located}} {{just in a}} {{residential}} area just northeast of Bangor's downtown, at {{the northwest corner of}} Penobscot and Pine Streets. It consists of a large two-story wood frame main block, to which additions have been made to the rear. The main block has elaborate and distinctive Greek Revival styling. Its front facade (facing south toward Penobscot street) has four bays recessed behind <b>matchboarded</b> walls headed by Doric pilasters. The first-floor bays have fluted Doric columns at each side, topped by carved wreaths. The center bays house the two unit entrances, and the outer bays have full-length windows; these all have flanking sidelight windows, and the window bays have wrought iron railings across the front. The upper level window bays also have ornate railings across the bays. The first floor of each side has a rounded window bay topped by a railing similar to the second-floor railings of the front. There is a dentillated cornice line between the floors and above the second floor, with a frieze board above that is punctuated by window openings covered with painted metal grillwork. The roof is a low-pitch hip roof. The rear additions added to each unit date to later in the 19th century, and are not as architecturally sophisticated.|$|R
50|$|Unique in Montgomeryshire {{in that it}} is timber-built. Single-chamber, {{with south}} porch and west belfry; the {{original}} timber framed building is likely to be 15th or 16th century in date. It was restored in 1856 with an outer outer timber framed casing and brick nogging outside and <b>matchboarding</b> inside. The church was restored again in September 2014 and this revealed that where the original timber-framing was intact, wooden panels were used to infill the framework, rather than the normal wattle and daub. Possibly at a later date lathes had been nailed to the framing, and this had then been torched, so that the outside of the church, before the 1856 restoration, would have presented a smooth rendered surface. The church has simple 19th-century cusped timber windows. The 15th-century roof of principals and arched braces has two tiers of trefoiled wind-braces. Every other truss was strengthened with a tie-beam, now sawn off, and replaced with iron tie rods. The flagstone floor is inset with C17 and C18 memorial slabs at the East end.The square wooden bell turret has a slatted lower stage and a second stage consisting of two square-headed louvred apertures in each face. There is a pyramidal slate roof surmounted by a wrought iron weathervane.The truss at the west end defines the position of the former gallery, which was originally reached by a ladder stair set in the north-west corner. Four modern chamfered uprights support what is now the bell turret. Behind these the ceiling slopes downwards broken only by the window aperture above. The front of the bell turret, formerly the gallery, has close-set studs, plastered between, with a large thick beam for the top rail.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} located east of Bangor's central {{business}} district at {{the southwest corner of}} State Street (United States Route 2) and Birch Street. It is a rambling three-story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof that has a flared eave, and <b>matchboard</b> siding treated to resemble stone. At the center of the north-facing front is a broad bellcast dormer, emulating the curve of the mansard roof flare. The eaves are bracketed and dentillated, and windows are topped by bracketed cornices. The front entrance is sheltered by an elaborately decorated porch.|$|E
5000|$|The village pub is the New Inn. An {{historic}} pub {{interior of}} [...] "national importance" [...] Listed Status: Grade II. This red-brick hotel-cum-pub built in 1885 for the South Down & East Grinstead Brewery retains its plan-form and fittings virtually intact at present. The central entrance has 'Hotel Entrance' etched {{glass in the}} doors {{and to the right}} are a pair of doors leading to the public bar with one remaining 'Public Bar' etched panel. To be noted is the ceramic button with the figure '1' above the inside of the front doors - a requirement of licensing magistrates. The pub part is small with a long public bar fronting the main street (there was probably a screen dividing it originally) and one small room behind. The spartan public bar fittings are much as they were in Victorian times with a wood-block floor, a long Victorian counter with the front painted cream, bar back fitting with three large cash drawers (note two slots for notes) and four ceramic spirit barrels (note ‘I Whisky’ from the days before the fad of inserting an ‘e’ to distinguish the Irish from the Scottish variety). There are two sections of wall bench seating attached to <b>matchboard</b> dado panelling and a small early 20th century tiled fireplace with decoration on the wood surround and with a log fire. To be noted is the hatch on the left of the servery for customers of the hotel and waiters who would have served the former restaurant. At the rear right is the snug, a small room which now has a carpet and is home to a bar billiards table, The <b>matchboard</b> dado panels have been painted white and service is via the original split doors with a hatch/shelf {{to the back of the}} bar. On the front left side of the building are twin currently out of use doors with ‘Hotel Entrance’ etched panels which lead into a corridor and off to the left is the former dining room with further <b>matchboard</b> panelling and an ornate cast-iron fireplace. The pub still retains its outside gents’ and ladies’.|$|E
50|$|The Cherryfield Academy {{building}} {{is located on}} the east side of Main Street in the center of Cherryfield. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a T-shaped cross-gable layout, end chimneys, and granite foundation. Its main facade faces south, and has the projecting leg of the T, which is a three-bay section topped by a square belfry. The section has a pair of entrances on the front, and further entrances on each side of the projection. The building's corners are pilasters, and most of its walls are finished in clapboard; the east and west ends are finished in <b>matchboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|On {{either side}} of the bed space, quarter-inch thick {{bevelled}} mirrors were common, and were lavishly decorated. Cupboards and locker seats were built in to prevent movement whilst travelling. Side and back windows were decorated and shuttered, and the body of the vardo itself would have originally been made from beaded tongue-and-groove <b>matchboard,</b> painted red picked out in yellow and green. As with other vardo, the extent of the elaborate decoration reflected the wealth of the family, boasting carved lion heads and gargoyles; these would have been painted gold or extensively decorated with gold leaf. Today, surviving Reading wagons are prized exhibits in museums or private collections.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{building}} was designed in an Italian Romanesque style by the architect Thomas Roger Smith and constructed in 1873. The four-storey building has five bays, and was built of brown and yellow stock brocks with buff banding and stucco details {{around the door}} and windows. Over the door is the motto [...] "Facts not Opinions". The heavy machine was installed on the ground floor, supported by brick piers in the basement. The testing room retains many of its original features, including fitted shelving and <b>matchboard</b> dado, with a ceiling held up by cast iron beams supported by four iron pillars. The basement houses a Denison machine for testing marine chains, acquired by Kirkaldy in 1906.|$|E
50|$|The Luppitt Inn is {{the only}} public house at Luppitt, Devon. Located in the front rooms of a farmhouse, the {{building}} is constructed from stone, rendered {{on one side and}} includes a tiled roof. The main house, still part of a working farm, was built in the early 19th century. The pub entrance is {{on the north side of}} the house, leading to a two-roomed pub. The serving room includes a simple counter made of <b>matchboard,</b> and some simple shelves, as well as a few seats, whilst the second room includes a brick fireplace. The toilets are outside, across the yard. The only table in the pub is covered in puzzles. The unique layout has meant that the pub is on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.|$|E
5000|$|John Bedford Leno was {{the first}} to reply and denounced the proposal, stating that it would surely lead to their [...] "discomfiture and transportation", and added that the {{government}} would surely hear of the plot. During subsequent speeches Leno noticed that only a <b>matchboard</b> partition divided the room they occupied, with another adjoining room, and that voices could be heard on the other side. Leno declared his attention to leave at once, the others agreed, and the room was soon cleared. The next day the meeting was fully reported in The Times, although Leno's speech had been attributed to George Odger, who had in fact supported Cluseret's proposal. Leno concluded {{that there had been a}} leak and that the traitor had been Robert Hartwell, the editor of The Bee-Hive journal.|$|E
