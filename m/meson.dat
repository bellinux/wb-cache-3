5|$|Measurements of the {{interaction}} between energetic photons and hadrons show that {{the interaction}} is much more intense than expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons {{in spite of the fact}} that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector <b>Meson</b> Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector <b>meson.</b> However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function. A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions was presented in a review in 2000.|$|E

25|$|With two {{particles}} {{now known}} with the intermediate mass, {{the more general}} term <b>meson</b> was adopted to refer to any such particle within the correct mass range between electrons and nucleons. Further, in order to differentiate between the {{two different types of}} mesons after the second <b>meson</b> was discovered, the initial mesotron particle was renamed the mu <b>meson</b> (the Greek letter μ (mu) corresponds to m), and the new 1947 <b>meson</b> (Yukawa's particle) was named the pi <b>meson.</b>|$|E

It is found that the energy density ε and pressure p will increase considering the <b>mesons</b> δ whereas will decrease as the <b>mesons</b> f and ϕ being considered. When the <b>mesons</b> f, ϕ and δ are considered, the energy density and pressure will all decrease. It is also found that the contribution of <b>mesons</b> f, ϕ and δ to the central energy density is only the central energy density's 0. 06 ∼ 0. 6 % whereas the contribution of <b>mesons</b> f, ϕ and δ to the central pressure is the central pressure's 4 ∼ 7 %. For the radius, it will decrease when the contributions of <b>mesons</b> f, ϕ and δ are considered. The moment of inertia I will increase considering the <b>mesons</b> δ whereas will decrease as the <b>mesons</b> f and ϕ being considered. When the <b>mesons</b> f, ϕ and δ are all considered, the moment of inertia will decrease. It is found that the contribution of <b>mesons</b> f and ϕ to moment of inertia is 4 ∼ 9 times larger than that of <b>mesons</b> δ.
