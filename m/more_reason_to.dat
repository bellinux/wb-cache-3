If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> develop aposematism.

5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E

5|$|Observations of the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} in life {{indicate that}} they were highly territorial. They presumably settled disputes by striking each other with their wings; to aid this purpose, they used the knobs on their wrists. Fractures in their wing bones also {{indicate that they}} were used in combat. It has also been suggested that these fractures {{may have been the}} result of a hereditary bone disease rather than battle-injuries. But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and knobs are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall and has more seasonal variation than Mauritius, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. Several accounts state that they also defended themselves with a powerful bite.|$|E

25|$|The ADVENT {{engine was}} {{originally}} targeted at the Air Force's 2018 Next-Generation Bomber, but uncertainty in that program has led Rolls-Royce (RR), {{one of the}} primary developers involved with the project, to predict that the ADVENT engine will be better suited for a potential 2020 engine upgrade for the F-35 Lightning II. RR, who is partnered with GE Aviation on the embattled F136 alternate engine for the F-35, has suggested that the ADVENT development contracts are all the <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> continue the F136, as any engine upgrade from Pratt & Whitney (makers of the F135 engine currently used in the F-35) would have to be separately funded, either internally or to additional government cost.|$|E

25|$|Although Cather {{began her}} writing {{career as a}} journalist, she made a {{distinction}} between journalism, which she saw as being primarily informative, and literature, which she saw as an art form. Cather's work is often marked by its nostalgic tone, her subject matter and themes drawn from memories of her early years on the American plains. Some critics have charged Cather with being {{out of touch with}} her times and failing to use more experimental techniques, such as stream of consciousness, in her writing. However, others have pointed out that Cather could follow no other literary path but her own: She had formed and matured her ideas on art before she wrote a novel. She had no <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> follow Gertrude Stein and James Joyce, whose work she respected, than they did to follow her. Her style solves the problems in which she was interested. She wanted to stand midway between the journalists whose omniscient objectivity accumulate more fact than any character could notice and the psychological novelist whose use of subjective point of view stories distorts objective reality. She developed her theory on a middle ground, selecting facts from experience on the basis of feeling and then presenting the experience in a lucid, objective style. Cather's style is not the accumulative cataloguing of the journalists, nor the fragmentary atomism of psychological associations.|$|E

However, recent literary criticism has labelled this claim as sexist and an unfortunate marginalization of the traumatic rape of Philomela.

[...] They also published a cartoon by Thomas Rowlandson entitled [...] "A Charm for a Democracy, Reviewed, Analysed, & Destroyed".

Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was [...] "absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it’s so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It’s important to a film like this—which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension—that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous."

The Wall Street Journals Dorothy Rabinowitz wrote that the [...] "standard caution is relevant—debut episodes tend to be highly polished.

Lowry said, [...] "Despite her success with Mean Girls, [...] Fey mostly hits too-familiar notes in the pilot. Moreover, she's a limited protagonist, which is problematic." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune criticized [...] "30Rock for being less {{than the sum of}} its parts, and, as an entry in the single-camera comedy sweepstakes, it fails to show either the inspired inventiveness of Arrested Development or provide the surprisingly perceptive character studies of The Office".|$|E

2500|$|At sixteen, then {{living on}} her own, Streisand's youth and {{ambition}} worked in her favor, but she lacked a mature woman's physical features which were needed for serious female roles. She therefore took various menial jobs {{to have some}} income. At one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping {{at the home of}} friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around to save on rent expense. When desperate, she would return to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother would be horrified by her daughter's [...] "gypsy-like lifestyle," [...] wrote biographer Karen Swenson, and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business; but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> keep trying: [...] "My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to my mother that I could be a star." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{system of}} {{government}} production and merchant distribution required a strong and adaptive bureaucracy. To begin with, the Ming government inherited from the Mongols not a unified national system but {{a dozen or more}} regional monopolies, each of which had a different production center, none of which was allowed to distribute salt to the others. [...] Officials tried to control production by continuing the Yuan system of registering hereditary salt producing households (竈户 zàohù). These families were not allowed to change their occupation or where they lived and were required to produce a yearly quota of salt (in the beginning, a little more than 3,000 catties). Initially, the government paid these saltern families with rice, then in the 15th century in paper money. By the 16th century the system broke down. Government monopoly salt was too expensive to compete with smuggled blackmarket salt, forcing officials to raise prices in order to meet their tax revenue quotas, making the government salt even less competitive and giving saltern families even <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> sell to smugglers. [...] Officials estimated that two-thirds of the salt in the Lianghuai region was contraband. A series of crises followed in which inland prices dropped too low for merchants to make a profit, armies on the frontier went without grain, and small mountains of salt might sit unused because officials impounded them for taxes then could not sell them.|$|E
