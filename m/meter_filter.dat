One of those is the natural sweetener stevia from the leaves of the stevia plant. One of the method to get the sweetener is byextracting the stevia leaf. However, after the process of extraction the solution turns brown due to tannins that contained in the stevia leaf. Oneof the processto eliminate tanninfrom the solution is by using activated carbon to absorb tannins. Materials used in this research is dried stevia leaves, water, activated carbon, and citric acid.

40|$|Abstract—Over the years, the {{petroleum}} and chemical industry has found increasing favor with 60 -Hz low-voltage (600 Vac) power systems that utilize a high-resistance grounded (HRG) neutral philosophy. Historically, {{the older generation}} of ad-justable-speed drives (ASDs) {{had little or no}} effect on the normal operation of ground-fault indicators (GFIs) used with the installed HRG systems. This paper focuses its investigation into nuisance GFI alarms that may occur when present-generation ASDs are retrofitted into the existing plant. The paper first reviews possible neutral grounding systems, with emphasis on the types of HRG systems possible and GFI alarm philosophy. The paper then dis-cusses how ASDs may generate zero-sequence high-frequency noise currents in the HRG neutral circuit, which may cause nuisance ground-fault alarms and potentially mask a legitimate ground fault. GFI noise current magnitude is defined for both present and older ASD technologies (e. g., insulated gate bipolar transistor versus bipolar junction transistor drives). The effect this transient zero-sequence noise current magnitude has on GFI operation is described. Mitigation methods used at the drive to reduce ASD noise current magnitude to acceptable nonalarm levels is investigated. Filter solutions located at the HRG/GFI meter that reduce nuisance alarms are also investigated. The pros and cons of at the drive or at the <b>meter</b> <b>filter</b> solutions are supported with laboratory and field test data. Application guidelines are given to help avoid nuisance problems with a plant ground-fault protection scheme, which needs to successfully operate in the presence of multiple ASDs.

40|$|As {{preparation}} for building of roads and railroads on damp ground, the ground sometimes {{needs to be}} stabilized. This {{can be done by}} ejecting limestone into the ground. A {{way to do this is}} by drilling into the ground and eject a mixture of cement and limestone thus creating a pillar. AcobiaFLUX has developed a system for supervising and controlling a procedure like this. They measure the depth of the drilling tool and the weight of the material stored in a tank and plot the depth on the vertical axis and average ejected mass per meter on the horizontal axis of a graph visible for the operator. Disturbances causes the graph to get out of hand sometimes and there are substantial fluctuations. This means that the client performing the ground stabilization cannot rely on what is visible in the graph.

40|$|The {{intracavity}} topologies {{of laser}} gravitational-wave detectors are the promising way to obtain sensitivity {{of these devices}} significantly better than the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). The most challenging element of the intracavity topologies is the local meter which has to monitor position of a small (110 gram) local mirror and which precision defines {{the sensitivity of the}} detector. To overcome the SQL, the quantum variational measurement can be used in the local meter. In this method a frequency-dependent correlation between the meter back-action noise and measurement noise is introduced, which allows to eliminate the back-action noise component from the meter output signal. This correlation is created by means of an additional filter cavity. In this article the sensitivity limitations of this scheme imposed by the optical losses both in the local meter itself and in the filter cavity are estimated.

This paper describes the lens design configuration and design considerations of the Main Laser. The Main Laser is 123 meters long and includes two spatial tllters: one 23. 5 meters and one 60 <b>meters.</b> These spatial <b>filters</b> perform crucial beam filtering and relaying functions. We shall describe the significant lens design aspects of these spatial tilter lenses which allow them to successfully deliver the appropriate beam characteristic onto the target.

40|$|The Flight Dynamics Div. (FDD) at NASA-Goddard {{commissioned}} {{a study to}} develop the Real Time Orbit Determination/Enhanced (RTOD/E) system as a prototype system for sequential orbit determination of spacecraft on a DOS based personal computer (PC). An overview is presented of RTOD/E capabilities {{and the results are}} presented of a study to compare the orbit determination accuracy for a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) user spacecraft obtained using RTOS/E on a PC with the accuracy of an established batch least squares system, the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS), operating on a mainframe computer. RTOD/E was used to perform sequential orbit determination for the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), and the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) was used to perform the batch least squares orbit determination. The estimated ERBS ephemerides were obtained for the Aug. 16 to 22, 1989, timeframe, during which intensive TDRSS tracking data for ERBS were available. Independent assessments were made to examine the consistencies of results obtained by the batch and sequential methods. Comparisons were made between the forward filtered RTOD/E orbit solutions and definitive GTDS orbit solutions for ERBS; the solution differences were less than 40 <b>meters</b> after the <b>filter</b> had reached steady state...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in exploiting cellular network data for transportation planning purposes in recent years. In this paper, we utilize these data for determining mode of travel {{in the city of}} Shiraz, Iran. Cellular data records -including location updates in 5 minute time intervals- of 300, 000 users from the city of Shiraz has been collected for 40 hours in three consecutive days in a cooperation with the major telecommunications service provider of the country. Depending on the density of mobile BTS’s in different zones of the city, the user location can be located within an average of 200 <b>meters.</b> Considering data <b>filtering</b> and smoothing, data preparation and converting them to comprehensible traces is {{a large portion of the}} work. A novel approach to identify stay locations is proposed and implemented in this paper. Origin-Destination matrices are then created based on trips detected, which shows acceptable consistency with current O-D matrices. Finally, Travel times for all trips of a user is estimated as the main attribute for clustering. Trips between same origin and destination zones are combined together in a group. Using K-means algorithm, records within each group are the portioned in two or three clusters, based on their travel speeds. Each cluster represents a certain mode of travel; walking, public transportation or driving a private car...|$|R
40|$|The Rayleigh lidar {{technique}} {{is being used}} at York University to study middle atmospheric thermal structure with particular emphasis on the properties and influence of internal gravity waves. These measurements are now carried out on a routine basis (every clear night) {{in order to determine}} seasonal variability and, eventually, long term trends. The transmitter consists of a doubled Nd:YAG laser with an output of 0. 4 Joules per pulse at 20 Hz (8 Watts) which is expanded to obtain a divergence of 0. 4 milliradians. Backscattered photons are collected by a half <b>meter</b> cassegrain telescope, <b>filtered</b> to a bandwidth of 1 nm, detected by a PMT, and counted with a multi-channel scaling averager. Strong backscatter from lower altitudes is blocked using a rotating chopper (25000 rpm) which triggers the laser. The range gate and hardware averaging interval are variable but typically 300 m and 5 minutes. Relative density profiles are obtained by simply normalizing to a model (eg. CIRA) at some altitude. Absolute temperature is derived using the hydrostatic equation, ideal gas law, and a model pressure value at the altitude where the photocount statistical uncertainty is about 15 percent - typically 90 km for the entire night's average. The lower limit is currently about 30 - 35 km due the presence aerosol from the volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo...|$|R
40|$|Mesopelagic fish biomass {{has been}} {{estimated}} at 7 – 10 billion metric tons, {{an order of magnitude}} higher than previous estimates. This upscaling has resulted from the acoustical quantification of net avoidance, particularly avoidance of smaller, research-sized nets such as rectangular midwater trawls (RMTs) upon which previous estimates were based. Net avoidance by fishes is size-dependent, thus our greatest underestimation is likely that of the larger deep-pelagic fishes. Here, we present results from a research program in the Gulf of Mexico that used a large, dual-warp pelagic trawl in concert with an opening-closing RMT to sample from 0 - 1500 m depth. A total of 129 quantitative samples were obtained with the large trawl, representing over 337 million cubic <b>meters</b> of water <b>filtered.</b> Results showed a stark difference in both the size class and taxonomic composition of fishes collected with the two gears. Some of the larger, predatory deep-pelagic fishes collected were dragonfishes, anglerfishes, great swallowers, pelagic eels, and snake mackerels. Aspects of faunal composition, abundance, biomass, and size distributions will be presented. These larger deep-pelagic fishes are preyed upon by top predators such as sharks, billfishes, tunas, toothed whales, and deep-demersal fishes. Thus, data from this study will help improve our understanding of the links between zooplanktivorous micronekton and apex predators. The inclusion of large deep-pelagic fish biomass should dramatically improve ecosystem modeling efforts aimed at understanding carbon flow in the deep ocean interior. [URL]...|$|R
