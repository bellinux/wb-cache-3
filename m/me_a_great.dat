I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E

We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

In 2011, Carlsen said: [...] "Thanks to [...] I began to understand a whole class of positions better.... Kasparov gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of practical help."

500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Gould {{published}} The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002), a long treatise recapitulating {{his version of}} modern evolutionary theory. In episode 13 of the Dutch TV series Of Beauty and Consolation Gould remarked, [...] "In {{a couple of years}} I will be able to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It is to <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals—very different from my popular science writings—but it is of greater consolation to me because it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Lynott's second solo album, The Philip Lynott Album, {{was delayed}} until 1982 while Renegade was {{completed}} and released in November 1981. Renegade was not successful, only reaching no. 38 in the UK and no. 157 in the US. A single, [...] "Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)", also flopped, {{although it did}} reach no. 24 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. Despite only two songs from the album being written solely by Lynott, {{and other members of}} the band contributing more to the compositions, both Gorham and Wharton have since stated their dissatisfaction with some of the songs, such as [...] "Angel of Death", [...] "Fats" [...] and [...] "Mexican Blood". Wharton was omitted from the band photos on the back of the record sleeve, despite the fact that he was by this time a permanent member of the band. [...] "It hurt <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal", he later said.|$|E

500|$|Money {{was very}} tight in Villeneuve's early career. He was a {{professional}} racing driver from his late teens, with no other income. In {{the first few years}} the bulk of his income actually came from snowmobile racing, where he was extremely successful. He could demand appearance money as well as race money, especially after winning the 1974 World Championship Snowmobile Derby. His second season in Formula Atlantic was part-sponsored by his snowmobile manufacturer, Skiroule. He credited some of his success to his snowmobiling days: [...] "Every winter, you would reckon on three or four big spills — and I'm talking about being thrown on to the ice at 100 miles per hour. Those things used to slide a lot, which taught <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal about control. And the visibility was terrible! Unless you were leading, you could see nothing, with all the snow blowing about. Good for the reactions — and it stopped me having any worries about racing in the rain." ...|$|E
500|$|... c. [...] In 1890 Prus wrote: [...] "When I was {{starting}} {{out as a}} writer, I wrote in part instinctively, in part by inadvertent imitation. [...] My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt {{against the backdrop of}} what I had read. [...] Every beginning author does the same. [...] To be sure, this kind of work was to <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' [...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art. [...] I expect that it will contain some fairly new things." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{were times}} when Lady Rosebery's devotion to her husband was tested. Rosebery may have not been antisemitic before his {{marriage}}; however, the acerbic wit {{for which he was}} famous led him to make remarks that could have been taken in such a way, once his marriage had secured the Rothschild fortune. Rosebery seems to have disliked his first son, who he claimed looked [...] "Jewish." [...] On seeing his son {{for the first time he}} remarked [...] "Le Jew est fait, rien ne vas plus," [...] which must have been disconcerting for the child's very Jewish mother. Rosebery, who has been described as febrile and supercilious, replied in a letter of congratulations on the birth of his heir from Mary Gladstone: [...] "I cannot pretend to be much excited by an event which occurs to almost every human being and which may cause <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of annoyance." [...] Rosebery then left his newborn child and wife (who was again pregnant) for a year-long tour of Australia. On another occasion, when the Roseberys were travelling in India, Rosebery is reported to have announced [...] "I will travel ahead, Hannah and the rest of the heavy baggage will follow the next day." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{pursuit of}} his plans, Jardine took advice on fielding {{positions}} from Frank Foster, who had bowled {{a form of}} medium-fast leg theory during the 1911–12 series in Australia with much success, taking 32 wickets at 21.63. Larwood did not at the time consider Jardine's proposed tactics as either novel or controversial. His priority was to contain Bradman, so [...] "any scheme that would keep him in check appealed to <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal". In county matches following the Piccadilly Hotel dinner, Larwood and Voce tried the tactics out, with mixed results. Two Essex batsmen sustained injuries as their side struggled with the unfamiliar bowling, at one stage losing 8 wickets for 52 runs. However, Glamorgan, reckoned to be a weak batting side, scored more than 500 against the experimental attack; spectators, including the future cricket writer and commentator John Arlott, were puzzled by the ineffectiveness of the bowling. Arlott later reasoned that what appeared weak bowling on English pitches would be a different proposition on the much faster Australian pitches. Hostile fast bowling was not confined to Larwood and Voce; in Yorkshire's match against Surrey at The Oval, Bill Bowes bowled a series of bouncers, bringing protests from Hobbs and press criticism from Warner.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the console}} {{versions}} include {{some form of}} dynamic musical score during gameplay, {{and in the case}} of the Mega Drive conversion, use arrangements of the music originating in the SNES and Apple IIGS versions. This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments. Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by Charles Deenen. They also wanted to exchange Jean-François Freitas's music for a different soundtrack, but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine's lawyer helped to keep the original intro music. The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by Rebecca Heineman, who said: [...] "Since Interplay wouldn't pay for a Super FX chip, I found a way to do it with static RAM on the cart and DMA which got <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> frame rate. Interplay wouldn't pay for the static RAM either, so I ended up using Fast ROM instruction. Interplay wouldn't pay for a 3.6 MHz ROM either. So, frustrated, I shoved my block move code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3.6 MHz. It worked. I got fast block moves on slow cartridges and made a game using polygons working on a 65816 with pure software rendering." [...] Another World is the only game directly ported from the Super NES to the Apple IIGS, which has the same 65C816 microprocessor.|$|E
