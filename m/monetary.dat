5|$|Macroeconomics descends {{from two}} areas of research: {{business}} cycle theory and <b>monetary</b> theory. <b>Monetary</b> theory {{dates back to}} the 16th century and the work of Martín de Azpilcueta, while business cycle analysis dates from the mid 19th.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's <b>monetary</b> {{ineffectiveness}} proposition and showed how <b>monetary</b> policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how <b>monetary</b> policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that <b>monetary</b> policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a <b>monetary</b> authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the <b>monetary</b> authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace (1975) applied {{rational}} expectations to models with Phillips curve trade-offs between inflation and output {{and found that}} <b>monetary</b> policy {{could not be used}} to systematically stabilize the economy. Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that economic agents would anticipate inflation and adjust to higher price levels before the influx of <b>monetary</b> stimulus could boost employment and output. Only unanticipated <b>monetary</b> policy could increase employment, and no central bank could systematically use <b>monetary</b> policy for expansion without economic agents catching on and anticipating price changes before they could have a stimulative impact.|$|E
5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A <b>Monetary</b> History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that <b>monetary</b> policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, <b>monetary</b> policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought <b>monetary</b> policy had been stimulative.|$|E
5|$|Econometric {{analysis}} of DSGE models suggested that real factors sometimes affect the economy. A paper by Frank Smets and Rafael Woulters (2007) stated that <b>monetary</b> policy explained {{only a small}} part of the fluctuations in economic output. In new synthesis models, shocks can affect both demand and supply. The new synthesis implies that <b>monetary</b> policy can have a stabilizing effect on the economy, contrary to new classical theory.|$|E

5|$|The {{union of}} Russia and Belarus, a {{supranational}} confederation, {{was established in}} a 1996–99 series of treaties that called for <b>monetary</b> union, equal rights, single citizenship, and a common foreign and defense policy. However, {{the future of the}} union has been placed in doubt because of Belarus's repeated delays of <b>monetary</b> union, the lack of a referendum date for the draft constitution, and a dispute over the petroleum trade.|$|E
5|$|When {{discussing}} the Eurasian Economic Union, Vladimir Putin said the Eurasian Economic Union would include closer coordination {{of economic and}} <b>monetary</b> policy, {{including the use of}} a common currency in the future. Although the creation of a <b>monetary</b> union was not envisaged in the Eurasian Economic Union Treaty, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called for the introduction of a common currency for the Eurasian Economic Union. Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma's CIS committee, backed Medvedev's proposal to start discussions on the creation of a <b>monetary</b> union. Slutsky said it could be introduced shortly after 2015, when the union's structure becomes clear.|$|E
25|$|Wieser thus {{perfected the}} theory of Carl Menger by {{introducing}} a definition of cost, the opportunity cost, compatible with {{the theory of}} marginal utility. He also used Menger's <b>monetary</b> theory from which he devised his own <b>monetary</b> theory presenting a study of possible influences on <b>monetary</b> value that can change the relationships between natural and <b>monetary</b> economics.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{important}} {{structural changes}} {{eventually led to}} the breakdown of international <b>monetary</b> management. One change was the development of a high level of <b>monetary</b> interdependence. The stage was set for <b>monetary</b> interdependence by the return to convertibility of the Western European currencies at the end of 1958 and of the Japanese yen in 1964. Convertibility facilitated the vast expansion of international financial transactions, which deepened <b>monetary</b> interdependence.|$|E

25|$|As an {{organization}} of central banks, the BIS seeks to make <b>monetary</b> policy more predictable and transparent among its 60-member central banks, except {{in the case of}} Eurozone countries which forfeited the right to conduct <b>monetary</b> policy in order to implement the euro. While <b>monetary</b> policy is determined by most sovereign nations, it is subject to central and private banking scrutiny and potentially to speculation that affects foreign exchange rates and especially the fate of export economies. Failures to keep <b>monetary</b> policy in line with reality and make <b>monetary</b> reforms in time, preferably as a simultaneous policy among all 60 member banks and also involving the International <b>Monetary</b> Fund, have historically led to losses in the billions as banks try to maintain a policy using open market methods that have proven to be based on unrealistic assumptions.|$|E

The name Khaleeji has been proposed as a name for this currency. If realised, the GCC <b>monetary</b> union would be the second largest supranational <b>monetary</b> union in the world, measured by GDP of the common-currency area.|$|E

25|$|Since the Treasury–Fed Accord of 1951, the Federal Reserve {{was freed}} from the {{constraints}} of fiscal influence and {{gave way to the}} development of modern <b>monetary</b> policy. According to John B. Taylor, this allowed the Federal Reserve to abandon discretionary macroeconomic policy by the US Federal government to set new goals that would better benefit the economy. Through systematic <b>monetary</b> policy free from fiscal concerns, structured macroeconomic policy helped usher in the Great Moderation. Also, the Federal Reserve’s change in communicating its <b>monetary</b> policy plans contributed to the Great Moderation. The increased transparency could result in more effective <b>monetary</b> policy.|$|E
25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the global}} <b>monetary</b> system was loosely linked at best, with Europe, the Americas, India and China (among others) having largely {{separate}} economies, and hence <b>monetary</b> systems were regional. European colonization of the Americas, {{starting with the}} Spanish empire, led to the integration of American and European economies and <b>monetary</b> systems, and European colonization of Asia led to the dominance of European currencies, notably the British pound sterling in the 19th century, succeeded by the US dollar in the 20th century. Some, such as Michael Hudson, foresee the decline of a single basis for the global <b>monetary</b> system, and instead the emergence of regional trade blocs, citing {{the emergence of the}} Euro as an example of this phenomenon. See also Global financial systems, world-systems approach and polarity in international relations. It was in the later half of the 19th century that a <b>monetary</b> system with close to universal global participation emerged, based on the gold standard.|$|E

25|$|The Bretton Woods {{agreement}} codified {{this economic}} {{dominance of the}} dollar after the war. In 1944, Allied nations sought to create an international <b>monetary</b> order that sustained the global economy and prevented the economic malaise that followed the First World War. The Bretton Woods agreement laid the foundations for an international <b>monetary</b> order that created rules and expectations for the international economic system. It created the International <b>Monetary</b> Fund (IMF), the predecessor of the World Bank, and an international <b>monetary</b> system based on fixed exchange rates. It valued the dollar at $35 per ounce of gold and the remaining signatories pegged their respective currency relative to the dollar, leading some economists to argue that Bretton Woods “dethroned” gold as the default asset.|$|E
25|$|The Bretton Woods {{system of}} <b>monetary</b> {{management}} established {{the rules for}} commercial and financial relations among the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and Japan after the 1944 Bretton-Woods Agreement. The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated <b>monetary</b> order intended to govern <b>monetary</b> relations among independent states. The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a <b>monetary</b> policy that maintained the exchange rate (± 1 percent) by tying its currency to gold {{and the ability of}} the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments. Also, there was a need to address the lack of cooperation among other countries and to prevent competitive devaluation of the currencies as well.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the failure}} of the CMCF, in 1992 the CARICOM Heads of Government {{determined}} that CARICOM should move towards <b>monetary</b> integration and commissioned their central bankers to study the possible creation of a <b>monetary</b> union among CARICOM countries. It was argued that <b>monetary</b> integration would provide benefits such as exchange rate and price stability and reduced transaction costs in regional trade. It was also thought that these benefits in turn would stimulate capital flows, intra-regional trade and investment, improve balance of payments performance and increase growth and employment.|$|E
25|$|Economists and {{economic}} historians are almost evenly split {{as to whether}} the traditional <b>monetary</b> explanation that <b>monetary</b> forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression. Today the controversy is of lesser importance since there is mainstream support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the <b>monetary</b> explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz add non-monetary explanations.|$|E
