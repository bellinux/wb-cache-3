50|$|The {{reputation}} {{and history of}} Damascus steel {{has given rise to}} many legends, such as the ability to cut through a rifle barrel or to cut a hair falling across the blade. A research team in Germany published a report in 2006 revealing nanowires and carbon nanotubes in a blade forged from Damascus steel. Although many types of modern steel outperform ancient Damascus alloys, chemical reactions in the production process made the blades extraordinary for their time, as Damascus steel was superplastic and very hard at the same time. During the smelting process to obtain Wootz steel ingots, woody biomass and leaves are known to have been used as carburizing additives along with certain specific types of iron rich in <b>microalloying</b> <b>elements.</b> These ingots would then be further forged and worked into Damascus steel blades. Research now shows that carbon nanotubes can be derived from plant fibers, suggesting how the nanotubes were formed in the steel. Some experts expect to discover such nanotubes in more relics as they are analyzed more closely.|$|E

During the UOE forming of large diameter (more than 400 mm) welded pipes the strength drop from plate to pipe, {{as a result of}} reverse deformation (the Bauschinger effect), depends on steel grade, namely <b>microalloying</b> <b>element</b> content, and processing. In this project the microstructure of two Nb- and V-microalloyed steels has been studied with optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The dislocation density and (Ti,Nb,V,Cu) -rich particle diameter, volume fraction and number density were measured for as-rolled and annealed (30 min. at 400 ^ 0 C and 550 ^ 0 C) steels. The Bauschinger effect was measured during compression-tension testing for the same steel conditions. The yield stress drop during reverse deformation has been found to increase with an increase in forward pre-strain, dislocation density and particle number density within the effective particle diameter range of 12 - 50 nm. On the basis of dislocation-particle interaction analysis, a quantitative model of work-hardening behaviour dependence on particle number density and dislocation density has been derived for the reverse deformation of studied steel grades.

Secondly, the amount of <b>microalloying</b> <b>elements</b> control the amount of C, N, S, and P in solid solution, which indirectly affects the recrystallization texture obtained after annealing. In this sense, the work carried out with three different interstitial free (IF) and interstitial free high-strength (IFHS) steel grades allows us to conclude that the increase of microalloying additions delays recrystallization kinetics.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{thermomechanical}} controlled processing (TMCP) parameters and chemistry on the grain growth constants n, Q and A in the grain growth equation was studied on microalloyed steels with varying compositions of Nb, Ti and V. The {{two sets of}} steels {{used in the study}} consisted of industrially produced steels with varying additions of Nb, Ti and or V and laboratory produced steels with systematically varied compositions of Nb content. The tests conducted included reheating of steels at austenitizing conditions and deformation on the Bähr dilatometer to simulate the effect of deformation conditions on grain growth. In order to find a reasonable heating system, the precipitation and solubility behaviour of the microalloyed steels was simulated on ThermocalcTM for temperatures between 800 oC and 1500 oC. Experimentally measured data were obtained through TMCP by considering parameters such as austenitizing temperature, austenitizing time, delay time in between roughing passes and deformation temperatures. The data obtained from the experimentally measured austenite grain sizes in the heat treatment and the deformation processes were analysed and used in the determination of the grain growth constants n, Q and A which were then analyzed quantitatively {{as a function of the}} Nb content to develop constitutive equation for austenite grain growth prediction in the microalloyed steels. The mutual effects of particle pinning by Nb (C,N) and Ti (C,N) on grain growth kinetics were studied through simulation of the solubility of the precipitates using the thermodynamic software, ThermocalcTM and thermodynamic calculations. The particle dissolution, the undissolved particle coarsening and the changes in Nb solute in solution during reheating at isothermal heat treatment processes were taken into account in the constitutive equations through the experimentally measured grain sizes. The systematically varied Nb content in the second set of steels was used to study the effect of increasing <b>microalloying</b> <b>element</b> on grain growth in the steels. Comparative analysis of the results show that the constants generated under deformation conditions are slightly higher than those generated from reheating conditions. The activation energy for grain boundary migration, Q was found to be in the range of 254 and 572 kJ/mol, the grain growth exponent n ranged from 2. 4 to 6. 5 and the material and processing condition s constant A was found to range from 1. 5 x 1011 to 4. 96 x 1028. Constitutive grain growth equations that incorporate the initial grain size Do as well as the <b>microalloying</b> <b>element</b> (Nb) compositions in the prediction of austenite grain growth in microalloyed steels has been developed.

In particular {{the role of}} <b>microalloying</b> <b>element</b> segregation during casting and, hence the spatial distribution of microalloying precipitates, on grain boundary pinning during reheating has been considered. The Al-Nb containing steel has been examined in separate initial conditions, including as-cast (segregated structure), homogenised and forged (reduced separation of segregated bands) samples. It was found that microalloy segregation occurred between the dendritic and interdendritic regions, where the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) was 150 ± 50 μm. Nb showed strong segregation into the interdendritic regions resulting in a higher number density of Nb(C,N) precipitates (2. 64 × 104 /mm 2) compared to the dendritic region (0. 73 × 104 /mm 2). However, Al did not show strong segregation resulting in relatively well-distributed AlN precipitates in the matrix (1. 29 × 104 /mm 2 in the interdendritic region and 1. 89 × 104 /mm 2 in the dendritic region). After forging, the separation between the segregated bands was reduced to 65 ± 10 μm from the previous 150 ± 50 μm in the as-cast sample.

The new route focused on optimising the kinetics of strain-induced precipitation (SIP) {{and the formation of}} deformation-induced ferrite transformation (DITF). For comparative purposes, two experimental 0. 06  wt% C steels were studied: one with 0. 03  wt% Nb (Nb steel), and a second with both 0. 03  wt% Nb and 0. 02  wt% Ti ([Formula presented] steel). Two processing routes were studied. The first was a conventional route, which consisted of a simulated rough deformation schedule with the final roughing pass taking place at 850  °C, which produced fully unrecrystallised austenite grains during deformation with no strain-induced ferrite formation. The second, new, thermomechanical processing route used the same roughing step, after which the steels were reheated at 10  °C/s to a temperature of 1200  °C, isothermally held for 10 s allowing for precipitate dissolution, prior to air cooling to a finishing deformation temperature of 850  °C. This route resulted in DIFT primarily on the prior-austenite grain boundaries. The precipitate solution during the reheat treatment increased the supersaturation of Nb and Ti in the austenite matrix on subsequent cooling, which therefore increased the undercooling due to the increased Ae 3. The observation of nanoscale cementite in the DIFT supports the view that it formed through a massive transformation mechanism.

40|$|The role of <b>Microalloying</b> <b>Element</b> (MAE) {{additions}} to high strength low-allow (HSLA) steels has been well-documented since their commercial introduction {{in the late}} 1950 ’s. Because {{of the benefits of}} MAE in terms of grain size control, among other metallurgical reactions, it has been important to study, understand and predict the role of MAE content on the grain coarsening behavior under different thermal cycles. Titanium content has shown beneficial effects in terms of austenite grain size control by the grain boundary pinning effect of TiN particles due to the low solubility of these precipitates at high temperatures. The thermodynamical stability of TiN is mainly influenced by the contents of both Ti and N which leads to hypo-stoichiometric and hyper-stoichiometric conditions for TiN particles nucleation, coarsening, and dissolution. Prior Austenite Grain Size studies and precipitation analysis have shown that these stoichiometric conditions play a role on the kinetics of the grain coarsening behavior under different thermal cycles by means of the available solute concentration in the matrix as predicted by particle coarsening theories and grain growth models. A systematic analysis of the grain boundaries character distribution (GBCD) by Electron Backscattered Diffraction and Electron Microscopy during the dissolution process of TiN precipitates has been conducted. These observations provided {{a better understanding of the}} role of GBCD in the presence or absence of TiN particles located at the matrix and along the austenite grain boundaries.

40|$|Strain induced {{precipitation}} of <b>microalloy</b> <b>elements</b> during hot deformation of steels {{has been an}} area of Interest for several decades. Several researchers have produced models for strain {{induced precipitation}} phenomena that gave reasonably good predictions of precipitate evolution during hot deformation. These models were however, applicable only for single pass deformation. The present work aims {{to develop a new}} model that could be extended to prediction of precipitate evolution during multi-pass hot deformation during rolling. In this work, a new approach has been adopted in modelling strain induced precipitation of niobium carbonitrides during hot deformation. A dislocation geometry is proposed for a typical microband, which is considered as a key factor In the model. This microband geometry enables one to obtain the local solute concentration gradients in the regions between the microbands. Diffusion of solute atoms towards the microbands is considered to govern the growth rate of the precipitates on the dislocation nodes in the microbands; i. e., the solute atoms reaching the microbands are immediately consumed in either nucleating a new precipitate or growing an existing precipitate. Depending on the considerations of how precipitates nucleate on the microbands, different models have been proposed and their results analysed. Extending this model to a multipass model depends on the location of the next generation microbands after a second/subsequent deformation. The local solute concentration, already obtained after the first pass, will govern the precipitation potential of the nodes on the second generation microband. Plane strain compression tests were conducted on Fe- 30 wt. %Ni-Nb alloys at different temperatures and deformation conditions. The test samples were subjected to thin foil transmission electron microscopy to obtain the particle size distribution of the niobium carbonitride particles.

The current work simulates the precipitation of vanadium a hot rolling process for the optimized strengthening effect in a microalloyed steel.

The diffuse interface effect on the interfacial energy as well as a volumetric misfit of AlN at dislocations is also taken into account. The latter is because of its significant difference in the lattice parameter from the matrix.

In the past, hot ductility has been measured in the laboratory by tensile testing specimens reheated to a high temperature (preferably melted), and then cooled down to the desired test temperature before isothermally testing to fracture. More recently, isothermal tensile testing has been performed after imposing different thermal histories prior to reaching the test temperature. The most relevant thermal history {{is that of the}} solidifying strand surface. Such thermal histories {{have been found to be}} quite complex, and invariably involve rapid cooling and heating cycles. This will therefore lead to high thermal gradients, which, in turn, can generate strains in the surface of the solidifying strand. Thus, the purpose of this thesis was to consider the effect of the thermomechanical history on the hot ductility of steel. A Nb-Ti microalloyed steel was chosen to be studied, since microalloying often increases susceptibility to transverse cracking. After in-situ melting and solidification, tensile test specimens were subjected to the thermal history typical of a continuously cast billet. Different amounts of prior deformations in various schedules were imposed on the specimens at selected stages during the thermal history, before tensile testing to fracture at the time and temperature corresponding to the unbending stage of the billet casting. It was found that the hot ductility varied from 1 % to 98 %, depending on the stage in the thermal history at which prior deformation was executed. Microstructural studies showed remarkable changes in the precipitation pattern occurred due to the employed prior deformation. Similar hot ductility measurements executed on a low carbon steel, that was free from <b>microalloy</b> <b>elements,</b> exhibited an effect of prior hot deformation which was quite different to the Nb-Ti microalloyed steel. In particular, the effect on the hot ductility was not as dramatic. The effects were also postulated to be due to precipitation...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} Nd {{addition}} on corrosion behavior of Mg 66 Zn 30 Ca 4 amorphous alloys in simulated body fluids (SBF) were studied in this paper. Electrochemical {{properties of the}} samples before and after corrosion were determined. Surface morphologies of samples after immersion in SBF at 37 篊 for different times were observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results show that the corrosion resistance of Mg-based alloys in SBF is improved {{with the addition of}} Nd element. The electrochemical properties indicate that <b>microalloying</b> Nd <b>element</b> to the alloys leads to an ennoblement in the open circuit potentials of the alloys and a decrease in the anodic current density in SBF, especially for the Mg 66 -xZn 30 Ca 4 Ndx alloys with Nd content of 1. 0 at. %- 1. 5 at. %. It was observed that the surface morphologies of the alloys immersed in SBF change with the Nd addition. A flake-like structure parallel to the alloy substrate formed on the surface of 1. 0 at. % Nd-containing alloy immersed in SBF for 7 days improves the corrosion resistance of the amorphous alloys by blocking the corrosion liquid from attacking the alloys...|$|R
40|$|Rapidly {{quenched}} {{ribbons of}} alloys of the Al-Fe-V-Si system are prepared. In all microcrystalline specimens {{there is a}} zone where the component phases have dimensions {{of the order of}} several nanometers. The disk cooling rate, component concentration, and the presence of <b>microalloying</b> <b>elements</b> affect the nanozone, which is reflected in the properties from bulk alloys prepared from ribbons. Existence of this zone is typical for all alloys based on the Al-Si system, and the presence of silicon particles within the zone depends on silicon concentration...|$|E
