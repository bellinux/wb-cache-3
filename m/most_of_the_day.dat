5|$|After gaining {{tropical}} characteristics throughout <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> on November3, {{the storm}} was designated Tropical Depression Eleven. The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence, the sixth named storm of the season. The storm briefly underwent rapid intensification, strengthening into a hurricane, before leveling out as a Category 1 hurricane. Florence was subsequently upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on November7. However, a large extratropical cyclone located to the north caused the hurricane to rapidly accelerate, with forward speeds reaching 58mph (93km/h). By the next day, Florence lost its identity, while still producing hurricane-force winds, as it was absorbed by the extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Feeding on fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, the Japanese {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that spends <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> lying {{still on}} the sea floor. This species gives birth to live young, which are sustained during gestation by yolk. The litter size varies from two to 10. The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked. It is fished in large numbers and used for meat and shagreen, a type of leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it under Vulnerable, citing the intense bottom trawling activity within its range and the low resilience of angel sharks to fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|With {{a sizable}} oily liver and low-density tissues, the Pacific {{electric}} ray is almost neutrally buoyant and can hover {{in the water}} column with very little effort. Propulsive power is provided by the muscular tail, while the disc is held rigid. Telemetry studies have shown that this species swims primarily at night, when it enters reefs and other habitats with high terrain relief, and spends <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> in nearby open areas buried in sediment. It is nomadic and solitary, though several individuals may rest within the same area.|$|E

5|$|In 1525 Pedro de Alvarado sent a {{small company}} to conquer Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo), {{the capital of the}} Poqomam. At the Spanish approach, the {{inhabitants}} remained enclosed in the fortified city. The Spanish attempted an approach from the west through a narrow pass but were forced back with heavy losses. Alvarado himself launched the second assault with 200 Tlaxcalan allies but was also beaten back. The Poqomam then received reinforcements, possibly from Chinautla, and the two armies clashed on open ground outside of the city. The battle was chaotic and lasted for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> but was finally decided by the Spanish cavalry, forcing the Poqomam reinforcements to withdraw. The leaders of the reinforcements surrendered to the Spanish three days after their retreat and revealed that the city had a secret entrance {{in the form of a}} cave leading up from a nearby river, allowing the inhabitants to come and go.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the delegates}} at the {{convention}} continued to cast ballots until a victor could be determined. On the second ballot of the day, a Pennsylvania delegate named W. A. Grier cast a vote for James Garfield. However, the Garfield support remained with that one delegate's vote for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> The delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner. After dinner, they came back and cast ten more ballots. Still, no candidate {{was close to the}} 379 votes needed to win. After twelve hours of balloting, Massachusetts delegate William Lovering moved to adjourn for the night. A few Grant delegates objected, but the motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 308. After twenty-eight ballots, Grant had 307 votes, Blaine had 279 and Sherman had 91, {{and the rest of the}} votes were split between favorite son candidates like William Windom and George F.

5|$|NY324 crosses {{its last}} major route, Transit Road (NY78), on an {{overpass}} {{just north of}} the once-thriving Eastern Hills Mall, which had been the premier mall in the Buffalo area until it began losing tenants and customers to the larger Walden Galleria in Cheektowaga. Beyond Transit, the road is still four-lane but primarily residential as it enters the Town of Clarence. After Harris Hill Road, the highway bends to the southeast once again for a final mile into its eastern end at Main Street (NY5). This last section was widened from two lanes to four in the mid-1990s, and has seen some development but still remains lightly trafficked <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

5|$|Queens {{mate with}} a single male and colonies may {{have more than one}} queen until the workers arrive, where they both exhibit antagonism. It takes around one or two months for an {{individual}} egg to develop into an adult. Colonies range in size, varying between 11,000 individuals to over 300,000. The meat ant is a diurnal species (active throughout <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day),</b> especially when it is warm. It forages on trees and collect sweet substances such as honeydew and nectar, and also capture insects or collect the remains of animals. A number of predators eat these ants, including the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), numerous species of birds, blindsnakes and spiders. This species is also a competitor of the banded sugar ant (Camponotus consobrinus). Meat ants establish territorial borders with neighbouring colonies and solve disputes through ritualised fighting.|$|E
5|$|Rather slow-swimming, the pyjama shark spends <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{resting in}} caves or crevices or amongst kelp, {{emerging}} {{at night to}} actively forage for food. Many individuals may congregate at a single spot, particularly in summer. This species falls prey to larger sharks, {{and is one of}} the cartilaginous fish most frequently consumed by the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). When threatened, it often curls into a circle with its tail covering its head, in a similar fashion to the shysharks (Haploblepharus). Its eggs are fed upon by the whelks Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria, which can pierce the outer covering to extract the yolk within. Like other sharks, the pyjama shark maintains osmotic balance with the environment by regulating its internal concentration of urea and other nitrogenous wastes. Experiments have shown that the shark's capacity for osmoregulation is dependent on how well it has fed.|$|E

He learned to sing religious songs, to attend pujas at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits – all of which are part of Brahmin culture. At the Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.|$|E
