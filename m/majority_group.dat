5|$|Although it was {{the largest}} of the African {{nationalist}} parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate évolués and the more radical mass membership. A radical and federalist faction headed by Ileo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the <b>majority</b> <b>group</b> became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who endured with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, popular in the south and among Kalonji's own ethnic group, the Baluba. The MNC-K later formed a cartel with ABAKO and the Parti Solidaire Africain (PSA) to call for a united, but federalised, Congo.|$|E

5|$|White Brazilians {{descended from}} the {{original}} Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the <b>majority</b> <b>group</b> in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) {{of the population in}} the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.|$|E

30|$|Following {{these two}} {{preliminary}} questions, {{the third and}} main question is how well immigrant minorities change their condition and advance over the years.

30|$|Indeed, this {{sensitivity}} analysis produces substantively similar results {{to those in}} Tables  3 and 4. They continue to show how all minority groups suffer from a “minority penalty” upon arrival. They also show how non-black minority groups assimilate faster with every additional group of years of residency {{in comparison to the}} <b>majority</b> <b>groups.</b> However, blacks do not show such a trend. Their pace of economic advancement is insignificant in comparison to the <b>majority</b> <b>groups</b> and their starting point is significantly lower (their starting point in the socioeconomic index is marginally significant).|$|R

25|$|A {{study which}} mapped {{patterns}} of segregation and congregation of incoming population groups found that, if a <b>majority</b> <b>group</b> {{is reluctant to}} accept a minority influx, they may leave the district, avoid the district, or use tactics to keep the minority out. The minority group in turn react by either dispersing or congregating, avoiding certain districts in turn. Detailed analysis of data from the 1990s onwards indicates that the concentration of immigrants in certain city districts, such as Husby in Stockholm and Rosengård in Malmö, is {{in part due to}} immigration influx, but primarily due to white flight.|$|E
25|$|Eight councils {{ended their}} {{campaign}} when the leadership proposed a legal budget, six when councillors from the <b>majority</b> <b>group</b> joined opposition councillors to overrule the leadership; Lewisham conceded in unique circumstances.

Liverpool's delay in setting a budget caused a severe financial crisis which was denounced by the Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.|$|E
25|$|Zimmerman was in Moscow on party {{business}} {{in association with}} RILU in May 1929 {{at the time of}} the decisive showdown between Lovestone and his associates with the Communist International. The Comintern's was at the time attempting to solve the unceasing and bitter factional war in the American Communist Party by equalizing factional strength in the party leadership and reassigning factional leaders Lovestone and Alexander Bittelman to Comintern work abroad, decisions which the Lovestone <b>majority</b> <b>group</b> deeply resented. Zimmerman soon found himself expelled from the organization along with Lovestone and most of the others in his circle for their defiance of the Comintern's instructions.|$|E

40|$|To {{explore the}} effects of various {{categorization}} strategies on intergroup bias within and beyond a contact situation, two experiments were conducted involving groups of different size and/or status that worked together on a cooperative task. Three categorization strategies (decategorization, recategorization, and dual identity) were compared, and bias was measured through symbolic reward allocations {{to people who were}} and were not actually encountered. In Experiment 1 (N = 129), we varied group size (minority or majority) and found that it affected bias within the contact situationminority groups were more biased than <b>majority</b> <b>groups.</b> All of the categorization strategies limited bias and they did so equally well. Outside the contact situation, however, only the recategorization and dual identity strategies limited bias. In Experiment 2 (N = 156), we varied both group status (low or high) and group size. Both of these variables affected bias within the contact situationhigh status groups were more biased than low status groups, and minority groups were again more biased than <b>majority</b> <b>groups.</b> Once again, all three categorization strategies limited bias and they did so equally well. Outside the contact situation, however, an interaction among the independent variables was observed. For minority groups, only the dual identity strategy limited bias, but none of the categorization strategies limited bias for <b>majority</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
25|$|Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, {{which was}} not capped, was in the unusual {{position}} of being unable to set a rate due to the actions of dissenting councillors from the <b>majority</b> <b>group</b> combining with the opposition. The council had a leadership from the right-wing of the Labour Party; council leader John Riley argued that the rates were high enough and that ratepayers ought {{not to have a}} massive increase. However two left-wing Labour councillors Chris Rackley and Thérèse Shanahan announced that they would join with the opposition Liberal group to support a 'no cuts' budget. Their stance attracted others and the Labour budget was defeated with nine Labour councillors voting against it.|$|E
25|$|The Bubi people (also {{known as}} Voove, Pove, Bobes, Boobes, Boobees, Boobies, Boubies, Adeeyahs, Adeejahs, Adijas, Ediyas, Eris, Fernando Poans, Fernandians and Bantu-speaking Bubi) are a Bantu ethnic group of Central Africa who are {{indigenous}} to Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. Once the <b>majority</b> <b>group</b> in the region, the population experienced a sharp decline due to disease and outright killing sprees during Portuguese expeditions. By {{the end of}} Spanish colonial rule in the mid 20th century, and after substantial intermarriage with newly introduced populations, such as Afro-Cubans, Krio people, Portuguese people and Spaniards, the Bubi people, again, experienced a great decline in number. Seventy-five percent perished due to tribal/clan rooted political genocide during a civil war that led to Spanish Guinea's independence from Spain. This, too, sparked mass exodus from their homeland {{with most of the}} exiles and refugees immigrating into Spain. The indigenous Bubi of Bioko Island have since been outnumbered—first by non-indigenous Krio Fernandinos; and then by members of the Fang ethnic group, who have immigrated in large numbers from Río Muni. Once numbering over 3 million, the Bubi currently number less than 100,000 worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent {{litigation}} further {{defined the}} contours of [...] "vote dilution through submergence" [...] claims. In Bartlett v. Strickland (2009), the Supreme Court held that the first Gingles precondition can be satisfied only if a district can be drawn in which the minority group comprises a majority of voting-age citizens. This means that plaintiffs cannot succeed on a submergence claim in jurisdictions where {{the size of the}} minority group, despite not being large enough to comprise a majority in a district, is large enough for its members to elect their preferred candidates with the help of [...] "crossover" [...] votes from some members of the <b>majority</b> <b>group.</b> In contrast, the Supreme Court has not addressed whether different protected minority groups can be aggregated to satisfy the Gingles preconditions as a coalition, and lower courts have split on the issue.|$|E

500|$|Section 2 prohibits {{two types}} of discrimination: [...] "vote denial", {{in which a person}} is denied the {{opportunity}} to cast a ballot or to have their vote properly counted, and [...] "vote dilution", in which the strength or effectiveness of a person's vote is diminished. Most Section 2 litigation has concerned vote dilution, especially claims that a jurisdiction's redistricting plan or use of at-large/multimember elections prevents minority voters from casting sufficient votes to elect their preferred candidates. An at-large election can dilute the votes cast by minority voters by allowing a cohesive <b>majority</b> <b>group</b> to win every legislative seat in the jurisdiction. Redistricting plans can be gerrymandered to dilute votes cast by minorities by [...] "packing" [...] high numbers of minority voters into a small number of districts or [...] "cracking" [...] minority groups by placing small numbers of minority voters into a large number of districts.|$|E
500|$|At the Sixth National Congress held in October 1963, Aflaq {{was barely}} able {{to hold on to}} his post as Secretary General – the Marxist factions led by al-Shufi and Ali Salih al-Sadi, in Syria and Iraq respectively, were the <b>majority</b> <b>group.</b> Another problem facing Aflaq was that several of his colleagues were not elected to party office, for {{instance}} al-Bitar was not reelected to a seat in the National Command. Instead of the traditional civilian leadership, a new leadership consisting of military officers was gradually growing; Jadid and Amin al-Hafiz from Syria and Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Salih Mahdi Ammash from Iraq were elected to the National Command. While the Military Committee was in fact taking control over the Ba'ath Party from the civilian leadership, they were sensitive to such criticism, and stated, in an ideological pamphlet, that civilian-military symbiosis was of major importance, if socialist reconstruction was to be achieved. To the outside world Aflaq seemed to be in charge. As the Tunisian newspaper [...] put it; [...] "The philosopher who made two coups [...] in a month".|$|E
