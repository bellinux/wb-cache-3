5|$|Team Razer faced Firestorm3 {{in their}} first battle of the series grand final, in a rematch from the All-Stars semi-final from earlier that year. Whilst victory in that battle had been {{relatively}} straightforward, Firestorm3 had increased the thickness of its armour for this battle to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> Razer to inflict major damage. This tactic almost worked: Razer was unable to completely immobilise the robot. The fight ended in a close judges' decision—in Razer's favour. Victory handed Razer {{a place in the}} series five grand final against Bigger Brother, rebuilt after being heavily damaged by Hypno-Disc in its previous battle. Razer gripped Bigger Brother early in the battle, causing damage to its opponent's drive chain from which Bigger Brother never recovered. The final ended in a stalemate and went to the judges; their decision came back in favour of Razer. Along with the UK Championship, Razer also took home a third Best Design award.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, {{based on a}} neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other reforms included removing many of the country's labour laws, to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from {{institutions such as the}} World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt labourers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them. In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1 percent to 3 percent over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks. Over Modi's first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5 percent, making it the world's fastest-growing large economy.|$|E

25|$|Waterfowl {{males of}} the family Aves: Anatidae have evolved a phallus to aid in coercion. This phallus everts out of the male body (when it’s time to mate) in a {{counter-clockwise}} coil. As a response, females have developed vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils {{to protect themselves from}} forceful intromission. Waterfowl females have evolved these “convoluted vaginal morphologies” to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> males to insert themselves without the female’s consent.|$|E
25|$|The male {{waterfowl}} (Aves: Anatidae) {{evolution of}} a phallus to forcefully copulate with females has led to counteradaptations in females {{in the form of}} vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils. These structures <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> males to achieve intromission. The clockwise coils are significant because the male phallus everts out of their body in a counter-clockwise spiral; therefore, a clockwise vaginal structure would impede forceful copulation. Studies have shown that the longer a male’s phallus is, the more elaborate the vaginal structures were.|$|E
25|$|Scientists using {{computer}} models to study extreme axial tilts {{have concluded that}} high obliquity would cause climate extremes that would threaten Earth-like life.

Although the obliquity they studied is more extreme than Earth ever experiences, there are scenarios 1.5 to 4.5 billion years from now, as the Moon's stabilizing effect lessens, where obliquity could leave its current range and the poles could eventually point almost directly at the Sun.|$|E

25|$|When {{it became}} clear that Mexico would not stand for this kind of an agreement, some critics from the labor {{movement}} would not settle for any viable alternatives. In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress. Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too much would cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats, and would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> the United States to elicit support from Mexico.|$|E
25|$|A rather {{specialized}} {{market for}} typewriters exists {{due to the}} regulations of many correctional systems in the US, where prisoners are prohibited from having computers or telecommunication equipment, but are allowed to own typewriters. The Swintec corporation (headquartered in Moonachie, New Jersey), which, as of 2011, still produced typewriters at its overseas factories (in Japan, Indonesia, and/or Malaysia), manufactures a variety of typewriters for use in prisons, made of clear plastic (to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> prisoners to hide prohibited items inside it). As of 2011, the company had contracts with prisons in 43 US states.|$|E

Beck submitted a resolution asking Tobin to stay on as president, but forced Tobin to refuse. As further humiliation, Tobin nominated Beck for president. He was elected by acclamation.

25|$|Justice Thurgood Marshall {{wrote for}} the court, resolving a {{conflict}} between the appellate circuits; Byron White added a concurrence in which he noted some issues with the underlying securities law that were not before the Court but, he felt, could in future cases <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> parties such as Byrd to claim that federal law always allowed them to litigate private actions for securities fraud.

25|$|The Drupal core {{search is}} {{ineffective}} at searching content: There are contributed modules that will greatly improve the search functionality on a Drupal website, {{but they are}} not easily accessible due to a high learning curve and the difficulty users have in general of finding the right module. One of the faceted search options is Apache Solr Search Integration module, however, the module requires a dedicated server or virtual private server (VPS) to operate because Solr must run on a servlet container, e.g. Tomcat, Jetty or Resin. These requirements <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> a Drupal website to have a functional search feature. In response some companies have created Apache Solr SaaS products.|$|E
25|$|Early rockets {{were very}} inaccurate. Without {{the use of}} {{spinning}} or any controlling feedback loop, rockets had a strong tendency to veer sharply off of their intended course. The early Mysorean rockets and their successor British Congreve rockets reduced this somewhat by attaching a long stick {{to the end of}} a rocket (similar to modern bottle rockets) to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> the rocket to change course. The largest of the Congreve rockets was the 32-pound (14.5kg) Carcass, which had a 15-foot (4.6 m) stick. Originally, sticks were mounted on the side, but this was later changed to mounting in the center of the rocket, reducing drag and enabling the rocket to be more accurately fired from a segment of pipe.|$|E
