40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere are {{in excess of}} 500, 000 <b>Manned</b> <b>Portable</b> Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) in worldwide inventories including several thousand outside of government control. MANPADS are surface-to-air missile systems enabling the operator to launch missiles at aircraft from the ground. The most common MANPADS are the Russian SA- 7 and U. S. Stinger, which feature infrared guidance systems. The concern that MANPADS can easily be acquired by non-state actors' intent on downing civilian and military aircraft has led international agencies, the U. S., and Russia to implement measures {{to reduce the risk}} of a MANPADS attack. International agencies such as the Wassenaar Arrangement work to stop illegal MANPADS proliferation. The U. S. MANPADS Defense Act and the U. S. Department of Homeland Security have implemented measures to counter the MANPADS threat. Russia has revised its export controls and forged a counter-proliferation agreement with most CIS countries. However, the multilateral initiatives to better control MANPADS stocks and transfers are far from comprehensive. A new approach to mitigating the MANPADS threat adopts elements from the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty and the Landmine Monitor. The conclusion of this thesis is that if MANPADS counter-proliferation efforts remain status quo an attack on a commercial aircraft in the western world is imminent...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{design and}} testing of a {{portable}} pumping system {{for use in the}} hydraulic excavation of commercial crab pots buried by ocean sediment was undertaken. The resulting portable system retained the four major components of the pumping systems presently used by commercial fishermen: engine, pump, fire hose, and nozzle. Because present systems are too heavy and unwieldy for use on smaller crab boats, a system of more modest proportions yet equivalent excavating capacity was sought. By using a more effective waterjet nozzle, it became possible to employ a one-cylinder pump-engine combination easily <b>portable</b> by two <b>men.</b> The <b>portable</b> pump and engine were purchased and a nozzle manufactured. The system package was assembled, tested for system flow characteristics, then field tested. The system performed well in a simulation experiment, digging a sizable hole on a sand flat. Limited testing aboard ship indicates that the system performs adequately there as well. Along with meeting the design criteria of performance, durability, portability, and corrosion resistance, the system may be simply fabricated using a metal lathe and basic welding equipment. The cost of the system is comparable to that of presently used systems. Analysis of phenomena associated with crab pot pumping, such as hose drag and nozzle reaction forces, was also performed...|$|R

50|$|The Spanish {{and their}} allies had to flee the city, as the people of Tenochtitlan had risen against them and their {{situation}} could only deteriorate. Because the Aztecs had removed the bridges over the gaps in the causeways that linked {{the city to the}} surrounding lands, Cortés' <b>men</b> constructed a <b>portable</b> bridge to cross the water of the lake.

Darkness tells him that he is just lonely and wants a playmate. After the two of them play together by playing the game [...] "Cheese and Crackers", Sam leaves the closet and finds himself back in his own room.
