5000|$|The {{name comes}} not from the popular fruit flavorings but {{from the fact that}} the acid in the mixture — which was then sourced from either citrus fruit (citric acid) or grapes (tartaric acid) — forms further salts such <b>monosodium</b> <b>citrate</b> in {{solution}} with the carbonates or tartrates. [...] "Fruit salt" [...] thus refers both to the fruit-derived salts formed in solution and metonymically to the mixture as a whole.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{changes in}} the blood of dogs treated with various inorganic salts after obstruction of the duodenum are reported. Two dogs treated with sodium chloride survived approximately six times as long as the average untreated animal, one living 22 days, the other 24 days. Ammonium chloride was found to produce an acidosis. The administration of potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride did not prevent the usual rise in non-protein nitrogen and fall in chlorides, and the fatal outcome. Iodides seemingly hasten the toxic process. Sodium bromide appears to have an inhibitory action upon it, but much less than that of sodium chloride. Sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, sodium <b>citrate,</b> <b>monosodium</b> phosphate, and disodium phosphate failed to alter the course of the intoxication. Atropine and pilocarpine were without therapeutic value in preventing the changes characteristic of intestinal obstruction...|$|R

The hybrids are synthesized by a two-step process: (a) ice templation of an aqueous suspension comprised of Nafion, graphite oxide, and chloroplatinic acid to form a microcellular porous network and (b) mild reduction in hydrazine or <b>monosodium</b> <b>citrate</b> which leads to graphene-supported Pt nanoparticles on a Nafion scaffold. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Olsen, Ronald H. (University of Minnesota, St. Paul) and James J. Jezeski. Some {{effects of}} carbon source, aeration, and {{temperature}} on {{growth of a}} psychrophilic strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens. J. Bacteriol. 86 : 429 – 433. 1963. —A psychrophilic strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens was grown in stationary and aerated culture at 4, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 32 C. Generation times were determined for cultures growing in media containing glucose, <b>monosodium</b> <b>citrate,</b> or Casamino Acids as the primary carbon and energy source. The results indicated that growth on Casamino Acids with aeration contributed to significantly shorter generation times at low temperatures when compared with other media systems. Furthermore, temperature coefficients (Q 10 values) calculated from growth-velocity data showed {{that the effects of}} temperature on growth rate are influenced by the carbon source in the growth medium and by aeration...|$|E
40|$|Current {{strategies}} in developing calcium phosphate bone substitutes are focused towards in situ {{setting of the}} cements under physiological conditions with adequate mechanical properties, which can be tai- lored to be resorbable by controlling structure and composition. In this study we report the formulation of brushite cements at both physiological and ambient temperature {{and its effect on}} the structure and properties. In addition the inﬂuence of using both, an alkaline and acidic retardant on the setting and ageing of the cements are reported. <b>Monosodium</b> <b>citrate</b> (pH 3. 5 ± 0. 1) or trisodium citrate (pH 8. 3 ± 0. 1) solutions were used at retardants at 23 ◦ C and 37 ◦ C, which clearly indicated that both these parameters inﬂuenced strength and microstructure. The ageing of the cements indicated some conversion to mon- etite, which was predominant in cements formulated at physiological temperature. The results clearly show that the microstructure, resorbability and strength of these in situ setting cements can be manipu- lated by compositional and temperature ranges to provide wider application as bone substitute materials...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} coconut water with a lone concentration and different concentrations of glycerol on chilled and cryopreserved cattle semen characteristics. Methods: Semen was collected from five mature cattle bulls, at weekly intervals for 5 weeks. The ejaculates were pooled and evaluated for dilution processing. Tris citrate egg yolk fructose was used as control treatment for semen, while 50 % (V/V) coconut water, 25 % (V/V) bidistilled water and 25 % (V/V, 5 % anhydrous <b>monosodium</b> <b>citrate)</b> to 20 mL egg yolk and three different concentrations of glycerol (4 %, 6 % and 8 %) were used as coconut water (CW) - glycerol-yolk extenders (CWCG- 4, CWCG- 6 and CWCG- 8). Extended semen was cooled and cryopreserved. Sperm motility%, sperm membrane integrity%, normal acrosome%, live sperm% and total sperm abnormalities% were recorded after equilibrium and after freezethawing. Results: The addition of 4 % glycerol to coconut water enriched media (CWCG- 4) revealed the most effective addition of glycerol on all parameters after equilibrium and after freeze-thawing. Conclusions: Coconut water enriched media with 4 % glycerol addition is safe {{to be used as}} an extender in bull semen preservation because it is a sterile liquid. So, it can be used without addition of antibiotics to the extender, as antibiotics have to some extent hazardous effect on spermatozoa...|$|E
40|$|A {{capillary}} electrophoresis method with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (CE-C 4 D) has been developed, optimized and validated for {{the determination of}} ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin {{is a member of}} the fluoroquinolone antibiotics with a broad spectrum bactericidal activity and recommended for complicated respiratory infections, sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, bacterial diarrhea etc. Method development was conducted with major focus on the quality by design (QbD) approach. During method development, multiple buffers were tried at different ionic strength. However, the optimized method finally involved a very simple background electrolyte, <b>monosodium</b> <b>citrate</b> at a concentration of 10  mM without pH adjustment. The optimized CE-C 4 D method involved an uncoated fused silica capillary (59 / 39  cm, 50  μm i. d.) and hydrodynamic sample injection at a pressure of 0. 5 p. s. i. for 5  s. The actual separation was conducted for 10  min at normal polarity with a voltage of 20  kV corresponding to 5. 9  μA current. LiCl (1  mg/mL) was used as an internal standard. The optimized method is robust and accurate (recovery > 98 %) which rendered the ciprofloxacin peak within five minutes with good linearity (R 2  >  0. 999) in the concentration range of 0. 0126 – 0. 8  mg/mL. The repeatability is expressed by percentage relative standard deviation (%RSD) of the relative peak areas (RPA) and it showed good repeatability both intra-day (< 3 %) and inter-day (3. 1 %). This method, proven to be free of matrix interference, showed that the estimated percent content of ciprofloxacin (102 %) was within the official requirements. Moreover, due to its ease of use and robustness, the method should also be applicable in less well controlled laboratory environments...|$|E

A zero-formaldehyde, easy-care finish for {{silk fabric}} {{has been developed}} using a polycarboxylic acid (PCA) finishing system. This thesis confirms that treatment of silk fabric with selected PCA finishing systems improves the stability of silk fabric. The treated fabric had improved stability to heat, reduced swelling in solvents, and improved elastic recovery in the dry and wet states. A number of interesting mechanistic possibilities are proposed for improving the easy- care performance of silk fabrics with a PCA finishing system. It is postulated that the improvement in elastic and stability properties of the treated silk fabrics could be {{as a consequence of}} new fibre inter-chain cross-links and/or a new intra-fibre PCA polymer network being formed within the silk fibres. Three different types of possible bonds between the PCA and silk fibroin were proposed : • Ester links formed via acid and/or base catalysis with hydroxyl containing amino acids, serine, threonine and tyrosine, in silk fibroin. • Amide links may also be formed between the basic amino acids, arginine, lysine and histidine, in silk fibroin and acid anhydrides formed during curing. • Hydrogen bonds formed with acid, basic and hydroxy side groups and with the silk fibroin backbone. This thesis extends previous research with respect to PCA finishing. It proposes the use of a new analytical method to pre-determine the effectiveness of an acid/catalyst system as an easy-care finish. It recommends the use of combination acids to compete with 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid and proposes the use of <b>monosodium</b> <b>citrate</b> as an alternative catalyst to sodium hypophosphite when cured at 165 °C. Good easy-care performance was achieved with silk fabrics treated with selective PCA/catalyst finish {{in the presence of a}} swelling agent, such as formic acid or acrylic acid, followed by after-treatment with a silicone softener. The finish produced a super soft, minimum iron fabric with enhanced resistance to fabric abrasion. The treated fabric was machine-washable...|$|E
