When drop growth is sufficiently slow, the effect of forces arising from surface tension due to the changing dimensions of the drop becomes evident.

40|$|Abstract) A high-turning {{compressor}} stator {{with a unique}} flow contr l design was developed and tested. Both boundary layer suction and trailing edge blowing developed from a single supplied <b>motive</b> <b>pressure</b> source are employed on the stator. Massflow removed through boundary layer suction {{is added to the}} motive massflow, and the resulting combined flow is used for trailing edge blowing to reduce the total pressure deficit generated by the stator wake. The effectiveness of the flow control design was investigated experimentally by measuring the reduction in the total pressure loss coefficient. The experiment was conducted in a linear transonic blowdown cascade wind tunnel. The inlet Mach number for all tests was 0. 79, with a Reynolds number based on stator chordlength of 2 ´ 106. A range of inlet cascade angles was tested to identify the useful range of the flow control design. The effect of different supply massflows represented {{as a percentage of the}} passage throughflow was also documented. Significant reductions in the total pressure loss coefficient were accomplished with flow control at low cascade angles. A maximum reduction of 65 % in the baseline (no flow control) loss coefficient was achieved by using a motive massflow of 1. 6 % of the passage throughflow, at cascade angle of 0 °. Th...|$|E
40|$|Steam ejector is an {{essential}} part in refrigeration and air conditioning, desalination, petroleum refining, petrochemical and chemical industries. The ejectors form an integral part of distillation columns, condensers and other heat exchange processes. In this study, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) analysis based on the finite volume method was employed to investigate the influence of angle of converging duct on the ejector performance. The degree of angle of converging duct was varied at 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 25, 2. 0, and 2. 75. The using of CFD method allowed not only the accurate prediction of the performance but also the identification of the shock/expansion wave, the circulation zone, and the pressure distribution of the axial direction. Verification with experimental data was also undertaken at various operational conditions. The comparisons of entrainment ratio between experimental and CFD results for various suction and discharge pressures at a fixed <b>motive</b> <b>pressure</b> show a good agreement. CFD studies show that the increase of converging angle affects on the increase of static pressure field inside of mixing duct. Hence, the length of shock train region is also influenced by the angle of converging duct. It is observed from this study that the entrainment ratio of ejector is influenced by the angle of converging duct. Ejector with degree of angle = 0. 5 gives the highest value and then decrease with reference to the increase of converging angle. The flow visualization of stream functions inside the ejector shows that the flow separation phenomena and recirculation conditions occur in the ejector with larger converging angle. The optimum design of steam ejector is at converging duct angle of 0. 5 degree which gives maximum entrainment ratio of 0. 941...|$|E

40|$|Aim Nephrectomy {{performed}} on healthy individuals {{for the purpose}} of transplantation is an exceptional activity. It confers great responsibilities to the medical staff involved. Potential donors must be carefully informed and assessed with respect to medical and psychosocial aspects. This thesis focuses on information, motives for donation, setting medical limits and the experience of undergoing nephrectomy. Materials and MethodsThe contents of written information from transplant units in 14 countries were investigated. Interviews were conducted with potential donors, and analysed using a phenomenological approach (n= 12). Categories of motives were identified. Questionnaires were sent to potential donors in Sweden and Norway, asking respondents to mark on a Visual Analogue Scale the importance of several motives and concerns (n= 154). The outcome of transplantation was evaluated with respect to several risk factors, including a low glomerular filtration rate of the living donor (n= 344). From medical records and in interviews performed 4 weeks post donation, the degree of pain, fatigue and physical activity were evaluated and compared between donors who underwent open and laparoscopic nephrectomy (n= 55 and 45, respectively). ResultsThe contents of the information brochures varied greatly, and many lacked important aspects. The decision to donate was mainly emotionally based. Seven major motives for donation were identified - a desire to help, a logic <b>motive,</b> <b>pressure,</b> identification, increased self-esteem, self-benefit and moral duty. A desire to help, identification and self-benefit were the strongest motives. In contrast, pressure, guilt and religion were weak incentives. A glomerular filtration rate below 80 ml/min was shown to be an independent risk factor for graft loss. The laparoscopic nephrectomy technique conferred less pain than the open procedure. Irrespective of surgical method, most donors had not recovered physically or mentally after 4 weeks. ConclusionsTo inform potential donors is of paramount importance, but difficult because the decision to donate is rarely based on actual facts. Most potential live kidney donors have a combination of motives for donation and mixed feelings about it. A lower limit for donor GFR should be set. Regardless of surgical technique, living kidney donation is more demanding, mentally and physically, than commonly recognised. These are important aspects of the pre-donation evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Air-jet {{pumps are}} being used {{increasingly}} in industry to feed and transport {{a wide range of}} bulk solids because of their simplicity in structure, lack of moving parts, convenience of installation and operation and with little damage to the product. However, to date, the design of this type of equipment and associated conveying system still is a 2 ̆ 2 black art 2 ̆ 2 due to the shortage of theoretical analysis and experimental data reported in the literature regarding the design and application of these pumps. For this reason, this thesis aims at formulating a mathematical model to predict jet p u m p performance under air-solids flow conditions and developing a general design procedure by investigating into the effect of air-jet p u m p geometry and operating conditions on the performance of these pumps, so that options to improve efficiency can be determined. To obtain detailed information on the interaction between the operating conditions and jet p u m p geometry, a systematic experimental investigation is undertaken into the characteristic performance of central air-jet pumps with five different nozzle geometry and annular air-jet pumps with multi-hole ring nozzles operating under both air-only and airsolid flow conditions. These experiments were conducted by varying <b>motive</b> <b>pressure,</b> back pressure respectively for each particular jet p u m p design to observe the effect of operating conditions and geometric parameters on p u m p performance. The factors affecting performance also are analysed. Generally, the efficiency of annular air-jet pumps with multi-hole ring nozzles is less that of central air-jet pumps. Based on the experimental results, options to improve efficiency by modifying the geometrical design are suggested. To assess the energy-effectiveness of an air-jet pump operating under different conditions, dimensional and non-dimensional parameters are defined and employed to represent jet p u m p characteristic performance and efficiency. A mathematical model to predict air-jet pump performance is formulated on the basis of fluid mechanics and a numerical solution is obtained. This model is used to predict the non-dimensional relationship between the motive, suction and discharge flow through an air-jet pump with a given geometry. The predicted performance agrees well with experimental results for numerous jet pump geometries, operating conditions and different materials. Based on the performance prediction model and experimental results, optimum parameters for maximum efficiency are analysed and correlated with experimental data. design procedure for an air-jet pump conveying system is developed to maximise efficiency and reliability. This design procedure also is applied to the proper sizing air-jet pump for a given application requirement. A mathematical optimisation model for the optimal design of an air-jet pump system is formulated and the numerical solution this model is obtained. The optimisation results agree well with the optimum parameters obtained from experiments. It is concluded {{on the basis of the}} analyses and experimental investigations that it is possible to improve the efficiency of air-solids jet pumps by modelling its performance and optimising its geometry for a given operating condition or adjusting the operating condition for a jet pump with a given configuration...|$|E
40|$|Steam {{is highly}} used {{in most of}} the industries. There are many {{occasions}} where low pressure steam is used. Most of the times, relatively higher pressure is generated, transported and finally the pressure is reduced before use. Throttling devices are used for reducing pressure. Throttling valves or pressure reducing valves have been used for this work {{in most of the}} instances. There is a huge potential of utilizing this energy by introducing back pressure steam turbines. If the turbine exhaust pressure can be further dropped, power generation through the steam turbine can be increased. This research project was created to cover these areas. There is no literature which can be used to calculate the power output of a turbine with known flow rates and input and output conditions. This project is aimed to give the information how much power is generated under the given conditions. This can be used for selecting a suitable back pressure turbine for the particular requirement. Giving the capital investment for such project also was an objective. It can be decided whether the selected project on retrofitting pressure reducing valves with the steam turbines is viable. There is no sufficient information on performance of thermo-compressors which can be used for increasing steam pressure. There is an objective of finding out the motive flow required for the known suction flow at known input and output conditions. As the title of the research shows, ultimate objective {{of this study was to}} see whether combining thermo-compressors to reduce back pressures is feasible or not. This research project was done for five input steam conditions and six output steam conditions of the turbines. For a selected turbine, performance at known pressures was calculated. This information was graphically represented to give a clear picture. Similarly performance of thermo-compressors was calculated for known input and conditions. This information also was graphically represented. Finally the performance of the back pressure turbines were calculated when the back pressure dropped further by introducing thermo-compressors. Calculated values were graphically represented to check whether this was a viable option. As per the outcome of this project, guide lines were made for back pressure steam turbines with different input and output conditions. As the input, superheated steam varying from 10 barg at 350 deg. C up to 50 barg at 450 deg. C have been considered. Turbine exhaust pressures varying from 1 bara to 6 bara also have been considered. Guide lines were extended to show the cost of investment to retrofit pressure reducing valves with back pressure turbines. Guide lines were made on the amount of <b>motive</b> <b>pressure</b> consumed to increase the pressure of steam at different input and output conditions. These guidelines also were extended to show the capital investment of the installing thermo-compressors. Process steam pressures varying from 2 bara to 6 bara have been discussed against turbine exhaust pressures varying from 1 bara to 6 bara under the study of the behavior of the back pressure steam turbines combined with thermo-compressors. Further study was done to ensure whether there is any effect of the isentropic efficiency and the generator efficiency on this behavior. Finally, it was proved that there was no benefit of operating the back pressure steam turbines at lower exhaust pressure by introducing thermocompressors and increasing the pressure before giving to the process for the pressure and temperature ranges covered in this study. Retrofitting of PRV with steam turbines seems to be an attractive option. This study discussed only the application of superheated steam. Further studies can be extended to saturated steam to use single stage steam turbines. Introducing of thermo-compressors for specific industries also can be done as a further study. However, further study of introducing thermo-compressors to enhance performance of back pressure turbine will not be done as it seems not viable...|$|E

40|$|Supercharging is {{a process}} {{which is used to}} improve the {{performance}} of an engine by increasing the specific power output whereas exhaust gas recirculation reduces the NOx produced by engine because of supercharging. In a conventional engine, supercharger functions as a compressor for the forced induction of the charge taking mechanical power from the engine crankshaft. In this study, supercharging is achieved using a jet compressor. In the jet compressor, the exhaust gas is used as the motive stream and the atmospheric air as the propelled stream. When high <b>pressure</b> <b>motive</b> stream from the engine exhaust is expanded in the nozzle, a low pressure is created at the nozzle exit. Due to this low pressure, atmospheric air is sucked into the expansion chamber of the compressor, where it is mixed and pressurized with the <b>motive</b> stream. The <b>pressure</b> of the mixed stream is further increased in the diverging section of the jet compressor. A percentage volume of the pressurized air mixture is then inducted back into the engine as supercharged air and the balance is let out as exhaust. This process not only saves the mechanical power required for supercharging but also dilutes the constituents of the engine exhaust gas thereby reducing the emission and the noise level generated from the engine exhaust. The geometrical design parameters of the jet compressor were obtained by solving the governing equations using the method of constant rate of momentum change. Using the theoretical design parameters of the jet compressor, a computational fluid dinamics analysis using FLUENT software was made to evaluate the performance of the jet compressor for the application of supercharging an IC engine.

40|$|The {{studies in}} this thesis sought to further {{validate}} the role of impulsivity facets, in particular the urgency facets (rash actions in response to intense positive or negative emotions), as risk factors for different {{patterns of alcohol use}} and related problems. Previous research has supported the use of mood based dispositions to rash action in predicting a wide range of maladaptive behaviours. However, these studies have predominantly relied on correlational research designs, and there has been limited consideration of variables that may mediate or moderate links between the impulsivity facets and alcohol use. The first three studies described in the thesis employed correlational designs to examine whether urgency facets predict alcohol use and problems over and above other UPPS-P facets, and the mechanisms through which urgency leads to alcohol use and related problems (e. g. drinking motives, executive functions) among a group of college students (n= 140, n= 386, n= 62 respectively for study 1, study 2, and study 3). The following two studies used experimental designs to assess the effects of alcohol use on executive functions and behavioural risk taking as moderated by trait urgency (n= 82); and the potential moderating effects of high activation positive mood states on the relationship between positive urgency and beer consumption (n= 110). Consistent with previous research, the first three studies revealed that urgency facets predicted alcohol use and problems beyond the other three facets of the UPPS-P. Additionally, the relationship between impulsivity facets and the three patterns of alcohol use was mediated through different drinking motives; while the relationship between negative urgency, sensation seeking, lack of perseverance and weekly total alcohol use was mediated by peer <b>pressure</b> <b>motives,</b> the relationship between negative urgency, sensation seeking and problem use was mediated by coping and peer <b>pressure</b> <b>motives,</b> and the relationship between lack of perseverance, sensation seeking and binge use of alcohol was mediated by enhancement and peer <b>pressure</b> <b>motives.</b> Study 3 demonstrated that lack of perseverance, but not the urgency facets, moderated the effects of alcohol use on distractor interference. Study 4 showed that the acute effect of alcohol on prepotent response inhibition was moderated through sensation seeking; negative urgency was directly and positively related to prepotent response inhibition and risk taking, while positive urgency was negatively associated with distractor interference. Finally, study 5 found that positive urgency led to increases in beer consumption following high activation positive mood induction, as opposed to low activation and neutral mood conditions. Overall, the role of urgency showed incremental validity beyond previously identified risk factors. These findings, combined with prior cross-sectional and longitudinal field studies, provide strong support for the unique contribution of urgency in rash actions. Additionally, sensation seeking and lack of perseverance emerged as strong determinants of prepotent response inhibition and distractor interference, respectively, among college students who consume alcohol excessively. The studies {{in this thesis}} support the notion that impulsivity is a multi-faceted construct, and highlight the function of each facet in alcohol use and related problems, and the role of other contributing factors (e. g. drinking motives, executive functions, and positive mood) in this relationship...|$|R

The present study examined controlled motives as an overarching motivational factor in eating dysregulation and examined {{its effects on}} dieting behaviour {{for those who are}} underweight, overweight or obese. Objective. – To examine whether the influence of controlled motives on dieting behaviour would bemoderated by body mass index (BMI). Specifically, it was hypothesised that controlled motives would be associated with high levels of dieting behaviour in underweight individuals and low levels of dieting behaviour in individuals classified as overweight or obese. Method. – One hundred and thirty-seven participants completed the measures of height, weight, and motivation and intentions towards watching their diet and subsequently completed a measure of dieting behaviour two weeks later. Results. – Moderated regression and simple slopes analyses provided support for the hypothesised effects at underweight, overweight, and obese range BMIs. Conclusion. – The effect of controlled motives on dieting behaviour is dependent upon BMI and therefore varies across underweight, overweight, and obese individuals.

40|$|An ejector is {{a device}} that entrains a {{secondary}} flow into a high speed stream that is generated by expansion of high <b>pressure</b> <b>motive</b> gas [1]. These ejectors can be broadly classified into central ejectors and annular ejectors. A large majority of applications involve central ejectors where the motive gas flow is injected along {{the centre of the}} flow passage of the secondary flow. Dutton and Carroll [2] proposed an optimization procedure for such ejectors without taking the mixed supersonic flow region into account and generated the design curves considering the constant Total temperature, Molecular weight and Specific heat ratios. However in some applications involving high temperature gases such as in ramjet/ scramjet and gas turbine test facilities, an annular supersonic ejector is more appropriate where annular injection of the motive gas at the periphery of the flow passage is desired to avoid the exposure of the motive gas flow nozzle to the high temperature combustion product gases. A design and optimization procedure for an annular supersonic ejector based on the earlier approach [2] with the mixed supersonic flow region and incorporating variable Total temperature, Molecular weight and Specific heat ratios in the model has been developed based on simplified one dimensional constant area mixing model and verified using CFD software Fluen...|$|R
40|$|An {{injector}} is {{a particular}} type of jet pump which uses condensable vapor to entrain a liquid and discharge against a pressure higher than either <b>motive</b> or suction <b>pressures.</b> The injector has no moving parts and requires no external power supply nor any complex control system. Thus, the injector is particularly suited for emergency core cooling operations. A detailed survey has indicated that various injector designs are available for operating pressures below 250 psig. However, the design of these injectors from the viewpoint of a basic understanding of heat and mass transfer processes has not been well developed. A critical review of the models showed serious discrepancies between the analytical models and the experimental observations. The discrepancies evolved from the neglect of non-equilibrium aspects of the flow. The origin of the non-equilibrium aspects {{can be traced to the}} extremely small time scales governing the flow in the injector. Thus, time scales of the order of 10 {sup {minus} 2 } seconds are involved in the injector, accompanied by mass, momentum, and heat transfer rates of orders of magnitude higher than that observed in conventional two-phase flows. The present study focuses on the phenomenological and mathematical modeling of the processes in the injector from the viewpoint of its non-equilibrium nature...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to present the {{phenomenon}} of posting workers within the EU {{in the context of}} the freedom to provide services. The author introduces the de lege lata legal framework in a complex and chronological manner, taking into consideration the <b>motives</b> and political <b>pressure</b> behind key modifications. Accordingly, the thesis examines relevant Treaty provisions, case law and its evolution, key secondary acts, as well as the relation of such sources to legal acts which address posting workers in an indirect manner. The author focuses on the analysis of existing key provisions, their practical impact and insufficiencies. However, she also approaches the topic from the de lege ferenda perspective by presenting the ongoing revision of the current legal framework and by considering other potential changes which could improve the regulation of posted workers in the future. Furthermore, the thesis demonstrates the complexity of posting workers by drawing attention to the colliding interests of involved member states and parties, showing the sensitivity of the subject. This underlines the fact that the phenomenon cannot be separated from its political context and is condemned to a constant balancing of two colliding interests - the freedom to provide services and social protection of posted [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{land use}} change have {{attracted}} relatively less attention from historians {{compared to other}} disciplines like human geography and anthropology. A history of land use change in Kilimanjaro is a study of how different actors interacted and shaped {{the whole process of}} land use on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro between 1920 s and 2000 s. It shows that land use change involved a myriad of complex interrelations that cut across a number of actors. The actors were government policies and plans, uses of a particular land, the social, economic and political construction and affiliation to a landscape. This study uses the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro to show how the Chagga have interacted with the challenges of population increase and market economy that had impact on land availability and use. It argues that while government plans were vital in determining land use, they were not enough to give directions towards particular forms and styles of land uses, it remained to be negotiated with other factors just mentioned above. Also the study shows that it is not always the case that only population <b>pressure</b> and economic <b>motives</b> influence the way people interact with their environment but a combination of population <b>pressure,</b> economic <b>motives</b> and social cultural motives. By using documentary sources, oral histories and contemporary sources such as satellite imagery reading and interpretation, this study concludes that access to land use was diverse and varied across and within similar environments in the whole period of study from 1920 s to 2000 s. The variation resulted from the nature of the societies themselves, their environments and how authorities tended to regulate access and use. The thesis shows near the end that adaptation and resilience to both social-cultural, economic <b>motives</b> and <b>pressures</b> of societies moving from one area to another with somehow different characteristics was entwined in the challenges of struggling to re-establish in new environments and the social-cultural connections to land and resources. It was easier for the Chagga to maintain strong cultural ties with the highland but not to transfer knowledge and skills of highland cultivation, food habit and livestock domestication to the lowland. The reasons behind this were based on the presence of some relatives, social-cultural values and properties in terms of banana fields and houses on the highlands that could not be moved to the lowlands. The question of what type of economic activities and social interactions were to be established on the lowlands was determined by the suitability of the lowland and not necessarily the skills from the highland. For instance, cultivation of perennial crops could not be possible because the lowlands received seasonal rainfall and had no access to reliable irrigation furrows like the highlands. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Sexually Assertive Behavior Scale (SABS) is to assess women’s {{behaviors}} and motives relative to initiating sexual contact with men. Description The SABS is a 19 -item scale composed of six factors—Sexual Arousal, Hidden <b>Motives,</b> Verbal <b>Pressure,</b> Retaliation or Gain, Physical Force, and Exploitation. Factor 1 (Sexual Arousal) relates to mutually consenting sexual contact and attempts to arouse a partner. Factor 2 (Hidden Motives) items relate to a woman initiating {{a sexual relationship with}} a man other than her partner to make her partner jealous, to hurt him, or to terminate their relationship. Factor 3 (Verbal Pressure) items relate to verbally persuasive tactics. Factor 4 (Retaliation or Gain) items relate to initiating sexual contact with a partner out of anger, to retaliate, or to gain favor. Factor 5 (Physical Force) items specify the threat and use of physical force. Factor 6 (Exploitation) items relate to initiating sexual contact while the partner is vulnerable. The SABS was developed to assess a wide range of behaviors and motives relative to women initiating sexual contact. Thirteen of the items in the SABS were adapted from the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) developed by Koss and Oros (1982). The SES is a self-report instrument using dichotomous (yes-no) responses to 13 questions that reflect various degrees of male sexual aggression and female victimization. For example, women responding to the SES were asked, “Have you had sexual intercourse when you didn’t want to because a man used his position of authority (boss, teacher, camp counselor, supervisor) to make you?” This work was chosen for adaptation because it was previously tested and shown to have good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha =. 74 for women,. 89 for men), test-retest reliability of. 93, and external validity established through face-to-face interview (Pearson r =. 61, p 3 ̆c. 001) (Koss 2 ̆ 6 Gidycz, 1985). In addition to the 13 items adapted from the SES for inclusion in the SABS, 6 more items were generated from {{a review of the literature}} on male sexual aggression and item suggestions by a panel of experts in sexual aggression. For example, “How many times have you attempted to have sexual contact with a man by taking advantage of a compromising position he was in (being where he did not belong or breaking some rule) ?” or “How many times have you attempted to have sexual contact with a man to get even with or hurt another man?” All items were worded to conform to the interviewing style used by Kinsey, Pomeroy, and Martin (1948), who assumed all respondents had engaged in each behavior mentioned and allowed for specific numerical responses (i. e., “How many times have you... ?” rather than “Have you ever... ?”). Also, we attempted to arrange the order of items in the SABS to ask what we judged to be the more comfortable questions first. Additional material pertaining to this scale, including information about format, scoring, reliability, and validity is available in Fisher, Davis, Yarber, and Davis (2010) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Students {{enter the}} medical study with {{internally}} generated motives like genuine interest (intrinsic motivation) and/or externally generated <b>motives</b> like parental <b>pressure</b> or desire for status or prestige (controlled motivation). According to Self-determination theory (SDT), students could {{differ in their}} study effort, academic performance and adjustment to the study depending on the endorsement of intrinsic motivation versus controlled motivation. The objectives {{of this study were}} to generate motivational profiles of medical students using combinations of high or low intrinsic and controlled motivation and test whether different motivational profiles are associated with different study outcomes. Methods. Participating students (N = 844) from University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands, were classified to different subgroups through K-means cluster analysis using intrinsic and controlled motivation scores. Cluster membership was used as an independent variable to assess differences in study strategies, self-study hours, academic performance and exhaustion from study. Results: Four clusters were obtained: High Intrinsic High Controlled (HIHC), Low Intrinsic High Controlled (LIHC), High Intrinsic Low Controlled (HILC), and Low Intrinsic Low Controlled (LILC). HIHC profile, including the students who are interest + status motivated, constituted 25. 2 % of the population (N = 213). HILC profile, including interest-motivated students, constituted 26. 1 % of the population (N = 220). LIHC profile, including status-motivated students, constituted 31. 8 % of the population (N = 268). LILC profile, including students who have a low-motivation and are neither interest nor status motivated, constituted 16. 9 % of the population (N = 143). Interest-motivated students (HILC) had significantly more deep study strategy (p < 0. 001) and self-study hours (p < 0. 05), higher GPAs (p < 0. 001) and lower exhaustion (p < 0. 001) than status-motivated (LIHC) and low-motivation (LILC) students. Conclusions: The interest-motivated profile of medical students (HILC) is associated with good study hours, deep study strategy, good academic performance and low exhaustion from study. The interest + status motivated profile (HIHC) was also found to be associated with a good learning profile, except that students with this profile showed higher surface strategy. Low-motivation (LILC) and status-motivated profiles (LIHC) were associated with the least desirable learning behaviours. © 2013 Kusurkar et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} period {{landscape}} protection, its representative types {{more and more}} comes to the limelight. In October 2000 the European Landscape Convention - {{also known as the}} Florence Convention was adopted. The aims of this Convention are to promote landscape protection, management and planning, and to organise European co-operation on landscape issues.   Contracting states ought to analyse the landscape types on the whole area of their countries, to analyse their features, record their changes, specify <b>motive</b> power and <b>pressure</b> forming them and assess selected types with respect to special values attributed by engaged participants and inhabitants. Knowledge and identification of single landscape types enable the intensification of care of diversity of single landscape types and landscape biodiversity. It is an unavoidable condition in the strategic planning process and effective protection of regionally special landscape. Slovakia signed ELC in 2005 and became an active participant in its implementation. The Institute of the Landscape Ecology of Slovak Academy of Sciences elaborated methodology for specification and evaluation of the representative landscape types of Slovakia (RLTS). RLTS are defined as homogeneous units considering the landscape character, functions and current land-use. GIS (Geographical Information Systems) tool was used to create RLTS, in particular by overlaying of abiotic landscape structure (type of relief, quaternary deposits, climatic regions, and soil types) and land-cover map (CORINE Land Cover 2006 - CLC) at national scale. This process yielded to a patched map of homogeneous areas, which were further interpreted, generalized, and regionalized to a final map of RLTS. Landscape types of Slovakia were defined by the synthesis of the mentioned maps. Totally there were identified 126 basic landscape types. Each landscape type represents unique combination of land-use in different abiotic conditions and gives the unique environment for nature development In the second stage typing  rare and unique landscape types of Slovakia have been marked. Following, all RLTS were evaluated {{from the point of view}} nature protection and recent degradation and threats. In the meantime main changes of RLES were identified, taken into account also key driving forces of landscape changes and consequent pressures on the landscape. The final step included preparation of management proposal with aim to maintain all representative landscape types and to secure their sustainable development and protection. </p...|$|R
