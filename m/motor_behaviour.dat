This paper explores through experiments with autonomous humanoid robots how such a body image could form. Robots play a situated embodied language game called the Action Game in which they ask each other to perform bodily actions. They start without any prior inventory of names, without categories for visually recognising body movements of others, and without knowing the relation between visual images of <b>motor</b> <b>behaviours</b> carried out by others and their own <b>motor</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Through diagnostic and repair strategies carried out within the context of action games, they progressively self-organise an effective lexicon as well as bi-directional mappings between the visual and the motor domain.

5000|$|Motor {{learning}} is a change, resulting from practice or a novel experience, in the capability for responding. It often involves improving the smoothness and accuracy of movements and is obviously necessary for complicated movements such as speaking, playing the piano, and climbing trees; {{but it is also}} important for calibrating simple movements like reflexes, as parameters of the body and environment change over time. Motor learning research often considers variables that contribute to motor program formation (i.e., underlying skilled <b>motor</b> <b>behaviour),</b> sensitivity of error-detection processes, and strength of movement schemas (see motor program). Motor {{learning is}} [...] "relatively permanent", as the capability to respond appropriately is acquired and retained. As a result, the temporary processes that affect behaviour during practice or experience should not be considered learning, but rather transient performance effects. As such, the main components underlying the behavioural approach to motor learning are structure of practice and feedback given. The former pertains to the manipulation of timing and organization of practice (potentially for different subtasks or variations of the task) for optimal information retention (also see varied practice), while the latter pertains to the influence of feedback on the preparation, anticipation, and guidance of movement.|$|E

We examined {{whether this was}} reflected in the expression of peptide mRNA in the direct and indirect striatal output pathways. 6 -OHDA lesioning of the nigrostriatal pathway increased striatal expression of PPE-A mRNA and decreased levels of PPT mRNA with PPE-B mRNA expression remaining unchanged. Acute L-dopa administration normalised PPE-A mRNA and elevated PPT mRNA while PPE-B mRNA expression remained unchanged. Acute administration of BTS 74 398 did not alter striatal peptide mRNA levels. Following chronic treatment with L-dopa, PPE-A mRNA expression in the lesioned striatum continued to be normalised and PPT mRNA was increased compared to the intact side. PPE-B mRNA expression was also markedly increased relative to the non-lesioned striatum. Chronic BTS 74 398 administration did not alter mRNA expression in the 6 -OHDA lesioned striatum although small increases in PPT mRNA expression in the intact and sham lesioned striatum were observed. The failure of BTS 74 398 to induce changes in striatal neuropeptide mRNA correlated with its failure to induce abnormal <b>motor</b> <b>behaviours</b> or behavioural sensitisation but does not explain how it produces a reversal of motor deficits.

40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract This article reviews the brain structures and neural circuitry underlying the motor system {{as it pertains}} to endurance exercise. Some obvious phenomena that occur during endurance racing events that need to be explained neurophysiologically are variable pacing strategies, the end spurt, motivation and the rating of perceived exertion. Understanding the above phenomena physiologically is problematic due to the sheer complexity of obtaining real-time brain measurements during exercise. In those rare instances where brain measurements have been made dur-ing exercise, the measurements have usually been limited to the sensory and motor cortices; or the exercise itself was limited to small muscle groups. Without discounting the crucial importance of the primary motor cortex in the exe-cution of voluntary movement, it is surprising that very few exercise studies pay any attention to the complex and dynamic organization of motor action in relation to the subcortical nuclei, given that they are essential for the execution of normal movement patterns. In addition, the findings from laboratory-based exercise performance trials are hampered by the absence of objective measures of the motivational state of subjects. In this review we propose that some of the above phenomena may be explained by distinguishing between voluntary, vigorous and urgent <b>motor</b> <b>behaviours</b> during exercise, given that different CNS structures and neurotransmitters are involved in the exe-cution of these different <b>motor</b> <b>behaviours.</b> ...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is twofold: first, to investigate whether the presence of adaptive <b>motor</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be observed reliably, and second, to explore the ages at which clinically observable transition to adaptive motility emerges for four specific motor functions: abdominal progression, sitting motility, reaching and grasping. Methods: The reliability part of the study included 38 assessments of term and preterm infants in the age range of 4 - 18 months. The longitudinal prospective study included 30 term born typically developing infants with nine assessments between 3 and 18 months.

40|$|Understanding the {{functional}} {{significance of the}} morphological diversity of mammalian skeletal muscles is limited by technical difficulties of estimating the contribution of motor units with different properties to unconstrained <b>motor</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Recently developed wavelet and principal components analysis of intramuscular myoelectric signals has linked signals with lower and higher frequency contents {{to the use of}} slower and faster motor unit populations. In this study we estimated the relative contributions of lower and higher frequency signals of cat ankle extensors (soleus, medial and lateral gastrocnemii, plantaris) during level, downslope and upslope walking and the paw-shake response. This was done using the first two myoelectric signal principal components (PCI, PCII), explaining over 90 % of the signal, and an angle, a function of PCI/PCII, indicating the relative contribution of slower and faster motor unit populations. Mean myoelectric frequencies in all walking conditions were lowest for slow soleus (234 Hz) and highest for fast gastrocnemii (307 and 330 Hz) muscles. Motor unit populations within and across the studied muscles that demonstrated lower myoelectric frequency (suggesting slower populations) were recruited during tasks and movement phases with lower mechanical demands on the ankle extensors - during downslope and level walking and in early walking stance and paw-shake phases. With increasing mechanical demands (upslope walking, mid-phase of paw-shake cycles), motor unit populations generating higher frequency signals (suggesting faster populations) contributed progressively more. We conclude that the myoelectric frequency contents within and between feline ankle extensors vary across studied <b>motor</b> <b>behaviours,</b> with patterns that are generally consistent with muscle fibre-type composition. © 2012.

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial consisting of four periods. One week wash-out was followed by a 2 -week period of light therapy in combination with placebo or melatonin. The second wash-out period of 1 week was followed by 2 weeks of treatment (cross-over). Setting. Twenty-four bed medium-stay psychogeriatric ward at a Dutch psychiatric teaching hospital. Patients. Ten patients, who met the criteria for dementia (DSM-IV) and <b>motor</b> restless <b>behaviour</b> (subscale 10 of the GIP), were included. Informed consent was obtained by proxy. Intervention. All subjects were exposed during 25 consecutive days for 30 minutes to 10, 000 lux bright light and randomly administered 2. 5 mg melatonin or placebo at 22. 00 h. Assessments. Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Dutch version of the geriatric behavioural observation scale (GIP), Social Dysfunction and Aggression Scale (SDAS) were assessed after each wash-out and treatment period. Outcome criteria were CGI, assessing <b>motor</b> restless <b>behaviour,</b> the SDAS, measuring extrovert aggression and the GIP, assessing social, psychomotor and emotional behaviour. Results. Six demented inpatients completed the trial. Positive eects were found for the treatment combined with placebo. Patients were less restless and more co-operative. The condition with melatonin showed no additional positive eects, additionally, patients became more aggressive and showed the same or more disturbed behaviour. Conclusions.

40|$|Modulation of frontal midline theta (fmθ) is {{observed}} during error commission, but {{little is known}} about the role of theta oscillations in correcting <b>motor</b> <b>behaviours.</b> We investigate EEG activity of healthy partipants executing a reaching task under variable degrees of prism-induced visuo-motor distortion and visual occlusion of the initial arm trajectory. This task introduces directional errors of different magnitudes. The discrepancy between predicted and actual movement directions (i. e. the error), at the time when visual feedback (hand appearance) became available, elicits a signal that triggers on-line movement correction. Analysis were performed on 25 EEG channels. For each participant, the median value of the angular error of all reaching trials was used to partition the EEG epochs into high- and low-error conditions. We computed event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP) time-locked either to visual feedback or to the onset of movement correction. ERSP time-locked to the onset of visual feedback showed that fmθ increased in the high- but not in the low-error condition with an approximate time lag of 200 ms. Moreover, when single epochs were sorted by the degree of motor error, fmθ started to increase when a certain level of error was exceeded and, then, scaled with error magnitude. When ERSP were time-locked to the onset of movement correction, the fmθ increase anticipated this event with an approximate time lead of 50 ms. During successive trials, an error reduction was observed which was associated with indices of adaptations (i. e., aftereffects) suggesting the need to explore if theta oscillations may facilitate learning. To our knowledge this is the first study where the EEG signal recorded during reaching movements was time-locked to the onset of the error visual feedback. This allowed us to conclude that theta oscillations putatively generated by anterior cingulate cortex activation are implicated in error processing in semi-naturalistic <b>motor</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R
