50|$|The {{traditional}} {{economy of}} the area is based on arboriculture (orchards and olive trees) and on the craft industry (tapestry or pottery). <b>Mountain</b> <b>and</b> <b>hill</b> <b>farming</b> is gradually giving way to local industry (textile and agro-alimentary).

50|$|The {{production}} of flax (Linum usitatissimum) and other oilseed crops {{peak in the}} temperate climates of the middle <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> <b>hill</b> <b>farming</b> regions in Nepal. Flax matures in approximately 90 to 125 days and develops most rapidly under the cool, short-season of growing. The middle hill region of the Lamjung district, also {{the epicenter of the}} earthquake devastating Nepal in April 2015, exemplifies an ideal climate for flax production experiencing consistently cool temperatures for most of the year. The shallow rooting system makes the plant especially susceptible to drought and excess moisture in the soil but also easier come time to harvest. Most cash crops are grown in the hill regions of Nepal as this is where two thirds of the subsistence farmers reside whom need to produce just enough food to feed themselves and their families.|$|E
