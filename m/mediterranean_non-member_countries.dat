40|$|The paper proposes some {{hypotheses}} {{about the way}} in which the EU contributes via its MEDA Programme to the promotion of intra-regional economic co-operation among <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> It argues that MEDA is indeed an important political and economic measure to create favourable conditions for increased trade and investment among <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> Notwithstanding this general proposition, an institutionalist analysis of the implementation process of the MEDA Programmes for the years 1995 - 1999 reveals that deadlocks within the EU policy-making process have significantly weakened the overall success of financial and technical assistance. The paper provides an in-depth empirical analysis of the MEDA Programme and its contribution to enhance intra-regional economic co-operation. It argues that only if the institutional deadlocks can be overcome can MEDA function as the envisaged accompanying measure to the reform of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> economic and social structures and, thereby, provide the basis for increased intra-regional economic co-operation. Recent reforms at the EU level have, at least partially, addressed the most pertinent shortcomings of the first five years of the operation of MEDA. However, political declarations, such as the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean, cast some serious doubts on whether the EU has the political will to underpin these organisational reforms with the necessary political leadership. This dilemma between cautious organisational reforms, on the one hand, and political stagnation, on the other, ultimately weakens the contribution the EU could make to foster economic co-operation among <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> via the MEDA system.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} intelligence cooperation between NATO and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> (Med). The paper is divided into four parts: The first part {{examines the}} development of intelligence cooperation frameworks in Europe and the Mediterranean region; The second part analyses major problems and issues relating to NATO-Med intelligence cooperation; The third part examines NATO’s intelligence requirements in the Mediterranean, at four distinct phases in NATO-Med cooperation; The forth part explores policy options aimed at enhancing frameworks for NATO-Med intelligence cooperation. The paper argues that NATO policy in the Mediterranean region requires the development of institutionalised frameworks for intelligence cooperation with its Mediterranean neighbours. NATO experience over the past decade, including the events in Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia, present the Mediterranean as a potential area of extensive NATO operations in the future. NATO intelligence structures, however, suffer from an ‘intelligence deficit ’ over the Mediterranean. Over fou...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. Development {{cooperation}} {{policies are}} not as well known as the European Union's other common policies such as the common agricultural policy or common commercial policy. Even compared to development policies such as the Lome' Convention, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is relatively obscure. The concept that the EU has special relations with the <b>non-member</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries</b> like Algeria and Morocco -and that these relations are of great importance -is not commonly understood by European citizens. In the UK, for instance, even political scientists widely interpret the phrase 'southern Mediterranean' to refer only to the southernmost members of the European Union (EU) such as France, Italy or Greece, rather than extending to the developing countries bordering on the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. This anonymity demonstrates {{one aspect of the}} EU's failure up to the present to shake off the image of 'foreign policy dwarf' (Lister l 997) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the process}} of the Euro-Mediterranean integration, and in {{prospect}} of the realization of the free trade area (FTA), motorways of the sea {{are one of the most}} ambitious initiatives. The agro food sector is worrying us in order to realize the free trade area. It offers many opportunities for the strong complementarity among the coastal countries’agriculture, that could see the countries of the Southern and Northern work together in a spirit of complementarity and cooperation. Sicily, in the middle of Mediterranean basin, is only marginally concerned by the agro food trade and by direct maritime trade between the two sides, due to the inadequacy of port logistics infrastructures. These, without doubt, are the main obstacles to the implementation of the project. This work, in addition to include an analysis of agro-food trade and shipping of Sicily with the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries,</b> highlights the benefits that the implementation of Motorways of the sea could provide, but, of course, it is necessary the adaptation of existing infrastructures and logistic services offered by the region...|$|E

40|$|The study {{deals with}} trade {{benefits}} from {{the free trade agreement}} of the SAARC countries. It assesses the trade potential and trade creation with member and <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> The gravity model has been used to measure the bilateral trade flows and to assess the trade effect for member and <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> Two analyses estimate the gravity model. The first analysis is based on cross-sectional data to capture the trade effect individually each year; and the second analysis utilises the pooled data to measure the overall trade effects and trade flows for the period 2003 to 2008. The results from the two approaches show that estimated coefficients are consistent with the model assumptions. Both analyses show that the regional trade agreement of the SAARC countries could divert the trade for member countries {{as well as for the}} <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> However, trade volume will increase only if the major partners (Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka) sign regional trade agreements.

40|$|Using the {{modified}} gravity model, {{this study examines}} whether the free trade areas of NAFTA, ANZCER and ASEAN would result in trade creation among the member countries and trade diversion with the <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> Further, it applies Linder's income similarity concept to explain the trade patterns in the developed and developing countries within these free trade areas. First, {{the results suggest that}} the implementations of the free trade areas have facilitated higher trade among the member countries, particularly the ANZCER and ASEAN countries. However, among all three free trade areas, the formation of the ANZCER free trade area has resulted in trade diversion with <b>non-member</b> <b>countries,</b> whereas that of the ASEAN free trade area has resulted in a trade increase with <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> Surprisingly, the formation of the NAFTA free trade area has no significant effect on trade with <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> as their trade flows remain quite low even before its implementation. Second, the result indicates that the trade-enhancing effect of income similarity is confirmed for the developing rather than developed member countries. The developing member countries with similar incomes would trade extensively more with each other. This result can be partly explained by Hanink's income threshold concept, which argues that the income similarity effect is only applicable to developed countries with very small difference in incomes. Given the heterogeneous country sample in this study, the substantial income differences among the developed member countries would probably account for the lack of income similarity effect in these countries.

30|$|Trade {{diversion}} is {{the replacement}} of cheaper imports from <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> with products of member countries due to {{a free trade agreement}} (Balassa 1967; Richardon 1993). Trade diversion occurs when free trade agreements among member countries shift the trade inflow from non-number to member countries in a trading bloc to increase the flow of intra-trade. When member countries perform trading activities among themselves in a trading bloc (i.e., intra-trade), this is economic regionalism which contributes to the development of trade protectionism (Lim 2009; Schiff and Winters 2003; Ruggie 1994). Richardon (1993) also pointed out the consequences of trade protection resultant of free trade agreements on <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> (extra-trade). Nevertheless, the number of free trade agreements are increasing. It is therefore important {{to examine the relationship between}} free trade agreements and extra-trade.|$|R

But to get the average treatment of an RTA on the member and <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> as countries’ baseline real GDPs are different and I emphasize on every member’s welfare gain, I take average of percentage losses of 9 AFTA member countries. Hence in conditional, the average real GDP loss of AFTA member countries is 1.74 % after the removal of AFTA.|$|R
