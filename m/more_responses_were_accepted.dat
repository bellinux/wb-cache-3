In 1992 Alan Blinder wrote about a [...] "Keynesian Restoration", as work based on Keynes's ideas had to some extent become fashionable once again in academia, though in the mainstream it was highly synthesised with monetarism and other neoclassical thinking. In the world of policy making, free market influences broadly sympathetic to monetarism have remained very strong at government level – in powerful normative institutions like the World Bank, the IMF and US Treasury, and in prominent opinion-forming media such as the Financial Times and The Economist.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an experiment carried out using a French version of CALL-SLT, a web-enabled CALL {{game in which}} students at each turn are prompted to give a semi-free spoken response which the system then either accepts or rejects. The central question we investigate <b>is</b> whether the <b>response</b> <b>is</b> appropriate; we do this by extracting pairs of utterances where both members of the pair <b>are</b> <b>responses</b> by the same student to the same prompt, and where one <b>response</b> <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> and one rejected. When the two spoken <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> presented in random order, native speakers show a reasonable degree of agreement in judging that the <b>accepted</b> utterance <b>is</b> better than the rejected one.

30|$|Recent revelations [10] expose {{monitoring}} and censorship activities of National Security Agency (NSA) and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) against Internet services and users. The NSA used its secret agreements with telecommunications companies to monitor communications channels in order obtain access {{to collect and}} analyse Internet traffic. The NSA uses hosts (code name QUANTUM) to inject spoofed DNS (and HTTP) responses: when observing a DNS request, a spoofed <b>response</b> <b>is</b> automatically crafted {{and returned to the}} victim client. Notice that since the QUANTUM servers are deployed on the backbone links, they can always respond before the legitimate server does. Since the first correct <b>response</b> <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> and the subsequent ones are ignored, the attacker can redirect victim clients to the servers controlled by the NSA (code name FOXACID); the servers then install malware on clients hosts or tap on the communication.|$|R

The magazine recorded the number of responses each ad received, and this constituted the dependent measure. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that <b>more</b> <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> received by women and by individuals providing nonnegative, evaluative self-descriptions than by their counterparts. Also, tall male advertisers and light female advertisers received <b>more</b> <b>responses</b> than their shorter and heavier counterparts.

Discussion focused on the relations between these findings and those of past research and on the utility of lonely hearts advertisements in psychological research...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies to}} date have {{examined}} time reallocation in naturalistic, multiresponse human repertoires when one or <b>more</b> <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> restricted. For this experiment, free-operant baseline levels of six <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> measured for four autistic children. The high-probability <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> made unavailable, one at a time, such that subjects had access to five, four, three, and two responses in successive restriction conditions. A return to the six-response free-operant baseline condition completed the experiment. Results were compared to predictions made by four time-reallocation models. These results were described accurately only by the selective substitution model. Further analyses examined alternative explanations for the individual reallocation patterns obtained. An expanded selective substitution definition is proposed that may characterize orderly patterns observed in multiresponse repertoires under restriction conditions more accurately than the other existing models...|$|R

40|$|Epistemics in {{interaction}} {{refers to}} how participants display, manage, and orient {{to their own}} and others’ states of knowledge. This article applies recent conversation analytical work on epistemics to classrooms where language and content instruction are combined. It focuses on Epistemic Search Sequences (ESSs) through which students in peer interaction collectively resolve emerging knowledge gaps while working on pedagogic tasks. ESSs are initiated when a speaker displays an ‘unknowing’ epistemic stance by making an information request about some aspect of language or the content being worked on. We examine three different types of ESS: those in which a ‘knowing’ <b>response</b> <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> by the initiator of the sequence; those {{in which there is}} an ‘unknowing’ response; and those where ‘knowing’ <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> contested. The findings have implications for understanding peer interaction in content-based classrooms in three areas: the affordances of peer interaction for learning in contrast with teacher-led ‘known-answer’ sequences; how learners manage rights and responsibilities around knowing or not knowing; and how learners discover and work on their own learning objects...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} English-L 2 child learner speech corpus, {{produced}} by Swiss German-L 1 {{students in their}} third year of learning English, which is currently {{in the process of}} being collected. The collection method uses a web-enabled multimodal language game implemented using the CALL-SLT platform, in which subjects hold prompted conversations with an animated agent. Prompts consist of a short animated Engligh-language video clip together with a German-language piece of text indicating the semantic content of the requested response. Grammar-based speech understanding is used to decide whether <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> <b>accepted</b> or rejected, and dialogue flow is controlled using a simple XML-based scripting language; the scripts are written to allow multiple dialogue paths, the choice being made randomly. The system is gamified using a score-and-badge framework with four levels of badges. We describe the application, the data collection and annotation procedures, and the initial tranche of data. The full corpus, when complete, should contain at least 5 000 annotated utterances...|$|R
40|$|In Malaysia, the Halal logo and {{certification}} {{has a significant}} religious cue that might peripherally generate a favourable attitude towards advertisement among Muslims. Prior findings have stated that Islamic religious symbol influenced Muslim consumers’ favourable attitude towards the advertising. Advertisements that portray value positions consistent with the intended consumers {{are likely to be}} more influential than advertisements that portray inconsistent values. This study intends to examine the relationship of consumers’ attitude functions (utilitarian, value-expressive, ego-defensive, knowledge), attitude towards advertising and purchase intention toward non-certified coffee shops amongst Muslim Postgraduate students in Malaysia. This study applied the Functional Theory of Attitudes to support this framework. Data were collected through self-administered surveys and a total of 242 usable <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> <b>accepted</b> for the purpose of this study. The results of this study show that the value expressive and utilitarian propositions significantly influence consumers’ attitudes toward the advertisement of non-certified coffee shops, whereas attitude towards advertising has a significant impact on purchase intention...|$|R
