25|$|Matisse {{was visiting}} Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 {{but managed to}} make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and {{remained}} in Nice, in Vichy France. “It seemed to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I would be deserting,” he wrote Pierre in September 1940. “If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?” Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.|$|E
25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E
500|$|In 1847 Felix Mendelssohn {{attended}} a London performance of Robert – an opera which musically he despised – {{in order to}} hear Jenny Lind's British debut, {{in the role of}} Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked at <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind." ...|$|E

500|$|Let {{the object}} of affection be {{snatched}} away by death, and how is all the pain ever inflicted upon them avenged! The same imagination that led us to slight or overlook their sufferings, {{now that they are}} forever lost to us, magnifies their estimable qualities ... How did I feel this when my daughter, Allegra, died! While she lived, her existence never seemed necessary to my happiness; but no sooner did I lose her, than it appeared to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I could not live without her.|$|E
500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, he looked at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{he thought it was}} my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{outside the}} Pearl, Eko sees Yemi and follows {{him into an}} open field, where Yemi tells him {{it is time for}} Eko to confess his sins. Eko says he has not sinned, having not chosen the life he was given and that Eko had only done what he needed to do to survive. An angry-looking Yemi replies, [...] "You speak to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were your brother" [...] as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking [...] "Who are you?!", and then finds the smoke monster. An arm of smoke attacks Eko, beating him into trees before he is slammed into the ground. Locke and the others rush out of the station to find a bloodied Eko. Locke {{approaches}} Eko, who whispers his dying words into Locke's ears. Sayid asks what he said, and Locke replies, [...] "We're next." ...|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people would look at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I {{began to think that}} maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
500|$|Mendelssohn met {{and worked}} with Lind many times, and started an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was {{unfinished}} at his death. He is said to have tailored the aria [...] "Hear Ye Israel" [...] in his oratorio Elijah to Lind's voice, although she did not sing this part until after his death, at a concert in December 1848. In 1847 Mendelssohn attended a London performance of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable– an opera which musically he despised– in order to hear Lind's British debut, in the role of Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked at <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mlle. Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success".|$|E
500|$|During filming, Gillian Anderson {{was unsure}} how exactly to perform her lines. She noted, [...] "the way the script was {{originally}} read to me, initially seemed to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Scully kind of {{stepped up to}} the plate and played along with the sheriff's humor". She reportedly performed her lines in a [...] "tongue in cheek"-esque way before receiving a call from Carter. He informed her that her lines were not meant to be humorous and that the production staff was having to [...] "edit out a lot of stuff" [...] in order to make up for this. Several of the scenes in the episode were shot at the places they stood in for. The gas station scene was filmed at a real gas station across from the series' production headquarters. The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket, Shop Easy in Port Coquitlam, a first for the series, according to art director Greg Loewen. The scenes required the store to be closed before Christmas and be installed with up-right freezers.|$|E

500|$|Bülow was {{committed}} to Wagner's music; in 1858 he had undertaken the preparation of a vocal score for Tristan und Isolde, and by 1862 {{he was making a}} [...] of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. A social relationship developed, and during the summer of 1862 the Bülows stayed with Wagner at the composer's home at Biebrich. Wagner records that Cosima became [...] "transfigured" [...] by his rendering of [...] "Wotan's Farewell" [...] from Die Walküre. In October 1862, just after Blandine's death, Wagner and Bülow shared conducting duties at a concert in Leipzig; Wagner records that, during a rehearsal, [...] "I felt utterly transported by the sight of Cosima ... she appeared to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> stepping from another world". In these years Wagner's emotional life was in disarray. He was still married to his first wife, Minna Planer (she was to die in 1866), and was involved in several extramarital relationships. On 28 November 1863 Wagner visited Berlin; while Bülow was rehearsing a concert, Wagner and Cosima took a long cab ride through Berlin and declared their feelings for each other: [...] "with tears and sobs", Wagner later wrote, [...] "we sealed our confession to belong to each other alone".|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, after a {{show at the}} Copacabana with Sammy Davis Jr., Richard Nixon and {{his wife}} Pat stopped by. [...] Afterwards the then Vice President {{made his way to}} the {{dressing}} rooms to thank them for the show. [...] The papers noted Mary as saying They applauded <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were a Republican! ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1972 {{she began}} running Pepsi Cola's {{national}} mobile tennis project, which brought portable nets {{and other equipment}} to underprivileged areas in major cities. [...] She ran multiple other clinics and tennis outreach programs {{over the next three}} decades, and coached numerous rising competitors, including Leslie Allen and Zina Garrison. [...] "She pushed <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were a pro, not a junior," [...] wrote Garrison in her 2001 memoir. [...] "I owe the opportunity I received to her." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{sprang to}} his feet, and looked a {{question}} at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> clear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had spoken.|$|R
6000|$|He looked {{round at}} <b>me</b> now, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in {{recognition}} of my understanding him; then ever so gently, [...] "To let me alone," [...] he replied.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped her}} chin {{on her breast}} and from under her {{straight}} eyebrows the deep blue eyes remained fixed on <b>me,</b> impersonally, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> without thought.|$|R
2500|$|Elizabeth's {{life changed}} irrevocably on 11 September 1227 when Louis, {{en route to}} join the Sixth Crusade, died of a fever in Otranto, Italy, {{just a few weeks}} before the birth of her {{daughter}} Gertrude. [...] Upon hearing the news of her husband's death, Elizabeth reportedly said, [...] "He is dead. He is dead. It is to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the whole world died today." [...] His remains were returned to Elizabeth in 1228 and entombed at the Abbey of Reinhardsbrunn.|$|E
2500|$|John {{declared}} {{that he did not}} worship matter, [...] "but rather the creator of matter." [...] He also declared, [...] "But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> filled with divine energy and grace." [...] He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the body and blood of Jesus. [...] This distinction between worship and veneration is key in the arguments of the iconodules.|$|E
2500|$|Out of this {{situation}} evolved an uproar, which through the shouting and clamour and an inexplicable {{growth in the number}} of participants in the struggle soon assumed a truly demoniacal character. It looked to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the whole town would break out into a riot...Then suddenly I heard a heavy thump, and as if by magic the whole crowd dispersed in every direction...One of the regular patrons had felled one of the noisiest rioters ... And it was the effect of this which had scattered everybody so suddenly.|$|E
60|$|The solitary knight {{shook his}} head again, eyeing <b>me</b> solemnly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in hope to discern in my face the sorcery that held himself in thrall.|$|R

2500|$|Goforth ministered at Yingkou (Newchwang), {{the final}} resting-place of Scottish missionary William Chalmers Burns. Burns’ impact {{was still being}} felt 40 years later among the Christian {{community}} of Yingkou. However, {{the same kind of}} repentance and prayer broke out, here as Goforth wrote: [...] "On entering the pulpit, I bowed as usual for a few moments in prayer. When I looked up it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> every last man, woman and child in that church was in the throes of judgment. Tears were flowing freely, and all manner of sin was being confessed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} published in ABC Film Review in November 1964, Cushing stated, [...] "People look at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were {{some sort of}} monster, but I can't think why. In my macabre pictures, I have either been a monster-maker or a monster-destroyer, but never a monster. Actually, I'm a gentle fellow. Never harmed a fly. I love animals, and when I'm in the country I'm a keen bird-watcher." [...] In {{an interview}} published in 1966, he added, [...] "I do get terribly tired with the neighbourhood kids telling me 'My mum says she wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson chose [...] "Montaigne; or, the Skeptic" [...] as {{a subject}} {{of one of his}} series of lectures {{entitled}} Representative Men, alongside other subjects such as Shakespeare and Plato. In [...] "The Skeptic" [...] Emerson writes of his experience reading Montaigne, [...] "It seemed to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I had myself written the book, in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my thought and experience." [...] Friedrich Nietzsche judged of Montaigne: [...] "That such a man wrote has truly augmented the joy of living on this Earth". Sainte-Beuve advises us that [...] "to restore lucidity and proportion to our judgments, let us read every evening a page of Montaigne." ...|$|E
