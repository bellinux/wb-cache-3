40|$|The 1. 27 Ga Mackenzie dyke swarm, {{the largest}} on Earth, radiates {{from a point}} in the western Canadian Arctic and extends across much of the Canadian Shield. Possible western {{extensions}} of the swarm are largely obscured by younger sedimentary cover. Paleoproterozoic inliers in northern Yukon host the Bear River dykes (BRD), herein dated by U–Pb baddeleyite and zircon methods at 1268. 5 ± 1. 5 Ma and 1264. 6 ± 1. 2 Ma. The BRD share similar geochemical and Nd-isotopic characteristics with the Mackenzie dykes and the coeval Coppermine River basalts, and are regarded as products of the same plume. Hydrothermal activity at ∼ 1270 Ma in breccia of the Nor <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrence,</b> northwest of the BRD, was probably generated by BRD at depth. The BRD generally strike northwest, approximately 90 ◦ to the orientation predicted by the radiating dyke model. This difference may be explained by an anomalous local stress field at the time of BRD emplacement, or reorientation of BRD during subsequent events of Cordilleran deformation. Using the Nor <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrence</b> as the westernmost locale of Mackenzie dyking, and assuming a model of uniform dyke radiation, the arc of the Mackenzie swarm is at least 50 ◦ greater than previously recognized, bringing the total arc of dyke radiation to> 150 ◦. © 2004 Elsevier B.

Through the observation of 39 thin sections, information about surface porosity, pore and throat radii, pore–throat coordination number, and lithic composition is obtained. Meanwhile, using the FEI Quanta 650 FEG device in the State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics of Northwestern University of China, SEM observation can help analyze the pore–throat property and clay <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrence</b> in the 24 samples, which can more accurately reflect the micro changes of mineral rocks (Fig.  4).|$|R
40|$|Geologic {{information}} extraction and integration {{are the main}} goals of this study. Tools are designed to aid in exploration for common mineral deposits by intelligently and efficiently processing spatial geological data. Gabor filters, comprising Gaussian-attenuated sinusoidal weight vectors, are used for textural discrimination. A highly non-linear logic operator was designed for "valley", "ridge", edge, and intersection extraction from multispectral images to cover most of the possible local lineament types. A zonation detector (a non-linear logic operator) indicates {{the presence or absence}} of lithologic zonation, the number and the types of zones using a series of automatically expanding moving windows. The ultimate window size represents the zonation size. Two different types of raster-based expert systems help optimize pixel-by-pixel knowledge extraction and representation over the spatial information and throughout the different raster feature layers. First a 2 -D expert system is used for classification, ranking, recognition and searching for important pattern associations in the feature space. Second, a multilayer adaptive raster-based expert system allows the processing of multiple geologic features, and operates over each pattern in the feature layers. The fuzzy integral method of evidence fusion is used to integrate information from a variety of mineral exploration sources. This nonlinearly combines objective <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrence</b> evidence, in the form of a fuzzy membership function, with subjective evaluation of the worth of the sources with respect to the decision. An application of these methods to the Tombstone mineral district in southern Arizona demonstrates its ability to pick out circular features from TM imagery, Gabor transforms and lineament patterns, as well as identify favorable zonation for new <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrence.</b> The final product at this time is a probability map to guide the exploration geologist...|$|R

50|$|The {{remote and}} mountainous {{location}} of Hajigak {{makes it a}} challenging project for future development. However, the large tonnage and high iron content make it attractive to companies with the proven ability to plan and develop large world-class mines in demanding areas.

Additional prospects and <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrences</b> over a 60 km along strike, at Darrah-i-Nil, Khesh, Zerak, Kharkiza, SurkhiParsa, further increase the potential of the area. A feasibility study for the exploitation of the Hajigak deposit was undertaken in 1972 by a Franco-German group, Nenot-Pic. This proposed the construction of a blast furnace, based on the occurrence nearby of coking coal, providing an opportunity for the creation of an integrated iron and steel plant.|$|E

The Crest Deposit belongs to Chevron. Unless this deposit is developed, it is unlikely that any of the other deposits will be viable as they would need to piggy back on the infrastructure development required- roads, railways and pipelines.

Form extensive fields and rocky boulders. The age of this granite is Neoproterozoic, estimated at 560 million years.

50|$|Quantitative mineral-resource {{assessments}} {{are defined as}} the numerical estimate of the amount, quality, and in some cases, value of undiscovered minerals (that is, metal or industrial mineral) present within a specified area (tract). Their purpose {{is to provide a}} framework for making decisions by governments or institutions concerning mineral resources under conditions of uncertainty. Due to the uncertainty inherent in assessment of unknown resources, the results are presented probabilistically.The resources are in undiscovered mineral deposits whose existence is postulated based on indirect geologic evidence. The mineral deposits are believed to exist within a specified distance {{from the surface of the}} ground, or an incompletely explored <b>mineral</b> <b>occurrence</b> or prospect that could have sufficient size and grade to be classed a deposit.
