5|$|Since their {{inception}} in 1960, <b>Maribor</b> {{have developed a}} loyal, passionate and dedicated fanbase. After Slovenia declared independence in 1991, most of the town's industry perished and over 25% {{of the population was}} unemployed. Still, the people remained loyal to the club. Besides the city of <b>Maribor</b> and the surrounding area, the club also has a large fan base in the regions of Styria and Carinthia. A small number of supporters are also present in Ilirska Bistrica in the Slovenian Littoral. Soon after the foundation of <b>Maribor,</b> the club was branded as the citizens club, while their city rivals Železničar <b>Maribor</b> has always been branded as the club of the working class. This was mainly because <b>Maribor</b> was seen, by the fans, as the successor of Branik <b>Maribor,</b> a club that folded in 1960. Many fans of Branik then started to cheer for <b>Maribor,</b> a club that was founded only couple of months later.|$|E

5|$|Because the new Olimpija is {{supported}} {{by most of the}} fans of the previous Olimpija, including their ultras group, the Green Dragons, who have a long-standing rivalry with Maribor's own ultras group Viole <b>Maribor,</b> many see the matches between <b>Maribor</b> and the new club as the continuation of the rivalry and refer to it by the same name. However, there are many fans, either the ones from <b>Maribor</b> or the ones from Ljubljana, that do not share the same view and do not share similar beliefs, including part of the media such as RTV Slovenija and Večer. The overall statistics of {{the old and the new}} Olimpija are tracked separately by the Football Association of Slovenia and the Association of 1. SNL. The first match between <b>Maribor</b> and the new Olimpija took place on 24 October 2007 in a Slovenian cup quarter-final match that was won by <b>Maribor,</b> 3–1. At the time, Olimpija was still competing under the name Olimpija Bežigrad. Statistically, <b>Maribor</b> is the more successful club either in the case of matches from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the whole period from 1962 to present day.|$|E

5|$|The old rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{in the final round}} of the 2000–01 season, when one of the most celebrated matches in Slovenian League history was played. Olimpija met <b>Maribor</b> at their home stadium, Bežigrad, and both teams were {{competing}} for their fifth Slovenian League title. The home team needed a win for the title, while a draw was enough for <b>Maribor.</b> The atmosphere was electric days before the kick-off, and the stadium with a capacity of 8,500 was completely sold out.

5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} {{is the fact}} that both <b>Maribor</b> and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole <b>Maribor</b> (supporting <b>Maribor),</b> and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two groups are the largest in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police. On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{independence}} of Slovenia, Slovenia's best clubs joined the newly formed Slovenian League. <b>Maribor</b> {{were one of the}} league's founding members, and are one of only three clubs, along with Gorica and Celje, who have never been relegated from the Slovenian top division. In the first couple of seasons, Maribor's rivals Olimpija from Ljubljana, who have had a long tradition of playing in the Yugoslav first league and at the time still had their squad composed of players from that era, dominated the league. Although Olimpija dominated the league, <b>Maribor</b> still managed to win the first edition of the Slovenian Cup in 1992. The final match was played in Ljubljana at Bežigrad Stadium versus Olimpija. It ended in a goalless draw after regular time and was won by <b>Maribor</b> after a penalty shoot-out (4–3). This was the first major success for <b>Maribor.</b> During the next season the team had their European début, appearing in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. They played their first European match on 19 August 1992, when they hosted Ħamrun Spartans of Malta and won with the score 4–0. Ante Šimundža scored the first historic goal of the match. Olimpija {{went on to win the}} first four domestic championships, until their streak was interrupted by Gorica who won it in the 1995–96 season. <b>Maribor</b> were runners-up in the 1991–92, 1992–93 and 1994–95 seasons, before finishing third in 1993–94 and then fourth in the 1995–96 season. During this period the club managed to win another Slovenian cup in 1993–94, defeating Mura from Murska Sobota in the final with 3–2 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015–16 season, <b>Maribor</b> was {{eliminated}} from the European competitions after just two matches, being defeated by Astana in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, meaning the club failed {{to advance to the}} third qualifying round of the competition for the first time after the 2003–04 season.
