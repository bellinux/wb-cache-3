40|$|Roots {{represent}} the primary site of direct interaction between rice plants and soil microorganisms. The {{influence of the}} plant on the soil microbial community includes the translocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon into the rhizosphere as rhizodeposition. This extends to the rhizosphere of rice plants, which is colonized by a syntrophic microbial community, {{which in turn is}} able to degrade root derived carbon to methane. Each plant species is thought to select a specific microbial community composition as root microbiome. A general understanding of microbial colonization of the rice rhizosphere and the consequential impact on the emission of methane originating from rhizodeposits is still uncertain, since the majority of the studies have so far focused exclusively on rice roots planted in rice paddy soils. Therefore, we used different initial soil microbial communities available for colonization of the rice roots. In order to do this, an inert sand-vermiculite matrix was inoculated with rice paddy soil and digested sludge, respectively, and was afterwards planted with rice. The microbial activity essential for the formation of methane from those soil-systems was tested in pre-experiments and the colonization of the rice rhizosphere was determined afterwards in plant-soil microcosms. Each of the microcosms possessed an individually structured microbial community, which served as a seed bank for the colonization of the rice roots. We analyzed the impact of the community composition on the emission of methane by combining 13 CO 2 pulse-labeling with illumina sequencing and quantitative PCR, targeting the 16 S rRNA as phylogenetic-, as well as mcrA and pmoA as functional marker genes for methanogenic archaea and methane-oxidizing bacteria. The degradation of rhizodeposits to methane in the different microcosms was dependent on the bacterial and methanogenic community structure, but not on their absolute abundance in the rhizosphere. Like the colonization of the rhizosphere by bacteria and methanogenic archaea, the translocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon depended upon the initial microbial communities. Nevertheless, the rice rhizosphere was found to be a distinct habitat for bacteria and methanogenic archaea. We were able to identify a methanogenic community which was linked to the degradation of rhizodeposits to methane across the rhizosphere of all microcosms. Besides hydrogenotrophic Methanocella and Methanobacteriaceae, acetoclastic Methanosaeta could also be assigned to this community. Nevertheless, most methanogens which contribute to the emission of methane originating from root derived carbon were found to belong to those with a hydrogenotrophic pathway. Within the methanogenic community linked to the formation of methane from rhizodeposits, the root surface was mainly colonized by hydrogenotrophic methanogens, while those able to perform acetoclastic methanogenesis were highly abundant in the rhizospheric soil. This was true of the colonization of the rice rhizosphere by methanogenic archaea in general. Furthermore, we were able to identify methanogens which were ubiquitous in the rhizosphere of all microcosms. Those were considered as methanogenic community selected by the rice plant on its roots. Representatives of Methanobacteriaceae, Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina colonized the overall rhizosphere, while Methanocella were found to be present in the rhizospheric soil of all microcosms. In addition to this, all methanogenic archaea which were linked to the degradation of root derived carbon to methane also belonged to this root associated community. Hence, the methanogenic community selected on the rice root also contributed to the formation of methane from rhizodeposits. Besides methanogens, we were also able to identify certain bacterial groups, which are linked to the degradation of root derived carbon to methane. These includes representatives of Kineosporiaceae, Anaeromyxobacter, Bradyrhizobium, and Bacteroidales. A higher abundance of Kineosporiaceae also resulted in an increased conversion of root derived carbon compounds to acetate, CO 2, and propionate. Therefore, at least the family of Kineosporiaceae was thought to be actively involved in the degradation of rhizodeposition to precursors for methanogenesis. Nevertheless, {{we were not able to}} determine bacteria which contributed to the emission of methane originating from root derived carbon and which were ubiquitous in the rhizosphere of all soil-systems. This resulted from the fact that the microbial community structure of the rhizosphere also depended on the initial pool of microorganisms available for root colonization. Die Pflanzenwurzel stellt die primäre Zone für Interaktionen zwischen Reispflanzen und Bodenmikroorganismen dar. Pflanzen nehmen unter anderem durch Translokation von photosynthetisch fixiertem Kohlenstoff in die Rhizosphäre als Rhizodeposition Einfluss auf die im Boden vorkommenden mikrobiellen Gemeinschaften. Dies gilt auch für Reiswurzeln, welche von einer syntrophen mikrobiellen Lebensgemeinschaft besiedelt sind, die <b>Methan</b> aus wurzelbürtigen organischen Kohlenstoffverbindungen bilden kann. Es konnte bereits gezeigt werden, dass jede Pflanzenart eine spezifische mikrobielle Gemeinschaft an ihren Wurzeln selektiert. Ein generelles Verständnis über die Kolonisierung der Rhizosphäre von Reispflanzen und der sich daraus ergebende Einfluss auf den Abbau von Rhizodepositen zu <b>Methan</b> fehlt jedoch, da der Großteil der veröffentlichen Studien das Augenmerk ausschließlich auf solche Wurzeln legt, die auch in Reisfeldböden herangewachsen sind. Daher haben wir für diese Studie verschiedene mikrobielle Ausgangs-Boden-Gemeinschaften erstellt, welche zur Besiedlung der Reiswurzeln zur Verfügung standen. Dazu wurde eine inerte Sand-Vermiculit Matrix mit Reisfeldboden, bzw. Faulschlamm inokuliert und anschließend mit Reis bepflanzt. Die mikrobielle Aktivität der Boden-Systeme zur Bildung von <b>Methan</b> wurde in Vorversuchen getestet und die Besiedlung der Reis-Rhizosphäre daraufhin in bepflanzten Mikrokosmen untersucht. Diese enthielten jeweils eine unterschiedlich strukturierte mikrobielle Gemeinschaft, welche zur Wurzelbesiedlung zur Verfügung stand. Die Bedeutung der mikrobiellen Gemeinschaften für die Bildung von <b>Methan</b> aus pflanzenbürtigem Kohlenstoff wurde durch eine Kombination aus 13 CO 2 pulse-labeling mit Illumina Sequenzierung und quantitativer PCR untersucht. Die molekularbiologischen Analysen richteten sich hierbei auf die 16 S rRNA als phylogenetisches, bzw. mcrA und pmoA als funktionale Marker-Gene für methanogene Archaeen und methanotrophe Bakterien. Die Bildung von <b>Methan,</b> sowie der generelle Abbau des wurzelbürtigen organischen Kohlenstoffs in den verschiedenen Mikrokosmen, war abhängig von der Zusammensetzung der bakteriellen und methanogenen Lebensgemeinschaften, jedoch nicht von deren absoluter Abundanz innerhalb der Rhizosphäre. Die Besiedlung der Rhizosphäre durch Bakterien und methanogene Archaeen fand in Abhängigkeit von den Ausgangs-Boden-Gemeinschaften statt, genauso wie die Translokation des photosynthetisch fixierten Kohlenstoffs. Dennoch zeigte sich anhand der an den Wurzeln vorkommenden mikrobiellen Zusammensetzung, dass die Rhizosphäre von Reispflanzen ein eigenständiges Habitat für Bakterien und methanogene Archaeen darstellt. Es konnte eine methanogene Lebensgemeinschaft identifiziert werden, welche über die Rhizosphäre aller Mikrokosmen hinweg mit der Bildung von <b>Methan</b> aus Rhizodeposition verknüpft war. Neben den hydrogenotrophen Methanocella und Methanobacteriaceae konnten auch Vertreter der acetoklastischen Methanosaeta dieser Gemeinschaft zugeordnet werden. Dennoch gehörten die meisten der Methanogenen, welche zur Methanemission aus Rhizodeposition beigetragen haben, zu denen mit hydrogenotrophem Stoffwechselweg. Innerhalb der methanogenen Gemeinschaft, die maßgeblich an der Bildung von <b>Methan</b> aus Rhizodeposition beteiligt war, wurden die Wurzeloberflächen stärker mit hydrogenotrophen Organismen besiedelt, während jene, die zur acetoklastischen Methanogenese befähigt sind, vornehmlich den Rhizosphären-Boden kolonisierten. Dies galt ebenfalls für die Besiedlung der Reis-Rhizosphäre durch Methanogene im Allgemeinen. Darüber hinaus konnten Methanogene ermittelt werden, die ubiquitär in der Rhizosphäre aller Mikrokosmen vertreten waren. Diese wurden somit als methanogene Lebensgemeinschaft verstanden, welche Reispflanzen an ihren Wurzeln selektieren. Hierbei besiedelten Vertreter von Methanobacteriaceae, Methanosaeta und Methanosarcina die gesamte Rhizosphäre, während Methanocella im Rhizosphären-Boden aller Mikrokosmen vorhanden waren. Des Weiteren konnte gezeigt werden, dass alle methanogenen Vertreter, welche an der Bildung von <b>Methan</b> aus wurzelbürtigem Kohlenstoff beteiligt waren, dieser der Reiswurzel assoziierten Gemeinschaft angehörten. Somit war die an der Reiswurzel selektierte methanogene Lebensgemeinschaft auch an der Bildung von <b>Methan</b> aus pflanzenbürtigem Kohlenstoff beteiligt. Neben methanogenen konnten auch bakterielle Gruppen identifiziert werden, die an der Entstehung von <b>Methan</b> aus Rhizodeposition beteiligt waren. Hierzu gehörten Vertreter von Kineosporiaceae, Anaeromyxobacter, Bradyrhizobium und Bacteroidales. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass ein erhöhtes Vorkommen von Kineosporiaceae auch zu einer verstärkten Umsetzung von wurzelbürtigem Kohlenstoff zu Acetat, CO 2 und Propionat führte. Daher ist davon auszugehen, dass zumindest die Familie der Kineosporiaceae aktiv an der Umsetzung von Rhizodeposition zu Vorprodukten für die Methanogenese beteiligt war. Dennoch konnten keine Bakterien identifiziert werden, welche sowohl zur Bildung von <b>Methan</b> aus wurzelbürtigem Kohlenstoff beigetragen haben, als auch ubiquitär in der Rhizosphäre aller Boden-Systeme präsent waren. Dies könnte darin begründet liegen, dass die Zusammensetzung der mikrobiellen Gemeinschaft in der Rhizosphäre auch maßgeblich von der Verfügbarkeit bestimmter funktionaler Gruppen in den Ausgangs-Boden-Gemeinschaften abhängig war...|$|E

By digesting a well developed catch crop it is possible to harvest the equivalent of around 750 l diesel fuel per ha. - 1 sown with such crops. Related to the whole system with 4 catch crops within 8 fields it is possible just by including catch crops in the fermentation process with slurry to duplicate the <b>methan</b> harvest of the digesting plant to around 700 l diesel fuel ha- 1 a- 1. By utilisation of biomass like the straw of peas and other residues it is possible to generate the equivalent of approx. 450 l diesel fuel ha- 1. Total biogas production potential by including all fermentable biomass is the equivalent of approx. 1150 l diesel fuel per each ha and year. Usually one third of this energy is necessary to temperate the digester, one third can be converted to electricity and one third can be used to heat buildings in the neighbourhood of the fermentation plant. In a typical stockless organic agricultural system composed of six crops (clover gras, potatoes, winter wheat, peas, winter wheat and summer wheat with undersown clover grass, with catch crops after winter wheat and peas, see STINNER et al. 2005) biomass of clover grass and catch crops will normally be left on the field and incorporated in the soil. By fermentation of clover grass there is a biogas production potential of around the equivalent of 3300 to 4700 l diesel fuel ha- 1 a- 1. Digesting catch crops allows a <b>methan</b> yield of ca. 650 to 700 l diesel fuel ha- 1, digestion of other residues like straw other 1250 to 1350 l diesel ha- 1. The total energy production potential of the whole crop rotation system is the equivalent of around 1700 to 1800 l diesel per ha and year. Removal of crop residues is coupled with removal of substantial quantities of nitrogen, reducing the residual mineralisable nitrogen amounts on fields {{at the end of the}} vegetation period and the risk of nitrate leaching. ...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{emissions}} from vegetation fires in Peninsular Malaysia as {{monitored by the}} National Oceanic Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) satellite during the burning season from February to March 2002 had showed that the states of Perak, Selangor and Pahang exhibited higher burning activities compared to other states. The hotspots displayed patterns of clusters that were variable temporally and spatially. Incomplete and uncontrolled vegetation burning can be a potential polluter to the surrounding atmosphere. Estimates of the emissions and dispersion of pollutants such as particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and non-methane hydrocarbons were investigated. The emission estimates showed that comparatively, carbon monoxide ranked as the highest polluter, followed by particulate matter and nonmethane hydrocarbons. Estimates of the greenhouse gases showed that carbon dioxide was much higher than either the emissions of nitrous oxides or <b>methan...</b>|$|E
40|$|The massiv {{usage of}} fossile fuels leads to high carbon dioxid {{emissions}} which cause global warming. To stop climate change {{we have to}} reduce the usage of fossile fuels and substitude them by renewable energie sources. Hydrogen {{is one of the}} most promising alternatives. Today steam reforming of natural gas is the most common production process of hydrogen. But there are also several renewable processes to produce hydrogen. One of them is the fermentative hydrogen production out of lignocellulosic biomas. The main focus should be on the usage of residual or waste materials. A competition between the energetic usage and the food industry is to be avoided. In this thesis the utilizability of grass silage is tested. Earlier experiments showed that monofermentation of grass silage lead to not acceptable conversion rates. Due to this results and to have a connection to practice a mixture of corn and grass silage was used. Moreover the effects of inorganic additive and enzyme on the fermentative process, the decay rate and the quality of hydrolysis gas were tested. For the experiments a fermenter with a netto capacity of 20 liters was used. The fermentation conditions were a mesophilic temperature from about 39 °C and a pH range of 4, 5 to 5, 0. In anaerobic degradations organic acids are produced which lower the pH range. To stabilize the process natriumhydroxid is used. The retention time is 4 days. To gain the best results several inokula has been tested. Primary and tertiary sludge from a purification plant and digestate of biogas fermentation have been tested. There was just a small gas yield when primary sludge and digestate have been applied. Furthermore it was not possible to inhibit the methanogenesis. It was not possible to reach the goal of hydrolysis gas without <b>methan.</b> In the end tertiary sludge has been chosen to be the best inokula for conducting the following experiments, because there was a high gas yield with no <b>methan</b> in it. Three experiments were done: ► Experiment 1 : Mixture of corn and grass silage (50 : 50) ► Experiment 2 : Mixture of corn and grass silage (50 : 50) plus inorganic additive ► Expermient 3 : Mixture of corn and grass silage (50 : 50) plus enzyme In Experiment 1 you gain a spezific hydrolysisgas yield of 78 l i. N/kgoTS and a hydrogen yield of 31 l i. N/kgoTS. You needed a lower amount of natriumhydroxid to stabilize the pH range because of the buffering effect of the grass silage. There was no <b>methan</b> in the hydrolysis gas. The addition of inorganic additive in experiment 2 lead to an lower degradation rate of the organic substrate. In comparission to experiment 1 a lower hydrolysis gas and hydrogen yield was reached. It was 61, 5 l i. N/kgoTs and 19, 2 l i. N/kgoTS. The inorganic additve pushed the methanogenesis. It was impossible to produce hydrolysis gas without <b>methan.</b> After a few days only <b>methan</b> got produced. The adding of this inorganic additive makes no sense for the hydrogenproduction. The best results had been reached with the addition of enzymes. The degradiation rate of the organic substrate was higher and the analyse of the gas quality showed an higher amount of hydrogen. In experiment 1 you got 37, 2 Vol. -% and in experiment 3 a hydrogen amount of 41 Vol. -% was reached. There was a specific hydrolysis gas yield of 89, 6 l i. N/kgoTS and a hydrogen yield of 36, 9 l i. N/kgoTS. The experiments demonstrate that the fermentative production of Hydrogen by lignocellulostic bio mass like corn and grass silage is possible. The next part was an economic efficiency calculation. The target was to calculate the production costs for the fermentative production of hydrogen and to compare them to the price of steam refoming. Bachelorarbeit von Danae Schmick – VII – The reactor for hydrolysation was considered as a pre-stage of a biogas reactor. The desulfurization and gas purification was realized by a pressure swing adoption plant. Two cases have been measured. In the first one only corn silage was used as substrate. In the second case a mixture of corn and grass silage were utilized. With corn sillage as substrate production costs of about 16 €/kg were generated. Because of lower substrat cost you reach a lower production cost with the usage of the mixture of grass and corn silage. It was ca. 13 €/kg. The calculation of the production cost of hydrogen come to the conclusion that the price for fermentative produced Hydrogen is 10 times higher than the process costs of hydrogen which was produced by steam reforming. The fermentative prosuction costs can be lowered by the selling of byproducts like for example carbon dioxid, but this wasn’t part of this thesis. To put it in a nutshell: There is still a high demand of research work and big technical progress in the sector of gas purification necessary to produce hydrogen by fermentation in an economic way...|$|E

The paper {{presents}} the results of laboratory research of the effectiveness of biogas produc-tion from silage of maize straw with addition of the fermentation inoculum, which was post-fermentation pulp from agricultural biogas plant. Maize straw was ensiled naturally and with the use of artificial additives, the task of which was to ensure correct fermentation process. Two preparations were used for ensilage: Silomax (bacteria of lactic fermentation) and Labacsil Acid (the set of organic acids and potassium sorbate). The experiment was conducted in a multi-chamber biofermentator, monitoring biogas production and the minimum level of methane. It was found out that silage from maize straw without the ensiling preparations was characterised with the highest biogas yield. Whereas, with regard to methane production, maize straw silage with Labacsil Acid preparations was the most efficient. Key words: maize straw, substrate, biogas, <b>methan...</b>|$|E

Die Zielprodukte sind n-Alkane mit zwei bis sechs Kohlenstoffatomen (C 2 - 6 -n-Alkane), die im Steamcracker die höchsten Ausbeuten an Ethen und Propen liefern. iso-Alkane sind ebenfalls für den Steamcracker-Einsatz geeignet. Dagegen sind teilweise hydrierte Aromaten, Cycloalkane, stark verzweigte Alkane und <b>Methan</b> unerwünscht.

The most desired products are n-alkanes with two to six carbon atoms (C 2 - 6 -nalkanes). iso-Alkanes are less suitable as a steamcracker feed, because they produce less ethene and propene in the steamcracker, but more methane. The formation of partially hydrogenated aromatics, cycloalkanes, highly branched alkanes and methane should be avoided...|$|E
