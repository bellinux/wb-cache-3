5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between the statements in each testimony; {{if they find}} a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads {{to changes in the}} testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E
5|$|Material worn {{from the}} margins of the land {{eventually}} ends up in the sea, where it is subject to attrition as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport material away from its place of origin. Sediment carried to the sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing deltas to form in estuaries. All these materials <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> under the influence of waves, tides, and currents. Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to prevent flooding through building breakwaters, seawalls, and other defenses against the sea. In Britain, the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surges, while the failure of the dykes and levees around New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina created a humanitarian crisis in the United States. Land reclamation in Hong Kong permitted the construction of Hong Kong International Airport through the leveling and expansion of two smaller islands.|$|E
5|$|The pupae of some moths {{are able}} to wriggle their abdomen. The three caudal {{segments}} of the pupal abdomen (segments 8–10) are fixed; the other segments are movable to some degree. While the more evolved Lepidoptera can wriggle only the last two-three segments {{at the end of}} the abdomen, more basal taxa such as the Micropterigidae can wriggle the remaining seven segments of the abdomen; this presumably helps them to protrude the anterior end from the pupal case before eclosion. The pupae of Hepialidae {{are able to}} <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in the larval tunnel by wriggling, aided by projections on the back in addition to spines. Abdominal wriggling is considered to be of startle value and discouraging to predators. In the case of a few hawk moths, such as Theretra latreillii, the wriggling of the abdomens is accompanied by a rattling or clicking sound which adds to the startle effect.|$|E

40|$|This {{demonstration}} illustrates Newton's first law, {{by showing}} that if an object experiences no force, it will not move. A glider is placed on an air track that has no air flowing. When the air track is <b>moved</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> the glider sticks to the air track because of friction, <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> with the air track. When the air is turned on, the glider floats virtually without friction on {{a thin layer of}} air, and remains fixed in space as the air track <b>moves</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> under it. The perceptive observer will notice that the glider is moving very slightly. This is caused by a small amount of residual friction...|$|R

5|$|The game {{emphasizes}} Batman's detective skills; for example, he can scan a {{crime scene}} with Detective Vision (displayed in first-person perspective) to highlight points of interest; holograms act out theoretical scenarios of the crime. The crimes can be reviewed via Batman's link to the Batcomputer in the Batcave; this allows a player to view virtual recreations of the scene from different angles (with the ability to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> through the crime's timeline), view it in slow motion or pause while looking for clues to solve the crime. Small (and large) crime scenes are distributed throughout Gotham City. Reviewing the downing of a helicopter, Batman is presented with false and accurate clues; investigation of the scene can reveal that the helicopter was shot, allowing Batman to trace the bullet's trajectory to a murdered police officer and another crime scene. When a crime is solved, the player is shown a Batman-narrated rundown of the crime. The Batcave is also a hub where Batman can change costumes, upgrade his equipment and access challenge maps to practice combat (these maps were accessed separately in previous games). After completing the story mode a New Game Plus mode is unlocked, enabling a player to replay the game with all their acquired gadgets, experience and abilities; enemies are tougher, and the icon warning players of attack is disabled. Completing New Game Plus unlocks I Am the Night mode, where the game ends if Batman dies.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of driver, {{commonly}} called a dynamic loudspeaker, uses a lightweight diaphragm, or cone, connected to a rigid basket, or frame, via a flexible suspension, commonly called a spider, that constrains a voice coil to move axially through a cylindrical magnetic gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the voice coil, a magnetic field is created by the electric current in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> accelerating and reproducing sound {{under the control of the}} applied electrical signal coming from the amplifier. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.|$|E

25|$|Within the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{concentrates}} {{its effort}} to restore grizzly bears in six recovery areas. These are Northern Continental Divide (Montana), Yellowstone (Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho), Cabinet-Yaak (Montana and Idaho), Selway-Bitterroot (Montana and Idaho), Selkirk (Idaho and Washington), and North Cascades (Washington). The grizzly population in these areas is estimated at 750 in the Northern Continental Divide, 550 in Yellowstone, 40 in the Yaak portion of the Cabinet-Yaak, and 15 in the Cabinet portion (in northwestern Montana), 105 in Selkirk region of Idaho, 10–20 in the North Cascades, and none currently in Selway-Bitterroots, {{although there have been}} sightings. These are estimates because bears move in and out of these areas, and it is therefore impossible to conduct a precise count. In the recovery areas that adjoin Canada, bears also <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> across the international boundary.|$|E
25|$|Sobhraj {{was born}} as Hatchand Bhaonani Gurumukh Charles Sobhraj to a Vietnamese mother and an Indian Sindhi father in Saigon, Vietnam. His parents were {{unmarried}} {{and his father}} later deserted the family. Stateless at first, Sobhraj was adopted by his mother's new boyfriend, a French Army lieutenant stationed in Indochina. However, he was neglected in favour of the couple's later children. Sobhraj continued to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between France and Indochina with the family. As a teenager, Sobhraj began to commit petty crimes. Sobhraj received his first jail sentence (for burglary) in 1963, serving at Poissy prison near Paris. Sobhraj manipulated prison officials into granting him special favours, such as being allowed to keep books in his cell. Around the same time, he met and endeared himself to Felix d'Escogne, a wealthy young man and prison volunteer.|$|E
25|$|Moonlighting {{was unusual}} {{at the time}} for being {{one of only three}} shows, due to FCC regulations, to be owned and {{produced}} in-house by a broadcast network (NBC’s Punky Brewster and CBS’s Twilight Zone revival being the others). This allowed the network greater flexibility in budgeting the show since the “back-end potential” for profits was so much greater with not having to pay a licensing fee to the film studio or independent production company. As a result, ABC gave Caron a lot of control over production. Caron, however, was a perfectionist and viewed Moonlighting as the filming of a one-hour movie every week, using techniques usually reserved for big budget films. To capture the cinematic feel of the films of the 1940s, for example, he would prohibit the use of a zoom lens, opting instead to use more time-consuming moving master cameras that <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> on a track and require constant resetting of the lights. Diffusion disks were used to soften Cybill Shepherd’s features, and a special lens needed to be employed so that in a two shot, Maddie would be diffused and David would not.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Pip, the Narissa dragon {{was allowed}} {{to be more of}} a fantasy {{character}} while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain. The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch. When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the Woolworth Building while clutching Robert in her claws, a greenscreen rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements. The rig was a [...] "puppeteering" [...] approach that involved a robotic arm being controlled by three different floor effects artists.|$|E
500|$|Players {{dispatch}} enemies {{by either}} thrusting {{at them with}} his Dragon Sword or by defeating them using Power Boosting Items. These special items consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power", also located {{on the top of}} the screen. Power Boosting Items include the following: shurikens; [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] that <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> like a boomerang; [...] "The Art of the Fire Wheel" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally upwards; [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally downwards; and the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that creates a barrier of three fireballs around Ryu, destroying any enemy that touches them. These items can be found in various crystal balls scattered throughout the levels, and they can be switched out by collecting another Power Boosting Item. The amount of ninja power used depends on the type of Power Boosting Item used. At the end of each Act Ryu fights a boss which has its own strength meter, located {{on the top of the}} screen. The boss's strength meter decreases every time the player damages it, and the boss is destroyed when the player completely depletes its strength meter.|$|E
500|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player {{attempts to get}} the defendant declared innocent by questioning witnesses and presenting evidence to the judge and the prosecutor. Many witnesses lie during their testimonies; the player is able to <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> through the testimony {{to try to find}} any inconsistencies. There are two options available during cross-examinations: [...] "press", which makes the player question a particular statement, which sometimes makes the witnesses change their testimony; and [...] "present", which is used to show a piece of evidence or a character profile that the player thinks shows a contradiction in the witness's currently shown statement. In the upper right corner of the screen, the player's health bar is shown, representing the judge's patience. The bar decreases if the player makes mistakes, such as presenting the wrong piece of evidence; if it reaches zero, the defendant is declared guilty, and the player loses the game. While the player cannot lose the game while trying to break a psyche-lock, the bar will still decrease if the player presents the wrong evidence while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the bar is restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and 100% is restored when an episode is completed.|$|E

500|$|Ryu can defeat enemies {{by attacking}} with his Dragon Sword or by using {{secondary}} weapons which consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power"; such weapons include the following: [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] which <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> like boomerangs, [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which launch fireballs downward at an angle, the [...] "Fire Wheel Art" [...] which launches fireballs upward at an angle, the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that forms {{a series of}} rotating of fireballs around Ryu and destroys any enemy who comes into contact, and a new weapon in this series called the [...] "Vacuum Wave Art" [...] which hurls vacuum blades above and below Ryu simultaneously. Players can collect red and blue capsules to refill Ryu's ninja power, and they can also collect [...] "Scrolls {{of the spirit of}} the Dragon" [...] to increase Ryu's maximum ninja power level. Another new item in Ninja GaidenIII is the [...] "Dragon Spirit Sword" [...] that increases Ryu range of his sword. At the end of each Act is a boss which has its own life meter that decreases when damaged; Ryu can defeat the boss by completely depleting its life meter. Ninja GaidenIIIs first four bosses consist of the [...] "bio-noids"– super-human creatures created and controlled by Foster to take over the world; they each represent the four elementals: earth, wind, fire, and water.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} test levels {{created for the}} game did not ship in the final version for being too open and {{featuring}} too many polygons. During the summer of 1995, the team focused on creating levels that were functional as well as fun and used the Cortex factory levels to experiment on this goal; the mechanical setting allowed the team to forego the complex and organic forest designs and distill the two-axis gameplay {{in an attempt to}} make it fun. Their first two successful levels ("Heavy Machinery" [...] and [...] "Generator Room") utilized 2.5D gameplay and featured basic techniques previously used in Donkey Kong Country, such as steam vents, drop platforms, bouncy pads, heated pipes and enemy characters that would <b>move</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> all of which would be arranged in progressively more difficult combinations as the level went on. [...] "Willie"'s jumping, spinning and bonking mechanisms were refined in these two levels. The level [...] "Cortex Power" [...] incorporates the original [...] "Sonic's ass" [...] point of view (behind the character and over his shoulder) featured in the two test levels. After working on those three levels, the first successful jungle-themed level (later titled [...] "Jungle Rollers") was created from pieces of the failed first test level arranged into a corridor between trees. From that point forward, two to three levels would be created for each level theme featured, with the first level featuring an introductory set of challenges and later levels adding new obstacles (such as dropping and moving platforms in the second jungle-themed level) to increase the difficulty.|$|E
