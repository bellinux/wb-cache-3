5|$|Kentucky's {{citizens}} were split regarding the issues {{central to the}} Civil War. The state had strong economic ties with Ohio River cities such as Pittsburgh and Cincinnati {{while at the same}} time sharing many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, especially in the east. With economic ties to both the North and the South, Kentucky had little to gain and <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> from a war between the states. Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for slavery was within the Union.|$|E
5|$|Seamans' {{establishment}} of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a launch vehicle {{to be used in}} the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision. This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR—as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR. The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.|$|E
25|$|His {{suggested}} detailed changes, additions {{and further}} developments were like a real `gold mine' for the submitting authors. He managed to stay aloof of all science `politics' most of the time, even in very adverse circumstances such as those during the McCarthy era when completely unfounded political accusations were made about one or two members of his close research group. Not unlike another American theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer, he then had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> for his loyal support of the wrongly accused researcher in his group.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{there were}} too many {{prominent}} people who had been willing collaborators in 1430 that had changed their allegiance once Charles had regained Paris and Rouen that had too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> for the proceedings against Joan to be reopened. They included men such as Jean de Mailly, now the Bishop of Noyon, who had converted to Charles' cause in 1443, but in 1431 had signed letters in the name of King Henry VI of England, guaranteeing English protection to all those who had participated in the case against Joan. An even greater obstacle was Raoul Roussel, archbishop of Rouen, who had been a fervent supporter of the English cause in Normandy and had participated in Joan’s trial, until he too took an oath of loyalty to Charles in 1450.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{hostilities}} {{between the}} North and South, {{the majority of}} European maritime powers had declared the practice of privateering to be illegal by the Declaration of Paris (1856). According to the treaty, privateers of signatory nations were strictly illegal and if caught they could be seized by the ships of any other signatory nation and tried in that nation's courts. However, they were {{not exactly the same}} as pirates. Privateers enjoyed limited legal status if they did not murder and if they behaved generally according to the laws of their sponsoring non-signatory government. Thus acting, they were not subject to the death penalty as if they were rogue buccaneers. True piracy was a crime everywhere and the death penalty for piracy was accepted worldwide. In 1856, the United States had declined to ratify the Declaration, or Treaty, of Paris in order to preserve the rights of a smaller fledgling nation against the larger maritime powers of the day. Now Lincoln wanted exactly the same protection against privateers as the European powers did in 1856, which the United States had denied. As a non-signatory of the Treaty, Lincoln could have legally raised a call for privateers himself, but he had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> by engaging in the practice because it could have stirred the wrath of the greatest maritime powers on earth, Great Britain, France and Spain, whom he wished instead would join in condemnation of the Confederacy as an illegal government. The Confederate States had little to lose and much to gain if they could neutralize the United States Navy and force the world to see them as a respectable world power. Surely, they believed, recognition of Southern sovereignty would follow.|$|E
500|$|Stephen also {{commented on}} the feud, opining that while [...] "Mercedes and Mitzeee are hardly Dynasty's Alexis and Krystle, they are enjoying quite a good spat". After Mercedes' {{stalking}} of Mitzeee, Stephen went on to say: [...] "No one could deny that Mercedes has had one heck of an exciting life. Siege victim, kidnap victim, depressive, stalker..." [...] Stephen urged Mercedes to realise that [...] "there are other guys in the world apart from Riley. True, you've had them all, but you could simply start going round the circuit again". She added that Mercedes does not have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> in her life. After her stalking of Mitzeee, Mercedes went on to stab herself, on this Carena Crawford of All About Soap said the episode itself was a [...] "huge shocker" [...] due to Mercedes' actions. Crawford added that when Mercedes realises she will be blamed for knocking Mitzeee unconscious she sees the knife and [...] "mad Mercedes {{came up with the}} perfect plan and we winced as she plunged the blade into her own stomach, knowing everyone would think Mitzeee did it! So now manipulative Mercedes has the upper hand over her rival [...] After all, who’d suspect anyone of stabbing themselves – very few people are warped enough to do that".|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{have argued}} that Hume's {{position}} assumes the character of miracles and natural laws prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of begging the question. To assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise- to compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers with intellectual observers {{and those who have}} little to gain and <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> with those with much to gain and little to lose is not convincing to many. Indeed, many {{have argued that}} miracles not only do not contradict the laws of nature, but require the laws of nature to be intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For example, William Adams remarks that [...] "there must be an ordinary course of nature before anything can be extraordinary. There must be a stream before anything can be interrupted". They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance those in the future. This, in Hume's philosophy, was especially problematic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{circumstances}} of Danby's acts (and King Charles's) now {{came together to}} bring about his fall. Although both abroad and at home his policy had generally embodied {{the wishes of the}} ascendant party in the state, Danby had never obtained the confidence of the nation. His character inspired no respect, and during the whole of his long career, he could not rely on the support of a single individual. Charles is said to have told him when he made him treasurer that he had only two friends in the world, himself and his own merit. He was described to Samuel Pepys as [...] "one of a broken sort of people that have not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> and therefore will venture all", and as [...] "a beggar having £1100 or £1200 a year, but owes above £10,000". His office brought him in £20,000 a year, and he was known to make large profits by the sale of offices; he maintained his power by corruption and by jealously excluding from office men of high standing and ability. Gilbert Burnet described him as [...] "the most hated minister that had ever been about the king".|$|E
2500|$|Newman met actress Joanne Woodward in 1953. Shortly after filming The Long, Hot Summer in 1957, he {{divorced}} Witte. He married Woodward {{early in}} 1958. The Newmans {{moved away from}} Hollywood in the early 1960s, buying a home and starting a family in Westport, Connecticut. They {{were one of the}} very first Hollywood movie star couples to choose to raise their families outside of California. [...] They remained married for 50 years, until his death in 2008. They had three daughters: Elinor [...] "Nell" [...] Teresa (b. 1959), Melissa [...] "Lissy" [...] Stewart (b. 1961), and Claire [...] "Clea" [...] Olivia (b. 1965). Newman was well known for his devotion to his wife and family. When once asked about his reputation for fidelity, he famously quipped, [...] "Why go out for a hamburger when you have steak at home?" [...] He also said that he never met anyone who had as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> as he did. In his profile on 60 minutes he admitted he once left Woodward after a fight, walked around the outside of the house, knocked on the front door and explained to Joanne he had nowhere to go. [...] Newman directed Nell alongside her mother in the films Rachel, Rachel and The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds.|$|E

50|$|This {{setting out}} {{to make a name for}} oneself was {{particularly}} common among younger brothers, who were less likely to receive anything from their father and therefore more motivated to overhaul the system through their own actions.

5000|$|There is some {{evidence}} that ISPs tend to quickly take down allegedly infringing content on request by copyright holders, in situations where the content is actually non-infringing and should be preserved.

2500|$|While at Cambridge, Sharp {{heard the}} lectures of William Morris {{and became a}} Fabian Socialist and lifelong vegetarian. He was {{cautious}} in his public statements, however, feeling that he had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> since, unlike Morris, he was not independently wealthy but dependent on outside funding for his researches. Respectability was important to him, increasingly so as he got older. According to his biographer, Maud Karpeles: [...] "Any display of singularity was displeasing to him; and he followed the convention in behaviour {{as well as in}} appearance unless there was a very good reason for departing from them. 'It saves so much trouble,' he would say." [...] During the post World War II [...] "second" [...] British folk revival of the 1950s and 60s, Sharp was occasionally chided for this by leftist critics such as Bert Lloyd. C. J. Bearman writes that [...] "Lloyd was effectively the first to offer public criticism of Sharp and of the first revival generally. This critique was from a Marxist perspective: Lloyd (1908-82) had associated himself with the Communist Party since the 1930s. ... However, he was always more pragmatic than doctrinaire, and he combined criticism of Sharp's philosophy and methods with high and unreserved praise for his motivation and the epic scale of his achievement.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to England {{again in}} October 1659, he endeavoured {{to support the}} {{original}} republican cause by reconciling the army to the parliament. [...] Ludlow failed in these final reconciliation attempts {{primarily because of the}} divisions and corruption within the military, legal, and Presbyterian factions. [...] Each faction feared successful attempt in bringing forth an equally representative republic on anything other than their own terms. [...] For example, it was difficult for the key leaders of a previously suspended Long Parliament to take any overtures from an army which had disbanded them seriously or without significant concessions to the army's power and good behavior, terms the Wallingford House and Gen. Lambert's party would not agree to. [...] Although Ludlow had the support of Henry Vane the Younger and some other generals, these efforts proved abortive since each side had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> in any compromise. While these futile attempts at reconciliation between the Wallingford House party and key members of the Long Parliament were taking place, other matters would soon override all these various factions and encompass all these parties in serious compromise and peril. [...] Consequently, most of the generals of the Wallingford House party and the key members of the Long Parliament who were in favour of the Good Old Cause (of a republican commonwealth) would lose their lives upon the restoration of King Charles II. It was believed by many of this republican faction that George Monck was for the restoration of the Long Parliament. [...] They had no idea that King Charles II would be restored by George Monck to the throne and were entirely deceived by Monck's treachery to the republican cause. The attempts at reconciliation between the Wallingford House part of the army and Parliament failed.|$|E
