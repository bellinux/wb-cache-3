Fey herself was nominated both as the creator/executive producer of the series and for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her guest performance as Marcia, a bumbling prosecutor in reference to <b>Marcia</b> <b>Clark.</b>|$|E
25|$|Deputy District Attorney <b>Marcia</b> <b>Clark</b> was {{designated}} as the lead prosecutor. Deputy District Attorney Christopher A. Darden became Clark's co-counsel.|$|E
25|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} <b>Marcia</b> <b>Clark</b> {{published a}} book about the case titled Without a Doubt (1998). Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded that nothing could have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.|$|E
50|$|In March 2014 Deadline.com {{announced}} that he had landed the role of Lieutenant Graden Hales in the TNT commissioned pilot of <b>Marcia</b> <b>Clark's</b> Guilt by Association alongside Julia Stiles, which TNT ultimately declined to pick up.|$|R
50|$|Clark is {{best remembered}} as the lead {{prosecutor}} in the 1995 trial of O. J. Simpson on charges of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson, his ex-wife, and Ron Goldman. Prior to this trial, Clark's highest-profile prosecution was in 1991, when she prosecuted Robert John Bardo {{for the murder of}} television star Rebecca Schaeffer. In his book Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away with Murder, Vincent Bugliosi blames the acquittal of O. J. Simpson on <b>Marcia</b> <b>Clark's</b> prosecutorial incompetence.|$|R
50|$|<b>Marcia</b> Rachel <b>Clark</b> (born <b>Marcia</b> Rachel Kleks on August 31, 1953) is an American prosecutor, author, and {{television}} correspondent. She {{was the lead}} prosecutor in the O. J. Simpson murder case.|$|R
25|$|According {{to media}} reports, {{prosecutor}} <b>Marcia</b> <b>Clark</b> thought that women, regardless of race, would {{sympathize with the}} domestic violence aspect {{of the case and}} connect with her personally. On the other hand, the defense's research suggested that women generally were more likely to acquit than men, and that jurors did not respond well to Clark's combative style of litigation. The defense also speculated that black women would not be as sympathetic as white women to the victim, who was white, because of tensions about interracial marriages. Both sides accepted a disproportionate number of female jurors. From an original jury pool of 40% white, 28% black, 17% Hispanic, and 15% Asian, the final jury for the trial had 10 women and two men, of which there were nine blacks, two whites, and one Hispanic.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{theories}} have been refuted by <b>Marcia</b> <b>Clark,</b> Tynna Brown and Fred Goldman who said, [...] "I believe [...] did it, {{and he did}} it alone".|$|E
2500|$|Immediate {{reaction}} to the verdict was notable for its division along racial lines: a poll of Los Angeles County residents showed that most African Americans there felt that justice had been served by the [...] "not guilty" [...] verdict, {{while the majority of}} whites and Latinos expressed an opinion that it had not. O. J. Simpson's integrated defense counsel included Johnnie Cochran, Robert Kardashian, Robert Shapiro, and F. Lee Bailey. <b>Marcia</b> <b>Clark</b> was the lead prosecutor for the State of California.|$|E
50|$|Kaz {{joined the}} house band of Austin blues venue Antones in 1982, {{where he has}} {{performed}} for 35 years. Kaz continues to play with local Texas musicians including Jimmie Vaughan, <b>Marcia</b> Ball, WC <b>Clark,</b> Red Young, Miss Lavelle White, and Anson Funderburgh.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Kaz {{started a}} three-piece horn section, The Texas Horns, with Al Gomez and John Mills. In 2015, The Texas Horns {{released}} their first album, [...] "Blues Gotta Holda Me," [...] on the Vizztone Label. Described as [...] "a horn-driven, blues-drenched celebration," [...] the album includes WC <b>Clark,</b> <b>Marcia</b> Ball, Johnny Nicholas, Danny Levin, and Anson Funderburgh. The Texas Horns have performed with American bands {{such as the}} Allman Brothers, and are featured at international festivals including The Ottawa Bluesfest, {{where they have been}} house band for over 15 years. Kaz's current band, The Recuperators, includes guitarist Derek O'Brien and Keyboard/vocalist Nick Connolly.|$|R
2500|$|Deputy District Attorneys <b>Marcia</b> <b>Clark</b> and Christopher Darden {{believed}} they had a strong case against Simpson, but Cochran was able to convince the jurors that there was reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence, which was a relatively new form of evidence in trials at that time. The reasonable doubt theory included evidence that the blood sample had allegedly been mishandled by lab scientists and technicians, and there were questionable circumstances that surrounded other court exhibits. Cochran and the defense team also alleged other misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), related to systemic racism. Simpson's celebrity status, racial issues, and the lengthy televised trial riveted national attention on the so-called [...] "trial of the century". By {{the end of the}} criminal trial, national surveys showed dramatic differences in the assessment of Simpson's guilt or innocence between black and white Americans.|$|E
2500|$|Explanations other than, or emphasizing, the prosecution's lack of {{forensic}} evidence were {{given for the}} jury's decision. A number of media commentators reasoned that the prosecution overcharged the case by tagging on the death penalty, concluding that people in good conscience could not sentence Anthony to death based on the circumstantial evidence presented. The CSI effect was also extensively argued—that society now lives [...] "in a 'CSI age' where everyone expects fingerprints and DNA, and we are sending a message that old-fashioned circumstantial evidence is not sufficient". Likewise, commentators such as O. J. Simpson case prosecutor <b>Marcia</b> <b>Clark</b> believe that the jury interpreted [...] "reasonable doubt" [...] too narrowly. Clark said instruction on reasonable doubt is [...] "the hardest, most elusive" [...] instruction of all. [...] "And I think it's where even the most fair-minded jurors can get derailed", she said, opining the confusion between reasonable doubt and a reason to doubt. [...] "In Scotland, they have three verdicts: guilty, not guilty, and not proven. It's one way of showing {{that even if the}} jury didn't believe the evidence amounted to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it didn't find the defendant innocent either. There's a difference." ...|$|E
