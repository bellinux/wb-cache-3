40|$|The Swedish {{energy agency}} (STEM), has {{developed}} a new regulatory model to supervise the revenues of the Distribution System Operators (DSO), {{referred to as the}} Network Performance Assessment Model (NPAM). The fundamental idea of the NPAM is that the electrical distribution system provides customer values, and the DSO is allowed to collect revenue corresponding to these values. The NPAM calculates customer values for a fictive electrical distribution system, with a total cost referred to as the Network Performance Assessment (NPA). The allowed debiting rate for a DSO is defined by the quotient of the revenue and the NPA. If the debiting rate is higher than a certain value, defined by the Energy <b>Market</b> <b>Inspection</b> (EMI) at STEM, the DSO is placed under review and could be forced to pay back revenue to customers. A lawsuit is currently in progress on this use of the NPAM, which has highlighted drawbacks in the model. This paper provides a comprehensive presentation of the NPAM. It describes in detail the different input data for the model, the steps in the calculations and the resulting cost factors. The paper also presents for the first time details on the theory underlying the calculations. QC 20101125 This paper was included in a licentiate thesis, but later rejected.

Is there {{a significant difference in}} operation status of companies between issuing cash dividend and those without cash dividend, and which one is the better? Is there a significant difference in income level of stocks between issuing cash dividend and those without cash dividend, which one is the higher? Is the irrational preference of cash dividend detracting along with the development and improvement of securities market? All issues above need the <b>market</b> <b>inspection.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Based on related dividend theories and the empirical data of Chinese securities market, we construct three portfolios including stock dividend, cash dividend and non-dividend. The paper studies the returns from these three kinds of portfolios which is analyzed by the least significant difference method, co-integration model, Sharpe index model, and error correction model, and then finally comes to the conclusions. Findings: The main finding is that there is significant effect of dividends catering in Chinese stock market; the income level of cash dividend portfolio is significantly lower than that of other portfolios; the listed companies issuing stock dividend have a high investment value.

40|$|The Swedish <b>market</b> for vehicle <b>inspection</b> is re-regulated since June 2010. More {{than four}} years after the {{re-regulation}} there are eight companies in the market. Two of these companies are a result of the former monopolist's owners divided the business among themselves. The remaining six companies have entered the market through acquisitions or by building up their business from scratch, these are known as new entrants in the study. The competition has developed slowly and the former monopolist still has the highest market share. Industry conditions are to say the least special because the companies and technicians have to have individual licenses in the form of accreditation and certification, which causes high establishment barriers. The study has the aim of contributing to the knowledge of new entrants on the re-regulated vehicle <b>inspection</b> <b>market.</b> In particular, the new entrant’s establishment and their strategic choices are studied to find out how they act to market conditions in order to create competitive advantages. The study is based on four questions: Main Question: How do new entrants create competitive advantages in the vehicle <b>inspection</b> <b>market?</b> Sub query 1 : How’s the new entrants view on the competitive situation? Sub query 2 : How do the new entrants establish their station-/s? Sub query 3 : What strategies do the new entrants use to strengthen its position against competitors? The essay is based on an empirical survey and is designed as a case study with four units of analysis that represent four new inspection companies in the <b>market</b> for vehicle <b>inspection.</b> Data were collected through interviews with people in key positions of the four companies, as well with a person of the authority whose task is to monitor market developments, namely the Transport Agency. Furthermore, also documents issued by the authorities and new entrants were reviewed. The conclusions that the study has come up with is that the new entrants create competitive advantages through a favorable placement of stations, a bit outside the city center. The strict regulation doesn’t allow the new entrants to create competitive advantages through new or modified inspection services. Based on these regulations the new entrants are trying to attract customers through enhanced service and additional services to the inspection. They try to create a total offering to the customer where the obligatory inspection service is included...|$|R

40|$|Asset pricing theory hypothesizes {{that investors}} are only {{interested}} in portfolios; individual securities are evaluated {{only in terms of}} their contribution to portfolio risk and return. Yet, standard financial market design is that of parallel, unconnected markets, whereby investors cannot submit orders in one market conditional on events in others. When markets are thin, this exposes them to substantial execution risk. Fear of ending up with unbalanced portfolios after trading may even keep investors from submitting orders, further eroding liquidity and the ability of markets to equilibrate. The suggested solution is a portfolio trading mechanism referred to as combined-value trading (CVT). Investors are allowed to submit orders for packages of securities and the system matches trades and computes prices by optimally combining portfolio orders in an open book. We study the performance of the CVT mechanism experimentally and compare it to the performance of parallel, unconnected double auctions in experiments with similar parametrization and either a similar number of subjects or substantially thicker markets. We present evidence that our portfolio trading mechanism facilitates equilibration {{to the extent that the}} thicker <b>markets</b> do. <b>Inspection</b> of order submission and trade activity reveals that subjects manage to exploit the direct linkages between markets enabled by the CVT system...|$|R
