5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of <b>making</b> <b>choices?</b> Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} Makoto Ishihara, a college student who attends a seminar camp on an island {{together}} with three other students; he also befriends three other people who he meets on the island. The game takes place {{over the course of}} a week, and consists of the player reading the story, occasionally <b>making</b> <b>choices</b> that affect the direction of the plot; on the sixth day, one of the female characters dies, and the game moves back in time to the beginning, letting the player use knowledge from the first set of six days to make new choices, to try to prevent the character's death.|$|E
5|$|The game follows Cocoro Fuyukawa and Satoru Yukidoh, who {{frequently}} experience {{a phenomenon that}} makes their minds switch place with each other, putting them in the other person's body. Cocoro is stuck in a blizzard in an emergency cabin on a mountain together with three other people, while Satoru is in an institute {{for the treatment of}} mentally ill criminals, having lost his memory. The player takes the role of Cocoro, and reads the story while occasionally <b>making</b> <b>choices</b> that affect the course of the story, attempting to keep her alive for seven days; after doing so, they are able to play through the seven days from Satoru's perspective as well.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} nonlinear gameplay, allowing multiple {{different ways}} to achieve objectives. This includes travelling between different areas in an open world and <b>making</b> <b>choices</b> that determine the dialogues and order of events as well as alternative endings depending on who the player identifies as the culprit. However, {{only one of the}} characters is the true culprit, while the others are red herrings; if the player closes the case with the wrong culprit, then the player will face criticism from the police chief and need to re-open the case. The game includes a phone {{that could be used to}} manually dial any number, which is needed to contact several non-player characters. The game also features an inventory system requiring the examination and collection of items, which could be used as evidence later in the game.|$|E
5|$|The player {{needs to}} make moral {{decisions}} at certain points during the game, including <b>making</b> <b>choices</b> that can determine the fate of both soldiers and civilians. These decisions affect the relationship between Walker and his squadmates, and will cause them to react differently. The game has several subtle effects as the team starts being broken mentally and physically, including the degradation of their combat uniforms. Walker has visual and auditory hallucinations later into the game, and his executions of enemies become more violent. The orders and shouts to his team become increasingly angry and ragged in contrast to his original stern command voice. His kill confirmations of enemies corrupts from professional in the beginning to psychotic. Similarly, loading screens initially display helpful gameplay hints for the player, but as the game progresses, the text becomes increasingly hostile towards Walker's actions, and sometimes breaks the fourth wall by addressing the player directly. The game features collectibles known as Intel, which are audio logs that provide additional backstory for players.|$|E

Overall language delay is associated with problems of intellectual disability, deafness, and learned helplessness. Children with cerebral palsy {{are at risk of}} learned helplessness and becoming passive communicators, initiating little communication. Early intervention with this clientele, and their parents, often targets situations in which children communicate with others so that they learn that they can control people and objects in their environment through this communication, including <b>making</b> <b>choices,</b> decisions, and mistakes.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{literature}} has pointed to difficulties {{in these kinds of}} assumptions. For instance, there may be aversion at any price towards losing particular species. It has also been suggested that low-probability, extreme outcomes are overweighted when <b>making</b> <b>choices.</b> This is related to climate change, since the possibility of future abrupt changes in the climate or the Earth system cannot be ruled out. For example, if the West Antarctic ice sheet was to disintegrate, it could result in a sea level rise of 4–6meters over several centuries.|$|E
25|$|P. dominula wasps have a lek-based mating system. Males compete {{intensely}} for dominant {{positions on}} the lek, while females are scrupulous when choosing their mates. Males form aggregations on the uppermost portions of structures such as fences, walls, roof peaks, and trees. Males often fight with other males in mid-air or on the structure. Males that lose will fly away from the lek. Females fly through leks or perch near lekking areas to observe males before <b>making</b> <b>choices</b> on mates. Females use the highly conspicuous abdominal spots on males, which are highly variable in size and shape, to aid in mate choice. Males with smaller, more elliptically shaped spots are more dominant over other males and preferred by females compared to males that have larger, more irregularly shaped spots.|$|E

After Turok release, the studio began working on a project for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Propaganda's {{vice president and general manager}} Dan Tudge said that this was because [...] "it is a universe fans will be dying to explore". The studio revealed that they worked on several scripts to improve the gameplay focus. Armada of the Damned included an interactive choice system to shape the game, <b>making</b> <b>choices</b> an important feature.|$|E

500|$|One of Chloe's key {{relationships}} {{is with the}} series protagonist, Clark Kent. Although believers in the [...] "Chlois" [...] theory initially suspected that Chloe would eventually become Lois Lane, Clark's future wife in the comics, Mack contends that Clark does not love Chloe {{in the way that}} she loves him. The actress does not believe that Clark's feelings will ever change. Regardless of Clark's feelings, Mack recognizes that Chloe is blinded by her love for Clark, which ultimately affects her judgment in not only seeing Clark's faults, but <b>making</b> <b>choices</b> that place her character in danger. In season five, Clark finally discovers that Chloe knows his secret, and this revelation allows Chloe the opportunity {{to come to terms with}} her feelings for Clark; this also provided a means for the two have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love.|$|E
500|$|The Division Bell {{deals with}} themes of {{communication}} {{and the idea that}} talking can solve many problems. In the Studio radio host Redbeard suggested that the album offered [...] "the very real possibility of transcending it all, through shivering moments of grace". Songs such as [...] "Poles Apart" [...] and [...] "Lost for Words" [...] have been interpreted as references to the estrangement between Pink Floyd and former band member Roger Waters, who left in 1985; however, Gilmour denied this, and said: [...] "People can invent and relate to a song in their personal ways, but it's a little late at this point for us to be conjuring Roger up." [...] The title refers to the division bell rung in the British parliament to announce a vote. Drummer Nick Mason said: [...] "It does have some meaning.

IGN's Hilary Goldstein offered similar praise to her dialogue. When looking at morality in games, Gamasutra's Katherine Cross noted how Kreia's comments affected her more than many of the dark-side/light-side choices in the game. Her [...] "practical" [...] philosophy was also complimented by Kotaku's Phil Owen, who noted its ties to reality over the traditional moral extremes of the Sith and the Jedi. Eurogamers Richard Cobbett considered her the most [...] "famous" [...] of The Sith Lords subversion of Star Wars and the first Knights of the Old Republic, commenting [...] "Whether you agree or think she's crazy, she's a fresh breath of air for the series, and easily one of the best RPG characters ever." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the {{narrative}} was to depict war in a manner unlike it is portrayed in media such as TV and books. Another goal was to use the scenarios presented to cause players to raise questions about their thoughts of killing people in a video game {{as a form of}} entertainment. To achieve this, the team made the hints at the game's loading screen increasingly aggressive, while the game's overall narrative was designed with the aim of being [...] "physically opposing", so that players could project themselves into the protagonist's position, especially when <b>making</b> <b>choices</b> that involve the killing of innocents. They hoped that players would be able to feel angry at the developers who [...] "forced" [...] players into killing civilians in the game. The team had a lot of debates regarding the imagery used in depicting violence towards civilians, as many considered it excessive and unnecessary. However, 2K approved their vision even when the team thought they had pushed the narrative to extremes.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq {{has said}} of his {{creative}} intentions with the follow-up, [...] "I’ve never shut my ears to anything, really.

Any guitar, any drums, any rhythm section— I’ve always been open to those things, {{trying to understand what}} makes them work in a song". He was influenced by early rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, and has cited blues musician Howlin' Wolf as an influence on the album's sound, which he described as [...] "bluesy" [...] and [...] "harder" [...] than that of his previous album, with more aggressive tempos. In an interview for BULLETT Magazine, Saadiq explained his idea of the album's title, stating [...] "Stone Rollin basically symbolizes the action of throwing dice and taking chances with life. That's what I've done my whole career—taking chances with different styles of music and <b>making</b> <b>choices</b> that other people would be afraid to take.

500|$|Allen and May's {{first series}} in control {{resulted}} in a 3–2 win over South Africa. In 1956, the Australians toured England. The home team won the five-match series 2–1. The selectors made several important decisions throughout the series. In the third Test, Allen pushed {{for the inclusion of}} Cyril Washbrook, who was then 41 years old and had not played a Test for five years. The decision was controversial, and Quelch suggests that, with the series in the balance after England lost the second Test, Allen was feeling the pressure. He was also criticised in the press by Bill Bowes, a former England teammate, for forcing one of the England team, Fred Trueman, to bowl at a handkerchief during practice before the match, in an attempt to improve his accuracy. The incident took place before a large crowd; although Trueman kept his counsel at the time, he felt humiliated and believed that Allen and the Establishment intended to keep him in his place. Washbrook scored 98, and England won the match. In the fourth game, David Sheppard, who had barely played in 1956, was selected and scored a century, and in the final Test Denis Compton was recalled after a long-term injury and scored 94. The Wisden editor Norman Preston judged the selectors to have done a good job that season, <b>making</b> <b>choices</b> with which critics disagreed. He wrote: [...] "I think it is appropriate, therefore, that tribute be paid to [...] for the time and patience they devoted to their task last summer. Nothing was too much trouble for them." [...] Allen was involved in one controversial episode, when the Australians accused him and other selectors of arranging for the pitches during the Test matches to give a lot of assistance to spin bowlers, which led to Laker's extraordinary success in the series. Allen denied any involvement. During the winter, Allen was part of an advisory group which looked for ways to revitalise county cricket.|$|E
