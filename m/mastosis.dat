40|$|The {{frequency}} of mammary tumors in canines {{is three times}} higher than in women. Contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) is a noninvasive clinical method, that uses special contrast agents (CAs), their role being to layout the microvasculature of different lesions. The aim of this particular method, in this case, was to establish if we can evaluate the malignancy of a mass, {{given the fact that}} neovascularization is a malignancy marker. The case is represented by a Silky Terrier breed female dog, 5 years old, that was presented initially with an enlarged polycystic mammary gland and a nervous lactation. The female was initially diagnosed with polycystic <b>mastosis.</b> After 2 more months the mass became denser and enlarged. Before the ovariohisterectomy and unilateral mastectomy surgeries have taken place, a B-Mode standard ultrasound, CEUS and a pulmonary X-ray were performed. Our results integrate this case in “fast in” and “slow in” (type 2 curve). The histological diagnosis was established as a simple cystic papillary carcinoma with a malignancy grade 2. The mean value of the MVD was 13. 75 which is a low MVD. We cannot determine a correlation between CEUS and a tumor’s malignancy, and so further studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} breast tumors in adult females with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. METHODS: Prospective, single-center study, based on female outpatients consulting in a liver unit, for 1 year. The study group included females with present and/or past history of chronic infection by HCV. Patients with spontaneous recovery were excluded. Chronic hepatitis had been proved by liver biopsy {{in the majority of}} cases and/or biological markers of inflammation and fibrosis. The control group included female patients with other well documented chronic liver diseases: chronic hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, non alcoholic liver disease, chronic cholangitis. Participating patients were prospectively questioned during consultation about past breast history and follow-up by mammography. RESULTS: Breast carcinoma was recorded in 17 / 294 patients with HCV infection (5. 8 %, 95 % CI: 3. 1 - 8. 4) vs 5 / 107 control patients (4. 7 %, 95 % CI: 0. 67 - 8. 67). Benign tumors of the breast (<b>mastosis,</b> nodules, cysts) were recorded in 75 / 294 patients with HCV infection (25. 5 %, 95 % CI: 20. 5 - 30. 5) vs 21 / 107 (19. 6 %, 95 % CI: 12. 1 - 27. 1) in the control group. No lesion was noted in 202 patients with HCV (68. 7 %, 95 % CI: 63. 4 - 74) vs 81 control patients (75. 7 %, 95 % CI: 67. 6 - 83. 8). Despite a trend to an increased prevalence in the group with HCV infection, the difference was not significant compared to the control group (P = NS). In patients over 40 years, the results were, respectively, as follows: breast cancer associated with HCV: 17 / 266 patients (6. 3 %, 95 % CI: 3. 4 - 9. 3) vs 5 / 95 patients (5. 2 %, 95 % CI: 0. 7 - 9. 7) in the control group; benign breast tumors: 72 / 266 patients with HCV infection (27 %, 95 % CI: 21. 7 - 32. 4) vs 18 / 95 patients (18. 9 %, 95 % CI: 11 - 26. 8) in the control group; no breast lesion 177 / 266 (66. 5 %, 95 % CI: 60. 9 - 72. 2) in patients with HCV infection vs 72 / 95 (75. 7 %, 95 % CI: 67. 1 - 84. 4) in the control group. The differences were not significant (P = NS). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that chronic HCV infection is not a strong promoter of breast carcinoma in adult females of any age...|$|E
