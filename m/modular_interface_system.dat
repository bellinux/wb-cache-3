A new <b>modular</b> <b>interface</b> <b>system</b> receives data directly from the processor broadcast bus and distributes them to up to ten digital chart recorders. This interface is programmed from a computer to assign individual tags to {{each one of the}} display channels. This system eliminates DAC's and patch panels.

40|$|The {{entrance}} region of a fluid channel {{is where the}} velocity distribution changes substantially from its initial condition {{at the entrance to}} that of fully developed flow. This region is particularly influential in microchannels as it may be {{a substantial portion of the}} total channel length, meaning that pressure drop and heat transfer are significantly different than for fully developed flow. Despite the fact that much work has been done on the development of steady flow, no reliable correlations exist for low Reynolds (Re) number flows in rectangular channels, and there is even less data available for oscillatory flows. It follows that a greater understanding of flow development would aid in the design of devices using microchannels in particular, since they involve low Reynolds numbers and are often oscillatory. In this study a microfluidic device was developed to generate controllable oscillatory flow together with a <b>modular</b> <b>interface</b> <b>system</b> to allow a reliable connection to a syringe pump so as to generate steady and pulsatile flows. The flow of de-ionised water from a large planar plenum into a square channel, nominally 50 by 50 micrometres, was studied under steady, oscillatory and pulsatile flow conditions. Time and phase averaged velocity fields were measured using micro-Particle Image Velocimetry. Steady flow was studied in the {{entrance region}} of the microchannel for Reynolds numbers, 1 <Re< 60. Entrance lengths were calculated from the measured centerline velocities. The expected non-linear relationship between entrance length with Re, for low Reynolds numbers was found, and the flow was shown to develop much faster than predicted by existing correlations due to the planar entry. An entrance length correlation is proposed for steady flow under these conditions. Oscillatory flow (zero net flow) was examined with Stokes number, S, < 2. 45. Time varying entrance lengths were calculated and these varied significantly over an oscillation cycle. Pulsatile flow (a mean flow superimposed on the oscillatory flow) for S= 2. 45 was examined for a range of oscillatory to steady flow ratios, 0. 9 <A< 3. 73. The entrance length was found to vary in time about the steady flow value. For both oscillatory and pulsatile conditions, the maximum entrance length was accurately described by the proposed steady flow correlation for entrance length, based on Re at peak flow. These results represent the first systematic experimental study into oscillatory entrance flows...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the focus}} on {{increased}} production and reducing operating costs has become an important goal for {{the oil and gas}} industry. This trend is likely to be even more important in the future. Installation and maintenance of underwater production and processing facilities is expensive, complicated and can cause problems. Solutions that facilitate easier maintenance operations, are an essential factor that reduces operating costs over time. SUBPRO is a combined research program between the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and industry partners, that are developing a concept to mitigate these problems. This concept is called "Subsea Gate Box", where one of the goals is to increase production from individual wells within the same well network. To achieve this, each well will be prepared for further processing, before they are commingled in a common manifold. Thereby, each well is to a higher degree accommodated with its own processing equipment. This thesis addresses modular architecture, and investigates solutions that can contribute to achieve a versatile process facility, as well as facilitating for an efficient installation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of the Gate Box system. In order to identify important factors that are related to these subjects, and than be able to come with some suggestions, relevant theory and "state of the art"-solutions for existing systems have been investigated. Based on this, a number of requirements and specifications have been stated. Furthermore, these requirements and specifications are the basis for the solutions presented in two different cases, which contain various module architecture and connection systems. The two cases were evaluated according to the given specifications in order to identify which one of them fits the requirements best. Important factors that were considered includes; <b>modular</b> <b>interfaces,</b> <b>system</b> redundancy, access to equipment, and possibility for easy replacement of equipment modules. The survey shows that both cases have their advantages and disadvantages, but the layout that allows fast disconnection and replacement of modules, appears to be the best solution...|$|R
