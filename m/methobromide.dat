40|$|Abstract: A set of n-alkyl esters of N,N-dimethylglycine (DMG-n) {{and their}} <b>methobromides</b> (DMGM-n) was synthesized, and their {{activities}} on yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared. The compounds {{differ in the}} number of carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain. Aminoesters with 12 carbon atoms appeared to be most active. Unlike quaternary ammonium salts previously tested, the activities of the compounds were not pH-dependent; the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were identical at pH 8 and at pH 6. In contrast to quaternary ammonium salts, aminoesters showed similar effects on respiratory sufficient (rho +) and respiratory deficient (rho o) mutants. When tested on glucose stimulated proton extrusion, aminoesters applied at MIC increased external pH. Aminoesters inhibited the plasma membrane H +-ATPase, whereas they were less inhibitory on the mitochondrial ATPase. In order to further compare the aminoesters and their corresponding quaternary ammonium salts, derivatives of N,N-dimethylalanine (DMAL-n and DMALMn, respectively) were synthesized. The quaternary ammonium salts appeared to have a higher inhibitory potency than aminoesters, especially at pH 8, and alanine derivatives inhibited growth at a lower concentration than glycine derivatives. Both alanine derivatives of the aminoester and the quaternary ammonium salt inhibited the plasma membrane H +- ATPase at lower concentrations than glycine derivatives, but the alanine aminoester was without a detectable effect on the mitochondrial ATPase. 112...|$|R

40|$|Isolated {{preparations}} of guinea-pig ileum and atria {{have been}} used to estimate the dose-ratios produced by antagonists at muscarinic receptors. Experiments with 4 -diphenyl-acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4 DAMP) metho-salts and with its isomer, 3 DAMP methiodide, indicate that these are only slightly affected by the choice of physiological salt solution, the choice of agonist and {{the presence or absence of}} hexamethonium. Methyl or chloro groups in the p-position of the two benzene rings in 4 DAMP metho-salts markedly reduce affinity and selectivity. When the two benzene rings are linked together, as in the fluorene- 9 -carboxylic ester, the affinity for the receptors in the atria is comparable with that of 4 DAMP <b>methobromide</b> but that for the ileum is about half, so the selectivity is reduced. When the rings are linked as in the xanthene- 9 -carboxylic ester, the affinity for receptors in both tissues is greater than that of 4 DAMP <b>methobromide</b> but there is less selectivity. When two molecules of 4 DAMP are linked together by a polymethylene chain of from 4 to 12 carbon atoms the effects on affinity for muscarinic receptors in the guinea-pig ileum are different from those on affinity for muscarinic receptors in guinea-pig atria. The pentamethylene compound is the most selective: compared with 4 DAMP <b>methobromide</b> it has slightly less affinity for receptors in the ileum but much less affinity for receptors in the atria.

40|$|Tyramine methiodide and {{dopamine}} <b>methobromide</b> {{have greater}} pressor effect (three- to five-times) in the spinal cat than the parent amines. Noradrenaline methochloride has little pressor effect. Dopamine <b>methobromide</b> is {{about four times}} as potent as nicotine; tyramine methiodide is about equiactive to nicotine; and noradrenaline methochloride has only one-tenth the potency of nicotine. Their pressor effects are usually abolished by hexamethonium but in some experiments the effect of noradrenaline methochloride persisted and was then abolished by tolazoline. Injected intravenously into the cat anaesthetized with chloralose, {{each of the three}} quaternary derivatives contracts the nictitating membrane; dopamine <b>methobromide</b> is again the most active, having more than six times the potency of nicotine. When the contractions of the nictitating membrane are induced by continuous stimulation of the preganglionic fibres of the cervical sympathetic nerve, intravenous injection of the quaternary derivatives of tyramine and dopamine has a biphasic effect; there is a block on which a contraction of the membrane appears to be superimposed. Noradrenaline methochloride produces only a further contraction of the membrane. On the isolated rectus abdominis muscle preparation of the frog, dopamine <b>methobromide</b> is the most active in contracting the muscle, being about twelve times as active as nicotine; noradrenaline methochloride is weakest, having only one-hundredth the activity of nicotine. These effects are antagonized by hexamethonium. On the isolated phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation of the rat, the quaternary derivatives of tyramine and dopamine each have neuromuscular blocking properties, 0. 7 - and 3 -times respectively that of nicotine. Noradrenaline methochloride has no effect. In the sciatic nerve-tibialis preparation of the cat, the quaternary derivatives of tyramine and dopamine are approximately equipotent in producing neuromuscular paralysis, having about three times the activity of nicotine and one-fifth that of suxamethonium. These effects are not antagonized either by neostigmine or by edrophonium. Noradrenaline methochloride has no neuromuscular blocking effect. The nicotine-like properties of these quaternized sympathomimetic amines are discussed. It is of interest that the presence of an hydroxyl group attached to the β-carbon atom of the side-chain greatly reduces nicotine-like activity.

The contribution of neurotransmitters and related receptors, the involvement of thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), {{and the role of}} neuronal firing patterns in this process were also examined. The principal nuclei of the medial geniculate body (MGB) showed c-fos expression when the auditory cortex (AC) was activated by direct injection of bicuculline <b>methobromide.</b> However, no expression was detectable with acoustic stimuli alone. This indicated that c-fos expression in the principal nuclei of the MGB was triggered by the corticofugal projection, c-fos expression could be elicited in the MGB by direct injection of glutamate. Direct administration of acetylcholine, alternatively, had no effect. Bicuculline <b>methobromide</b> injection in the AC also triggered synchronized oscillatory activities sequentially in the AC and MGB. Cortically induced c-fos expression in the MGB was not mediated by a pathway involving the TRN because it remained intact after a TRN lesion with kainic acid. The present results also conclude that c-fos expression is not simply associated with firing rate, but also with neuronal firing pattern. Burst firings that are synchronized with the cortical oscillations are proposed to lead to c-fos expression in the principal nuclei of the MGB. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|It has {{generally}} been held that adsorbents reduce the rate of absorption of orally administered drugs, partly by limiting {{the availability of the}} drugs and partly by impeding their access to the absorbing surface (Sollmann, 1948).

Preliminary experiments with atropine sulfate and hydrated alumina gel (A. mphojel, Wyeth) administered orally to rats, however, demonstrated Un-equivocally that contrary to expectation, this adsorbent did not appreciably limit the availability and activity of the anticholinergic drug but, rather, acted as an intestinal repository and prolonged the duration of its action.

Zn 2 + at low concentrations (0. 5 – 2 μM) inhibited, but at high concentrations (5 and 10 μM) augmented, a slow depolarizing component (slow ventral root potential). Zn 2 + had no effect on fast components (monosynaptic reflex potential; fast polysynaptic reflex potential). Unlike Zn 2 +, strychnine (5 μM), a glycine receptor antagonist, and (S), 9 (R) -(−) -bicuculline <b>methobromide</b> (10 μM), a GABAA receptor antagonist, potentiated both fast polysynaptic reflex potential and slow ventral root potential. Zn 2 + (5 μM) did not affect depolarizing responses to glutamate and N-methyl-d-aspartate. Zn 2 + enhanced the substance P-evoked depolarization in the absence of tetrodotoxin (0. 3 μM) but not in its presence. The dorsal root potential was inhibited by (S), 9 (R) -(−) -bicuculline <b>methobromide</b> (10 μM) but not by Zn 2 + (5 μM). The Zn 2 +-potentiated slow ventral root potential was inhibited by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists, ketamine (10 μM) and dl- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphaonovaleric acid (50 μM) but not by P 2 X receptor antagonists, pyridoxal-phosphate- 6 -azophenyl- 2 ′, 4 ′-disulphonic acid (30 μM) and 2 ′, 3 ′-O-(2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl) ATP (10 μM). Ketamine (10 μM) and dl- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphaonovaleric acid (50 μM) almost abolished spontaneous activities increased by Zn 2 +. It is concluded that Zn 2 + potentiated slow ventral root potential induced by primary afferent stimulation, which was mediated by the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors but not by activation of P 2 X receptors or blockade of glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition.

However, in guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle, ipratropium and N-methyldeptropine behaved as classic antagonists with Schild slopes of unity. The high Schild plot slopes in bovine tracheal smooth muscle could not be solely explained by inadequate equilibration of the antagonists, since increased incubation times (3 or 5 h instead of 30 min) still brought about slopes significantly greater than unity, or {{by the presence of}} an atropinesterase in the tissue.

Phentolamine (1 and 4 mg kg- 1 i. v.) blocked both the hypotension and bradycardia produced by Met enkephalin. The inhibitory effect of phentolamine was not due to a simple hypotensive action of this drug per se because a similar degree of hypotension induced by nitroprusside (15 micrograms kg- 1, i. v.) caused a further reduction of pressure when Met enkephalin was added. Atropine (2 mg kg- 1) reduced the bradycardia but not the hypotensive response to Met enkephalin. Met enkephalin did not antagonize the vasopressor effect of exogenous noradrenaline (2 - 8 micrograms kg- 1, i. v.).

On the other hand, increases in plasma epinephrine, norepi-nephrine, and glucose levels induced by intracerebroventricular [D-Ala 2,Ar-Me-Phe 4,Gly 5 -ol]-enkephalin were significantly greater than those by [D-Ala 2,D-Leu 5]-enkephalin. Both enkephalins did not cause any responses in plasma renin activity, plasma vasopressin, and serum sodium and potassium concentrations. The sensitivity of the baroreceptor reflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity using a logistic model was enhanced by a subpressor dose of intracerebroventricular [i) -Ala 2,/V-Me-Phe 4,Gly 5 -ol]-enkephalin (10 pmol/kg) but not by [D-Ala 2,D-Leu 5]-enkephalin.

40|$|PURPOSE: Gradually {{progressing}} {{contraction of}} airway smooth muscle is suggested {{to be due}} to the Rho-kinase signaling pathway. In our preliminary study in rat tracheas, landiolol, a beta(1) -adrenoceptor antagonist, at high doses caused gradually progressing contraction, and this contraction reached a plateau after 20 min. Therefore, this study was carried out to clarify whether landiolol could stimulate the Rho-kinase pathway or the phosphatidylinositol (PI) response in the rat trachea. METHODS: Seventy-eight male Wistar rats weighing 250 - 350 g were used for the experiments. Their tracheas were cut into 3 -mm-wide ring segments or 1 -mm-wide slices. Measurements of isometric tension and [(3) H] inositol monophosphate (IP(1)) production were conducted, using these tracheal rings or slices. Data values are expressed as means +/- SD, and statistical significance (P < 0. 05) was determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Landiolol (700 microM) -induced contraction was completely inhibited by fasudil at 30 microM, while the landiolol-induced contraction was not inhibited by 4 -diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine <b>methobromide</b> (4 -DAMP), ketanserin, or nicardipine. Landiolol did not stimulate IP(1) production. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that high concentrations of landiolol could cause airway smooth muscle contraction through the Rho-kinase pathway, but not through the PI response coupled with muscarinic M(3) receptors, 5 -HT receptors or the activation of L-type Ca(2 +) channels...|$|E
40|$|In the {{preceding}} article (Levine and Pelikan, 1961) {{the influence of}} experimental procedures and dose on absorption of a quaternary agent, benzomethamine, was investigated and dis-cussed.

Therefore, in the present study, this environment was modified by addition of various agents, {{and the effects of}} these modifications on absorption of benzomethamine (N-diethylamino-ethyl-N’-methylbenzilamide <b>methobromide)</b> 3 were investigated. Among the agents used as additives were enzymes, polysaccharides and a basic protein. In earlier studies (Levine et at., 1955; Levine and Pelikan, 1961), polysaccharides obtained from intestinal mucous material and mucus itself were found to decrease the degree of absorption of benzomethamine. Any change in the mucoprotein and polysaccharide content of the gut, either de-creased by the action of the enzymes papain and mucinase, or increased by the addition of by-aluronic acid or chondroitin sulfate, might be ex-pected also to influence absorption. The effect of protamine, which combines with polysaccharides in vivo, might be expected to increase degree of absorption by tying up potential binding sites of the quaternary ion. A complex formed between a quaternary ion and an added anionic agent might interfere with other complex formation and fixation of the quaternary ion at anionic sites of This investigation {{was supported in part by}} research grants B 1966 and B 1967 from the Na...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the organization of}} corticothalamic projection in the auditory pathway, we examined {{the time course of}} Fos expression in medial geniculate body (MGB) neurons after chemical activation of the auditory cortex in cochlearablated Sprague–Dawley rats. The cochlea of pentobarbitalanesthetized rats were bilaterally removed and the animals were allowed to recover for 4 h (group I), 24 h (group II) or 7 days (group III). These rats were then anesthetized with pentobarbital again. The auditory cortex on one side was injected with bicuculline <b>methobromide</b> (20 mM), which activates cell bodies but not fibers of passage. At 1 h after this injection, the brain was processed for immunohistochemical expression of Fos protein. Neuronal activation was indicated by Fos expression in cell nuclei. In group-I rats, Fos expression was mainly restricted in the central region of the ventral nucleus of the MGB ipsilateral to the activated hemisphere and the medial nucleus of the MGB. In group-II and group-III rats, Fos expression was mainly located in the marginal zone, the dorsal and medial nuclei of the MGB ipsilateral to the activated hemisphere. The spatial distribution and the number of Fos-immunoreactive MGB neurons in group-III rats were larger than those of group II. Our results indicate that the corticofugal-induced neuronal excitability in the non-ventral MGB exhibits a different time course than that in the ventral MGB after cochlear ablation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Gluten exorphin B 5 (GE-B 5) is a food-derived opioid peptide {{identified}} in digests of wheat gluten. We have recently shown that GE-B 5 stimulates prolactin (PRL) secretion in rats; {{this effect is}} abolished by preadministration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. However, since the structure of naloxone allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and antagonize opioid effects centrally as well as peripherally, it could not established, {{on the basis of}} those data, if GE-B 5 -induced PRL release is exerted through sites located inside or outside the BBB. In this study, we sought to determine the site of action of GE-B 5 on PRL secretion, by pretreating male rats with naloxone <b>methobromide</b> (NMB), an opioid antagonist that does not cross the BBB. Four groups of rats were given the following treatments: 1) intravenous vehicle; 2) intravenous GE-B 5 (3 mg kg − 1 body weight); 3) intraperitoneal NMB (5 mg kg − 1 body weight), followed by vehicle; 4) NMB, followed by GE-B 5. Blood samples for PRL were taken at intervals for 40 minutes after vehicle or GE-B 5 administration. GE-B 5 stimulated PRL secretion; the effect was statistically significant at time 20. NMB preadministration completely abolished PRL response. Our experiment indicates that GE-B 5 stimulates PRL secretion through opioid receptors located outside the BBB. Since opioid peptides do not exert their effect on PRL secretion directly, but via a reduced dopaminergic tone, our data suggest that GE-B 5 can modify brain neurotransmitter release without crossing the BBB...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to characterize the subtype(s) of endothelial muscarinic receptor that mediate(s} endothelium-dependent relaxation and contraction in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Rings of SHR aorta with endothelium were suspended in organ baths for the measurement of isometric force. Ecothiopate (an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase) was present throughout the experiments. Endothelium-dependent contraction to acetylcholine was studied in quiescent aortic rings {{in the presence of}} N(G) -nitro-L-arginine (to prevent the formation of nitric oxide). Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was obtained during contraction to phenylephrine and in the presence of indomethacin (to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase activity). Responses to acetylcholine were assessed against the non-preferential muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, and the preferential antagonists pirenzepine (M 1), methoctramine (M 2) and 4 -diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine <b>methobromide</b> (4 -DAMP; M 3). The potency of acetylcholine in inducing endothelium-dependent contraction was 6. 54 ± 0. 07 (EC 50). Atropine, pirenzepine, methoctramine and 4 -DAMP displayed competitive antagonism towards the endothelium-dependent contraction to acetylcholine. The pA 2 values for these muscarinic receptor antagonists were estimated from Arunlakshana-Schild plots to be (log M) 9. 48 ± 0. 07, 6. 74 ± 0. 22, 6. 30 ± 0. 20 and 9. 3 ± 0. 22 respectively. The potency of acetylcholine in inducing endothelium-dependent relaxation was 7. 82 ± 0. 09 (IC 50). Atropine, pirenzepine and 4 -DAMP displayed competitive antagonism towards the endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine but methoctramine had no effect. The pA 2 values for atropine and 4 -DAMP for the relaxation to acetylcholine were estimated from Arunlakshana-Schild plots to be (log M) 9. 15 ± 0. 23 and 9. 63 ± 0. 28, respectively. These results suggest that the muscarinic M 3 receptor subtype mediates both endothelium-dependent relaxation and contraction to acetylcholine in SHR aorta. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effect of an increase or decrease in opioid activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on the onset of maternal behavior in rats. In Experiment 1, the latency to show maternal behavior toward foster rat pups (sensitization latency) was determined in maternally naive female rats given either nothing or a unilateral intra-VTA injection of morphine sulfate (MS) (0. 0, 0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 1 or 0. 3 µg), on {{the first three days}} of a 10 -day period of constant exposure to pups. Rats treated with 0. 03 µg MS had significantly shorter sensitization latencies than did rats treated with 0. 0 µg MS, 0. 01 µg MS, or receiving no treatment (higher doses of morphine produced intermediate results). The facilitating effect of intra-VTA MS on the onset of maternal behavior was blocked by pretreatment with naltrexone hydrochloride and was found to have a specific site of action in the VTA (MS injections dorsal to the VTA were ineffective). In Experiment 2, sensitization latencies were determined in periparturitional rats given a bilateral intra-VTA injection of either the opioid antagonist naltrexone <b>methobromide</b> (quaternary naltrexone), its vehicle, a sham injection, or left untreated 40 min after delivery of the last pup. The mothers' own pups were removed at delivery; mothers were nonmaternal at the time of testing. Quaternary naltrexone treatment produced significantly slower sensitization to foster pups than did control conditions. Total activity and pup-directed activity did not differ significantly with treatment. The results demonstrate that increased opioid activity in the VTA facilitates the onset of maternal behavior in inexperienced nonpregnant female rats, and decreased opioid activity in the VTA disrupts the rapid onset of maternal behavior at parturition...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the time course of}} Fos expression in medial geniculate body (MGB) neurons after chemical {{activation of the}} auditory cortex in cochlear-ablated Sprague-Dawley rats in the present study. The cochlea of ketamine-anesthetized rats were bilaterally removed and the animals were allowed to recover for 4 hrs (group I), 24 hrs (II), 7 days (III), 14 days (IV) and 30 days (V). The rats were then anesthetized with ketamine again. The auditory cortex on right side was injected with bicuculline <b>methobromide</b> (20 mM), which activates cell bodies but not fibers of passage. At 1 hr after this injection, the brain was processed for immunohistochemical expression of Fos protein. Neuronal activation was indicated by Fos expression in cell nuclei. In group-I rats, Fos expression was mainly restricted in the ventral nucleus and the medial nucleus of the MGB ipsilateral to the activated hemisphere. In group-II rats, Fos expression was detected in the ventral, medial and dorsal nuclei of the MGB ipsilateral to the activated hemisphere. In group-III rats, Fos expression was mainly located in the dorsal and medial nuclei, some in the marginal zone of the MGB, and clearly void in the ventral nucleus of the MGB. In group IV and V rats, Fos expressions were located in the nuclei of the MGB similar to group-III rats and clearly void in the ventral nucleus of the MGB. The Fos expressions were less intensive than the group-III rats. Our results indicate that the corticofugally-induced neuronal excitability in the non-lemniscal MGB exhibits a slower time course than that in the ventral MGB, suggesting that contributions of corticofugal modulation to neural plasticity and regeneration within the thalamus are different between the lemniscal and non-lemniscal MGB...|$|E
40|$|The time {{course and}} extent of the {{expression}} of Fos protein in neurons within the medial geniculate body (MGB) were examined after chemical activation of the auditory cortex in cochlearablated Sprague-Dawley rats. Surgical ablation of the bilateral cochlea was performed in ketamine-anesthetized animals which were then allowed to recover for 4 h (Group I), 24 h (II), 7 days (III), 14 days (IV), and 30 days (V). After each of these time points, the rats were again anesthetized with ketamine. The exposed auditory cortex {{on the right side}} was administered with GABA A antagonist biccuculline <b>methobromide</b> (20 m M), which in turn resulted in the activation of cells in the injected site. At 1 h after injection, the brain was processed for Fos immunostaining. Completeness of cochlea destruction was ascertained by post-mortem examination of the temporal bone. Control experiments were also conducted in cochlear-ablated animals without the injection of biccuculline. Neuronal activation was defined by Fos expression in cell nuclei. In Group-I rats, Fos labeling was mainly confined within the ventral and medial nuclei of the MGB ipsilateral to the activated hemisphere. In Group-II rats, Fos expression was found in the ventral, medial and dorsal nuclei of the MGB ipsilateral to the activated hemisphere. In Group-III rats, Fos expression was mainly located in the dorsal and medial nuclei, with some in the marginal zone of the MGB, but absent in the ventral nucleus of the MGB. In Groups-IV and V rats, the distribution of Fos-labeled neurons in the MGB was similar to that of Group-III rats but the Fos expression was less intense. We demonstrate that corticofugal induction of neuronal excitability in the non-lemniscal MGB shows a slower time course than in the lemniscal MGB, suggesting that these two areas of the auditory thalamus are differentially modulated by corticofugal pathways. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Saturable binding of (±) -[3 H]-baclofen and [3 H]-γ-aminobutyric acid ([3 H]-GABA) to rat brain crude {{synaptic}} membranes {{has been}} examined {{by means of}} a centrifugation assay. The binding of [3 H]-baclofen could be detected in fresh or previously frozen tissue and was dependent on the presence of physiological concentrations of Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + although a lower affinity Na+-dependent component could also be observed. Both components probably reflect binding to receptor recognition sites. The saturable portion of bound [3 H]-baclofen formed 20. 3 ± 6. 9 % of total bound ligand. This could be displaced by GABA (IC 50 = 0. 04 μm), (–) -baclofen (0. 04 μm) and to a much lesser extent by (+) -baclofen (33 μm). Isoguvacine, piperidine- 4 -sulphonic acid and bicuculline <b>methobromide</b> were inactive (up to 100 μm) and muscimol was only weakly active (IC 50 = 12. 3 μm). Saturable binding of [3 H]-GABA increased on adding CaCl 2 or MgSO 4 (up to 2. 5 Mm and 5. 0 Mm respectively) to the Tris-HCl incubation solution. This binding (GABAB site binding) was additional to the bicuculline-sensitive binding of GABA (GABAA site binding) and could be completely displaced by (–) -baclofen (IC 50 = 0. 13 μm). Increasing the Ca 2 + concentration (0 to 2. 5 Mm) increased the binding capacity of the membranes without changing their affinity for the ligand. The binding of [3 H]-GABA to GABAB sites could be demonstrated in fresh as well as previously frozen membranes with a doubling of the affinity being produced by freezing. Further incubation with the non-ionic detergent Triton-X- 100 (0. 05 % v/v) reduced the binding capacity by 50 %. The pharmacological profile of displacers of [3 H]-GABA from GABAB sites correlated well with that for [3 H]-baclofen displacement. A correlation with data previously obtained in isolated preparations of rat atria and mouse vas deferens was also apparent. It is concluded that [3 H]-baclofen or [3 H]-GABA are both ligands for the same bicuculline-insensitive, divalent cation-dependent binding sites in the rat brain...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} NO donors on Ca 2 +-dependent Cl− {{currents}} (ICl(Ca)) were investigated in freshly isolated cat tracheal myocytes using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. With nystatin-perforated whole-cell recording, carbachol (CCh, ≥ 1 μm) induced a transient inward current (ICCh) with a reversal potential of about - 20 mV. Activation of ICCh probably occurred through the M 3 muscarinic receptor, since nanomolar concentrations of 4 -diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine <b>methobromide</b> (4 -DAMP) greatly inhibited this current, while 11 -(2 -(diethylamino) methyl) - 1 -piperidinylacetyl) - 5, 11 -dihydro- 6 H-pyrido (2, 3 β) (1, 4) benzodiazepine- 6 -one (AF-DX 116) or pirenzepine at concentrations {{of up to}} 1 μm were almost ineffective. Chloride channel/transporter blockers such as DIDS (100 μm), anthracene- 9 -carboxylic acid (9 -AC, 100 μm) and niflumic acid (100 μm) greatly inhibited ICCh, but cation channel blockers, such as nifedipine (10 μm), Zn 2 + (500 μm) or Gd 3 + (500 μm), were without effect. Activation of ICCh was strongly attenuated by pretreatment with ryanodine (4 μm) plus caffeine (10 mM). Addition of neomycin (1 mM) into the bath or inclusion of heparin (3 mg ml− 1) in the pipette abolished {{a substantial part of}} ICCh. These results suggest that ICCh is ICl(Ca), which is activated by inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) -mediated Ca 2 + release. The nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) reduced the amplitude of ICCh dose dependently (IC 50, ≈ 10 μm). Similar inhibition was also exerted by other types of NO donor such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and (±) -E-methyl- 2 -(E-hydroxyimitol) - 5 -nitro- 6 -methoxy- 3 -hexeneamide (NO-R). SNAP-induced ICCh inhibition was effectively antagonized by Methylene Blue (1 - 100 nM), and mimicked by dibutyryl cGMP (db-cGMP) (0. 5 - 1 mM), whereas two structurally distinct types of cGMP-dependent (G) -kinase inhibitor, N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 5 -isoquinilinesulphonamide (H- 8, 2. 5 μm) and KT 5823 (1 μm), failed to counteract the inhibitory effects of SNAP or db-cGMP. Another G-kinase-specific inhibitor Rp- 8 -(para-chlorophenylthio) guanosine- 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp- 8 -pCPT-cGMPS; 1 μm) itself caused a marked reduction in ICCh. SNAP (100 μm) or db-cGMP (100 μm) exhibited no inhibitory actions, when caffeine (10 mM) or photolytically released IP 3 were used instead of CCh to activate the inward current. These results suggest that inhibition of ICCh by NO donors involves a cGMP-dependent but G-kinase-independent mechanism, which may operate at a site(s) between the muscarinic (M 3) and IP 3 receptors...|$|E
