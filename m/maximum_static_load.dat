40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{research}} on dynamic amplification factors (DAFs) caused by traffic loading from simply supported to continuous (highway and railway) bridges. DAF is defined here as the ratio of maximum total load effect to <b>maximum</b> <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect at a given section (mid-span). Another dynamic amplification factor FDAF {{can be defined as}} the ratio of the maximum total load effect throughout the entire bridge length to the <b>maximum</b> <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect at a given section (mid-span). For continuous beam DAF/FDAF can be determined for both sagging and hogging bending moments. Noticeable differences appear among DAF/FDAF of mid-span bending moment in a simply supported beam, DAF/FDAF of the mid-span bending moment in a continuous beam and the DAF/FDAF of the bending moment over the internal support in a continuous beam. Three span lengths are tested in the simply supported beam models as well as three continuous beams made of two equal spans. Each model is subjected to a moving constant point load that travels at different velocities. The location of the maximum total moment varies depending on the speed. FDAF and DAF are plotted versus frequency ratio. The results showed that FDAF is often greater than DAF in simply supported and continuous beams. Also, FDAF of sagging bending moment in continuous beam is about 12 % greater than that the simply supported case. Moreover, the results showed that FDAF of hogging bending moments is about 3 % greater than those of sagging bending moments in continuous beam. Consequently, all values were larger than those of simply supported case...|$|E

However, {{the development of}} high speed machinery and the iraportance of sound transmission through structures make it desirable to evaluate the transmissibility of machinery mountings above their natural frequency.

40|$|Bridge codes adopt {{values for}} dynamic {{allowance}} in traffic load models that are necessarily conservative {{to cover for}} an entire range of bridges with different mechanical characteristics, boundary conditions, and {{the large number of}} uncertainties associated to the vehicle-bridge interaction problem. A further level of conservatism occurs due to the independent manner in which the governing <b>static</b> <b>load</b> and the corresponding allowance for dynamics are specified. In particular, certain bridges are not susceptible to high levels of vehicle-bridge interaction when loaded by a critically heavy vehicle or a critical combination of vehicles. Recent advances in Bridge Weigh-In-Motion technology allow not only to collect information on the weights, spacings and speeds of the traffic loads traversing a bridge, but also to separate the <b>maximum</b> <b>static</b> strain from the total measured strain using a filtering procedure. In this paper, <b>maximum</b> <b>static</b> and total <b>load</b> effects are collected and analysed for three different sites as part of the European project ARCHES (6 th RTD framework programme). Bridge measurements are used to discuss the dynamics of the most frequent truck classes and the entire traffic sample.

40|$|A {{kinematic}} {{study of}} a helicopter main rotor control system is carried out to investigate loads in servo actuators and non-rotating scissors during high speed and high load factors maneuvers. The kinematic model is then used to optimize the servo-actuators placement and pre-inclination {{in order to minimize}} static and dynamic loads in the three servo-actuators and in the non-rotating scissors. The inputs for the model (blade pitch link loads and pilot input to trim the aircraft) are taken from flight tests measurements, current rotor computations being unable to predict blade root torsion moments vs azimuth with enough accuracy. The analysis is based on X 3 demonstrator flight tests, which showed high control system loads that used to reduce flight envelope during the first flight test campaign. Flight tests measurements are used to validate the kinematic model used for the optimization. Computations made for X 3 case at 220 kts showed a reduction of 40 % of <b>maximum</b> <b>static</b> <b>load</b> and 45 % of maximum dynamic load on servo-actuators compared to the initial placement of the servo actuators. With appropriate servo actuators pre-inclination, dynamic loads in the non-rotating scissors are decreased by 95 % at high speed trim flight.

The optimization algorithm presented in this paper can be used for conventional helicopters to reduce loads in the control system and then limit command reinjection because of control system flexibility, and on compound helicopters to expand the flight envelope and to remove control system loads as the first limit factors at high speed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There {{are several}} {{numerical}} investigations on bone remodelling after {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) {{on the basis of}} the finite element analysis (FEA). For such computations certain boundary conditions have to be defined. The authors chose a <b>maximum</b> of three <b>static</b> <b>load</b> situations, usually taken from the gait cycle because this is the most frequent dynamic activity of a patient after THA. Materials and methods The numerical study presented here investigates whether it is useful to consider only one <b>static</b> <b>load</b> situation of the gait cycle in the FE calculation of the bone remodelling. For this purpose, 5 different loading cases were examined in order to determine their influence on the change in the physiological load distribution within the femur and on the resulting strain-adaptive bone remodelling. First, four different <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> cases at 25 %, 45 %, 65 % and 85 % of the gait cycle, respectively, and then the whole gait cycle in a loading regime were examined in order to regard all the different loadings of the cycle in the simulation. Results The computed evolution of the apparent bone density (ABD) and the calculated mass losses in the periprosthetic femur show that the simulation results are highly dependent on the chosen boundary conditions. Conclusion These numerical investigations prove that a <b>static</b> <b>load</b> situation is insufficient for representing the whole gait cycle. This causes severe deviations in the FE calculation of the bone remodelling. However, accompanying clinical examinations are necessary to calibrate the bone adaptation law and thus to validate the FE calculations. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{traditionally}} investigate {{the strength of}} marine structures, the structure is subjected to a <b>maximum</b> <b>static</b> <b>load.</b> However, the marine structures are usually suffering environmental forces varying with time. Wave forces {{are the most important}} time dependent loading that causes fatigue in structural elements and joints. In this paper different methods base on S-N curve and linear elastic failure mechanics are presented. The governing equations and theories that are used in each method are expressed and the application of each method will be discussed. The two main methods of deterministic analyses are: stress-based approach (S-N curve approach) and linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) approaches. These approaches are applicable to different analyzing strategies, ie the first approach is used for cases in which general form of fatigue is dominant, but the latter involves the calculations of reliability as functions of crack geometry and its boundary conditions. The SPD 12 C jacket platform in South Pars Oil Field is also modeled as a case study and the results of fatigue reliability analysis are presented. In this paper a comprehensive method is presented to accurately predict the reliability of offshore platforms. This method is based on S-N curve and the results are compared with the fatigue life of joints. Due to nonlinear interaction of soil and piles and the other affecting parameters such as flexibility of joints, non Gaussian procedure of loading, and nonlinearity of reaction force, the precise analyzing of stress levels will be impossible and a complex numerical analysis could only give limited information about the statistical properties of stress. In order to perform the fatigue analysis and predicting the cycles of stress SACS was used which is known as a powerful software in designing and analyzing offshore structures [1]. In this paper the whole structure was modeled subjected to different forces such as wave and sea currents. The effects of parameters such as marine growth and interaction of soil and piles are also included. The latter is shown to {{have a significant effect on}} determination of fatigue life of the platform...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of surface}} {{floating}} dredgers in deep inland reservoirs and continental shelves, either for dredging or mining purposes, is restricted by several operational limitations. Use of smaller surface floating dredgers in deep inland reservoirs is {{constrained by the}} ladder (a long truss like structure 'arm' that supports the excavation tool) length. Bigger dredgers have operational restrictions and mobilization problems. In shelf areas, the dredging operation is less precise due to currents, winds and waves. The floating pipelines, floats and winch wires are obstacles to navigational paths for other surface vessels. High investment costs {{are involved in the}} construction of bigger high capacity dredgers. It is difficult to modify such systems once they are constructed. The limitation of the existing technology served as the main motivation to design an active legged submersible dredger / miner, which is described in this thesis. The designed vehicle is named the 'Golden Tortoise' because it simulates the belly crawling motion of a tortoise or turtle. A full scale prototype vehicle was manufactured by Excavation & Equipment Manufacturing (P) Ltd., (EEM (P) Ltd.) India. The prototype vehicle is suitable for operation in deep inland reservoirs up to a depth of 50 m and is designed to excavate sand, silt or clay mixtures in various proportions. [...] Parametric performance models were developed to evaluate the locomotion, excavation and transportation processes of the designed vehicle. Periodic gait plans were developed for straight line and curvilinear locomotion on natural terrain. Experimental validation of the theoretical gait plans was performed, which showed that the average slip was about 20 % at the foot/soil interface in medium to relatively fine sands. Parametric models were developed for the evaluation of the locomotion cycle time of the designed vehicle. The locomotion cycle time was also measured from the gait plan tests and was found to be an average of 30 seconds. The static load incident at each foot {{as a function of the}} vehicle weight and the leg joint parameters was predicted by developing a two-dimensional model based on simple beam theory. Prototype tests were performed to measure the static load incident at each foot as a function of the leg swing angle. The <b>maximum</b> <b>static</b> <b>load</b> measured due to weight of the vehicle was approximately 13 kN. The subsequent soil settlement and failure were estimated based on the theories of elasticity and plastic equilibrium as well as the shallow foundation theories. The dynamic load as a function of the leg actuating hydraulic cylinders was also considered for predicting the soil response. Comparisons between the different performance parameters of tracked vehicles and the designed legged vehicle were made. The shear stress-shear displacement relationship for different types of terrain was considered to predict the traction available for each foot during locomotion under different slip conditions. It was observed that the foot with grousers (lugs or teeth underneath the foot) provided more tractive effort compared to a tracked vehicle of similar dimensions and weight in cohesive soils. [...] Parametric performance models for the designed excavation system were developed based on the theories of earth moving machinery and their dynamics. The performance of the designed excavation system was evaluated based on the excavation production, spillage generated and the excavation power required under varying operational and soil conditions. [...] Parametric models were developed for evaluation of the designed pump-pipeline system by integrating the two-phase flow theories developed by various previous researchers. The models predict the total head loss in the pipeline system and hence the required pump power and also the limiting settling velocity condition and thereby the chances of pipeline blockage. In the present design this means that the suitable pipeline diameter is between 0. 15 to 0. 3 m to achieve a production of 61 m³/hr with a maximum volumetric concentration of 18 %. The mean mixture velocity in the pipeline should vary between 2 to 5 m/sec to achieve the desired production and avoid pipeline blockage. A conceptual model was developed showing the complex interrelationships existing between the dredging and locomotion processes. [...] The results from this thesis can now be used to design the requisite controllers for the automatic operation of the 'Golden Tortoise'...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} calcium oxide on the {{crushing}} strength, reduction, and smelting performance of high-chromium vanadium–titanium magnetite pellets (HCVTMP) was studied in this work. The main characterization methods of an electronic {{universal testing machine}} (EUTM), X-ray fluorescent (XRF), inductively-coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope-energy disperse spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) were employed. The crushing strength was affected by the mineral phases generated during oxidative baking and the subsequently-formed pellet microstructures owing to CaO addition. The reduction and smelting properties of HCVTMP with different CaO additives were measured and characterized with different softening-melting-dripping indices. Although HCVTMP showed the highest crushing strength with CaO addition of ca. 2 wt %, more CaO addition {{may be needed to}} achieve high permeability of the furnace burdens and a good separation condition of the slag and melted iron. In the formation process of the slag and melted iron, it can be determined that CaO could have a relationship with the transformation behavior of Cr, V, and Ti to some extent, with respect to the predominant chemical composition analysis of ICP-AES and XRF. With the microscopic examination, the restraining formation of Ti(C,N) and the promoting formation of CaTiO 3 are in accordance with the improved melting-dripping indices, including the decrease of the <b>maximum</b> external <b>static</b> <b>load</b> and gas permeability, and the increase of the melting-dripping zone and dripping difficulty...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{component}} of bridge traffic loading is commonly {{taken into account}} with a Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) – the ratio between the <b>maximum</b> dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effects on a bridge. In the design codes, this factor is generally higher than in reality. While this is fine for new bridges that must account for various risks during their life-time, it imposes unnecessary conservativism into assessment of the existing well defined bridges. Therefore, analysis of existing bridges should apply more realistic DAF values. One way of obtaining them experimentally is by bridge weigh-in-motion (B-WIM) measurements, which use an existing instrumented bridge or culvert to weigh all crossing vehicles at highway speeds. The B-WIM system had been equipped with two methods of obtaining an approximation to the static response of the. The first method uses the sum of influence lines. This method relies on accurate axle identification, the failure of which can have a large influence on the DAF value. The other method uses a pre-determined low-pass filter to remove the dynamic {{component of}} the measured signal; however an expert is needed to set the filter parameters. A new approach that tries to eliminate these two drawbacks has been developed. In this approach the parameters for the filter are determined automatically by fitting the filtered response to {{the sum of the}} influence lines. The measurement of DAF on a typical bridge site agrees with experiments performed in the ARCHES [1] project: dynamic amplification decreases as <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> increases...|$|R
40|$|Critical <b>static</b> bridge <b>loading</b> {{scenarios}} are often {{expressed in terms}} of the number of vehicles that are present on the bridge at the time of occurrence of maximum lifetime load effect. For example, 1 -truck, 2 -truck, 3 -truck or 4 -truck events usually govern the critical <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> cases in short and medium span bridges. However, the dynamic increment of load effect associated with these <b>maximum</b> <b>static</b> events may be assessed inaccurately if it is calculated in isolation of the rest of the traffic flow. In other words, a heavy vehicle preceding a critical loading case causes the bridge initial conditions of displacement and acceleration to be non zero when the critical combination of traffic arrives on the bridge. Failure to consider these pre-existing vibrations will result in inaccurate estimation of dynamic amplification.

Because the specific gravities of the materials {{used in this study}} were higher than the lower limit values, the short-term allowable lateral resistance was adjusted to the actual specific gravities. The resultant short-term allowable resistance was 494  N, 74  % of 667  N [9]. As a result, one-third, two-thirds and three-thirds of the control maximum load corresponded to 0.68, 1.36 and 2.03 times the short-term allowable lateral resistance adjusted to the actual specific gravities of the materials. In this study, the rounded average maximum load was adopted as the control value with no conservative estimation. This was due to the consideration that an underestimation of the input forces would result in an overestimation of the dynamic resistance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{shows the}} process of the virtual {{production}} development of the mechanical connection between the top leaf of a dual composite leaf spring system to a shackle using finite element methods. The commercial FEA package MSC/MARC has been used for the analysis. In the original design the joint was based on a closed eye-end. Full scale testing results showed that this configuration achieved the vertical proof load of 150 kN and 1 million cycles of fatigue load. However, a problem with delamination occurred at the interface between the fibres going around the eye and the main leaf body. To overcome this problem, a second design was tried using transverse bandages of woven glass fibre reinforced tape to wrap the section that is prone to delaminate. In this case, the maximum interlaminar shear stress was reduced by a certain amount but it was still higher than the material’s shear strength. Based on the fact that, even with delamination, the top leaf spring still sustained the <b>maximum</b> <b>static</b> and fatigue <b>loads</b> required, the third design was proposed with an open eye-end, eliminating altogether the interface where the maximum shear stress occurs. The maximum shear stress predicted by FEA is reduced significantly and a safety factor of around 2 has been obtained. Thus, a successful and safe design has been achieved. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of bridge lifetime load {{effect is a}} complex problem. Usually, statistical extrapolation of simulated <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect is used to derive a lifetime characteristic <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect. In reality, when a vehicle crosses a bridge, dynamic interaction occurs which often causes a greater total load effect. This total load effect {{is related to the}} <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect through a dynamic amplification factor (DAF). Often the worst estimated DAF is applied to the lifetime <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect to obtain a total lifetime characteristic load effect. This does not allow for the reduced probabilities of both high <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> and high dynamic interaction. The authors present an approach that accounts for this reduced probability by using multivariate extreme value theory, in conjunction with extensive static simulations and 3 -D finite element bridge-truck dynamic interaction models.

Engineering practice suggests that the key of <b>static</b> <b>load</b> test lies in the avoidance of pile eccentric compression, the precise control of pile driving pressure, and accurate measurement of vertical deformation of the pile by dial indicator, especially for minor diameter plain concrete piles. Therefore, this paper made an improvement in the traditional <b>static</b> <b>load</b> test device, developed an installation technology of the pile head treatment device for vertical <b>static</b> <b>load</b> test of minor diameter rigid embankment pile regarding the special-shaped pile, and introduced the technology in terms of technical principles, scope of application, technical features, construction technique and operating points...|$|R

The programmable device defines P control law interval time in {{dependence on the}} <b>static</b> <b>load</b> level of the system. The <b>static</b> <b>load</b> current estimation is performed by the designed Luenberger observer. The derived <b>static</b> <b>load</b> current signal is suitable {{for use in the}} P control law interval time definition device. The input-output dependence of the programmable device is developed ensuring optimal dynamical quality of the velocity control system independently on the <b>static</b> <b>load</b> conditions. The presented simulations results of the velocity control system using programmable variable structure controller coincide with analogical results obtained applying Fuzzy logic based variable structure controller...|$|R

However, these <b>static</b> <b>load</b> conditions could not represent all the severe situations of automobile parts which subjected to complex loads varying with time, especially for lower control arm of front suspension. In this study, dynamic optimization of lower control arm was performed by combing traditional <b>static</b> <b>load</b> optimization techniques and multi-body dynamics by Equivalent <b>Static</b> <b>Load</b> (ESL). And the best draw-bead distribution of the stamped lower control arm was attained. Comparing the MBD analysis results of the new design derived from dynamic optimization and original structure, results show that the strength and stiffness was increased significantly while the mass was almost unchanged...|$|R

If XC {{is not considered}} separately, the power factor of <b>static</b> <b>load</b> may become abnormal and the calculation results become unreasonable. In order to separate XC from the <b>static</b> <b>load,</b> additional condition is required. To ensure normal power factor for the <b>static</b> <b>load,</b> {{it is assumed that}} the power factor cosφ is known. As B/G[*]=[*]tanφ, the relationship between G and B is thus known and XC can be determined once G and B are obtained.|$|R
