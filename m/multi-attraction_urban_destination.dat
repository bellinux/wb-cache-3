40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} thesis {{has been defined as}} the development and presentation of a model designed to show transparency of different effects of tourism in <b>urban</b> <b>destinations</b> and its practical application by destination management organizations. The resident sub-model was compiled, based on research in the selected destination as well as its statistical evaluation. This sub-model clearly demonstrates relationships that affect tourism. This decision model was focused on the socio-economic effects, primarily generated by residents, which influence tourists and basically tourism in <b>urban</b> <b>destinations.</b> The resident sub-model was subsequently incorporated into another decision model of the sustainable destination to show the resident influence on objective economic factors generated by tourism in <b>urban</b> <b>destinations.</b> These two models clearly illustrate how complicated system is the behaviour of residents and which significant negative / positive effects on tourism can generate. For the development of this solution system thinking was used as the main methodological approach. System thinking has been actually rarely used, but it is very effective method, because it can reveal complexity of diverse relationships and find possibilities how to influence and control these relationships; in this case by destination management organizations. This solution is intended primarily for these tourism institutions. This method was intentionally simplified to be applicable by the local organizations. However, it retains high level of efficiency, which can bring required objectivity in very subjective relationships between residents, tourist and basically tourism at <b>urban</b> <b>destinations...</b>|$|R

It also explores the interrelationship between restorative and aesthetic qualities in nature-based and <b>urban</b> <b>destinations.</b> Associations between destination aesthetic qualities (Locale Characteristics, Scope, Upkeep, Accord, Perceived Age, and Shape) and restorative qualities (Compatibility, Extent, Mentally Away, Physically Away, Discord, and Fascination) were estimated by canonical correlation analysis. In nature-based destinations, the results illuminate the criticality of experiential characteristics of nature aesthetics to perceived destination restorative qualities and of fascination to destination aesthetic qualities. In <b>urban</b> <b>destinations,</b> findings indicate the importance of experiential characteristics of destinations and compatibility of tourists' needs and predispositions to vacation destination characteristics.

40|$|The {{complexities}} of cities as spaces {{lead to the}} difficulties in understanding the spatial behavior of tourists within cities. Mapping and modelling of tourists’ spatial activity is viewed by many researchers as an under researched field in which much progress is still needed. The advancement of tracking technologies development offers an opportunity to further and expand the nature of understanding the tourist particularly in <b>urban</b> <b>destination.</b> Understanding of this phenomenon may also allow planners and tourism managers to make decisions and to address tourism development in a well-versed manner. The rapid advancement and availability of small, cheap and reliable tracking devices drawing on GPS technology is assisting researchers to develop new methods of spatial research. From this point of view, tourism is mainly a geographic activity. Most of the information needed in tourism planning is spatial, indicating where and how extensive the tourism resources are, how intensively the resources are used and so on. Basically, different methods can be employed to utilize the collected spatial data. However, the most basic method is to present the collected information on a map. The tracks collected from tourists using advanced tracking technologies can be further used to calculate many different variables that describe the spatial activity of tourist particularly in <b>urban</b> <b>destination.</b> This paper aims to capture the new methodological approaches which can help to explain different modes of behavior in <b>urban</b> <b>destination</b> versus traditional approaches. In this context, advanced tracking technologies were seen as the best tool {{in order to give}} both actual and detailed insight into people’s individual and collective travel behavior...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} set on the context of tourism {{marketing}} and it investigates the concept of segmentation as an important tool {{in the management of}} <b>urban</b> tourism <b>destinations.</b> Segmentation presumes the existence of heterogeneity among customers in the market, and has received considerable support within the tourism literature while urban tourism has been the object of intensive research for several years. Based on a quantitative research, the present study, aims to provide a deeper insight into the typology of tourists visiting Romanian <b>urban</b> tourism <b>destinations,</b> with a focus on the city of Brasov. The survey reveals that the studied sample can be grouped into different clusters according to their socio-demographic and travel characteristics. As the results demonstrate that each of the identified tourists segments has different profiles, the implications for destination management are discussed. Recommendations are also highlighted in order to assist destination managers to formulate marketing strategies adapted to the different market segments, aiming to better position Brasov as an <b>urban</b> <b>destination</b> on the competitive national and international market...|$|R

While positive impacts largely fell into the social domain, the negative ones were more often associated with the environment. Residents' gaming behavior had significant effects on their level of support of the activity. Direct positive relationships were identified between residents' attachment to the community and their level of support. Moreover, power relations were found to be strongly embedded in community perceptions of gaming impacts.

40|$|In {{the urban}} {{transportation}} field, planners and engineers have explored {{the relationship between}} <b>urban</b> <b>destinations</b> and travel behavior {{for more than half}} a century. However, we still have only a preliminary understanding about how the spatial arrangement of different types of <b>urban</b> activity <b>destinations</b> influence human travel, and how urban development policies influence travel patterns. Recent developments in urban sensing and cell phone technologies have enabled spatially-detailed and massive GIS-based datasets on land use, points of interest (POIs), cell phone and GPS-based tracking, etc. These new datasets provide rich possibilities for better understanding and modeling of urban activity patterns and travel behavior. In this study, we utilize such spatially-detailed data—POI data and large-scale travel tracker data—to explore the link between <b>urban</b> activity <b>destinations</b> and human travel patterns. First, we employ the timely and large-scale urban activity-based travel survey for the Chicago Metropolitan Area, implemented from January 2007 to February 2008 (Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning 2008). We derive travel patterns for both commute and non-commute activities in the Chicago Metropolitan Area for individuals and groups of individuals with various socioeconomic characteristics. The Chicago activity-based travel survey includes 10, 552 households (23, 452 individuals) who participated in either a one-day or two-day survey, providing detailed travel information for each household member for a particular assigned travel day(s). Second, we combine a spatially-detailed business establishment dataset (the InfoUSA 2008 data) included in the ESRI Business Analyst Package (ESRI 2009) and the employment data in the U. S. census to analyze the spatial distribution of <b>urban</b> activity <b>destinations</b> in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. Finally, we examine the linkage between these two aspects, and demonstrate the impacts of spatial arrangement of <b>urban</b> activity <b>destinations</b> on human travel patterns in the urban settings. This new study is crucial to understanding how the spatial patterns of <b>urban</b> activity <b>destinations</b> influence individuals’ and groups of individuals’ travel patterns at both individual and aggregated level. It is also important for policy making in the fields of urban development and transportation planning. URL to abstract on conference site. You have to be a conference participant to access papers.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{academic}} and practitioner literature on <b>urban</b> <b>destination</b> marketing, suggesting that it contains within it a dominant paradigm which the author characterises as 'the theory of marketing competitive advantage'. As such, this theory requires towns and cities to differentiate themselves through the provision of unique products, based on which they subsequently undertake branding, market positioning, distribution and other activities through bespoke destination marketing organisations (DMOs). Practice is then contrasted with theory by reference to a discordant strad of the literature {{as well as the}} actual destination marketing currently being undertaken in 60 European towns and cities. The theory of marketing competitive advantage is shown to be an ideal which rarely translates into practice. Irrespective of whether or not a town or city possesses competitive advantage, DMO destination marketing gravitates almost inexorably towards a 'marketing of everything'. Such an approach, in turn, reduces to a bland and monolithic 'theming of urban sameness', all of which is diametrically opposite to what one would expect to be the case as per the theory of marketing competitive advantage. The author contends that this gap between theory and practice matters, necessitating a rethinking of how academics and practitioners should in future seek to explain or otherwise account for <b>urban</b> <b>destination</b> marketing...|$|R

The thesis reviews the use of service quality and customer satisfaction measures in urban tourism and urban public transport, highlighting dimensions of urban public transport quality which may be of particular relevance to overseas visitors at <b>urban</b> <b>destinations.</b> The results of a survey of overseas visitors to Greater Manchester, employing both quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques, are subsequently presented, identifying factors affecting the use of public transport by overseas visitors to Greater Manchester. Attributes of public transport service quality, revealed by the research to be of importance in measuring overseas visitors’ satisfaction with urban public transport performance in Greater Manchester, are reduced by means of principal components analysis to reveal the underlying dimensions of overseas visitors’ satisfaction with Manchester’s public transport system. An ensuing regression analysis reveals the relationships between the dimensions of public transport performance, overall satisfaction with public transport and satisfaction with Manchester as a visitor destination. Additionally, an importance-performance analysis is employed to uncover {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} public transport service in Manchester from an overseas visitor perspective.
