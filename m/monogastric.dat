5|$|Equines are <b>monogastric</b> hindgut fermenters. They {{prefer to}} eat grasses and sedges, {{but may also}} consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits and roots if their favored foods are scarce, {{particularly}} asses. Compared to ruminants, equines have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like cecum. where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants; 30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for a cow. Equines may spend 60-80 {{percent of their time}} feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.|$|E
25|$|In human beings, phytoestrogens {{are readily}} absorbed, {{circulate}} in plasma and are excreted in the urine. Metabolic influence {{is different from}} that of grazing animals due to the differences between ruminant versus <b>monogastric</b> digestive systems.|$|E
25|$|A {{fraction}} of the maize feedstock dry matter used for ethanol production is usefully recovered as DDGS (dried distillers grains with solubles). In the 2010/2011 marketing year, about 29.1 million tonnes of DDGS were fed to US livestock and poultry. Because starch utilization in fermentation for ethanol production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue, the feed value per kg of DDGS, with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein, exceeds that of the grain. Feed value for <b>monogastric</b> animals, such as swine and poultry, is somewhat lower than for ruminants.|$|E
25|$|Grassland based {{livestock}} production relies upon plant material such as shrubland, rangeland, and pastures for feeding ruminant animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned {{directly to the}} grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists. Mixed production systems use grassland, fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and <b>monogastric</b> (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} soluble carbohydrates {{of mature}} soybeans are the disaccharide sucrose (range 2.5–8.2%), the trisaccharide raffinose (0.1–1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of galactose, and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose. While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect {{the viability of}} the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars, so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other <b>monogastric</b> animals, comparable to the disaccharide trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.|$|E
25|$|The {{cottonseed}} {{which remains}} after the cotton is ginned {{is used to}} produce cottonseed oil, which, after refining, can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil. The cottonseed meal that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock; the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to <b>monogastric</b> animals. Cottonseed hulls {{can be added to}} dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found {{in all parts of the}} cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.|$|E
2500|$|For human consumption, {{soybeans}} must {{be cooked}} with [...] "wet" [...] heat {{to destroy the}} trypsin inhibitors (serine protease inhibitors). Raw soybeans, including the immature green form, are toxic to all <b>monogastric</b> animals.|$|E
2500|$|In Spain, a {{seed mixture}} known as comuña {{consisting}} of Lathyrus sativus, L. cicera, Vicia sativa and V. ervilia provides a potent mixture of toxic amino acids to poison <b>monogastric</b> (single stomached) animals. Particularly the toxin beta-cyanoalanine from seeds of V. sativa enhances the toxicity {{of such a}} mixture through its inhibition of sulfur amino acid metabolism [...] and hence depletion of protective reduced thiols. Its use for sheep does not pose any lathyrism problems if doses do not exceed 50 percent of the ration.|$|E
2500|$|The abomasum is {{the fourth}} and final stomach {{compartment}} in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a <b>monogastric</b> stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here {{in much the same}} way. It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine. [...] Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine.|$|E
50|$|The {{types of}} farm animals, {{as well as}} the food they supply can be put into two categories: <b>monogastric</b> and {{ruminant}}. Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; <b>monogastric,</b> or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the <b>monogastric</b> types, therefore, yield less emissions. This {{is due to the fact}} that these types of animals have a higher feed-conversion efficiency, and also do not produce any methane.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>monogastric</b> {{organism}} has {{a simple}} single-chambered stomach, {{compared with a}} ruminant organism, like a cow, goat, or sheep, which has a four-chambered complex stomach. Examples of <b>monogastric</b> animals include omnivores such as humans, rats, dogs and pigs, carnivores such as cats, and herbivores such as horses and rabbits. [...] Herbivores with <b>monogastric</b> digestion can digest cellulose in their diets by way of symbiotic gut bacteria. However, their ability to extract energy from cellulose digestion is less efficient than in ruminants.|$|E

50|$|<b>Monogastric</b> herbivores, such as rhinoceroses, horses, and rabbits, are not ruminants, as {{they have}} a simple single-chambered stomach. These hindgut fermenters digest {{cellulose}} in an enlarged cecum through the reingestion of the cecotrope.|$|E
5000|$|For human consumption, {{soybeans}} must {{be cooked}} with [...] "wet" [...] heat {{to destroy the}} trypsin inhibitors (serine protease inhibitors). Raw soybeans, including the immature green form, are toxic to all <b>monogastric</b> animals.|$|E
5000|$|Genes from Clostridium thermocellum {{have been}} {{inserted}} into transgenic mice {{to allow the}} production of endoglucanase. The experiment was intended {{to learn more about}} how the digestive capacity of <b>monogastric</b> animals could be improved.|$|E
50|$|In human beings, phytoestrogens {{are readily}} absorbed, {{circulate}} in plasma and are excreted in the urine. Metabolic influence {{is different from}} that of grazing animals due to the differences between ruminant versus <b>monogastric</b> digestive systems.|$|E
5000|$|Hindgut fermenters {{generally}} have a cecum and large intestine {{that are much}} larger and more complex than those of a foregut or midgut fermenter. Research on small cecum fermenters such as flying squirrels, rabbits and lemurs has revealed these mammals to have a GI tract about 10-13 times the length of their body. [...] This {{is due to the}} high intake of fiber and other hard to digest compounds that are characteristic to the diet of <b>monogastric</b> herbivores. Unlike in foregut fermenters, the cecum is located after the stomach and small intestine in <b>monogastric</b> animals, which limits the amount of further digestion or absorption that can occur after the food is fermented.|$|E
50|$|The {{grain of}} quality protein maize (QPM) {{varieties}} contains {{nearly twice as}} much lysine and tryptophan, amino acids that are essential for humans and <b>monogastric</b> animals. QPM {{is a product of}} conventional plant breeding (i.e., it is not genetically modified) and an example of biofortification.|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolite}} unguinol, produced uniuquely by A. unguis, is {{a growth}} promotor specific to <b>monogastric</b> {{animals such as}} chickens. It also been investigated as a potential herbicide due to its ability to selectively inhibit pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (PPDK), a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis and photosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|The abomasum's normal {{anatomical}} {{location is}} along ventral midline. It is a secretory stomach similar in anatomy and {{function as the}} <b>monogastric</b> stomach. It serves primarily in the acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine.|$|E
5000|$|Ruminant {{animals are}} those that have a rumen. A rumen is a multichambered stomach found almost {{exclusively}} among some artiodactyl mammals, such cattle, deer, and camels, enabling them to eat cellulose-enhanced tough plants and grains that <b>monogastric</b> (i.e., [...] "single-chambered stomached") animals, such as humans, dogs, and cats, cannot digest.|$|E
5000|$|Bone meal, {{along with}} a variety of other meals, {{especially}} meat meal, is used as a dietary/mineral supplement for livestock. It is used to feed <b>monogastric</b> animals with bone meal from ruminants, and vice versa, {{to prevent the spread of}} bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or [...] "mad cow disease". Proper heat control can reduce salmonella contaminants.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} widely used as a fodder for livestock, due to its high protein and energy content. Lupins contain high levels of {{fermentable}} carbohydrates {{and low levels of}} starch and are, therefore, an adequate ruminant feed. But lupins are a valuable feed for <b>monogastric</b> animals as well, because of the high digestibility of the lupin nitrogen and the low level of protease inhibitors.|$|E
5000|$|When {{food has}} been {{degraded}} efficiently it passes from the reticulorumen through the reticulo-omasal orifice to the omasum {{followed by the}} abomasum to continue the digestion process in the lower parts of the alimentary canal. No enzymes are secreted in the rumen. Enzymes and hydrochloric acid are only secreted from the Abomasum (fourth stomach) onwards, and ruminants function from that point onwards much like <b>monogastric</b> animals, such as pigs and humans ...|$|E
50|$|After this, the digesta {{is moved}} to the true stomach, the abomasum. The abomasum is the direct {{equivalent}} of the <b>monogastric</b> stomach, and digesta is digested here {{in much the same}} way. Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulorumen are also digested in the small intestine. Fermentation continues in the large intestine {{in the same way as}} in the reticulorumen.|$|E
50|$|Humans {{and other}} <b>monogastric</b> animals (pigs and poultry) {{do not possess}} the α-GAL enzyme to break down RFOs and these {{oligosaccharides}} pass undigested through the stomach and upper intestine. In the lower intestine, they are fermented by gas-producing bacteria that do possess the α-GAL enzyme and make carbon dioxide, methane or hydrogen—leading to the flatulence commonly associated with eating beans and other vegetables. α-GAL is present in digestive aids such as the product Beano.|$|E
50|$|The {{digestive}} {{physiology of}} a very young kid (like the young of other ruminants) {{is essentially the same}} as that of a <b>monogastric</b> animal. Milk digestion begins in the abomasum, the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticuloesophageal groove during suckling. At birth, the rumen is undeveloped, but as the kid begins to consume solid feed, the rumen soon increases in size and in its capacity to absorb nutrients.|$|E
50|$|A <b>monogastric</b> {{digestive}} system works {{as soon as}} the food enters the mouth. Saliva moistens the food and begins the digestive process. After being swallowed, the food passes from the esophagus into the stomach, where stomach acid and enzymes help to break down the food. Bile salts stored in the gall bladder empty the contents of the stomach into the small intestines where most fats are broken down. The pancreas secretes enzymes and alkali to neutralize the stomach acid.|$|E
50|$|Phytase is {{produced}} by bacteria found in the gut of ruminant animals (cattle, sheep) {{making it possible for}} them to use the phytic acid found in grains as a source of phosphorus. Non-ruminants (<b>monogastric</b> animals) like human beings, dogs, birds, etc. do not produce phytase. Research in the field of animal nutrition has put forth the idea of supplementing feed with phytase so as to make available to the animal phytate-bound nutrients like calcium, phosphorus, other minerals, carbohydrates, and proteins.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of phosphorus digestion and metabolism differ substantially between ruminant and non-ruminant (<b>monogastric)</b> species. In pigs, most phosphorus is absorbed {{from the small}} intestine -jejunum, duodenum- {{in the form of}} ortho-phosphate where its solubility is greatest. The phosphorus is then transported across the gut wall. The kidney plays the major regulatory role in controlling phosphorus levels, any excess is excreted primarily via the urine. In poultry available phosphorus solubilises in the gizzard where it becomes available for absorption also in the duodenum and jejunum.|$|E
50|$|A {{fraction}} of the maize feedstock dry matter used for ethanol production is usefully recovered as DDGS (dried distillers grains with solubles). In the 2010/2011 marketing year, about 29.1 million tonnes of DDGS were fed to US livestock and poultry. Because starch utilization in fermentation for ethanol production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue, the feed value per kg of DDGS, with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein, exceeds that of the grain. Feed value for <b>monogastric</b> animals, such as swine and poultry, is somewhat lower than for ruminants.|$|E
50|$|Hindgut {{fermentation}} is a digestive process seen in <b>monogastric</b> herbivores, {{animals with}} a simple, single-chambered stomach. Cellulose is digested {{with the aid}} of symbiotic bacteria. The microbial fermentation occurs in the digestive organs that follow the small intestine: the large intestine and cecum. Examples of hindgut fermenters include proboscideans and large odd-toed ungulates such as horses and rhinos, as well as small animals such as rodents, rabbits and koalas. In contrast, foregut fermentation is the form of cellulose digestion seen in ruminants such as cattle which have a four-chambered stomach which digests cellulose.|$|E

Its use for sheep does not pose any lathyrism problems if doses do not exceed 50 percent of the ration.|$|E
50|$|Some {{varieties}} of Photinia are toxic {{due to the}} presence of cyanogenic glycosides in the vacuoles of foliage and fruit cells. When the leaves are chewed these compounds are released and are rapidly converted to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) which blocks cellular respiration. The amount of HCN produced varies considerably between taxa, and is in general greatest in young leaves. Ruminants are particularly affected by cyanogenic glycosides because the first stage of their digestive system (the rumen) provides better conditions for liberating HCN than the stomachs of <b>monogastric</b> vertebrates.|$|E
