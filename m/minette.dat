25|$|Shiprock is {{composed}} of fractured volcanic breccia and black dikes of igneous rock called <b>minette,</b> or lamprophyre. It is the erosional remnant of the throat of a volcano, and the volcanic breccia formed in a diatreme. The rock probably was originally formed 2,500–3,000 feet (750–1,000 meters) below the Earth's surface, but it was exposed after {{millions of years of}} erosion. Wall-like sheets of <b>minette,</b> known as dikes, radiate away from the central formation. Radiometric age determinations of the <b>minette</b> establish that these volcanic rocks solidified about 27 million years ago. Shiprock is in the northeastern part of the Navajo Volcanic Field—a field that includes intrusions and flows of <b>minette</b> and other unusual igneous rocks that formed about 30 million years ago. Agathla (El Capitan) in Monument Valley is another prominent volcanic neck in this volcanic field.|$|E

In a study of hurricane damage statistics conducted in 2008, it was estimated that if a storm similar to that of the Miami hurricane were to occur in 2005 it would result in over $140–157billion in damage. In all, the storm caused at least 478 deaths along its path accounting for the revised toll in the United States since 2003.

Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his books Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication Liberty.|$|E
2500|$|After Louis XIV's {{marriage}} to Maria Theresa of Spain on 9 June 1660, Queen Anne {{turned her attention}} to the marriage of Philippe. He had previously been encouraged to court his older cousin the Duchess of Montpensier, eldest daughter of Gaston and his first wife Marie de Bourbon. Known as Mademoiselle at this time, she had an immense private fortune and had previously rejected suitors such as Charles II of England. Born in 1627, she was the sole heiress of her mother who died in childbirth. Mademoiselle declined the union, complaining that Philippe always stayed near his mother as if he was [...] "like a child". Mademoiselle instead remained unmarried. Philippe would marry instead another first cousin, Princess Henrietta of England, youngest child of King Charles I of England and his wife Queen Henrietta Maria, who was Philippe's aunt and had taken refuge at the court of France after the birth of Princess Henrietta in 1644. They lived at the Palais Royal and at the Palais du Louvre. In 1660, after the restoration of the House of Stuart to the throne of England under her brother Charles II, Princess Henrietta returned to England to visit her sister, the Princess of Orange, who later caught smallpox and died. The French court officially asked for Henrietta's hand on behalf of Philippe on 22 November 1660 while she was in England. The couple signed their marriage contract at the Palais Royal on 30 March 1661. [...] The ceremony took place the next day in the same building in front of select members of the court. The dowry promised was a huge 840,000 livres. Known as Henriette d'Angleterre in France, and <b>Minette</b> to her intimates, she was known officially as Madame and was ever popular with the court. Court gossip later said that the king was the father of Henrietta's first child.

40|$|Propagation of the Rio Grande rift into {{northwest}} Colorado at 26 - 8 m. y. BP {{was accompanied}} by eruption of mafic magmas with varied elemental and isotopic compositions. The volcanic rocks were erupted during two Miocene episodes (24 - 20 and 13 - 4 - 7 - 5 m. y. BP), and in the Quaternary (2 m. y. BP- 4000 BP). Three mafic magma end-member compositions are identified which were not {{related to each other}} by fractional crystallization or assimilation of crust. Most of the volcanic rocks represent hybrids of two or three of these end-members, although textural evidence for such mixing is normally absent. Group 1 end-members are basanites, derived by partial melting of an OIB-source astheno-spheric mantle. Group 3 end-members are mainly alkali basalts, derived by partial melting of asthenosphere modified by subduction of oceanic lithosphere. Group 1 source mantle replaced Group 3 source mantle as the asthenosphere underlying the region 11 - 6 - 10 m. y. BP, but Group 3 magmas continued to be erupted into the Quaternary. This replacement of asthenosphere post-dated cessation of subduction of oceanic lithosphere at the west margin of the North America plate by about 10 m. y. Group 2 end-members are <b>minettes,</b> with 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios comparable to those of the Cretaceous-Recent Montana-Wyoming potassic province. These <b>minettes</b> are thought to represent partial melts of sub-Colorado lithospheric mantle. Group 2 magmas were available as end-members for mixing during the entire period 24 m. y.

40|$|Numerous {{studies on}} rocks of the Navajo {{volcanic}} field (NVF) {{have been conducted}} in the last fifty years, {{but there are still}} questions about the origin and evolution of NVF magmas. Electron microprobe and laser ablation ICP-MS analyses on apatite crystals from NVF rocks reveal distinct chemical differences and trends that further support the notion that these rocks were created from several different magma sources. Bulk-rock geochemical trends reveal that all rocks in the NVF are potassic to ultrapotassic (K 2 O/Na 2 O from 1 to 5) with SiO 2 ranging from 30 to 60 weight percent. All NVF rocks are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements (K, Sr, Rb, Ba) and LREE. Samples with greater than 45 weight percent SiO 2 tend to show downward spikes in Nb-Ta and Ti and sharp upward spikes in Pb on some spider diagrams, indicating arc-like signatures. Katungite samples with less than 40 weight percent SiO 2, however, share some similarities to ocean-island basalts. Normalized-REE patterns for apatite crystals from katungite samples reveal ~ 10 times less enriched in LREE compared to the <b>minettes</b> and transitional-rock compositions. On plots of selected rare earth elements versus CaO the apatite crystals from katungites plot in distinctly separate fields compared to the <b>minettes</b> and transitional compositions. A plot of La+Ce against CaO shows that these elements are the lowest in apatite from the katungites, which is also observed in data from olivine crystals. The mineral-chemical data for <b>minettes</b> and transitional compositions are consistent with magma genesis by partial melting of highly enriched sub-continental lithospheric mantle. The distinct difference in the chemical signatures for the katungites, lend evidence that these rocks were generated from a deeper less-enriched mantle source that interacted with lithospheric mantle to produce the slightly elevated LREE signatures. Our data indicate that the NVF magmas involved several different melt phases during generation, which produced the wide spectrum of chemical trends we observe in these rocks...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} west-trending ultramafic and ultrapotassic dikes (katungite) are exposed in the west-central {{part of the}} Navajo {{volcanic}} field. These katungite dikes contain high concentrations (up to 5 % volume) of perovskite along with associated olivine, phlogopite, mellilite, and apatite. Perovksite in these rocks occurs as euhedral to subhedral crystals with complex growth and chemical-zonation patterns. The perovksite forms either as isolated rounded to pyramid-shaped crystals, “flower” aggregates, and “necklaces” around earlier formed phenocrysts of olivine. A study of the chemical signatures of perovskite in the NVF katungite samples reveals that they mostly consist of the end member perovksite CaTiO 3 (96 - 98 mol. %). The perovskite crystals have extremely elevated abundances of rare-earth elements with LREE enriched 10, 000 to 30, 000 times chondrite with 0. 1 to 0. 7 weight percent of Nb 2 O 3, La 2 O 3, Ce 2 O 3, Pr 2 O 3, Nd 2 O 3, and SrO. Overall, however, the perovskite in the katungite samples {{tends to be more}} ceroan, and exhibit elevated concentrations of U (40 to 100 ppm) and Th (300 - 2000 ppm). Prominent zonation in perovskite indicates a complex history of crystallization during magma explacement in which LREE oxides tend to show a decrease in concentration from core to rim whereas SrO show an increase. According to the oxygen barometer of Bellis & Canil (2007), the NVF katungite samples span a wide range of oxygen fugacities relative to the Ni-NiO buffer, ranging from - 4 to 0 with DNNO increasing with increasing Fe 2 O 3. The DNNO values tend to become more negative from the cores to rims of individual crystals. This suggests that the magmas associated with these rocks were in a moderately to slightly reduced state during emplacement, and were buffered by a C-H-O volatile phase that increased with crystallization. Most elements show an increase in concentration with higher Fe 2 O 3 and higher DNNO. This hints that the distribution of most elements in the perovksite is closely allied to the oxidation state of the magma. We interpret the DNNO data as evidence the magmas for the NVF katungite dikes were generated by melting of a deeper mantle source than NVF <b>minettes.</b> A variety of geochemical trends indicate that the <b>minettes</b> were generated by partial melting of metasomatized lithospheric mantle...|$|R
