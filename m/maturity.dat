40|$|We {{study how}} a firm’s {{decision}} to offer bonds of various <b>maturities</b> affects the portfolio allocations of institutional investors. We argue {{that because of}} lower information-collection costs, institutional investors tilt their portfolios towards firms that offer bonds of various <b>maturities.</b> We show that this translates into lower bond yields, both in the primary and in the secondary bond markets. (JEL G 12, G 2, G 32) Does the variety of bond <b>maturities</b> that a firm offers influence the demand for its bonds? For example, in 2007, IBM had thirteen bonds outstanding with twelve different <b>maturities,</b> ranging from 1 year to 89 years. Would bond investors view IBM differently if its thirteen bonds were instead concentrated in fewer (say, six) <b>maturities?</b> More importantly, can differences in the variety of <b>maturities</b> offered by the firm affect its bond yields? This is the question that we address in this paper. More specifically, we study whether offering a variety of <b>maturities</b> can affect the demand from institutional investors for corporate bonds and whether this induces differences in yields among otherwise similar firms. We argue that firms that offer bonds of various <b>maturities</b> are attractiv...|$|R

5|$|Great {{white sharks}} were {{previously}} thought to reach sexual <b>maturity</b> at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual <b>maturity</b> at age 26, while females take 33 {{years to reach}} sexual <b>maturity.</b> Maximum life span was originally believed {{to be more than}} 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual <b>maturity,</b> low reproductive rate and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the overfishing, the tilefish's age of sexual <b>maturity</b> has been dramatically affected. From 1978 to 1982, {{the median age of}} sexual <b>maturity</b> in males declined by 2.5 years from 7.1 to 4.6 years. This resulted in the males becoming sexually mature before females. In 2008, the median age of sexual <b>maturity</b> in males had risen to 5.9 years. Females of the species also exhibit low reproductive ability after becoming sexually mature, instead increasing with age and their sexual <b>maturity</b> has varied to a lesser extent then the male population across the years.|$|E

This study also conducts sub-period analysis based on the switching regression technique of Goldfield and Quant (GQSRT) (1972, 1973, and 1976). The main empirical findings are (1) Full-sample results show significant bi-directional linear causality from the CD and CD interest rates for one-month <b>maturities</b> and unidirectional linear causality between the EURO and CD interest rates for three-month and six-month <b>maturities.</b> Furthermore, full-sample results reveal for all three <b>maturities.</b> (2) Sub-sample results based on linear tests show a unidirectional causal relation from the CD rate to the EURO rate during the first sub-period for all three <b>maturities.</b> During the second sub-period, however, linear tests uncover a strong bi-directional relation between the CD and the Euro rates for all three <b>maturities.</b> The linear results for the third sub-period reveal mostly unidirectional causality from the EURO rate to the Cd for three <b>maturities.</b> (3) Finally, sub-sample nonlinear causality tests reveal mostly a unidirectional causality from the CD rate to the EURO rate for all three <b>maturities</b> during the first sub-sample, a strong significant bi-directional causality between the two rates for all three <b>maturities</b> during the second sub-period, and an uneven bi-directional causality between the two rates for all three <b>maturities</b> during the third sub-period.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a term-structure {{model in which}} investors with preferences for specific <b>maturities</b> trade with risk-averse arbitrageurs. Arbitrageurs integrate the markets for different <b>maturities,</b> incorporating information about expected short rates into bond prices. We show that bond risk premia are negatively related to short rates and positively to term-structure slope. Moreover, forward rates under-react to expected short rates, especially for long <b>maturities,</b> while investor demand impacts mainly long <b>maturities.</b> Thus, {{the short end of}} the term structure is mainly driven by short-rate expectations, while the long end by demand. Despite the presence of two distinct economic factors, the first principal component “explains ” about 90 % of movement.

5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual <b>maturity</b> {{in great}} {{northern}} tilefish population is occurring throughout the continental shelf. In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at <b>maturity</b> were observed in 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at <b>maturity</b> in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at {{about three years}} of age and can then become pregnant; in comparison, males reach sexual <b>maturity</b> when they are about four years old, {{although}} they can produce sperm as early as two years. While the chest glands can be functional as early as 18 months of age, males do not begin scent-marking behaviours until they reach sexual <b>maturity.</b> Because the offspring have a long dependent period, female koalas usually breed in alternate years. Favourable environmental factors, such as a plentiful supply of high-quality food trees, allow them to reproduce every year.|$|E

5|$|Most bovids are polygynous. In a few species, {{individuals}} are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be {{slightly larger than}} males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This {{is the case in}} duikers and other small bovids. The time taken for the attainment of sexual <b>maturity</b> by either sex varies broadly among bovids. Sexual <b>maturity</b> may even precede or follow mating. For instance the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of age. On the contrary barbary sheep females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual <b>maturity.</b> The delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within a year or two of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.|$|E
