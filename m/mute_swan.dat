5|$|Several common {{birds in}} North America, {{such as the}} house sparrow, the rock pigeon, the European {{starling}} and the <b>mute</b> <b>swan</b> are introduced species, meaning {{that they are not}} native to this continent but were brought here by humans from Europe or elsewhere. Introduced species are marked on this list as (I). There may be species that have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America that are not on this list. This is especially true of birds that are commonly held as pets, such as parrots and finches.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} water birds {{can be seen}} around the lake including: great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocoracidae), <b>mute</b> <b>swan</b> (Cygnus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), duck (Anatidae), shoveller (Anas clypeata) and gadwall (Anas strepera). The common buzzard (Buteo buteo) {{can be seen on}} the surrounding hills and both Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and kestrel breed. Occasional visitors include: osprey ("Pandion haeliatis"), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The ruddy darter dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.|$|E
40|$|Since their {{introduction}} to the United States in the late 19 th century, <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> (Cygnus olor) have become a nuisance species by causing damage to aquatic habitats, acting aggressively toward humans, competing with native waterfowl, and potentially transmitting or serving as a reservoir of infectious diseases to humans and poultry. In an effort to investigate their potential role as a disease reservoir and to establish avian health baselines for pathogens that threaten agricultural species or human health, we collected samples from 858 <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> and tested them for avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV- 1), avian influenza virus (AIV), and Salmonella spp. when possible. Our results indicate that exposure to APMV- 1 and AIV is common (60 %, n 5 771, and 45 %, n 5 344, antibody prevalence, respectively) in <b>mute</b> <b>swans,</b> but detection of active viral shedding is less common (8. 7 %, n 5 414, and 0. 8 %, n 5 390, respectively). Salmonella was isolated from three <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> (0. 6 %, n 5 459), and although the serovars identified have been implicated in previous human outbreaks, {{it does not appear}} that Salmonella is commonly carried by <b>mute</b> <b>swans...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{suitability}} of propofol for minor diagnostic or thera-peutic procedures in <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> (Cygnus olor) and mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). In the present study 30 free-living <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> and seven mallard ducks were given propofol as part of minor diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures. The birds were randomly divided into two groups. Induction of anesthesia was accomplished by administering 8 mg/kg of propofol. The birds of the first group were given additional boluses (2 - 4 mg/kg of propofol every one to seven minutes) as required to attain a light plain of anesthesia. In the other birds the induction was followed by a constant rate infusion (CRI) of propofol (0. 85 mg/kg/min). After receiving the loading dose no bird showed apnea and all birds could be easily intubated. Periodic bolus injection requires constant assessment and adjustment of anesthetic depth. Birds woke up unexpectedly during anesthesia with bolus administration. Therefore constant rate infusion is superior to and much more practical than bolus administration. Body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, saturation with oxygen and reflexes were comparable in both groups. In <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> the loss in body temperature was 0. 75 °C (bolus) and 0. 85 °C (CRI) within 35 minutes, and in mallard ducks 0. 8 °C (bolus) and 0. 9 °C (CRI) within 35 minutes. Heart rate decreased from 164 to 129 bpm (bolus) and from 221 to 191 bpm (CRI) in <b>mute</b> <b>swans,</b> and from 310 to 210 bpm (bolus) and from 367 to 337 bpm (CRI) in mallard ducks. Respiratory rate varied in <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> during anesthesia with boluses and decreased during CRI from eight to 12 breaths per minute. In mallard ducks the respiratory rate did not change significantly over time (bolus) and decreased during CRI from 37 to 34 breaths per minute. Saturation with oxygen varied in all birds, increased in <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> from 69 % to 81 % (bolus) and in mallard ducks from 61 % to 88 % (bolus) and from 79 % to 82 % (CRI). There was no increase of saturation with oxygen in <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> during CRI. During CRI all <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> and during boluses and CRI all mallard ducks had corneal reflex. During boluses corneal reflex was temporarily delayed in three <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> and lost in one. The swallowing reflex was lost in most birds and delayed in some birds. Most birds always displayed pedal reflex. All birds recovered from anesthesia without any long-term effects. At the latest 40 minutes after the end of anesthesia all birds had fully recovered. 60 % (12 / 30) of the <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> and 71 % (5 / 7) of the mallard ducks examined showed transient signs of central nervous system excitement during recovery, which subsided after a few minutes. Besides respiratory depress-sion and excitatory phenomena during recovery, no other side effects of propofol occurred during this study. Propofol is a good anesthetic agent for minor procedures in <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> and mallard ducks – especially given as constant rate infusion...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mute</b> <b>swans</b> (Cygnus olor) are an {{invasive}} {{species in the}} United States.

To learn more about select pathogens that <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> may harbor, a survey was conducted from April of 2011 to August of 2012 in the Great Lakes region and localized areas of the Atlantic coast, which revealed serologic evidence of arbovirus exposure in <b>mute</b> <b>swans.</b> Of 497 <b>mute</b> <b>swans</b> tested, antibodies were detected for eastern equine encephalitis (4. 8 %), St. Louis encephalitis (1. 4 %), West Nile (1. 2 %), and Turlock (0. 6 %) viruses.
