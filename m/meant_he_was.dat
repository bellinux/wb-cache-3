5|$|In 1922 {{after playing}} only 5 league matches {{for the season}} his career at Port Adelaide finally {{came to an end}} due to {{commitments}} to his farm at Berri and disputes regarding game compensation. His contract termination <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> paid ₤76 of ₤100 pounds for the season.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher's extra pace as {{a result}} of his lighter fuel loads <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to pull out enough of a gap to Häkkinen which enabled him to make an extra pit stop. Häkkinen's pace was very slow, {{allowing}} Nicola Larini to leapfrog him when the two-stoppers made their final pit stops.|$|E
5|$|His mother, Elizabeth Barrow, and {{her three}} {{youngest}} children joined {{her husband in the}} Marshalsea in April 1824. Dickens would visit them every Sunday until he found lodgings in Lant Street, closer to the prison, in the attic of a house belonging to the vestry clerk of St George's Church. This <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to breakfast with his family in the Marshalsea and dine with them after work.|$|E
25|$|The effort involved, however, <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{unable to}} bat {{in the second}} innings.|$|R
60|$|She meant Alceste. She <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> severe. She <b>meant</b> {{that she}} could deceive him.|$|R
60|$|Alfred hated {{nothing so}} much as to hear that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> low, for it <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> cross.|$|R
5|$|In 1862 he was {{appointed}} abbot of the Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush, which <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> also the prelate of Taron. He revitalized the monastery and transformed it into a flourishing center. He founded a school there and a journal, called Artsvik Tarono. He succeeded in convincing the wali (governor) of the Erzurum Vilayet to lower taxes for Armenians.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015, Darabont {{requested}} to amend his original complaint that AMC further reduced his profits from Season 2 as his firing mid-season <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not fully vested in the season, allowing AMC {{to reduce the}} profits paid him. Darabont's amended request points {{out that he had}} written and produced all the episodes in that season already and was entitled to the proper profit share. The judge granted this amendment in February 2016, partially influenced by concerns raised in Darabont's deposition.|$|E
5|$|Many vocalists were {{considered}} to perform on the album; Matheos and Portnoy briefly considered having a different vocalist perform on each track. Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation wrote some vocal melodies and lyrics, but Moore ultimately performed most of the vocals and wrote most of the lyrics. Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track. Cynic and Gordian Knot bassist Sean Malone performed bass, but was credited as a guest musician because his schedule <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to join Matheos, Moore and Portnoy for the basic tracking sessions.|$|E
50|$|His preaching {{ministry}} <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{away from}} {{his wife and children}} for very long periods.|$|R
5000|$|Holmes {{has been}} a long-standing member of the Tyrone panel, and his {{versatility}} has <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> normally an important member of the panel although his career has often been blighted by numerous injuries. [...] He has won honours with the county at youth and senior level, including the 1993 Ulster Minor Championship as well as four Ulster Senior Championship medals and three All-Ireland Championship medals.|$|R
50|$|For 2011 Seeley {{chose to}} stay with Relentless TAS Suzuki which <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> demoted to the {{supersport}} class.|$|R
5|$|Oppenheimer {{majored in}} chemistry, but Harvard {{required}} science students to also study history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics. He compensated for his late start by taking six courses each term and {{was admitted to}} the undergraduate honor society Phi Beta Kappa. In his first year, he was admitted to graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not required to take the basic classes and could enroll instead in advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on thermodynamics that was taught by Percy Bridgman. He graduated summa cum laude in three years.|$|E
5|$|Paul Walsh {{was born}} to Don and June Walsh in Plumstead on 1 October 1962; {{his father was a}}n {{electrician}} and his mother worked at Tate & Lyle. He grew up supporting Arsenal, though his father was a season-ticket holder at West Ham United. Despite his natural skill, his small stature <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> frequently overlooked at junior football. He was spotted playing for local youth side Londinium by Charlton Athletic scout Jim Fibbins, and signed schoolboy forms aged 14. In a 1986 interview with Shoot magazine Walsh cited Londinium manager John O' Connor as the biggest influence on his career. After leaving school he also began working part-time at a meat factory and later a fruit packing factory before he joined Charlton on a full-time basis.|$|E
5|$|Pitman was a hapa-haole, of part Hawaiian {{and part}} Caucasian descent. His father {{was white and}} his {{native-born}} mother was also part Caucasian from her own mother, who {{was the daughter of}} Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to colored regiments, but Pitman's fair skin color <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared. Historians Bob Dye, James L. Haley and others claimed Pitman was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race, but regiment records indicate otherwise.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Razumov, {{listening}} {{with a faint}} smile, asked Councillor Mikulin point-blank if this <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} have him watched.|$|R
2500|$|Imus {{said his}} {{comments}} were misinterpreted. Through his spokesman, Imus said, [...] "I <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being picked on because he's black." ...|$|R
5000|$|Smithers’ applied {{approach}} and funding base has <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> regularly {{directed to the}} educational issues that are uppermost in people’s minds. [...] Among the areas with which his team have been associated have been choice and selection in education, social variation between schools, qualifications and assessment, physics education, international comparisons of educational achievement, headship, teacher training, recruitment and retention, technical and further education, the independent/state divide, single-sex and coeducation, and higher education.|$|R
5|$|He {{would go}} on to score 23 times for Wales, {{including}} a hat-trick against Belgium in 1949 and braces against England (twice), Portugal, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. He won his final cap on 20 October 1950, scoring in a 2–2 draw with Scotland. His total of 23 goals was a record for Wales at the time before being equaled by Ivor Allchurch and eventually surpassed by Ian Rush and Gareth Bale. However, Ford's tally of 38 caps during his career was significantly lower than either Rush or Allchurch, who gained 73 and 68 caps respectively. In 1958, Wales qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first, and to date only time in their history but Ford was serving his suspension from the British game which <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> overlooked for selection and {{was not included in the}} Welsh squad for the 1958 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Conacher {{left the}} Bruins to {{enlist in the}} Royal Canadian Air Force for the {{duration}} of the Second World War where he served as a physical training instructor. He continued to play hockey in the Canadian military leagues, playing first for the Saskatoon RCAF team in 1942–43, then with the Dartmouth RCAF for the following two seasons. He led the Halifax city league with nine goals in 1943–44. Toward the end of the war, Conacher was deployed to England where he continued to play with military teams, but the deployment also <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unavailable to return to the Bruins at the start of the 1945–46 season like many of his teammates did. He appeared in only four games late in the season following his discharge from the military.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Smith {{formally}} {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force. He began his instruction with Initial Training Wing in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia's second city, and after six weeks there transferred to Elementary Flying Training School at Guinea Fowl, just outside Gwelo. The majority of the men he trained alongside were Australians, and many others were British. Smith was glad to find himself in a course that would ultimately lead to flying fighters as opposed to bombers—at Guinea Fowl, he learned to pilot Tiger Moths, then Harvards—and was also pleased to have been posted only a half-hour car journey from Selukwe. Late in the course he was picked out to undergo instruction as an officer cadet, which <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> transferred to Thornhill, another Gwelo airbase. He passed out in September 1942 with the rank of pilot officer; his training in Southern Rhodesia had taken a year in all.|$|E
50|$|His {{death in}} October 1945 <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{not able to}} help with {{re-building}} the SPD. Hans-Vogel-Straße, a street in Fürth, is named after him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Throwed {{a gun on}} me, got the drop, an' pitched mine away!" [...] muttered Holley, in disgust. The way <b>he</b> spoke <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> disgraced.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, {{he decided}} to start writing under the pen name of David Bryher as his real name <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hard to find on Google.|$|R
5|$|Kanaan {{ran out of}} fuel on {{the final}} lap; he stopped his car between turns three and four. Andretti's {{strategy}} of four pit stops <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not required to conserve fuel and maintained his lead to win the race. Tagliani finished second, Fernández took third, Zanardi fourth and Dixon fifth. Tracy, Gugelmin, Papis, Nakano and Kanaan rounded out the top ten. There were four lead changes in the race; five drivers reached {{the front of the}} field. De Ferran's total of 49 laps led was the highest of any competitor. There were eleven cautions (a new track record) during the race for 31 laps. The victory was Andretti's first (and only) win of the season, his seventh at Toronto (which surpassed the record of most wins in a CART event whom Andretti previously jointly held by Al Unser Jr. with six), and the 41st of his career. The attrition rate was high, with 11 of the 26 starters finishing the race.|$|E
5|$|Shearer's {{international}} {{career began}} in 1990 {{when he was}} handed a callup to the England under-21 squad under Dave Sexton. During his time with the squad, he scored 13 times in 11 games; a record return which is still unbeaten. The striker's goals at this level, coupled with his club form, <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> soon promoted to the senior squad by coach Graham Taylor. Marking his debut in the 2–0 win against France in February 1992 with a goal, he made his only appearance for the England B team a month later. Due to replace Gary Lineker, who retired from international action after UEFA Euro 1992, in the England attack, Shearer played only intermittently in the qualifying campaign for the 1994 FIFA World Cup due to injury and the team failed to reach the competition finals.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Berger was {{responsible}} for the large numbers of non-Reich foreign recruits that joined the Waffen-SS between 1940 and 1945. Despite the fact that Berger would have preferred a field command, he was one of Himmler's few trusted senior lieutenants, and his recruiting and organisational skills <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> kept as chief of the SS-HA throughout the war. The only exception was the short period as military commander in the Slovak State in the autumn of 1944 during the uprising. In September 1939, the number of non-Germans in what soon became the Waffen-SS was minimal. By May 1945, the force included 38 divisions, and the majority were non-Germans. None of the 38 divisions were exclusively manned by Reich Germans, and half were made up of mostly of personnel from outside the Reich.|$|E
60|$|But he knew {{quite well}} what that <b>meant.</b> <b>He</b> would <b>be</b> {{henceforth}} under suspicion, watched incessantly, as a mouse {{is by the}} cat, and pounced upon, the moment time would be considered propitious for his final downfall.|$|R
50|$|After a spell {{with the}} Featherstone Rovers, Foster signed for London on a 2 year deal. Injury <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{restricted}} to 20 appearances for the Broncos.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tahib!' exclaimed his Highness, which <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> satisfied. 'After all, I do {{not know}} whether the army will march at all. You have been in Syria?' ...|$|R
5|$|Unlike both horror remakes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and The Amityville Horror (2005)which {{were also}} {{produced}} by Bay, Form, and Fullerit {{was decided that}} Friday the 13th {{would not be a}} period piece. Form and Fuller said the film was not strictly a remake so there was no reason they could not set the story in the 2000s. In October 2007, Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, the writers of Freddy vs. Jason, were hired to write a script for Friday the 13th. Jonathan Liebesman was in negotiations to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unavailable and Fuller and Form chose Marcus Nispel. Nispel was apprehensive about taking the job, mainly because he would be taking over another film franchise, but Fuller eventually persuaded him to direct the project. Principal photography began on April 21, 2008, in Austin, Texas, and finished on June 13, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Buemi elected not {{to change}} tyres and gained the overall lead. Conway later served a drive-through penalty for his {{collision}} with Shaytar. The repairs to Van der Garde's vehicle <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> stationary in his pit stall for four minutes which allowed Merhi to inherit fifth position in LMP2. Tréluyer reported to Audi that his car had no front downforce, while Buemi went off the track at Raidillon {{in his effort to}} push hard to extend his lead over Bernhard. Buemi was held up by one of the SMP entrants and an Aston Martin at Fagnes causing his advantage to be reduced to 1.015 seconds. The Toyota driver missed his braking point at the Bus Stop chicane and went wide at La Source shortly afterwards, causing him to lose the first position to Bernhard. Buemi reclaimed the position at Eau Rouge but temporarily fell to second again after Bernhard overtook him on the Kemmel straight and retook the place before the entry to Les Combes. At Blanchimont corner, Bernhard avoided colliding heavily with the rear-end of Buemi's car after the latter slid while lapping Gulf Racing's Porsche entry.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Force India {{committed}} {{an error}} when bringing their drivers in early. Liuzzi {{made contact with}} Sutil which damaged his front wing. The team had been expecting Liuzzi to pit before Sutil, but the latter {{was the first to}} arrive into the team's pit stall. It was only after both drivers had returned to the circuit that the team realised they had accidentally placed Liuzzi's tyres on Sutil's car and Sutil's tyres on Liuzzi's. Buemi was pushed back into his garage and became the race's first retirement with accident damage on the second lap. Hamilton was running close behind Vettel but despite his car's straight-line speed advantage, he was unable to affect an overtaking manoeuvre. Hamilton later dropped further away from Vettel. Trulli became afflicted with an gearbox issue which <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to select second gear, and his mechanics pushed his Lotus T127 back into his garage where they attempted to rectify the issue without success. Alonso recorded lap times faster than teammate Massa which reduced the gap to 1.1 seconds by the conclusion of lap six. Trulli was released from his garage by his team but drove slowly around the circuit and elected to retire on the next lap.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} that Lucas walked a fine line down the middle between European traditionalists and Reform modernists. Paradoxically, this <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> often in {{conflict}} with both.|$|R
50|$|Ashton {{scored two}} tries in England's opening 2011 Six Nations Championship match against Wales at the Millennium Stadium on 4 February, with England winning the game 26-19. He {{followed}} this with four tries against Italy {{the following week}} equalling the all time Six Nations record with six championship tries. This performance also <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{the first person in}} the history of the Six Nations to score four tries in a single match. His famous swallow dive celebration was used to celebrate two of these tries.|$|R
6000|$|By {{the phrase}} [...] "I can't say," [...] Thomas {{secretly}} <b>meant</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not {{at liberty to}} say, though Copley understood him to mean that he did not know.|$|R
