50|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> {{is often}} used as an {{anti-adherent}} {{in the manufacture of}} medical tablets, capsules and powders. In this regard, the substance is also useful because it has lubricating properties, preventing ingredients from sticking to manufacturing equipment during the compression of chemical powders into solid tablets; <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> is the most commonly used lubricant for tablets. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> can also be used efficiently in dry coating processes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> is {{produced}} by the reaction of sodium stearate with magnesium salts or by treating magnesium oxide with stearic acid. Some nutritional supplements specify that <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> is sourced from vegetable-derived stearic acid.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> {{is a major}} {{component}} of [...] "bathtub rings." [...] When produced by soap and hard water, <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> and calcium stearate both form a white solid insoluble in water, and are collectively known as [...] "soap scum." ...|$|E

50|$|Examples of {{glidants}} include <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate,</b> {{fumed silica}} (colloidal silicon dioxide), starch and talc.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula [...] It is a soap, consisting of salt containing two equivalents of stearate (the anion of stearic acid) and one magnesium cation (Mg2+). <b>Magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> is a white, water-insoluble powder.

5000|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> is {{generally}} considered safe for human consumption at levels below 2500 mg/kg per day. [...] In 1979, the FDA's Subcommittee on GRAS (generally recognized as safe) Substances (SCOGS) reported, [...] "There is no evidence in the available information on ... <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> ... that demonstrates, or suggests reasonable grounds to suspect, a hazard to the public when they are used at levels that are now current and in the manner now practiced, or which might reasonably be expected in the future." ...|$|E
50|$|Common {{minerals}} like talc or silica, and fats, e.g. vegetable stearin, <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> or {{stearic acid}} {{are the most}} frequently used lubricants in tablets or hard gelatin capsules.|$|E

50|$|Antiadherents {{reduce the}} {{adhesion}} between the powder (granules) and the punch faces and thus prevent sticking to tablet punches {{by offering a}} non-stick surface. They are also used to help protect tablets from sticking. The most commonly used is <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sugar free {{versions}} of the lozenges contain sorbitol, aspartame, menthol, vegetable-sourced sucralose, and acesulfame K.

For example, the blackcurrant flavour variant includes elderberry juice extract.|$|E
50|$|Common {{minerals}} like talc or silica, and fats, e.g. vegetable stearin, <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> or {{stearic acid}} {{are the most}} frequently used lubricants in tablets or hard gelatin capsules. Lubricants are agents added in small quantities to tablet and capsule formulations to improve certain processing characteristics.|$|E
50|$|After granulation, a final {{lubrication}} step is used {{to ensure}} that the tableting blend does not stick to the equipment during the tableting process. This usually involves low shear blending of the granules with a powdered lubricant, such as <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> or stearic acid.|$|E
5000|$|... 5. The {{resulting}} fibers {{are then}} {{treated with a}} finishing agent which can be <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> or another polymer. This treatment prevents the fibers' sticking together and aids in textile manufacture. The fibers are then transferred {{through a series of}} rollers onto a spool.|$|E
50|$|Calcium {{stearate}} is a waxy {{material with}} low solubility in water, unlike traditional sodium and potassium soaps. It is also easy and cheap to produce, and exhibits low toxicity. These attributes {{are the basis}} of many of its applications. Related applications exist for the <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate.</b>|$|E

Lorazepam for injection formulated with polyethylene glycol 400 in propylene glycol with 2.0% benzyl alcohol as preservative.|$|E
50|$|Most {{widely used}} {{lubricants}} {{in use today}} are of the hydrophobic category. Hydrophobic lubricants are generally good lubricants and are usually effective at relatively low concentrations. Many also have both anti- adherent and glidant properties. For these reasons, hydrophobic lubricants are used much more frequently than hydrophilic compounds. Examples include <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{injectable}} form of delafloxacin is sold as the meglumine salt of {{the active}} ingredient and its United States Adopted Name, delafloxacin meglumine, reflects that; the injection formulation also includes EDTA and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin. The tablet is made of delafloxacin, citric acid anhydrous, crospovidone, <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate,</b> microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate.|$|E

The new formula has the same other ingredients, except silica is now listed after <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The active {{ingredients}} are calcium carbonate (550 mg) and magnesium hydroxide (110 mg). The in{{active ingredients}} are dextrose, flavoring, <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate,</b> polyethylene glycol, pregelatinized starch, sucralose and sucrose.

50|$|Coral grains are mined from fossilized coral beds on the coastline, {{and pumped}} from coral beds in shallow waters. Grains are then ground into a fine powder, and heat treated up to 1000 F and/or ozonated {{depending}} on the grade. The final product is either bagged as powder, or mixed with silicon dioxide (an anti-caking agent), rice flour, and <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> which acts as a lubricant, then encapsulated and bottled for retail sale.|$|E
5000|$|Diluents {{are also}} very {{important}} in the pharmaceutical industry. They are inactive ingredients that are added to tablets and capsules {{in addition to the}} active drug. For example, a Tylenol 325 mg tablet does not weigh 325 mg. This is the weight of the active acetaminophen, while the tablet weighs more due to other additives known as diluents. These additives may be used as binders, disintegrants (help the tablet break apart in the digestive system), or flavor enhancers. Some very common diluents in tablets include starch, cellulose derivatives, and <b>magnesium</b> <b>stearate</b> (a lubricant). (See also Excipient.) ...|$|E
