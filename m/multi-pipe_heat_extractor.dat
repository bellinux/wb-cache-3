40|$|In this paper, <b>heat</b> <b>extractors</b> are {{embedded}} into the magnetic materials of the integrated power electronics passive modules. The optimum volume of heat-extracting material may slightly {{reduce the amount}} of electromagnetic energy that is processed, but more efficient heat removal yields higher allowable levels of both electromagnetic stress and losses per unit volume in the remaining material. Without influencing the electromagnetic performance, <b>heat</b> <b>extractors</b> provide the potential to improve the power density of passive modules. This paper introduces the mechanism of <b>heat</b> <b>extractors</b> into passive power electronics modules. Theoretical thermal models and simulation are used to investigate factors influencing the module performance and the improvement on power density. Prototypes are built for experimental investigation. The experimental results show great improvement of power density by the application of heat extraction technology. High power density, more than 1 kW/in 3 (70 W/cm 3), is achieved on the prototype...|$|R

25|$|New for 2002 was a $2,695 40th Anniversary option package which {{included}} the NASCAR-inspired rear spoiler and roof fences, polished dual-outlet exhaust tips, hood with <b>heat</b> <b>extractors,</b> and 15-spoke chrome wheels previously offered with the 2001 Special Edition package. Unique elements such as the Dark Cherry Metallic paint, 40th Anniversary badges, and Ruby Red and Graphite interior trim with the 40th Anniversary logo embroidered on the front seats and floormats differentiated this option package from the previous year's offering.|$|R
2500|$|A Special Edition Package {{was added}} {{this year that}} {{could be applied to}} the GT and GTP models. This package adds the NASCAR-inspired rear spoiler and roof fences, hood-mounted <b>heat</b> <b>extractors,</b> and {{polished}} dual-outlet exhaust tips previously offered on the 2000 Pace Car Replica and also adds a two tone interior, 15-spoke chrome wheels, and the requisite badging. Also available for 2001 were two dealer installed [...] "75th Anniversary" [...] emblems, to celebrate Pontiac's 75th anniversary, they were placed in front of the badging on each door.|$|R
50|$|The Supercharged {{version of}} the S-281 was first {{introduced}} as an option for the New Edge Mustang in 1999 with a horsepower rating of 350 (261 kW). Designated as Saleen 281 CID SuperCharged, this designation was widely recognized as a separate model in 2000 with more options becoming available by Saleen. Notable internal differences of an S-281SC introduced a dual gauge instrument cluster above the dashboard, while the only external difference was a Saleen <b>Heat</b> <b>Extractor</b> hood. With {{the introduction of the}} Fifth-generation Ford Mustang, the supercharger was now installed in an upside-down configuration to provide better performance and a higher horsepower rating of 465 (347 kW).|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} body {{redesign}} and the 420 hp in the 2013 Mustang, the GT/CS also received a slight update. The side stripe was moved {{from the middle of}} the door to the bottom of the body in the same location as the GT500 side stripe. The stripe was also featured along the body lines on the hood of the car. The <b>heat</b> <b>extractors</b> now featured on the 2013 Mustang GT's hood are painted black instead of body color. The 19" [...] wheels are also black with chrome accent and a 5-spoke design. The interior was updated with Alcantara-style inserts in the seats and doors where the 2011/12 model year sported a faux carbon fiber pattern. The package cost $1,995.00 USD.|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{model of a}} soil warming system with a compost <b>heat</b> <b>extractor</b> was proposed. The soil warming system for the model simulation was constituted by some compost beds for heat extraction, pipe lines for circulation of the medium water and water reservoirs. The application of the {{simulation model}} to the practical example for warming the soil bed was investigated by {{the analysis of the}} heat balance of the system, using some actual operating conditions. The heat balance in the soil warming was treated analytically and systematically, taking account of the process control of the system. The concept of the model simulation and procedure for the systematical analysis of the heat balance in the soil warming may be of use for the planning, design and operations of the actual soil warming system. 堆肥発酵熱を利用した土壌加温システムを提案し, その熱的シミュレーション・モデルを検討した。シミュレーションを行うために想定した土壌加温システムは, 発酵熱抽出器としての数基の堆肥そう, 熱媒体用の水を循環させる配管系及び蓄熱のための貯水そうから成る。幾つかの実際的な操作条件を用いてシステムの熱収支を解析することによりシミュレーション・モデルの実際例への応用を検討した。システムの熱収支はプロセス制御を考慮して解析的かつ系統的に取り扱った。ここに示した土壌加温のモデル・シミュレーションと熱収支の系統的な解析手順の概念は, 実際の土壌加温システムの基本計画, 設計, 操作方法を検討するに当って有用であろう...|$|R
40|$|Having had {{imagined}} the heat recovery from exhaust {{air out of}} a compost bed, experiments for rising the temperature of water (medium fluid) by a packed column heating tower of counter flow-type were conducted. There was a considerably larger temperature rise of water (30 °C of the maximun), and a higher value of the heat recovery efficiency (72 % in average), as compared with those for the buried-tube-type <b>heat</b> <b>extractor.</b> Therefore, the proposed heat recovery system seemed likely to be valid. An overall volumetric coefficient of enthalpy transfer of the tower Ka depended only on the mass velocity of dry air G, and it was arranged by the experimental equation Ka= 27 G 0. 76 within the error of± 20 %. Assuming the linearity between the enthalpy and temperature of saturated air, approximate solutions of the temperature of water and the enthalpy of moist air in the tower were derived. It was illustrated that the volume of compost bed and the mass velocity {{of water in the}} tower which would be required to get the desired water temperature at the outlet of the tower could be graphically determined by the approximate solutions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{experimentally}} obtained flow characteristics of <b>multi-pipe</b> earth-to-air <b>heat</b> exchangers (EAHEs) {{were used to}} validate the EAHE flow performance numerical model prepared by means of CFD software Ansys Fluent. The cut-cell meshing and the k-ε realizable turbulence model with default coefficients values and enhanced wall treatment was used. The total pressure losses and airflow in each pipe of multi-pipe exchangers was investigated both experimentally and numerically. The results show that airflow in each pipe of multi-pipe EAHE structures is not equal. The validated numerical model {{can be used for}} a proper designing of multi-pipe EAHEs from the flow characteristics point of view. The influence of EAHEs geometrical parameters on the total pressure losses and airflow division between the exchanger pipes can be also analysed. Usage of CFD for designing the EAHEs can be helpful for HVAC engineers (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) for optimizing the geometrical structure of multi-pipe EAHEs in order to save the energy and decrease operational costs of low-energy buildings...|$|R
25|$|In 2004 the re-introduction of the Pontiac GTO (based on the Holden Monaro from Australia) took place, {{effectively}} {{replacing the}} spot {{left by the}} Firebird and Camaro. The GTO was also initially powered by the 350 HP LS-1 V8 in 2004. It had an independent front and rear suspension and an upscale full leather interior. Its clean lines and understated looks drew some criticism. Sales did not reach the 18,000 units that GM predicted. Initial dealer mark ups, slow shipping transit from Australia, and lack of advertisement by GM were to blame. Due to the retirement of the LS1 engine in 2004, Pontiac added the drive-by-wire 400 HP LS2 V8 for 2005–2006 model years at no additional cost. Additional upgrades also consisted of stainless steel dual exhaust outlets, larger Corvette sourced PBR brakes with EBD, larger front vented rotors with vented rear rotors, and functional <b>heat</b> <b>extractor</b> hood scoops. The Bonneville introduced the GXP trim level to replace the SSEi. The Bonneville GXP featured a 4.6 Northstar V8, borrowed from Cadillac, and replaced the Supercharged 3800 Series II. The redesigned Grand Prix made its appearance, and featured a GT and GTP trim level. The GTP's new 3.8L supercharged V6 now made , up 20 from the previous generation. TAPshift was also introduced {{as well as a}} Competition Group package (Comp G).|$|R
5000|$|They {{are limited}} {{versions}} of 2010 Chevrolet Camaro SS from SLP Performance. The ZL550 {{would have a}} supercharger attached to the 6.2L V8 boosting power from 426 to 550 bhp. The 550 hp variant was mated to the 6-speed automatic. It would also include 20" [...] 5-spoke red line machined spoke face with ZL center caps. A decal on the rear tail light in flat black. Heritage style SS badges on the front grill and rear panel, three ZL550 or ZL575 OEM-styled exterior badges, ZL550 or ZL575 logo embroided in the headrests and floor mats. It also included a 1-250 numbered plaque on the dashboard and numbered key fobs. It also sported a cold air induction system and an axle-back exhaust system with unique tips. A tweaked suspension lowered the front 1" [...] and 0.8" [...] in the rear. The {{hood of the car}} utilizes an RTM hood with a functional <b>heat</b> <b>extractor.</b> The ZL575 used the same 6.2L with an upgraded boost from the ZL550's supercharger making 575 hp. The ZL575 came mated to the 6-speed manual transmission found in the normal Camaro but was tweaked for the increased power. An option for the ZL575 was the 6-speed manual transmission would be installed with the clutch off of a Corvette ZR1 for sportier gear changes. Also, an option for the ZL550's transmission was being equipped with a 3:45 gear ratio. Brembo brakes were also an option. Sales began at Chevy dealers in mid-2010.|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. Power {{electronics}} {{refers to}} electronic processing of electrical power. In this process the electrical power {{is controlled by}} switching of power semiconductor devices as well as electromagnetically stored in electrical and magnetic fields while the energy flow is directed through selective conduction paths. The losses/power-efficiency of all these actions {{is of paramount importance}} in the processing. The lack for standardisation and the absence of a modular approach is a barrier to the development of more compact systems. Recently more research resources have been invested in development of integrated power electronic modules as an attempt to solve this problem. By integrating power electronic components, an increase in the power density is achieved, which unfortunately also leads to higher internal heat-generation and higher operating temperatures. This has an unfavourable effect on electronic behaviour and the reliability of the structures. In order to maintain the advances made in volume reduction of integrated power electronics, efficient and cost effective methods for removing heat is of essence. In this investigation the performance of rectangular cross-section embedded solid-state heatextraction inserts to increase thermal heat spreading and the reduction of steady-state peak temperatures was evaluated theoretically and experimentally. Theoretically, the cross sectional aspect ratio of such inserts was thermally optimised {{for a wide range of}} dimensional, thermal, and material property conditions. Possible materials investigated for use as <b>heat</b> <b>extractors</b> in power electronics include aluminium nitride, beryllium oxide, and synthetic diamond. The presence of interfacial thermal resistance was theoretically found to have a significant detrimental influence on the thermal performance of an integrated heat-extraction system and should be minimised as far as possible. For conditions commonly found in integrated power passives, continuous embedded heatextraction layers are proposed. Theoretically it is shown that such inserts can aid in the increase of power density by reducing the temperature increase per unit volume of heat-generation. Experimental test results corresponded closely with the theoretically expected allowed increase in heat-generation that could be accommodated due to the heat-extraction action of the inserts. As an experimental system, insertion of aluminium nitride into ferrite in an integrated electromagnetic power passive module was investigated. An increase of 187 % in the effective power density could be achieved due to the presence of aluminium nitride heat-extraction layers embedded into ferrite. Preliminary magnetic flux density optimisation, in terms of the volume fraction occupied by a parallel-layered heat-extraction system, was performed for a wide range of heat-extraction materials, and interfacial resistance values...|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} dynamics and phenology of 2 species of predatory soil arthropods, Neobisium muscorum (Leach) and Chthonius orthodactylus (Leach) (Pseudoscorpiones : Arachnida), were studied for a two year period in a beech wood community. A {{stratified random sampling}} method was employed, and the sample was divided into leaf litter, humus and topsoil for extraction. 10 samples of 0. 1 m 2 {{were taken from the}} sample site every 14 - 28 days over the study period. A modified <b>heat</b> <b>extractor</b> was designed and constructed for use in the study, and the characteristics of the extractor were investigated. Field temperatures at the sample site were measured hourly at nine positions in the soil profile, by a Grant temperature recorder, over the study period. These data were analysed by computer program. In both pseudoscorpion species, maximum densities were recorded during autumn and winter, and minimum densities during spring and summer. 2 generations a year were produced by the Neobisium muscorum population, in spring and autumn. The autumn generation was found to be the most important. The life cycle of Chthonius orthodactylus was found to be univoltine with no free-living protonymphs. Deutonymphs appeared in the population during the autumn months. The horizontal and vertical distribution patterns of both species of pseudoscorpion were investigated. Both populations were shown to aggregate, and the transformation needed to stabilise the variance of the population density estimates was calculated. There was no evidence for either species undergoing a winter hibernation in the humus layer, as had been reported. Respiration studies were carried out on individuals of all life stages of Neobisium muscorum, and the adults of Chthonius orthodactylus, at 5 °, 10 ° and 15 °C, using a Cartesian Diver micro-respirometer. The population metabolism of Neobisium muscorum was calculated for two yearly periods using a computer method, from data calculated for the field temperatures, population density and phenology, respiration studies and biomass estimates. Annual production and net population production efficiencies for Neobisium muscorum were calculated for the two yearly periods. The standing crop of both species of pseudoscorpion, over the study period, was estimated by means of bomb calorimetry of all life stages. The importance of pseudoscorpions as part of the predatory fauna of the beech wood community was discussed, and a comparison of the energetics data for Neobisium muscorum was made with published data for other predators...|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{greenhouse}} experiments the host status and quality of 49 biofuel plants for the larvae of WCR were evaluated. The plants tested (18 species and varieties of Sorghum, 16 forage grasses, 6 Miscanthus genotypes, 6 Panicum varieties and 3 broadleaf species) were grown {{for at least three}} weeks before they were used in the bioassays. The insects used in the experiments were obtained from a non diapausing laboratory strain originally from the US and maintained by BTL since 2006. Only neonate larvae (not older than 24 hours) were used in the bioassays. In each experiment up to six species or varieties of plants were tested each with 10 replicates (containers). A susceptible maize variety was used as a positive control in each experiment. Each plant container was infested with ten neonate WCR larvae using a fine art brush. After inoculation the plants were not watered for at least 24 hours to facilitate the establishment of the larvae. The experiments were terminated after 18 days. To extract surviving larvae the soil and roots of test plants were carefully examined by hand and then transferred to a modified MacFadyen <b>heat</b> <b>extractor</b> with an extraction temperature of 45 °C. To assess the host quality the number of larvae recovered, the widths of their head capsules and dry weights were recorded. The larvae were dried at 40 °C for at least 72 hours and then weighed on an electronic micro balance. Of the 21 forage and switch grasses examined 16 hosted WCR larvae. However, the percentage of larvae that survived for 18 days, their dry weights and head capsule widths were significantly less than that recorded for larvae that developed on maize roots. The roots of most (i. e. 15) of the 18 Sorghum species or varieties tested were unsuitable for the development of WCR larvae. For the remaining three Sorghum species a maximum of only two larvae (of 100 inoculated) were recovered. These results indicate that species of Sorghum are very poor quality hosts for WCR as previously reported in other studies. The opposite was true for the Miscanthus species tested. The number of larvae recovered from Miscanthus x giganteus roots, their dry weight and head capsule widths were the same as those recorded for larvae reared on the maize control. The other Miscanthus genotypes were less suitable than Mxg, but still more acceptable than all the forage and switch grasses tested in this study. In accordance with all previous studies, which used host plants other than maize, no larvae developed on the three broad leaf species...|$|R
40|$|U-pipe Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHE) {{are widely}} used today in ground source heating and cooling systems {{in spite of their}} less than optimal performance. This thesis {{provides}} a better understanding on the function of U-pipe BHEs and Investigates alternative methods to reduce the temperature difference between the circulating fluid and the borehole wall, including one thermosyphon and three different types of coaxial BHEs. Field tests are performed using distributed temperature measurements along U-pipe and coaxial heat exchangers installed in groundwater filled boreholes. The measurements are carried out during heat injection thermal response tests and during short heat extraction periods using heat pumps. Temperatures are measured inside the secondary fluid path, in the groundwater, and at the borehole wall. These type of temperature measurements were until now missing. A new method for testing borehole heat exchangers, Distributed Thermal Response Test (DTRT), has been proposed and demonstrated in U-pipe, pipe-in-pipe, and multi-pipe BHE designs. The method allows the quantification of the BHE performance at a local level. The operation of a U-pipe thermosyphon BHE consisting of an insulated down-comer and a larger riser pipe using CO 2 as a secondary fluid has been demonstrated in a groundwater filled borehole, 70 m deep. It was found that the CO 2 may be sub-cooled at the bottom and that it flows upwards through the riser in liquid state until about 30 m depth, where it starts to evaporate. Various power levels and different volumetric flow rates have been imposed to the tested BHEs and used to calculate local ground thermal conductivities and thermal resistances. The local ground thermal conductivities, preferably evaluated at thermal recovery conditions during DTRTs, were found to vary with depth. Local and effective borehole thermal resistances in most heat exchangers have been calculated, and their differences have been discussed in an effort to suggest better methods for interpretation of data from field tests. Large thermal shunt flow between down- and up-going flow channels was identified in all heat exchanger types, particularly at low volumetric flow rates, except in a multi-pipe BHE having an insulated central pipe where the thermal contact between down- and up-coming fluid was almost eliminated. At relatively high volumetric flow rates, U-pipe BHEs show a nearly even distribution of the heat transfer between the ground and the secondary fluid along the depth. The same applies to all coaxial BHEs as long as the flow travels downwards through the central pipe. In the opposite flow direction, an uneven power distribution was measured in multi-chamber and multi-pipe BHEs. Pipe-in-pipe and <b>multi-pipe</b> coaxial <b>heat</b> exchangers show significantly lower local borehole resistances than U-pipes, ranging in average between 0. 015 and 0. 040 Km/W. These heat exchangers can significantly decrease the temperature difference between the secondary fluid and the ground and may allow the use of plain water as secondary fluid, an alternative to typical antifreeze aqueous solutions. The latter was demonstrated in a pipe-in-pipe BHE having an effective resistance of about 0. 030 Km/W. Forced convection in the groundwater achieved by injecting nitrogen bubbles was found to reduce the local thermal resistance in U-pipe BHEs by about 30 % during heat injection conditions. The temperatures inside the groundwater are homogenized while injecting the N 2, and no radial temperature gradients are then identified. The fluid to groundwater thermal resistance during forced convection was measured to be 0. 036 Km/W. This resistance varied between this value and 0. 072 Km/W during natural convection conditions in the groundwater, being highest during heat pump operation at temperatures close to the water density maximum.

40|$|Caffeine {{is one of}} the few plant {{products}} with which the general public is readily familiar because of its occurrence in beverages such as coffee and tea,as well as various soft drinks. Its chemical formula is C 8 H 10 N 4 O. Moreover,caffeine can naturally be found in cocoa seeds such as Prang Besar Cocoa (PBC) 123. PBC 123 one of cocoa clone that can be found in Malaysian Cocoa Board plantaion at Jengka, Pahang. Commonly,the alkaloid contents (caffeine,theobromine,and theophylline) in cocoa are extracted before the cocoa is processed and the caffeine are discarded without use whereas the caffeine has its own benefits. For example,it is used for pharmaceutical purposes and the caffeine has increasing demand in the world. Moreover,an effective and low cost solvent is also needed for better extraction of caffeine. This will increase the profit from the sales of caffeine. Thus,this research will find the best solvent for the high extraction yield and also will optimize the parameters that affect the extraction yield of caffeine. The purpose of this research is to extract caffeine from Prang Besar Cocoa (PBC) 123. Besides that, this research is also to investigate the effect of sample particle size,extraction time and solvent/feed ratio on the yield of caffeine. Firstly,the seeds dried at 60 ˚C for 1 hour. Then,the dried seeds will blend and sieved into 5 different particles size which is 2000, 1000, 800, 630 and 315 µm. 5 g of powdered seeds will boiled with 250 mL distilled water in batch <b>heat</b> reflux <b>extractor</b> for 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes. For liquid-liquid extraction, solvent extraction will done using ethyl acetate at solvent or feed ratio of 1 : 5, 1 : 4, 1 : 3, 1 : 2 and 1 : 1. The lower layer that contains caffeine will collect. Rotary evaporator will used to evaporate ethyl acetate at 78 ˚C. Finally,the yields of caffeine in the solution will analyze by using UV/Vis Spectrophotometric method. The caffeine yield was highest at sample particle size of 315 μm (0. 27 % w/w caffeine or 2. 739 mg/g cocoa), solvent/ feed ratio of 1 : 1 (0. 26 % w/w caffeine or 2. 614 mg/g cocoa), and extraction time of 90 minutes (0. 26 % w/w caffeine or 2. 637 mg/g cocoa). The best conditions for the highest yield of caffeine from PBC 123 were 315 μm of sample particle size, 1 : 1 of solvent/feed ratio and 90 minutes of extraction time...|$|R
40|$|Sweden {{has long}} had access to low {{electricity}} prices due to the wide availability of hydro and nuclear power. This has now changed because of today's rising electricity rates resulting in increasing heating costs for properties, especially in the properties with electric heating systems. "Ankaret" is a parish for "Svenska Alliansmissionen", which is located at "Gullbrannagården". The parish has installed electrical radiators and an exhaust ventilation system that makes the energy demand high due to the large ventilation flows. The building was built {{as the price of}} electricity was still low and would reduce energy use today by combining its heating system with an air/air heat pump. The heat pump delivers more heat into the room than the electrical energy that it uses. This lowers the electricity needs. At present, the Assembly pays 22 000 SEK for electricity, water and sewage. The report's purpose is other than to install a heat pump to improve an air/air heat pump with a very simple solution. Air/air heat pumps have a lower COP-factor in cold out temperatures when the most energy is needed in the building. Suggesting an unusual placement of the heat pump in order to take advantage of an otherwise unused energy source. By placing the heat pump near the exhaust ventilation to use the heat that would otherwise just had been energy losses. In this report a discussion with three options for recovering heat from the ventilation system will take place. The added heat to the heat pump will reduce the temperature difference and thus increase the COP-factor to allow it to supply more heat to "Ankaret". The defrosting of the outer part (the evaporator) performs at cold temperatures due to icing will be lowered which further improves the heat pump. The report will also identify the transmission and ventilation losses for "Ankaret" to assess the energy need. An estimation of household electricity (lighting, appliances, etc.) and hot water use will be carried out in order to obtain an approximate value for how much electrical energy the building use. In addition, there will also be two alternative heating systems which have a similar function as an air/air heat pump that uses heat from a ventilation system. This is a "FTX" ventilation system and an <b>extractor</b> <b>heating</b> pump. This is to see the difference in the investment cost for the three different systems and the energy savings. The result of the energy inventory shows an overall energy use at 37 000 kWh/year of these 5 500 kWh/year household electricity and water heating. The specific energy use for heating is 180 kWh/m 2  and year. The result also shows an economic aspect over which of the three heating system with the shortest payback period in relation to the investment cost. The pay-of-method shows that air/air heat pump has the shortest payback period...|$|R
