5|$|After a rest {{day on the}} Sunday of the game, England resumed on <b>Monday</b> <b>with</b> England still 223 runs in arrears. The Nottinghamshire {{secretary}} H. A. Brown broadcast {{an appeal}} to the spectators via the public address system, urging them to refrain from barracking Miller. In response, they clapped when the Australians took to the field. The chairman of Nottinghamshire reportedly apologised to Bradman in private regarding the crowd reaction to Miller. Taking the new ball in the fifth over of the day, in the overcast conditions that morning, Miller bowled a relatively full length, rather than bouncers, and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. Shortly after a break for bad light, he bowled Hutton with an off cutter. This brought in Hardstaff, who was dropped from his third delivery by Arthur Morris at slip. In the remainder of the over, Hardstaff played and missed, then edged two further balls; the second edge went for four runs through the slips. During the morning session, Bradman used Miller for 11 overs in a row to pressurise the Englishmen.|$|E

Ronaldo was forced to pay for the remaining period on his contract which tied him to Real Madrid, only because the latter did not agree to release him, while Milan were not ready to pay such a sum. On 25 January, Ronaldo flew from Madrid to Milan to watch the team play in a cup tie against Roma. Statements on the club's website said that Ronaldo was in Milan for a medical, and that a meeting had been arranged for <b>Monday</b> <b>with</b> Real Madrid officials to discuss and finalize his transfer to the Milanese club. On 26 January, Ronaldo successfully completed his medical tests at the Milanello training complex under the supervision of club doctors, and the transfer completed on 30 January and got the squad number 99.

25|$|A {{look at the}} booking {{dates of}} The New Glenn Miller Orchestra in the two months {{following}} Hambro's November5 wedding {{is representative of the}} lifestyle of a big-band musician. On the day of his marriage, Hambro and the 17-member The New Glenn Miller Orchestra were playing one of the ballrooms of Philadelphia's Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, while his fiancée, Lynn Michels, was singing with Al Raymond's big band in another room. Immediately after his marriage, while Hambro and Michels celebrated a weekend honeymoon, the band played The Tuxedo Ballroom in New York City. On <b>Monday,</b> <b>with</b> Hambro and Michels following the tour bus in their new convertible, the band headed to the Midwest for two weeks of engagements, followed by dates in Louisiana and Texas.

Kennedy's five inaugural balls in Washington, DC.

25|$|On April 2, 2016, the Lightning {{announced}} that Stamkos {{was diagnosed with}} thoracic outlet syndrome, {{which is the same}} injury that sidelined teammate Andrei Vasilevskiy {{at the start of the}} season. It is a condition that is rare among hockey players. Stamkos said that he first felt some discomfort in his arm after the game against the Montreal Canadiens. He is scheduled for surgery on <b>Monday</b> <b>with</b> Dr. Karl Illig, who performed Vasilevskiy's surgery. Lightning General Manager, Steve Yzerman, stated that there will be no long-term impact on Stamkos' health or his career. In addition, Yzerman indicated that Stamkos recovery time would be between one and three months, but they would have a better idea in a couple of weeks where he falls within that time frame. Yzerman also stated that the team's desire is for Stamkos to remain with the organization, which came after a question of whether Stamkos had played his last game in a Lightning uniform. On April 4, 2016, Stamkos had successful surgery at Tampa General Hospital. Stamkos' surgeon stated that they plan on evaluating him in approximately two weeks and that should clear up his prognosis. On May 26, 2016, Stamkos dressed for game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins despite still being on blood thinners following surgery. He registered five shot attempts during the game, but the Lightning ultimately lost 2-1 and were eliminated from the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|A week later, Stevenage {{travelled}} to Essex to play Grays Athletic. The game ended 21 to Stevenage, {{despite the}} home side leading at the interval through a Jamie Guy strike. Stevenage {{turned it around}} in the second half, with goals from Michael Bostwick and Charlie Griffin. Stevenage followed this up with another away win four days later at Crawley Town; winning the match 30. Stevenage started brightly and scored within the first five minutes; Yemi Odubade latching onto David Bridges through ball to slot home. The visitors doubled their lead on the half hour mark, this time Tim Sills was the provider, as Odubade scored his second. Joel Byrom scored Stevenage's third in the second half, picking up the ball a yard inside the Crawley half and chipped Simon Rayner in goal. Stevenage then followed this up with an eighth consecutive victory, beating Oxford United 10 at Broadhall Way. The only goal of the game came seven minutes into the second half, David Bridges was fouled in the area by Chris Hargreaves; Scott Laird stepped up and subsequently scored to ensure the home side earned three points. Four days later, Stevenage lost 10 to Luton Town thanks to a Matthew Barnes-Homer goal in the second half. Stevenage bounced back just two days later on Easter <b>Monday,</b> <b>with</b> a 30 victory over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow. The away side {{took the lead in}} the ninth minute; Mark Roberts bundling home a Joel Byrom corner after Tim Sills had knocked the ball down. Just two minutes later, Stevenage doubled their lead, again Byrom was the provider, and his lofted ball was met on the half-volley by Lawrie Wilson, who lashed the ball home - making his first start since breaking his leg in August. Stevenage rounded off the victory in injury-time, substitute Eddie Odhiambo slotting the ball home from Charlie Griffin's cross. Stevenage then faced Forest Green Rovers at Broadhall Way five days later; the game ended 20 to Stevenage. The home side took the lead in the tenth minute; Tim Sills broke the offside trap and set up Joel Byrom to lash the ball home. Stevenage doubled their lead in the second half when substitute David Bridges was brought down in the area. Scott Laird calmly stepped up and stroked the ball into the net. A third win followed four days later, when Stevenage beat Altrincham 10 in a tight encounter at Moss Lane. Substitute Charlie Griffin scored the only goal of the game in the 83rd minute; Altrincham goalkeeper Russell Saunders fumbled the ball into the path of Griffin who placed his shot in-between the goalkeeper and the post to ensure a valuable three points to the visitors.|$|E

500|$|In 1880, Weaver {{prepared}} a resolution {{stating that the}} government, not banks, should issue currency and determine its volume, and that the federal debt should be repaid in whatever currency the government chose, not just gold as the law then required. The proposed resolution would never be allowed to emerge from committees dominated by Democrats and Republicans, so Weaver planned to introduce it directly to the whole House for debate, as members were permitted to do every Monday. [...] Rather than debate a proposition that would expose the monetary divide in the Democratic Party, Speaker SamuelJ. Randall refused to recognize Weaver when he rose to propose the resolution. Weaver returned to the floor each succeeding <b>Monday,</b> <b>with</b> the same result, and the press took notice of Randall's obstruction. Eventually, Republican JamesA. Garfield of Ohio interceded with Randall to recognize Weaver, which he reluctantly did on April 5, 1880. The Republicans, mostly united behind hard money, largely voted against the measure, while many Democrats joined the Greenbackers voting in favor. [...] Despite support by the soft-money Democrats, the resolution was defeated 84–117 with many members abstaining. [...] Although he lost the vote, Weaver had promoted the monetary issue in the national consciousness.|$|E

In [...] "Special Education", when given his first opportunity to audition for a Warblers solo, Kurt asks Rachel for advice on selecting a song and she recommends [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] from Evita; the episode cuts between the two as they each sing the song.
