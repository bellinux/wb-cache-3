A plant <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> must provide useful information to operators as the third layer of the Independent Protection Layers. Therefore, a method for designing a plant <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> is important for plant safety. Because plants are modified throughout their plant lifecycles, any <b>alarm</b> <b>systems</b> need to be properly managed throughout the plant lifecycles. To manage the changes, the design rationale of the <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> should be explained explicitly. Takeda et al.

An <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> is optimal if it detects catastrophes with a high probability and simultaneously gives a low number of false alarms.

To evaluate and compare different <b>alarm</b> <b>systems,</b> a method using operating characteristics, i. e. the probabilities of a correct alarm and detecting a catastrophe, is used.

An analysis on both indices is performed, and a model is constructed to predict the future values of both indices. Based on this model an optimal <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> is constructed to warn for the indices crossing a certain level. This model is then evaluated, it does not work very well.
