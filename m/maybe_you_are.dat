2500|$|Lil Wayne {{has been}} {{referenced}} in public speeches by President Barack Obama {{on at least}} two occasions, in mixed contexts. Speaking to a largely African-American audience during a general election campaign town hall speech in Georgia, then-U.S. Senator Obama exhorted children to stay in school and achieve their dreams through education and perseverance instead of hoping for shortcuts to fame and riches as professional athletes and entertainers via the fields of sports and entertainment, stating: [...] "You are probably not that good a rapper. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the next Lil Wayne, but probably not, in which case you need to stay in school." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand {{if you want to}} get rid of me. [...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E

"Indeed they have, miss; neater-twisted, as {{you might}} say; but not {{scarcely}} to be noticed by any but a very old friend. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a little tired with your long drive and those two solemnities on the box.

[...] "If Aglaia had lived I could wish for {{nothing better than}} {{for her to have}} grown up to be just such a little woman as you are. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> Aglaia," [...] he continued, falling in with her playful mood; [...] "can't you {{remember}} when we lived at the mill?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Honest John Floyd did his duty, but he didn't {{find the}} owner; so the old purse came back at last, and now Jack could keep {{it with a}} clear conscience. Nanny was asleep when it happened; and as they sat {{counting}} the dingy bills, Mrs. Quinn said to the boy, 'Jack, you'd better keep this for yourself. I doubt if it's enough to do the child any good; and you need clothes and shoes, and a heap of things, let alone the books you hanker after so much. It ain't likely you'll ever find another wallet. It's all luck about Nanny's eyes; and <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> only throwing away a chance you'll never have again.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I want {{to thank}} you and your brother for what you did for me. I [...] shall never forget it.

You, perhaps, have [...] learned my name, and <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> wondering if I am related to Mr. [...] Pelter of Pelter, Japson & Company, of New York City. Mr. Pelter is [...] my uncle, and for a number of years I made my home with him.

But he is my uncle, and on [...] several occasions he has assisted me very materially. For that [...] reason, I think it is best that we do not meet.|$|E
60|$|Another {{thing you}} must not do {{in the streets of}} German towns is to feed horses, mules, or donkeys, whether your own or those {{belonging}} to other people. If a passion seizes you to feed somebody else's horse, you must make an appointment with the animal, and the meal must take place in some properly authorised place. You must not break glass or china in the street, nor, in fact, in any public resort whatever; and if you do, you must pick up all the pieces. What you are to do with the pieces when you have gathered them together I cannot say. The only thing I know for certain is that you are not permitted to throw them anywhere, to leave them anywhere, or apparently to part with them in any way whatever. Presumably, you are expected to carry them about with you until you die, and then be buried with them; or, <b>maybe,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> allowed to swallow them.|$|E
6000|$|... --Let us try, therefore, to {{make this}} retreat in honour of saint Francis with our whole heart and our whole mind. God's blessing will then be upon all your year's studies. But, above and beyond all, let this retreat be one to which you can look back in after years when <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> far from this college and among very {{different}} surroundings, to which you can look back with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to God for having granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation of a pious honourable zealous christian life. And if, as may so happen, there be {{at this moment in}} these benches any poor soul who has had the unutterable misfortune to lose God's holy grace and to fall into grievous sin, I fervently trust and pray that this retreat may be the turning point in the life of that soul. I pray to God through the merits of His zealous servant Francis Xavier, that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance and that the holy communion on saint Francis's day of this year may be a lasting covenant between God and that soul. For just and unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may this retreat be a memorable one.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said Dr. Bagby, gently, glancing {{away from}} Carl to the machine. He went over, twanged a supporting-wire, {{and seemed to}} {{remember}} that some one had spoken to him. He returned to the fevered Carl, walking sidewise, staring all the while at the resting monoplane, so efficient, yet so quiet now and slender and feminine. [...] "Yes, yes. So you'd {{like to be an}} aviator. So you'd like--like----(Hey, boy, don't touch that!)----to be an aviator. Yes, yes. They all would, m' boy. They all would. Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> can <b>be,</b> some day. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> can <b>be....</b> Some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} {{got rid of}} me yet," [...] he said. [...] "As for you, Squire Thorndyke, I shall not forget your meddlesome interference, and some day, <b>maybe,</b> <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> sorry for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, dad!" [...] Jack said, {{affected}} at this {{proof of}} Bill Haden's {{desire to do}} what he could towards maintaining his dignity. [...] "I wouldn't think o't. If you and mother feel that you'd be more happy and comfortable here--and <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> right, I didn't think over the matter from thy side as well as my own, as I ought to have done--of course you shall stay here; and, of course, you shall have a berth as under-viewer. As for swearing off drink altogether, I wouldn't ask it of you, though I do wish you could resolve never to drink too much again. You ha' been used to go to the [...] "Chequers" [...] every night for nigh forty years, and you couldn't give it up now. You would pine away without somewhere to go to. However, this must be understood, whenever you like to come up to me I shall be glad to see you, and I shall expect you on Sundays to dinner if on no other day; and whenever the time shall come when you feel, dad, that you'd rather give up work, there will be a cottage for you and mother somewhere handy to me, and enough to live comfortably and free from care." ...|$|E

5000|$|Leyla (Melis Birkan): The {{last major}} Leyla in the series, who appears in season three, most closely resembles the {{original}} Leyla. Like the first Leyla, Mecnun {{falls in love}} with her when he sees her {{at the top of the}} stairs. Leyla is a businesswoman, and Mecnun's constant presence sabotages her company; once, he starts a fire. When Leyla criticizes him one day, Meclun says: [...] "What are you doing? Why are you always criticizing me? Why are you always doing this? For once, turn around and look at yourself. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to blame, huh? <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> just not good enough. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not made for this job. If you can't do this job, then don't. Stop!" [...] Leyla tries to slap him, Mecnun gently grabs her hand and they gaze into each other's eyes.|$|E

40|$|You have {{probably}} felt {{the power of}} music to lift you out of yourself. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in a magnificent cathedral, listening to a choral mass. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> at a music festival where the music made you forget the bad weather and appalling toilet facilities. Whatever the setting, music can lead us into a shared experience of ecstasy – a word which literally means “to stand outside oneself”. For my recent book Exaltation I examined two different musical “spaces” in which people experience ecstasy catalysed by music. The first was a Pentecostal congregation in suburban Perth; the second was the West Coast Blues ‘n’ Roots Festival...|$|R
5000|$|The book {{received}} both acclaim {{and criticism}} for its candor {{in dealing with}} such topics as reincarnation, meditation, mediumship (trance-channeling), and even unidentified flying objects. It made Shirley MacLaine the butt of many jokes, especially by late-night television comedians. Once, when David Letterman would not let up on the New Age subject, she responded by saying, [...] "Maybe Cher was right; <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> an asshole!" [...] The claim about an affair with the MP gained attention in the UK when the book was published there.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{told that}} at one battle Gustavus Adolphus sent Torstensson with an order {{to one of the}} officers. On his way Torstensson noticed that the enemy had changed {{position}} and altered the King's orders. Gustavus noticed the new development. When Torstensson returned he told Gustavus what he had done. The King first raised his hand as if to strike Torstensson but changed his mind and said, [...] "Lennart, this could have cost you your life, but <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> better suited to be a general than a page at the royal court".|$|E
