5|$|As of November 2011, the Kennel Club has not {{highlighted}} {{any specific}} concerns regarding the breed's health to conformation show judges. Due {{to the low}} numbers of the breed, two of the <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> problems facing the breed today is the popular sire effect and the general problem of genetic diversity within the breed.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{significant}} and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> during the bat's breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a pipeline from Myanmar to Thailand may have a negative impact. Threats to the Myanmar population are not well known.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} {{states of}} ruthenium range from 0 to +8, and −2. The properties of ruthenium and osmium compounds are often similar. The +2, +3, and +4 states {{are the most}} common. The <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> precursor is ruthenium trichloride, a red solid that is poorly defined chemically but versatile synthetically.|$|E
5000|$|Psychological maltreatment is [...] "the <b>most</b> {{challenging}} and <b>prevalent</b> form {{of child abuse}} and neglect." ...|$|R
50|$|Reasons {{for wanting}} a solo home birth include: wanting a natural process, {{going through a}} {{polluted}} period, and increased self-confidence doing it alone. The idea of self-confidence and not needing anybody else is <b>most</b> strongly <b>prevalent</b> among multiparous women, having already done it previously without any help.|$|R
5000|$|New Jersey - The {{filtered}} form of {{the word}} [...] "Hell". The <b>most</b> infamous and <b>prevalent</b> of the conversions by the filter.|$|R
5|$|A {{widespread}} misconception {{has arisen}} in Pakistan that polio vaccine contained Haram ingredients and could cause impotence and infertility in male children, leading some less-educated parents {{not to have}} their children vaccinated. This belief is <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA region, where {{people are likely to}} be influenced by conservative teachings. There also have been attacks on polio vaccination teams. This is hampering international efforts to eradicate polio in Pakistan and globally since the virus can be carried by travelers.|$|E
5|$|A-line. Founded by Anselmo, born 1926. One of the <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> lines today, {{descendants}} {{include the}} second-largest number of stallions at stud. Anselmo was {{brought back to}} stud {{at the age of}} 21, when a lack of stallions after World War II led to concerns that the line would not survive, and produced several stallions now represented in all Haflinger breeding populations worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Among his <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> {{skills are}} his speed and wrist shot, {{the latter of}} which has {{improved}} alongside his recent years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, he is an efficient shot blocker, using his body {{to get in the}} way of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size and strength to maintain position in front of the opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E
50|$|Several {{adaptations of}} Gendlin's {{original}} six-step Focusing process have been developed. The <b>most</b> popular and <b>prevalent</b> {{of these is}} the process Ann Weiser Cornell teaches, called Inner Relationship Focusing.|$|R
50|$|Adults who are {{afflicted with}} LPR often {{experience}} the acrid taste of bile {{emanating from the}} back of their throat. This is also likely to be accompanied by a lump-like sensation in the throat, making it difficult to swallow. The throat may also seem to burn and breathing can be difficult. These symptoms are <b>most</b> often <b>prevalent</b> just after waking.|$|R
50|$|A large dairy {{operates}} in Crossmaglen. Apart from the dairy, most properties in Crossmaglen {{can be considered}} as semi rural, with hobby farms <b>prevalent.</b> <b>Most</b> properties range from 5-100 acres in size.|$|R
5|$|Decorated rustication. Sebastiano Serlio had {{decorated}} the blocks of ashlar in his rustication; {{by the end}} of the 16th century, Sicilian architects were ornamenting the blocks with carvings of leaves, fish-scales, and even sweets and shells; shells were later to become among the <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> ornamental symbols of Baroque design. Sometimes the rustication would be used for pillars rather than walls, a reversal of expectations and almost an architectural joke (illustration 2).|$|E
5|$|Harrison County has {{a diverse}} economy. Manufacturing {{industry}} is {{centered in the}} Corydon Industrial Park where automobile-related manufacturing is <b>most</b> <b>prevalent.</b> There is large scale farming throughout the rural areas of the county; corn and soybeans are the county's largest crops. A service and shopping district is centered in Corydon. There are several medical facilities in the county including the Harrison County Hospital, two nursing facilities operated by Kindred Healthcare, {{and a number of}} private practices.|$|E
5|$|In early 1968, media {{coverage}} {{in the aftermath of}} the Tet Offensive spurred increased protests in opposition to the Vietnam War, especially among university students. The protests were <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> in the US, but on 17 March, several thousand demonstrators marched to the American embassy in London's Grosvenor Square and violently clashed with police. Major protests concerning other political issues made international news, such as the March 1968 protests in Poland against their communist government, and the campus uprisings of May 1968 in France.|$|E
40|$|Vitamin-A {{deficiency}} {{continues to}} be one of the <b>most</b> widely <b>prevalent</b> and devastating nutritional diseases of man. This is in spite of the discovery of vitamin A more than half a century ago and its now ready availability in inexpensive concentrated form. Lack of knowledge at many levels is the basis of this tragic situation, which may result in needless blindness and loss of life, especially among young children...|$|R
50|$|Dorsal {{colouration}} is cryptic, brown. A pale oblique lateral stripe is present. Dorsal skin {{is smooth}} or with irregularly scattered granules or tubercles, <b>most</b> distinct and <b>prevalent</b> posteriorly. In adult males, third finger is swollen.|$|R
6000|$|We now {{reach the}} crucial {{point at which}} {{historical}} blunders and confusions have been <b>most</b> maddeningly <b>prevalent.</b> Mr. Pettigrew, writing in 1859, {{had no knowledge of}} Cecil's corroboration of the story of the libel--Amy in no need of physic, and the intention to poison her. Mr. Froude, however, published in his History a somewhat erroneous version of de Quadra's letter about Cecil's revelations, and Mr. Rye (1885) accused Dudley on the basis of Mr. Froude's version.* ...|$|R
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|E
5|$|Some {{clinical}} guidelines recommend {{the use of}} RSTs in people with pharyngitis, but others do not. US guidelines are more consistently in favor of their use than their European equivalents. The use of RSTs may be most beneficial in the third world, where the complications of streptococcal infection are <b>most</b> <b>prevalent,</b> but their use in these regions has not been well studied.|$|E
5|$|The {{gates of}} the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze treated with {{depletion}} gilding. The process was <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> in Alexandria, where alchemy {{is thought to have}} begun. In ancient India, copper was used in the holistic medical science Ayurveda for surgical instruments and other medical equipment. Ancient Egyptians (~2400BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later to treat headaches, burns, and itching.|$|E
5000|$|Being {{part of a}} clique {{is usually}} seen as a norm in society {{regardless}} of status. Cliques are <b>most</b> likely <b>prevalent</b> during teenage years, but are found in other age groups. Cliques may be formed among, for example, athletes, nerds, workmates, fraternities, sororities, and cheerleaders. Cohesive factors may include ethnicity, similar interest, and physical appearance. Members of a clique often isolate themselves as a group and tend to view the clique as superior to anyone outside the clique.|$|R
5000|$|Celtic: The second <b>most</b> common faction, <b>prevalent</b> in The Gallic Wars, Conquest of Britain and Pacifying the North. Unique units {{include the}} Celtic Warband (infantry), Celtic Fanatics and Celtic Cavalry. Celtic {{buildings}} are distinctly green, featuring domed city halls topped with grass.|$|R
500|$|The Kalikula (family of Kali) form of Shaktism is most {{dominant}} in Nepal, northern and eastern India, and is <b>most</b> widely <b>prevalent</b> in West Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Odisha, {{as well as}} parts of Maharashtra, Bangladesh and some parts of Kerala. Kalikula lineages focus upon the Devi {{as the source of}} wisdom (vidya) and liberation (moksha). They generally stand [...] "in opposition to the brahmanic tradition," [...] which they view as [...] "overly conservative and denying the experiential part of religion." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} of Hamersley is predominantly Australian-born, with some 69.8% {{of its residents}} being born in Australia as at the 2011 census. The second <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> birthplace was the United Kingdom at 9.3%, followed by New Zealand at 3.6%. 6.4% of Hamersley's population reported one or both parents of Italian birth, with the strongest concentration in the Vickers Street district (13.4%). Other significant minorities included those of Chinese (2.2%), Macedonian (1.9%), Indian (1.6%) heritage.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; of those found in A. ocreata, α-amanitin is the <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> and along with β-amanitin {{is likely to be}} responsible for the toxic effects. The major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism stop and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the first organ encountered after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible to the toxins.|$|E
5|$|At 9:42a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{grounded}} all civilian aircraft {{within the}} continental U.S., and civilian aircraft already in flight {{were told to}} land immediately. All international civilian aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in Canada or Mexico, and were banned from landing on United States territory for three days. The attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air traffic controllers. Among the unconfirmed and often contradictory news reports aired throughout the day, one of the <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> said a car bomb had been detonated at the U.S. State Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C. Another jet—Delta Air Lines Flight 1989—was suspected of having been hijacked, but the aircraft responded to controllers and landed safely in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
50|$|Narcissus {{degeneration}} virus (NDV) is a plant pathogenic Potyvirus of {{the family}} Potyviridae which infects plants of the genus Narcissus. It {{is one of the}} <b>most</b> serious and <b>prevalent</b> of the approximately 21 viruses which infect this genus.NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in N. tazetta.|$|R
40|$|As vaccine {{potential}} of cross-species protection by a candidate antigen is less explored, {{in this study}} we compared cross-specific protective efficacy of KinetoplastidMembrane Protein- 11 (KMP- 11) as aDNAvaccine alone and in conjunction with exogenous IL- 12 administration in experimental BALB/c model against two <b>most</b> widely <b>prevalent</b> forms of clinical diseases caused by Leishmania major (LM) and Leishmania donovani (LD). Whereas, KMP- 11 DNA vaccination alone showed significant potential in terms of resolution of splenic and hepatic parasite burden against virulent LD challenge, it showed considerably less efficacy (< 70...|$|R
5000|$|The Played in Britain {{series was}} {{launched}} in 2004, following a pilot study conducted in Manchester in 2002 as part of English Heritage’s contribution to the cultural programme of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. It frequently cites as its inspiration the words of Joseph Strutt, author of the seminal book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, first published in 1801. Strutt wrote, “In order to form a just estimation {{of the character of}} any particular people, it is absolutely necessary to investigate the sports and pastimes <b>most</b> generally <b>prevalent</b> among them.” ...|$|R
5|$|Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop {{studied the}} effects of various factors, {{including}} different substances in blood and different temperatures, on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria (Plasmodium gallinaceum) vector, Aedes aegypti. She also examined factors that contributed to Plasmodium reproduction. This work {{became the basis for}} subsequent ongoing research into a malaria vaccine. Her subsequent work was spurred by the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort because the <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies. From 1947 to 1964, she {{was in charge of the}} Institute's Chemotherapy Research Institute, associated with the Medical Research Council.|$|E
5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre of music that {{originated}} {{in the early to}} mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.|$|E
5|$|Lead is the <b>most</b> <b>prevalent</b> {{heavy metal}} contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised {{societies}} have been {{estimated to be}} {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E
40|$|Many {{tuberculosis}} control activities {{are based on}} principles learned from studies of tuberculosis transmission. To date, these have largely been limited to outbreak investigations in confined geographical regions. In this report conventional and computerized DNA fingerprint- based approaches were integrated {{to demonstrate that the}} <b>most</b> widely <b>prevalent</b> strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from New York City was cultured from only 1 of 755 patients in San Francisco, Calif, who was a traveling salesman. Large-scale molecular epidemiologic studies may provide {{a better understanding of the}} dynamics of tuberculosis transmission between geographic regions and suggest rational measures to interrupt such transmission...|$|R
5000|$|Of {{her work}} she says “for {{the past twenty}} years or so, my visual preoccupation within my {{practice}} has manifested itself in terms of human form. Sometimes this has been bodies, but the power, for me, is around the head in some way. I did a series of some two hundred works, derived from more than eighty participants, just concentrating on their facial features, but I’m not sure I’d call them portraits. I have done portraits of other people, but perhaps, as an only child, who often had to entertain herself, the self-portrait has been <b>most</b> consistently <b>prevalent</b> throughout my practice.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Tribal: The <b>most</b> common faction, <b>prevalent</b> in the Tutorial, Unification of Italy, Hispania, and Germania. Featured units include Archers, Javelinmen (both {{of which}} are also {{available}} to all other non-Roman factions), various infantry (Hill Tribe Warriors, German and Spanish Mercenaries) and cavalry (Italiot Greek Cavalry). Tribal buildings are mostly brown and have a rustic look.|$|R
