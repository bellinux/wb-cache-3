Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellar}} cortex {{is divided into}} three layers. At the bottom lies the thick granular layer, densely packed with granule cells, along with interneurons, mainly Golgi cells but also including Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells. In the middle lies the Purkinje layer, a narrow zone that contains the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glial cells. At the top lies the <b>molecular</b> <b>layer,</b> which contains the flattened dendritic trees of Purkinje cells, along with the huge array of parallel fibers penetrating the Purkinje cell dendritic trees at right angles. This outermost layer of the {{cerebellar cortex}} also contains two types of inhibitory interneuron: stellate cells and basket cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of nanoconfined water layers are still poorly understood {{and continue to}} create considerable controversy, despite their importance for biology and nanotechnology. Here, we report on dynamic nanomechanical measurements of water films compressed down to a few single <b>molecular</b> <b>layers.</b> We show that the {{mechanical properties}} of nanoconfined water layers change dramatically with their dynamic state. In particular, we observed a sharp transition from viscous to elastic response even at extremely slow compression rates, indicating that mechanical relaxation times increase dramatically once water is compressed to less than 3 - 4 <b>molecular</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Diffusion {{coefficients}} {{obtained from}} weighted mean square displacements along probe molecule trajectories within ultrathin liquid TEHOS films show a correlation with film thickness. By studying cumulative distributions obtained {{with a time}} resolution of 20 ms, we could show that the diffusion is heterogeneous within our liquid films which consist of a few <b>molecular</b> <b>layers</b> only. We detected two components of the diffusion process, a slower and a faster one. Thinning of the film due to evaporation caused a slowdown of the whole diffusion process. But this resulted not from a slowdown in the two contributing components itself. Instead their relative contributions changed in favor for the slow component. We conclude {{that there is no}} pronounced difference in the diffusion coefficients attributed to the <b>molecular</b> <b>layers</b> 3 to 5 vertically above the substrate, but with the loss of upper layers along with the thinning process the concentration of probe molecules in the near surface region containing only one or two <b>molecular</b> <b>layers</b> is increased...|$|R
25|$|A decade later, Davson and Danielli {{proposed}} a modification to this concept. In their model, the lipid bilayer was coated {{on either side}} {{with a layer of}} globular proteins. According to their view, this protein coat had no particular structure and was simply formed by adsorption from solution. Their theory was also incorrect in that it ascribed the barrier properties of the membrane to electrostatic repulsion from the protein layer rather than the energetic cost of crossing the hydrophobic core. A more direct investigation of the membrane was made possible through the use of electron microscopy in the late 1950s. After staining with heavy metal labels, Sjöstrand et al. noted two thin dark bands separated by a light region, which they incorrectly interpreted as a single <b>molecular</b> <b>layer</b> of protein. A more accurate interpretation was made by J. David Robertson, who determined that the dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers. In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This {{was the first time the}} bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes.|$|E
25|$|Thus, by {{the early}} twentieth century the chemical, but not the {{structural}} nature of the cell membrane was known. Two experiments in 1924 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick. Although the results of this experiment were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single <b>molecular</b> <b>layer.</b> Because the polar lipid headgroups are fully hydrated, they do not show up in a capacitance measurement meaning that this experiment actually measured the thickness of the hydrocarbon core, not the whole bilayer. Gorter and Grendel approached the problem from a different perspective, performing a solvent extraction of erythrocyte lipids and spreading the resulting material as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses of this experiment showed several problems including an incorrect monolayer pressure, incomplete lipid extraction and a miscalculation of cell surface area. In spite of these issues the fundamental conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer- was correct.|$|E

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the thickness {{as a function of}} time of liquid films as they are squeezed between molecularly smooth mica surfaces. Three Newtonian, nonpolar liquids have been studied: octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, n-tetradecane, and n-hexadecane. The film thicknesses are determined with an accuracy of 0. 2 nm as they drain from ∼ 1 μm to a few <b>molecular</b> <b>layers.</b> Results are in excellent agreement with the Reynolds theory of lubrication for film thicknesses above 50 nm. For thinner films the drainage is slower than the theoretical prediction, which can be accounted for by assuming that the liquid within about two <b>molecular</b> <b>layers</b> of each solid surface does not undergo shear. In very thin films the continuum Reynolds theory breaks down, as drainage occurs in a series of abrupt steps whose size matches the thickness of <b>molecular</b> <b>layers</b> in the liquid.

500|$|When {{phospholipids}} {{are exposed}} to water, they self-assemble into a two-layered sheet with the hydrophobic tails pointing {{toward the center of}} the sheet.

The assembly process is driven by interactions between hydrophobic molecules (also called the hydrophobic effect). [...] An increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules (causing clustering of hydrophobic regions) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other, increasing the entropy of the system.

Two different types of characteristic diffuse scattering along c* were observed during the phase transformation. The strong diffuse streaks along row lines hκζ with h＋κ odd, of which intensity distributions changed continually as the transfomation proceeds, was analyzed using the stacking disorder model of 4 kinds of averge <b>molecular</b> <b>layers.</b> Furthermore the weak diffuse streaks with h＋κ even, of which intensity distribution remain almost unchanged during the transformation, was able to explain it by a disorder positioing model of the terminal methyl group (trans and gauche Ⅱ).

50|$|The {{observation}} that parylenes could form ordered <b>molecular</b> <b>layers</b> (MLs) came with contact angle measurements, where MLs thicker than 10 Å had an equilibrium contact angle of 80 degrees (same as bulk parylene N) but those thinner had a reduced contact angle. This was also confirmed with electrical measurements (bias-temperature stress measurements) using metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors (MISCAPs). In short, parylene N and AF-4 (those parylenes with no functional groups) are pin-hole free at ~14 Å. This results because the parylene repeat units possess a phenyl ring {{and due to}} the high electronic polarizability of the phenyl ring adjacent repeat units order themselves in the XY-plane. As {{a result of this}} interaction parylene MLs are surface independent, except for transition metals, which de-activate the triplet (benzoid) state and therefore the parylenes cannot be initiated. This finding of parylenes as <b>molecular</b> <b>layers</b> is very powerful for industrial applications because of the robustness of the process and that the MLs are deposited at room temperature. In this way parylenes can be used as diffusion barriers and for reducing the polarizability of surface (de-activation of oxide surfaces).
