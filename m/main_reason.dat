5|$|Human {{activity}} {{is arguably the}} <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is the <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> for the decline of population.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known religious monument is the Catholic holy well in Penrhys first {{mentioned in}} the 15th century, though {{it may have been}} a place of pagan worship before this. This pilgrimage site was identified as a 'manor' belonging to the Cistercian Abbey of Llantarnam and was seen as one of the most important religious sites in Wales, because of its Marian shrine. This holy site was the <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> people would pass through the commote; it was even thought to be the <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> why the first bridges were built over the River Rhondda.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis is the <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> for 3.7million {{visits to}} {{physicians}} {{a year in}} the United States and 3million visits in France.

5|$|In {{towns and}} central country districts during the 18th century, log walls were {{increasingly}} covered by weatherboards, a fashion {{made possible by}} sawmill technology. These buildings were better insulated and better protected against the harsh climate. But the <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> for the rapid adoption of this custom was the more fashionable appearance of boarded walls, which were more suitable than bare log walls as a background to details and ornaments borrowed from classical architecture.|$|E
5|$|Mahshi (pl. mahshi) {{dishes are}} {{composed}} of rice stuffed vegetables such as, eggplants, baby pumpkins, potatoes, carrots and marrows {{as well as a}} variety of leaf vegetables, primarily grape leaves, cabbage leaves and less often chard. Mahshi requires delicacy and time—the <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> it is prepared before the day it is cooked and served. Many female family members participate in the rolling and stuffing of the vegetables, relaxing the amount of individual effort required, with great attention to detail.|$|E
5|$|New In Chess {{observed}} in its 2000 Yearbook {{that of the}} 731,740games in its database, White scored 54.8% overall; with the two most popular opening moves, White scored 54.1% in 349,855games beginning 1.e4, and 56.1% in 296,200games beginning 1.d4. The <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> that 1.e4 was less effective than 1.d4 was the Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5), which gave White only a 52.3% score in 145,996games.|$|E

5|$|Newman {{was awarded}} the Order of Canada in 1981, the country's highest {{civilian}} honour. Shortly thereafter he returned to live in Britain again for some time following the death in 1981 of his wife Elizabeth McRae, to whom he had been married since 1944. His <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> for {{going back to the}} UK was to attempt, unsuccessfully, to produce a drama series about the Bloomsbury Group for the new Channel 4 network.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> {{to go into}} hiatus was that, {{in early}} 2003, their lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she has {{released}} two solo albums—Love.

5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, {{it turns out to}} be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> is that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{volcanic}} {{areas in the}} world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure is loose, eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{adult male}} ruffs start to moult {{into the main}} display plumage before their return to the {{breeding}} areas, {{and the proportion of}} birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> of the delayed moult.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the disaster, new safety {{legislation}} was proposed. The local economy declined because the factory was closed down. Imperial intended to rebuild it and return to production by the end of 2008, with replacement buildings to be completed by summer the following year.

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> is that the police districts {{see it as a}} waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E

In early 2008, Anthony Kiedis finally confirmed this, citing exhaustion from constant work since Californication as the <b>main</b> <b>reason.</b> Frusciante quit the group on July 29, 2009, but did not publicly announce his departure until December 2009, {{two months after the}} band ended their hiatus in October 2009 and began work on their next album with Josh Klinghoffer as their new guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Author Roald Dahl {{disapproved of}} the 1971 film {{adaptation}} and declined the film rights {{to produce the}} sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The purchase was finalized in 1998, with Dahl's widow, Felicity ("Liccy"), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl Estate's subsequent protection of the source material was the <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.|$|E
