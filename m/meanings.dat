5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, <b>meanings,</b> and a code connecting signs with their <b>meanings.</b> The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and <b>meanings</b> are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E

40|$|The first {{question}} under Consideration {{is whether it}} is possible to explicate the <b>meaning</b> of 'meaning' (in the sense of Carnap's 'meaning explication'). It is argued then that we have to distinguish just between <b>meaning</b> 1 and <b>meaning</b> 2 : <b>Meaning</b> 1 refers to the proper semantic <b>meaning</b> whereas <b>meaning</b> 2 refers to a pragmatic <b>meaning</b> expressed by the form 'S means that p'. The statement follows that there is no possibility of giving an explication of <b>meaning</b> directly based on <b>meaning</b> 1. Concerning <b>meaning</b> 2, arguments are given which demonstrate the identity of <b>meaning</b> 2 with material implication. An explication of <b>meaning</b> 2 would show tight resemblances to Tarski's well- known truth-definition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Dictionary is {{not enough}} to give a <b>meaning</b> of a {{particular}} word or sentence. Therefore, one needs <b>meaning</b> in context to formulate the <b>meaning</b> in order to make sure the intended <b>meaning,</b> particularly the <b>meaning</b> of Holy Quran. It {{is no doubt that the}} similar <b>meaning</b> (synonym) has an effect on expansion. It gives a particular <b>meaning</b> on a certain sentence. As a result, <b>meaning</b> is sometimes restricted and can not be  intercpreted freely. It is safe to say that semantically, the <b>meaning</b> is restricted on a certain <b>meaning.</b> Pragmatically, howevers, <b>meaning</b> needs a context. So that <b>meaning</b> and context is related each other. Context, then is needed in interpreting the use of a sentence and expression. Keyword:  المعجم, الدلالة, والسياق, والتكنولوجي...|$|R

5|$|The {{meaning of}} a reconstructed root is {{conventionally}} that of a verb; the terms root and verbal root are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from {{a limited number of}} so-called root nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in verbal inflection through well-established morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their <b>meanings</b> are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in the <b>meanings</b> of reflexes in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verbal roots via suffixes and ablaut.|$|E

Compared with verbs, coverbs are far more numerous and far more semantically rich. Verbs express simple, broad <b>meanings</b> such as yu- 'be', ya- 'go' and di- 'come', while coverbs convey more specific, semantically narrow <b>meanings</b> such as barnhbarn-na 'make footprints', lerdongh-nga 'play (a didjeridu)' or murr-ma 'wade through shallow water using your feet to search for something'.|$|E

It discusses how quantitative and qualitative research methods handle ‘meaning’ in data analysis. It examines the relationship between <b>meaning</b> and <b>meaning</b> making in data collection and data analysis. Different research methods treat <b>meaning</b> and <b>meaning</b> making differently. This variation reflects researchers’ view on what research is and their role in research. <b>Meaning</b> making takes place at different linguistic and discourse levels.

5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular <b>meanings.</b> This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E
5|$|Around 1924 Whorf {{first became}} {{interested}} in linguistics. Originally he analyzed Biblical texts, seeking to uncover hidden layers of meaning. Inspired by the esoteric work La langue hebraïque restituée by Antoine Fabre d'Olivet, he began a semantic and grammatical analysis of Biblical Hebrew. Whorf's early manuscripts on Hebrew and Maya {{have been described as}} exhibiting a considerable degree of mysticism, as he sought to uncover esoteric <b>meanings</b> of glyphs and letters.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} advent of printing, the visual {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed <b>meanings</b> in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem. In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new <b>meanings</b> become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E
5|$|Further to derivational and inflectional morphemes, Wagiman coverbs and {{nominals}} often undergo reduplication, whereby a part, or {{often the}} entirety of the root, is repeated. Reduplication can convey a multitude of <b>meanings.</b> When coverbs are reduplicated, the resulting derived coverb may involve added meaning components such as iterativity, duration or habituality.|$|E
