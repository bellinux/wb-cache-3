5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> take on {{a wider range of}} tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers would be paid a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E
5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E
500|$|In her {{review of}} the anime's first episode, Meghan Sullivan of IGN praised the visuals and fight choreography, but felt that the story would be {{confusing}} to those not already familiar with the game. She finished by calling the episode [...] "a solid start to what will hopefully be a memorable anime". Michelle Nguyen of Geek.com, writing following the release of [...] "Sword and Shield", was generally positive about the anime, praising its characters despite her dislike {{for the lack of}} playable female characters in the game itself. Speaking about each episode, she found the first episode to be rather weak, and ranked [...] "Dogged Runner" [...] high for changing Prompto into a more complex character. Andrew Webster, writing for The Verge, said that the anime captured the game's mixture of humor and traditional role-playing story tropes, sharing Nguyen's praise for [...] "Dogged Runner", and saying that the anime made him <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> play the game itself.|$|E

500|$|During the Brezhnev Era, {{pressure}} from below forced the Soviet leadership to alter some cultural policies, though the fundamental {{characteristics of the}} Communist system remained the same. Rock music and jeans, which had been criticized as hallmarks of Western culture, were legalized. The Soviet Union even started to manufacture its own jeans in the 1970s. As time progressed, however, the youth were <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> buy Western products. The Soviet black market flourished during the Brezhnev Era, and [...] "fake Western jeans" [...] became very popular according to Archie Brown. Western rock groups such as The Beatles remained very popular throughout the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, even if Soviet official policy remained wary of it. Soviet rock music evolved, and became a form of dissidence against the Soviet system. Vladimir Vysotsky, Alexander Galich and Bulat Okudzhava were the most renowned rock musicians, and their lyrics, and music in general, were critical of the country's Stalinist past, {{as well as its}} undemocratic system. In a 1981 editorial published in Pravda, Viktor Chebrikov, a deputy KGB head, commented on the apathy of Soviet youth towards the system and accused the West of using concepts such as consumerism, religion, and nationalism to encourage [...] "pessimism, nihilism, and the pervasive view that life is better in the West." [...] He also argued that foreign groups of Estonians, Latvians, and other ethnicities had a considerable influence on Soviet society.|$|E

2500|$|The big freedom {{given to}} schools {{results in a}} {{constant}} competition to be the [...] "best" [...] school. The schools get certain reputations amongst parents and employers. So it's important for schools {{to be the best}} school since the subsidies depend on the number of pupils. This competition has been pinpointed as {{one of the main reasons}} for the high overall quality of the Flemish education. However, the importance of a school's reputation also makes schools <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> expel pupils that don't perform well. Resulting in the ethnic differences and the well-known waterfall system: pupils start high in the perceived hierarchy, and then drop towards more professional oriented directions or [...] "easier" [...] schools when they can't handle the pressure any longer.|$|E

2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of [...] that Abraham's servant had [...] "all the goods of his master's in his hand," [...] Rabbi Helbo {{explained}} {{that this was a}} deed of gift (made by Abraham of all his wealth to Isaac, so that a bride would be <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> marry him). Similarly, Rabbi Simeon (or some say Rabbi Shemajah) taught that Abraham wrote a will that bequeathed all that he had as an inheritance to Isaac, as [...] says, [...] "And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac." [...] Abraham took the document and gave to Eliezer, his servant, who reasoned that since the document was in his hand, all Abraham's money was in his hand, so that he might go and be recommended thereby in Abraham's father's house and with his family.|$|E
2500|$|Mylo Xyloto {{received}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, receiving {{a score of}} 65 out of 100 from review aggregator Metacritic based on 39 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] In a five-star review, Simon Goddard of Q wrote that Mylo Xyloto [...] "will, at the bare minimum, safely sustain their imperial position {{for a long time}} to come", singling out Martin and Buckland's musical contributions and Eno and Dravs' production for praise. Mikael Wood of Spin wrote that like Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, Mylo Xyloto [...] "draws from an expansive palette that makes Coldplay's first three albums sound even quainter" [...] and that [...] "where Viva La Vida showcased Coldplay's sense of adventure, this [...] feels <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> please". Citing the album the band's most ambitious effort, Josh Eels of Rolling Stone noted that [...] "the choruses are bigger, the textures grander, the optimism more optimistic" [...] and described it as a [...] "bear-hug record for a bear-market world". The Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick called the record [...] "irresistible", noting its [...] "adventurous" [...] mood and [...] "luxuriously colourful" [...] sound. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork wrote that the album sees the band [...] "successfully continuing to explore the tension of wanting to be one of the best bands in the world and having to settle for being one of the biggest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources (CBR) gave A-Force #1 four-and-a-half stars {{out of five}} writing, [...] "A-Force #1 is a triumph, {{taking a}} concept that could have simply been dashed off and then ignored and {{turning it into a}} book that I'd cheerfully read every month." [...] Tony Guerrero of Comic Vine gave it four out of five stars saying, [...] "This book was pretty much exactly what I wanted and hoped for. Too many times the female heroes in the Marvel Universe get overlooked. Marguerite Bennett and G. Willow Wilson have created a natural feeling world. It's easy to cry out that having just female heroes is a gimmick but it all simply works here." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the issue an 8.4 out of 10 and said, [...] "While certain details {{regarding}} the nature of this team and their connection to the old marvel Universe remain unclear, A-Force #1 marks a worthy debut for Marvel's newest team book." [...] Eric Diaz of The Nerdist gave it three out of five burritos and wrote, [...] "Overall the issue was fine, and I'm curious to see where it all goes, but I'm far <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> see what can be done with this grouping of [...] awesome female heroes once the wacky conceit of Secret Wars is over and they return to the Marvel Universe proper." [...] Diaz also noted that, [...] " [...] making a decidedly feminist statement by taking nearly all of their major female heroes and putting them together in their own Avengers title called A-Force." [...] Lan Pitts of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 praising the artwork of Jorge Molina, Laura Martin and Matt Milla.|$|E

2500|$|In English Canada, {{support for}} {{government}} {{intervention in the}} economy to defend the country from foreign (i.e. American) influences is one of Canada's oldest political traditions, going {{back at least to}} the National Policy (tariff protection) of Sir John A. Macdonald, and has historically been seen on both the left and the right. [...] However, calls for more extreme forms of government involvement to forestall a putative American takeover have been a staple of the Canadian left since the 1920s, and possibly earlier. [...] Right-wing nationalism has never supported such measures, {{which is one of the}} major differences between the two. [...] Leftist nationalism has also been <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> dispense with historical Canadian symbols associated with Canada's British colonial heritage, such as the Canadian Red Ensign or even the monarchy (see Republicanism in Canada). [...] English Canadian leftist nationalism has historically been represented by most of , factions with the social-democratic New Democratic Party (such as the Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada in the 1960s and 1970s), and in a more diluted form in some elements of the Liberal Party of Canada (such as Trudeauism to a certain extent). [...] Today it manifests itself pressure groups such as the Council of Canadians. [...] This type of nationalism is associated with the slogan [...] "it's either the state or the States", coined by the Canadian Radio League in the 1930s during their campaign for a national public broadcaster to compete with the private, American radio stations broadcasting into Canada, representing a fear of annexation by the United States. [...] Right-wing nationalism continues to exist in Canada, but tends to be much less concerned with integration into North America, especially since the Conservative Party embraced free trade after 1988. [...] As well, many far-right movements in Canada are nationalist, but not Canadian nationalist, instead advocating for Western Separation or union with the United States.|$|E
