5|$|After {{the battle}} of Stalingrad in February 1943, Himmler {{realised}} that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of Sonderkommando 1005, a special task force under SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel. The unit's assignment was to visit <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> on the Eastern Front to exhume bodies and burn them {{in an attempt to}} cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished {{at the end of the}} war, and many <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> remain unmarked and unexcavated.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, an {{exploratory}} excavation discovered <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> {{on the edge}} of Pheasant Wood outside of Fromelles. Two-hundred and fifty British and Australian bodies were excavated from five <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> which were interred in the newly constructed Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery. This was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in more than 50 years, the last such cemeteries having been built after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{preceding}} the Battle of Taejon, {{some of the}} Bodo League massacres took place around Taejon, where between 3,000 and 7,000 South Korean leftist political prisoners were shot and dumped into <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> by South Korean troops, partially recorded by a US Army photographer.|$|E
5000|$|Naklo is {{the site}} of a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> {{associated}} with the Second World War. The Preval Cave 2 <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (Grobišče Jama na Prevali 2)—also known as the Big Preval Cave <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (...) or Fly Cave <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (...) —is located {{on the edge of the}} woods southwest of Matavun. It contains the remains of Slovene civilians and was discovered in 1982.|$|R
50|$|On 1 June 2013, some of {{the victims}} found in the <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> were buried in a Šehidsko mezarje (Martyr Cemetery) in Memići {{alongside}} victims found in the Crni Vrh <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> and the <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> in Kazanbašča by Zvornik.|$|R
5000|$|Log is {{the site}} of a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> {{associated}} with the Second World War. The Boštanj <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (Grobišče Boštanj)—also known as the Boštanj Quarry <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (...) or Log <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (...) —is located south of the settlement, next to an electrical transformer by a quarry. Different sources state that the grave contains the remains of either 14 German soldiers or 200 to 300 Ustaša soldiers.|$|R
5|$|On 3 April 2009, the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights {{announced}} that <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> containing {{the remains of}} approximately 4,500 members of the division had been discovered near Zaprešić. Locals indicated that the Partisan 21st Serbian Division {{was responsible for the}} massacre.|$|E
5|$|Processing {{scenes of}} mass {{fatality}} or incidents of terrorism (i.e. homicide, <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> and war crimes, and other {{violations of human}} rights) is a branch of work that forensic archaeologists are involved with as well.|$|E
5|$|In June 1988, the {{archaeologist}} {{and leader}} of the Christian Conservative Party of the BPF Zyanon Paznyak discovered <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> of victims executed in 1937–41 at Kurapaty, near Minsk. Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people, causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mass</b> <b>grave,</b> {{containing}} {{the bodies of}} hundreds of victims of the Nazis, has been found {{near the site of}} the camp. The <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> {{is believed to be the}} largest <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> in Germany which was not itself within a concentration camp.|$|R
5000|$|Ugljare <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> - 15 {{bodies of}} Serbs {{found in a}} <b>mass</b> <b>grave,</b> {{reported}} on 25 August 1999 by KFOR. The KFOR exhumed the <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> on 27 July. 14 Serbs had been shot, stabbed or clubbed. Ugljare was a KLA stronghold.|$|R
5000|$|Sekirišče is {{the site}} of a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> {{associated}} with the Second World War. The Pavlin Shaft <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (Grobišče Pavlinovo brezno), also known as the Repičnik Shaft <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (...) , is located 1.5 km northeast of Krvava Peč on the south slope of Mount Repičnik. It contains the remains of unidentified victims.|$|R
5|$|Third class {{funerals}} were {{reserved for}} pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense {{in the section}} of the cemetery designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> (other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site. (The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial, but this practice was rare.) Despite this, Brookwood's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period, all of which other than Brookwood continued the practice of <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> for the poor.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Lion Mound, {{there are several}} more {{conventional}} but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels–Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud–Ohain crossroads marks the <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled L'Aigle blessé ("The Wounded Eagle"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. <b>Mass</b> <b>graves</b> were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E

The Savsko Naselje <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (Grobišče v Savskem naselju), also known as the Rušar Meadow <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (...) , {{contains}} the remains of up to 35 German soldiers killed in an engagement with the Partisans in May 1945.|$|R
5|$|In the {{two months}} {{following}} the recapture of the area by Croatia in 1995 during Operation Storm, the bodies of 27 victims were recovered in two <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> containing three and fourteen bodies respectively, and in ten individual graves. In its indictment of Milan Babić, leader of the SAO Krajina {{at the time when}} the killings in Saborsko took place, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) specified that 29 Croat civilians were killed in Saborsko on 12 November 1991.|$|E
5|$|No Gun Ri villagers {{said that}} in later decades, two <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> holding some victims' remains were disturbed, and bones were removed during a {{reforestation}} project, and by farming activity. In 2007, excavations at several places near the bridge turned up little. The forensics team said that it hadn't found more, because so much time had passed, and any remains {{had been exposed to}} the elements and soil erosion, railway work, cultivation, and highly acidic soil.|$|E
5|$|Saborsko was rebuilt {{after the}} war {{with a total of}} 400 houses constructed, but the {{refugees}} returning to the village were mostly elderly {{due to a lack of}} employment options elsewhere. The site of one of the <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> in Saborsko is marked with a monument to the victims. Three different commemorative plaques dedicated to Croatian policemen and troops killed in Saborsko in 1991 were placed at various sites in the village in 2009, but two were stolen on 11 November 2010. The missing commemorative plaques were replaced by November 2011.|$|E

It contains the remains of unknown victims.|$|R
5|$|The {{government}} of Nazi Germany announced {{the discovery of}} <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> in the Katyn Forest in 1943. When the London-based Polish government-in-exile asked for {{an investigation by the}} International Committee of the Red Cross, Stalin immediately severed diplomatic relations with it. The USSR claimed that the victims had been murdered by the Nazis in 1941 and continued to deny responsibility for the massacres until 1990, when it officially acknowledged and condemned the perpetration of the killings by the NKVD, as well as the subsequent cover-up by the Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} {{resulted in}} 178 dead, 588 wounded and 41 captured ARBiH troops. Bosnian Serb losses were 900 killed {{and more than}} 1,000 wounded. In September and October, 6,500 Bosniak and Croat civilians living {{in the area of}} Banja Luka or Prijedor were expelled from their homes by Bosnian Serb forces. Changes of control of territory also allowed access to two <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> near Sanski Most, believed to contain the bodies of 300 civilians killed by Bosnian Serb forces in April 1992.|$|E
5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
5000|$|Puštal is {{the site}} of a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> {{associated}} with the Second World War. The Žovšče <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (Grobišče Žovšče), also known as the Žolšče <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (...) , is located in the Žovšče Commons, on the northeast slope of Dešna Hill, between Puštal and Bodovlje. It contains the remains of about 10 Slovene civilians that were murdered and buried at two locations about 12.5 m apart.|$|R
5000|$|Hrušica is {{the site}} of three <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> from the period {{immediately}} after the Second World War. All of the graves contain the remains of Home Guard prisoners of war that were repatriated from Austria after the war and murdered. Each site contains the remains of an unknown number of victims. The Hrušica No. 56 <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (Grobišče za hišo Hrušica 56) is located behind the house at Huršica no. 56. The Hrušica 1 <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (...) lies 40 m east of the house at Hrušica no. 83, and the Hrušica 2 <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (...) lies on the slope above it.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> from World War II was {{discovered}} near {{the settlement of}} Gornja Kustošija. Exhumations of the <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> began in February 2011, thus far revealing the remains of nine victims.|$|R
5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His <b>mass</b> <b>graves?</b> Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} {{suspect that}} a further 61 individuals killed at Ovčara were buried there as well. They suspect {{one or more}} additional <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> exist in the general area, or that the bodies originally buried at the site were moved to a secondary grave. Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian {{author of a book}} on Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others were buried there. According to her, they were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities and moved to a secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow that body parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E
5|$|Forensic archaeologists {{can help}} {{determine}} potential grave sites {{that might have}} been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave. The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it. The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> to search for additional burial locations.|$|E
50|$|Dol is {{the site}} of a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> from the Second World War. The Ravni 2 <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> (Grobišče v Ravneh 2) is located above Dreta Creek, about 150 m south of the Prodnik farm. Together with the Ravni 1 <b>Mass</b> <b>Grave</b> in {{neighboring}} Gornji Grad, it contains the remains of 100 to 200 people executed by the Partisan command of the Fourth Operation Zone in the fall of 1944.|$|R
