Sea angling trips are operated from Porth Meudwy, fishing for pollock, coley and mackerel; wrasse, bass, mullet and gurnard are also possible. Bass and coley can be caught from the rocks at Porth Iago; and wrasse, pollock and <b>mackerel</b> are plentiful. Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd, but pollock, <b>mackerel,</b> wrasse and conger are caught; huss are plentiful; and ling are found occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic <b>mackerel,</b> Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or <b>mackerel</b> even when they are abundant.|$|E

5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as <b>mackerel,</b> bluefish, herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed mostly on the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse <b>mackerel,</b> pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although <b>mackerel</b> or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E

40|$|This study covers fish larval survey {{conducted}} by the Philippine multi-purpose vessel MV DA-BFAR in the Pacific seaboard and Celebes Sea in May to June 2010. The composition, distribution and abundance of fish eggs and fish larvae are described based on 40 sampling stations. There were 87 families identified and 8. 8 % of the total samples were Scombridae (tunas and <b>mackerels).</b> Of the tunas and <b>mackerels,</b> 39 % were yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), 21 % skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), 15 % bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and 15 % <b>mackerels.</b> Majority of these species were under preflexion stage. Attempt was also made to compare the composition and distribution of tuna larvae according to four geographical areas(Batanes-Polilio Island, Catanduanes-Eastern Samar, Siargao-Davao, and Mindanao-Celebes Sea) ...|$|R

In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic <b>mackerel</b> fishery, which forced it to be shut down.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts are {{economically}} {{important in}} different ways. They are captured for food around the world. A {{small number of}} species such as herring, cod, pollock, anchovy, tuna and <b>mackerel</b> provide people with {{millions of tons of}} food per year, while many other species are fished in smaller amounts.

5|$|The fishing {{industry}} remains {{an important part}} of the provincial economy, employing 26,000 and contributing over $440 million to the GDP. The combined harvest of fish such as cod, haddock, halibut, herring and <b>mackerel</b> was 150,000tonnes (165,000tons) valued at about $130million in 2006. Shellfish, such as crab, shrimp and clams, accounted for 195,000tonnes (215,000tons) with a value of $316million in the same year. The value of products from the seal hunt was $55million.|$|E
5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake <b>mackerel,</b> and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate <b>mackerel,</b> needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E

40|$|In the East China Sea, mutual {{seasonal}} {{changes can}} be observed between the Kuroshiwo warm current and the coastal water mass (Fig. 1). Hydrographical conditions on the white marlin fishing grounds depend upon the changes of these two water masses. As shown in the charts (Fig. 3 -A, B, C&D), the fishing grounds of white marlins roughly coincide with those of <b>mackerels</b> irrespective of the fishing seasons, hence {{it is to be}} considered that <b>mackerels</b> play a part as a biological factor for white marlins. The fishing grounds in winter are formed in the outside vicinity of the cold front (near Lat. 26 °N) {{in the southern part of}} the East China Sea, while in spring and summer the fishing grounds are found in the outside vicinity of the low-salinity front (near Lat. 29 °N) in the eastern part of the East China Sea (Fig. 2). In autumn such frontal areas become undistinguishable and still the fishing grounds of white marlins and those of <b>mackerels</b> are formed overlapping each other (Fig. 3 -D), therefore it seems very likely that the formation of the white marlin fishing grounds in autumn depend more on the distribution of <b>mackerels</b> rather than on the hydrographic conditions. ...|$|R
