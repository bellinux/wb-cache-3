2500|$|The two XP-51Bs were a more {{thorough}} conversion than the Mustang X, with a tailor-made engine installation and a complete redesign of the radiator duct. The airframe itself was strengthened, with the fuselage and engine mount area receiving more formers because of the [...] greater weight of the Packard V-1650-3 compared with the V-1710. The engine cowling was completely redesigned to house the Packard Merlin, which, because of the intercooler radiator mounted on the supercharger casing, was [...] taller and used an updraught carburetor, rather than the downdraught variety of the Allison. The new engine drove a four-bladed -diameter Hamilton Standard propeller that featured cuffs of hard <b>molded</b> <b>rubber.</b> To cater for the increased cooling requirements of the Merlin, a new fuselage duct was designed. This housed a larger radiator, which incorporated a section for the supercharger coolant, and, forward of this and slightly lower, an oil cooler was housed in a secondary duct which drew air through the main opening and exhausted via a separate exit flap.|$|E

5000|$|RTV {{silicone}} rubber has excellent release properties compared to <b>mold</b> <b>rubbers,</b> which is especially an advantage when doing production casting of resins (polyurethane, polyester, and epoxy). No release agent is required, obviating post-production cleanup. Silicones also exhibit good chemical resistance and high-temperature resistance (205 °C, 400 °F and higher). For this reason silicone molds {{are suitable for}} casting low-melt metals and alloys (e.g. zinc, tin, pewter, and Wood's metal).|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} two different rapid technologies, namely, MultiJet Modeling (MJM) and silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>molding</b> to manufacture investment casting pattern of gas turbine blade. For this reason, the second stage blade of Ruston TA 1750 (1. 3 MW) gas turbine was digitized using CMM and then its wax pattern manufactured by MJM technology and silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>molding</b> technique. Regarding the inspection results of manufactured patterns, maximum deviation of MJM pattern was - 0. 111 mm. While for pattern fabricated using silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>molding,</b> maximum deviation was + 0. 298 mm. Considering results of this experimental research, both techniques are usable to manufacture expendable pattern of gas turbine blade {{but in terms of}} part accuracy, silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>molding</b> is not successful approach for manufacturing of blade expendable patterns. MJM technology enjoys more dimensional accuracy as well as more ability compare with silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>molding</b> technique...|$|R
5000|$|The spin {{casting process}} {{typically}} uses vulcanized silicone or organic rubber as the mold-making substrate. Vulcanization {{is an integral}} step that occurs halfway through the mold-making process. Prior to vulcanization, the <b>mold</b> <b>rubber</b> is a soft and malleable solid-like fluid, in many ways very similar to Silly Putty. Because of the clay-like nature at this stage, the mold is easily cut or shaped to accommodate irregular models. Vulcanization serves two purposes: establishing the negative space inside the mold as well as hardening the rubber so it will remain strong and rigid during casting.|$|R

5000|$|As {{with the}} yo-yo, {{the design of}} the diabolo has varied through history and across the world. Chinese diabolos have been made of bamboo. Wooden diabolos were common in Victorian times in Britain. Rubber diabolos were first {{patented}} by Gustave Phillippart in 1905. In the late twentieth century a rubberised plastic material was first used. Metal has also been used especially for fire diabolos. [...] "Parker Brothers used steel for the bobbins axles, with <b>molded</b> <b>rubber</b> ends, and also made some versions out of hollow Celluloid--which, because of its 'frictionless' properties, spun even faster than steel." [...] Holes and metal strips alter the sound of the spinning diabolo, but create friction.|$|E
50|$|Spin casting, {{also known}} as {{centrifugal}} <b>rubber</b> <b>mold</b> casting (CRMC), is a method of utilizing centrifugal force to produce castings from a <b>rubber</b> <b>mold.</b> Typically, a disc-shaped mold is spun along its central axis at a set speed. The casting material, usually molten metal or liquid thermoset plastic, is then poured in through an opening at the top-center of the mold. The filled mold then continues to spin as the metal solidifies or the thermoset plastic sets.|$|R

50|$|In the 1981 case of Diamond v. Diehr, the United States Supreme Court {{upheld the}} CCPA's {{reversal}} of the Patent Office, and ordered the {{grant of a patent}} on a process for curing <b>rubber</b> in a <b>mold,</b> a substantial part of which involved use of a computer program that used a well-known formula (the Arrhenius Equation) for calculating the time when rubber was cured and the mold could therefore be opened. The Supreme Court stated that in this case, the invention was not merely a mathematical algorithm, but a process for <b>molding</b> <b>rubber,</b> which used the mathematical formula for an industrial purpose, and was therefore patent eligible. In the Diehr case, there was no concession (as there was in Flook) that the implementation was conventional, and the process did effectuate a transformation of substances (from uncured rubber to cured rubber).|$|R
5000|$|In older cars, the {{trunnion}} {{is part of}} the suspension and either allows free movement of the rear wheel hub in relation to the chassis or allows the front wheel hub to rotate with the steering.

American Motors recommended lubrication of its pre-packed front suspension trunnions using a sodium base grease every 32000 mi or three years. It later incorporated <b>molded</b> <b>rubber</b> [...] "Clevebloc" [...] bushings on the upper trunnion to seal out dirt and retain silicone lubricant {{for the life of the}} car.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Corgi Toys, Mettoy mainly produced tin plate toys. However, in the early 1950s, they began producing a few products in cast metal. The first was a large scale wind-up racer made with a cast aluminum body and tin plate wheels. The body material was soon changed to die cast zinc and it was refitted with cast wheels and <b>molded</b> <b>rubber</b> tires. Other models followed and the product line was given the name [...] "Castoys." [...] These were the direct ancestors of Corgi Toys. Two models from this range are notable to Corgi Toys collectors. The first was a promotional Karrier Bantam bottle truck produced for CWS Soft Drinks, but not otherwise released. The second was a die cast service ramp used in a tin plate service station set. Both of these models would later reappear in slightly revised forms as Corgi Toys 455 and 1401.|$|E

This has been carried on as stylized reinforcing pads of rubber on the knees and elbows to protect the suit from wear, and allows logos to be directly bonded onto raw sheet rubber. Additionally, the Animal Skin's looser fit allowed for the use of a supplemental vest in extreme conditions.|$|E
