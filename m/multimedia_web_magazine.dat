40|$|As Web {{services}} {{become more}} and more popular, how to manage <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> services that can be composed as value-added service solutions remains challenging. This paper presents a service-oriented multimedia componentization model to support Quality of Service (QoS) -centered, device-independent <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> services, which seamlessly incorporates cuttingedge technologies relating to <b>Web</b> services. A <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> service is divided into control flow and data flow, each can be delivered via different infrastructures and channels. Enhancements are proposed to facilitate Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Composite Capability/Preference Profiles (CC/PP) protocols to improve their flexibility to serve <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> services. We present a set of experiments that show the viability of our service-oriented componentization model that can support efficient delivery and management of <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> services...|$|R

Also we will discuss to implement open source software as foundation in order to deploy the information system with low cost without losing the performance. In the future assembling internet technology on education and training will be need in order to enhancement and distribution education quality, specially in Indonesia where has many islands separate with sea and mountain. Students and faculty will enjoy access to multiple resources from one location, delivering search results with a range of content including encyclopedia articles, <b>multimedia,</b> related <b>Web</b> sites, <b>magazines,</b> and much more. Enables schools to implement an online academic program.

40|$|Searching for {{multimedia}} is {{an important}} activity for users of Web search engines. Studying user's interactions with <b>Web</b> search engine <b>multimedia</b> buttons, including image, audio, and video, {{is important for the}} development of <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> search systems. This article provides results from a Weblog analysis study of <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> searching by Dogpile users in 2006. The study analyzes the (a) duration, size, and structure of Web search queries and sessions; (b) user demographics; (c) most popular <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> searching terms; and (d) use of advanced Web search techniques including Boolean and natural language. The current study findings are compared with results from previous <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> searching studies. The key findings are: (a) Since 1997, image search consistently is the dominant media type searched followed by audio and video; (b) multimedia search duration is still short (> 50 % of searching episodes are < 1 min), using few search terms; (c) many multimedia searches are for information about people, especially in audio search; and (d) multimedia search has begun to shift from entertainment to other categories such as medical, sports, and technology (based on the most repeated terms). Implications for design of <b>Web</b> <b>multimedia</b> search engines are discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> {{services}} {{constitute a}} considerable load on Internet bandwidth and on Web servers. With {{the increasing demand}} of <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> services, {{the need to maintain}} a respectable QoS is a major concern for <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> services’ providers. Binary data compression, lossy and lossless, increases performance gain and maintains QoS, at large and small-scale implementations. At the expense of increased CPU processing time, data compression provides a reliable solution to sustain QoS parameters such as response time, download time and server delay where bandwidth is limited. This paper presents a detailed analysis, which is based upon realistic and representative data, in order to quantify the performance gain for <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> services due to the application of binary image compression. To provide data for our analysis method, we have built an image-retrieval Web service that provides a set of images in both compressed and non-compressed form. The work in this paper promotes the utilisation of multimedia compression techniques and proposes the integration of multimedia compression techniques in current Web standards such as HTTP. The analysis method and results can be extended and adapted to various service and network models, such as wireless LAN, Ad-Hoc, mobile networks, IP-telephony and distributed systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|Web {{search engines}} are {{beginning}} to offer access to multimedia searching, including audio, video and image searching. In this paper we report findings from a study examining the state of multimedia search functionality on major general and specialized Web search engines. We investigated 102 Web search engines to examine: (1) how many Web search engines offer multimedia searching, (2) the type of multimedia search functionality and methods offered, such as "query by example", and (3) the supports for personalization or customization which are accessible as advanced search. Findings include: (1) few major Web search engines offer multimedia searching and (2) <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> search functionality is generally limited. Our findings show that despite the increasing level of interest in <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> search, those few Web search engines offering <b>multimedia</b> <b>Web</b> search, provide limited multimedia search functionality. Keywords are still {{the only means of}} multimedia retrieval, while other methods such as "query by example" are offered by less than 1 % of Web search engines examined...|$|R
