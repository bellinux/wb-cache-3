50|$|Aliphatic polyesters are {{a diverse}} family of {{synthetic}} polymers {{of which are}} biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-toxic. Specifically, poly (lactic acid) has low <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> and low viscosity properties {{that are similar to}} EVA midsoles in athletic shoes. Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is part of the poly (amide-enamine) group and can go through thermoplastic and foaming processes. Along with its good mechanical properties, its popularity is based on the non-toxic products that it becomes when it decomposes through hydrolytic degradation. Hydrolytic degradation of PLA generates the monomer lactic acid, which is metabolized via the tri-carboxylic acid cycle and eliminated as carbon dioxide.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} die {{geometry}} on the <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> of conventional and high <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> polypropylene (HMS PP) was studied. It {{was found that}} the <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> of highly elastic PP is sensitive to changes in die geometry and that die diameter has greater effect on <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> than on the length of the die. The effect of die entrance angle on <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> was also studied. No significant difference in <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> was observed when die with different entrance angles was used. This may be because dies with high L/D ratio used in this study helped to relax the polymer and dissipate stresses caused by different entrance angles.

40|$|Improving the <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is of {{continuing}} strategic research interest since a low <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> results in poor processability of foaming and blowing film.

Cell density was increased and cell structure became more uniform with increasing <b>melt</b> <b>strength,</b> in particular when the melt strain was also increased after modification. With increasing <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> the phenomenon of open and ruptured cells was decreased.

It {{was found that the}} <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> of the polypropylene was decreased for talc additions of less than 40 wt% (17. 5 vol%) under all test conditions. Addition of 50 wt% talc improved the <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> under all testing conditions. Drawability, defined as the stretch ratio at strand break, decreased with increased filler loading. The <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> of all materials was found to decrease with increased temperature within the range 180 [degrees]C to 210 [degrees]C. The <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> of all melts showed dependence on the test extrusion rate, and this dependence was well described by an exponential relationship. Highest dependencies were seen for the unfilled and 50 wt% talc-filled polymer.

40|$|Application <b>Melt</b> <b>strength</b> of polymer {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{primaries}} for the success of fabricatinglow-density extrusion foam and thermoforming process. Polypropylene (PP) as alinear polyolefin has low <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> for bubble stabilization and sagging. Large molecules and long chain branches of PP cause higher molecular entanglements and increase elongational strength of PP melt. In this paper the rheological behaviour, melt elasticity, mechanical properties, and crystallinity of linear PP blends are studied and compared with blends containing a long chain branched PP resins. It is found that terna-ry blends of linear PP improve the melt elasticity in a certain composition, comparing to binary blends. Branched PP resins increase molecular entanglements, which it leads to higher melt elasticity. The results of this study help to understand the effects of chain size and chain architecture in increasing the <b>melt</b> <b>strength</b> and melt drawability of PP blends. These are the most important factors for producing low density PP foam and high quality thermoformed products...|$|E

The governing equations are transformed into the non-dimensional form by using pseudo similarity coordinate (zeta) and dimensionless time (4). The resulting two dimensional boundary value problem (BVP) is then solved by the method of lines (MOLs) with the central finite difference and Newton's iteration to obtain the entire numerical solutions for all transient process from the initial stage (xi= 0) to the final state (xi= 1). The results show the rate of dynamic mass transfer at the solid-liquid interface is reduced with increasing the <b>melting</b> <b>strength.</b> In addition, the response time and the rate of the dynamic mass transfer for aiding buoyancy are respectively shorter and faster than those for opposing buoyancy from the transient molecular diffusion to the steady mixed convection in a porous medium with melting effect.

EVAs with VA contents of 18 % and 28 % by weight and a commercially modified montmorillonite clay were melt compounded in a twin-screw extruder. Nanocomposites of 2. 5 %, 5 % and 7. 5 % by weight were produced. WAXS measurements {{have revealed that}} EVA chains had intercalated into the silicate layers and expanded the interlayer distance. TEM showed that the morphologies of the nanocomposites were of mixed intercalated/exfoliated. The nanocomposites exhibited an increase in steady shear viscosities compared to the unfilled EVA polymers. At high loading {{there was a possibility}} of yield stress owing to network structures. Elasticity of the nanocomposites was compared using first normal stress difference-shear stress plots and the modified Cole-Cole plots, with both methods showing contradictory results. <b>Melt</b> <b>strengths</b> of both EVAs were enhanced with the addition of silicate fillers; however, this was {{at the expense of the}} materials&# 039; extensibility.

40|$|A novel {{strategy}} {{was designed for}} the preparation of a long-chain branched polypropylene (PP) with improved foamability via reactive extrusion {{in the presence of}} supercritical CO 2 (scCO(2)). Benzoyl peroxide was used as a radical initiator and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) was applied as a polyfunctional reactive monomer during extrusion. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and high temperature GPC confirmed that TMPTA was grafted onto PP chains, and the presence of scCO(2) promoted the grafting and branching reactions, and hindered polymer degradation. A possible mechanism was proposed to explain the effect of scCO(2) on the branching reactions. In addition, rheological behavior of pure PP and modified PP samples was studied to investigate the effect of long chain branching of PP on the <b>melt</b> viscosity and <b>strength,</b> and foaming behavior was studied to confirm the subsequent effect on its foamability.
