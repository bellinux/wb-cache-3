The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by <b>mutual</b> <b>inductance.</b> These are most useful where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E

25|$|When {{either side}} of the {{transformer}} is a tuned circuit, the amount of <b>mutual</b> <b>inductance</b> between the two windings, together with the Q factor of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The tuned circuit together with the transformer load form an RLC circuit with a definite peak in the frequency response. When both sides of the transformer are tuned, it is described as double-tuned. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of k. When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through <b>mutual</b> <b>inductance,</b> the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of <b>mutual</b> <b>inductance</b> increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the <b>mutual</b> <b>inductance</b> is increased beyond a critical point, the peak in the response curve begins to drop, and the center frequency will be attenuated more strongly than its direct sidebands.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new adaptive torque estimation algorithm for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) with parameter variations and cross-coupling between d- and q-axis dynamics. All cross-coupled, time-varying, or uncertain {{terms that are}} not part of the nominal flux equations are included in two equivalent <b>mutual</b> <b>inductances,</b> which are described using the equivalent d- and q-axis back electromotive forces (EMFs). The proposed algorithm estimates the equivalent d- and q-axis back EMFs in a recursive and stability-guaranteed manner, in order to compute the equivalent <b>mutual</b> <b>inductances</b> between the d- and q-axes. Then, it provides a more accurate and adaptive torque equation by adding the correction terms obtained from the computed equivalent <b>mutual</b> <b>inductances.</b> Simulations and experiments demonstrate that torque estimation errors are remarkably reduced by capturing and compensating for the inherent cross-coupling effects and parameter variations adaptively, using the proposed algorithm...|$|R

25|$|In {{electromagnetism}} and electronics, inductance is {{the property}} of an electrical conductor by which a change in current through it induces an electromotive force in both the conductor itself and in any nearby conductors by <b>mutual</b> <b>inductance.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper studies two {{important}} questions related with switched reluctance machines: 1. In what conditions we can consider {{to use the}} SRM linear model but with sufficient accuracy to predict its steady-state characteristics? 2. To take or not {{to take into account}} the <b>mutual</b> <b>inductances</b> in the 6 / 4 SR non-linear model? Are there any significant errors when we neglect the phase <b>mutual</b> <b>inductances</b> in their simulation? An experimental prototype 6 / 4 SR machine with its magnetic characteristic computed by FEM analysis is the basis for our analysis. Results compare the electromechanical characteristics of the SRM including torque ripple, mean torque, and motor speed. The benefits of using a linear model or a non-linear machine model, considering or not, the mutual fluxes effect in the SR machine, are thus evaluated and discussed.

25|$|Reducing the {{coupling}} between the coils, by physically separating {{them so that}} less of the magnetic field of one intersects the other, reduces the <b>mutual</b> <b>inductance,</b> narrows the bandwidth, and results in much sharper, more selective tuning than that produced by a single tuned circuit. However, the looser coupling also reduced {{the power of the}} signal passed to the second circuit. The transformer was made with adjustable coupling, to allow the listener to experiment with various settings to gain the best reception.|$|E
25|$|These {{effects are}} derived from two {{fundamental}} observations of physics: a steady current creates a steady magnetic field described by Oersted's law, and a time-varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in nearby conductors, which is described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, a changing electric current through a circuit that contains inductance induces a proportional voltage, which opposes the change in current (self-inductance). The varying field in this circuit may also induce an EMF in neighbouring circuits (<b>mutual</b> <b>inductance).</b>|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{effect of}} the <b>mutual</b> <b>inductances</b> between the rotor coils of a {{synchronous}} machine on its defined reactances and predicted transients are investigated. Two linearized models of the machine are considered. One uses the Laplace-Transform approach, with minimum number of assumptions on the inter-coil couplings, in developing {{a model for the}} machine with short-circuited stator terminals. The other model is obtained by modifying the commonly used model and equivalent circuits given by Adkins (4). In the first model, the root-locus technique of classical control theory is used as a tool to investigate the effect of <b>mutual</b> <b>inductances</b> on the short-circuit eigenvalues of the general Park model. Transfer functions for the short-circuit stator and field current responses are derived in terms of the <b>mutual</b> <b>inductances.</b> Numerical examples are presented for two (solid rotor) turbogenerators and one (salient pole) hydrogenerator unit with dampers. In the second model, the {{effect of the}} rotor coil <b>mutual</b> <b>inductances</b> on the dynamic behavior of the synchronous machine are investigated for the machine connected to an infinite-bus via a transmission line. Small displacements around a fixed operating point are assumed in order to linearize the nonlinear model; and the state space approach is used for eigenvalue analysis and simulation of the model on a digital computer. A numerical example is given for a hydrogenerator unit. When the models studied were required to yield a fixed set of time constants and short-circuit reactances, it was noticed that the mutual couplings between the rotor coils did not affect the model eigenvalues. The rotor coil mutual couplings also hold no effect on the contribution of the eigenvalues to the short-circuit stator current components (i[subscript d], i[subscript q]) when the field excitation voltage was fixed. On the other hand, the rotor currents were significantly affected by the mutual couplings between the rotor coils, and their effect should be included in any detailed investigation of synchronous machine...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} inductive power transfer applications is the wireless power supply for locomotives which may cancel the need for pantographs. In order to meet the dynamic and high power demands of wireless power supplies for locomotives, a relatively long transmitter track and multiple receivers are usually adopted. However, during the dynamic charging, the <b>mutual</b> <b>inductances</b> between the transmitter and receivers vary and the load of the locomotives also changes randomly, which dramatically affects the system efficiency.

Firstly, a detailed theoretical analysis on dual receivers is carried out. Then a control scheme with three control loops is proposed to regulate the receiver currents to be the same, to regulate the output voltage and to search for the maximum efficiency point. Finally, a 2 kW prototype is established to validate the performance of the proposed method. The overall system efficiency (DC-DC efficiency) reaches 90. 6 % at rated power and is improved by 5. 8 % with the proposed method under light load compared with the traditional constant output voltage control method...|$|R
