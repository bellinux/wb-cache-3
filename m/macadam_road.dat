Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built {{at the apex of}} the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In May 1911, the Pennsylvania General Assembly {{passed the}} Sproul Roads Act, which created the Pennsylvania state road system {{and allowed the}} state to take over turnpikes. Baltimore Pike was {{designated}} Legislative Route 42 from the Maryland state line northwest to the borough of Gettysburg. The Sproul Roads Act was challenged as being unconstitutional, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the legislation on June 27, 1913. The state took over the Gettysburg and Petersburg Turnpike and abolished tolls the next day, {{just in time for}} the March to Gettysburg ahead of the 1913 Gettysburg reunion. Baltimore Pike was improved as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> from the state line to Gettysburg by 1916. The highway from the state line to US 15 at the intersection of Baltimore Street and Steinwehr Avenue (then Emmitsburg Road) was designated the northernmost part of US 140 in 1927. US 140 was widened and resurfaced with concrete from Gettysburg to Littlestown between 1941 and 1943. The remainder of the highway through Littlestown to the Maryland state line was widened and resurfaced with asphalt between 1943 and 1953. US 140's interchange with modern US 15 was completed when the thentwo-lane US 15 bypass opened in June 1963, immediately before the centennial of the Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E

As of 1910, the improved road was proposed to be extended to Poolesville; however, the BeallsvillePoolesville {{segment of the}} <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> was not completed until 1923. The highway was extended north from Barnesville to Comus in two sections. The first segment was built in 1925 and 1926; the road was completed to Comus in 1927 and 1928. A disjoint segment of MD 109 was built as a concrete road along Westerly Road between Edwards Ferry Road and Willard Road on the southern edge of Poolesville in 1929 and 1930. The county highway between MD 95 at Comus and U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355) at Hyattstown was reconstructed as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> by the Maryland State Roads Commission between 1936 and 1938. MD 109's bridge across Little Bennett Creek and its interchange with Washington National Pike (now I-270) were constructed between 1951 and 1953. The disjoint segment of MD 109 south of Poolesville was transferred to county maintenance in 1957. MD 109 was extended from Comus to Hyattstown in 1960.|$|E

This course was used by portions of General Edward Braddock's army from Alexandria, Virginia, to Cumberland, Maryland, {{prior to the start of}} the ill-fated Braddock Expedition in 1755. The Rockville and Georgetown Turnpike, which opened in 1818, included a descent into the valley of Rock Creek that bypassed MD 187's portion of the RockvilleGeorgetown highway. The portion of Old Georgetown Road from that turnpike (now MD 355) in Bethesda to the community of Alta Vista at Cedar Lane was paved as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> by Montgomery County with state aid by 1910. MD 187 was extended to what is now Democracy Boulevard in 1924. The highway was extended as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> to Tuckerman Lane in 1928.

25|$|The first {{segment of}} MD 118 to be {{constructed}} {{as a modern}} road was from Middlebrook Road north of Germantown to Frederick Road at Neelsville, which was built as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> by Montgomery County with state aid by 1910. The <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> was extended south to what is today the MD 117 intersection in what was called Old Germantown in 1923. MD 118 was extended south as a concrete road from Old Germantown to Black Rock Road in 1930. The highway was completed when the concrete road was extended to MD 28 at Darnestown in 1934. MD 118 originally followed most of its present course. The highway followed what are today Liberty Mill Road and Walter Johnson Road through Old Germantown and Germantown and Boland Farm Road at its northern end at U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355). Washington National Pike (now I-270) was completed from MD 121 in Clarksburg to MD 118 in Germantown in 1954.

The highway was extended west along Metropolitan Avenue and Plyers Mill RoadMD 193 (now MD 185) was relocated around the center of Kensington after its grade separation of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was built in 1936by 1950. MD 192 was extended east from MD 97 along Forest Glen Road to Sligo Creek starting in 1934. That same year, a separate segment was built {{on a part of}} Forest Glen Road then named Fairway Avenue from US 29 west to Dallas Avenue. The Fairway Avenue segment was designated MD 597 by 1939, but became part of MD 192 when the portion of Forest Glen Road between Sligo Creek and Dallas Avenue was brought into the state highway system by 1946. This middle segment between Sligo Creek Parkway and Dallas Avenue was transferred to Montgomery County by 1961. The eastern segment of MD 192, whose eastern end had been shorn off by the construction of US 29's interchange with I-495, was removed from the state highway system in 1977. The final eastern segment of MD 192 from MD 97 to Sligo Creek Parkway was transferred to county maintenance between 1989 and 1991.|$|E
25|$|Cecil County paved {{what is now}} MD 310which {{has also}} been known as St. Augustine Road and Mount Pleasant Roadeast of St. Augustine as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> with state aid by 1915.

MD 175 was extended as a concrete road east to its modern intersection with MD 713, then northeast along what later became MD 713 to MD 176 in Hanover in 1929. The easternmost portion of MD 175, which was originally MD 180, was constructed as a concrete road starting in 1930 from MD 3 to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak) in Odenton; the highway was complete west to Gambrills by the end of 1930. The original western part of MD 175, from US 1 in Jessup to MD 103 in Ellicott City, was constructed as MD 531 in 1932. The portion of the highway through Fort Meade was a public highway maintained by Anne Arundel County or the federal government through World War II.|$|E
25|$|In 1856, General Francis Rawdon Chesney {{traveled}} to Palestine {{to survey the}} land for a railway {{in the company of}} Sir John McNeil, a railway expert. After examining two possible routes, he deemed a rail line to Jerusalem too expensive, estimating construction costs at 4,000–4,500 pounds per kilometer. McNeil then proposed a short line from Jaffa to Lydda only, and a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> from there to Jerusalem (which would cost only 150 pounds per kilometer). Chesney did not give up, contacting Sir Arthur Slade, a general in the Ottoman army, who supported the plan for a railway in what is today Iraq. Slade opposed a Jaffa–Jerusalem line, which he believed would benefit England and be against Turkey's interests. Although Montefiore was involved in it, nothing came of Chesney's initiative. According to another account, Montefiore backed out of the project when Culling Eardley reiterated during a meeting that the railway would serve Christian missionary activity.|$|E
25|$|Veirs Mill Road {{is named}} for a grist and sawmill on Rock Creek built by Samuel Clark Veirs in 1838 and {{operated}} by his family until 1924. This mill drew business from Rockville and Mitchell's Crossroads, which later became Wheaton, along its namesake road. MD 586 was constructed starting in 1934. By the end of 1935, the highway was paved as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> from MD 97 northwest to a branch of Rock Creek next to the modern MD 586MD 185 intersection. Two segments of concrete road were also completed {{from the end of}} the macadam segment northwest to Turkey Branch and from First Street Rockville southeast to Edmonston Drive in Rockville. The remainder of the highway was completed in 1937 concurrent with Veirs Mill Road's original bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) between First Street and U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355).

25|$|Between 1916 and 1919, {{the highway}} between Glenmont and Colesville was {{improved}} as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> by Montgomery County with state aid; this road later {{became known as}} Glenmont Road and was designated MD 183. The road east from Colesville {{and part of the}} Beltsville road were reconstructed as gravel roads in 1934. Montrose Road was paved from US 240 (now MD 355) west to near Cabin John Creek by 1944. By that time, the road had been extended as a gravel road from the railroad to just west of Rock Creek, where the highway became dirt for its old crossing of Rock Creek on Gaynor Road. The highway was paved from US 29 (now MD 650) at Colesville to east of Fairland Road, then gravel to MD 196 (Old Columbia Pike). The pavement resumed there until the BeltsvilleCherry Hill split, from which Cherry Hill Road continued to US 1 as a gravel road. Cherry Hill Road was moved to its present alignment, replacing Gracefield Road, in 1985. The staggered intersections at MD 212 were unified by 1999.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} MD 276 from Port Deposit to Woodlawn follows {{the path of}} the Old Baltimore and Philadelphia Turnpike, a {{collection}} of free and toll roads that passed through Cecil County from a ferry crossing at Port Deposit northeast through Calvert to Chester County, Pennsylvania. The connection between the turnpike and Rising Sun was east of modern MD 276 along Hopewell Road, which was paved as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> from the turnpike intersection east of Woodlawn at Cathers Corner to Rising Sun by Cecil County with state aid by 1910. Wilson Avenue in Rising Sun and the highway adjacent to the town were reconstructed as a concrete road to eliminate a steep grade in 1926. That same year, work began on paving the highway from Port Deposit to Cathers Corner. A section of the highway between the two endpoints near but not in Port Deposit was paved as a concrete road in 1926. The Port Deposit end of the highway was completed in 1929. The gap in MD 276 between the concrete segment west of Woodlawn and Cathers Corner was filled between 1930 and 1933.|$|E
25|$|A {{section of}} present-day MD 274 was {{constructed}} as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> by Cecil County with state aid from Farmington north to Pierce Road south of Rising Sun by 1910.

The highway remained a spur from Rising Sun to Greenhurst until {{the highway to}} Bay View was completed in 1942. The first section of MD 274 {{to be placed in}} its modern form was the segment between Old Bay View Road, then MD 699, and modern MD 272; this piece was built in 1965. This highway was extended northwest to Old Farmington Road in 1968 and 1969. MD 274 was reconstructed from Post Road through Farmington to the town limit of Rising Sun between 1978 and 1980. The final stretch of MD 274 to be reconstructed was from Post Road to Bay View, which bypassed what is now Ebenezer Church Road at Greenhurst, between 1982 and 1984. Queen Street in Rising Sun was maintained by the town until the town's section of the state highway was transferred to state maintenance in a January 5, 1979, road transfer agreement.|$|E

The rolling road in western Baltimore County connecting Rockdale with Elkridge, which was likely built in 1714 by William Summers, is the only such road in Maryland whose name survived to modern times. South Rolling Road was improved as a <b>macadam</b> <b>road</b> from Washington Boulevard (later US 1) to Frederick Road (later US 40 and now MD 144) by 1921. In St. Denis, the highway that was to become MD 166 followed modern Arlington Avenue and East Street south across a grade crossing of the B Railroad to its southern terminus at Washington Boulevard. MD 166 was moved to modern South Rolling Road when the highway's bridge over the railroad was built in 1931. By 1933, North Rolling Road was upgraded to an improved county highway.
