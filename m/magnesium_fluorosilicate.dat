40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the preventive effect of fluoride precipitation with calcium hydroxide on secondary caries in a bacterial based in vitro caries model. Caries-free, retained wisdom teeth were randomly divided into four groups (n= 30). The enamel was cut off and cylindrical cavities 3 mm in diameter and 1, 5 mm in depth were prepared on each dentine surface. The cavities of Group A and B were restored with composite (Z 100) only. A fluoride solution (43, 500 ppm FË‰ as <b>magnesium</b> <b>fluorosilicate,</b> copper sulphate and sodium fluoride, pH 2; Dentin Versiegelungsliquid primary application solution, Humanchemie) and a Ca(OH) 2 solution (Dentin-Versiegelungsliquid secondary application solution, Humanchemie) were applied in group B before the insertion of the composite. Group C and D were restored according to the manufacturers' instructions with phosphoric acid etching and the adhesive/composite system (Optibond FL/ Z 100). The cavities of Group D were also treated with the fluoride and Ca(OH) 2 solution (Dentin-Versiegelungsliquid primary and secondary application solutions, Humanchemie) before etching and inserting the adhesive/composite system. After thermo-cycling, the specimens were exposed to a cariogenic Streptococcus mutans biofilm in an artificial mouth model for 18 days. After cutting the cavities, the depths of demineralization along the fillings were measured on serial sections by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The depth of the marginal leakage was also measured to evaluate if the use of fluorides influences the marginal adaption of composites to dentine. A significant difference in the demineralization area and the marginal integrity could be found between Group A and B (no adhesive system used) compared to Group C and D (use of phosphoric acid and an adhesive system). The marginal leakage and the demineralization was significantly higher in the Groups A and B (p < 0, 05; Mann-Whitney Test) compared to the Groups C and D. The marginal adaption was not influenced by the DVL, but the use of the DVL did not help to prevent secondary caries in dentine either. The study demonstrated that an additional precipitation reaction with Ca(OH) 2 following fluoridation does not significantly prevent secondary caries in dentine. Based on the present in vitro data, the best results were achieved by using the adhesive/composite system according to the manufacturers' instructions...|$|E
