25|$|Margin-equity {{ratio is}} a term used by speculators, {{representing}} the amount of their trading capital that is being held as margin at any particular time. The low <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> of futures results in substantial leverage of the investment. However, the exchanges require a minimum amount that varies depending on the contract and the trader. The broker may set the requirement higher, but may not set it lower. A trader, of course, can set it above that, {{if he does not}} want to be subject to margin calls.|$|E
25|$|During the Crash of 1929 {{preceding}} the Great Depression, <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> were only 10%. Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, {{which could not}} be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss {{of billions of dollars in}} assets.|$|E

2500|$|Again, this {{differs from}} futures which get 'trued-up' {{typically}} daily by {{a comparison of}} the market value of the future to the collateral securing the contract to keep it in line with the brokerage <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b> This true-ing up occurs by the [...] "loss" [...] party providing additional collateral; so if the buyer of the contract incurs a drop in value, the shortfall or variation margin would typically be shored up by the investor wiring or depositing additional cash in the brokerage account.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Greenspan raised {{interest}} rates several times; these actions were believed {{by many to}} have caused the bursting of the dot-com bubble. According to Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, however, [...] "he didn't raise {{interest rates}} to curb the market's enthusiasm; he didn't even seek to impose <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> on stock market investors. Instead, he waited until the bubble burst, {{as it did in}} 2000, then tried {{to clean up the mess}} afterward". E. Ray Canterbery agrees with Krugman's criticism.|$|E
2500|$|During the New Deal {{years as}} well as the 1940s, there was much less focus on Wall Street and finance. The {{government}} clamped down on the practice of buying equities based only on credit, but these policies began to ease. From 1946 to 1947, stocks could not be purchased [...] "on margin", meaning that an investor had to pay 100% of a stock's cost without taking on any loans. But this margin requirement was reduced four times before 1960, each time stimulating a mini-rally and boosting volume, and when the Federal Reserve reduced the <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> from 90% to 70%. These changes made it somewhat easier for investors to buy stocks on credit. The growing national economy and prosperity led to a recovery during the 1960s, with some down years during the early 1970s {{in the aftermath of the}} Vietnam War. Trading volumes climbed; in 1967, according to Time Magazine, volume hit 7.5 million shares a day which caused a [...] "traffic jam" [...] of paper with [...] "batteries of clerks" [...] working overtime to [...] "clear transactions and update customer accounts".|$|E

40|$|Margin {{policy is}} used by {{regulators}} {{for the purpose of}} inhibiting exceSSIve volatility and stabilizing the stock market in the long run. The effect of this policy on the stock market is widely tested empirically. However, most prior studies are limited {{in the sense that they}} investigate the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> for the overall stock market rather than for individual stocks, and the time periods examined are confined to the pre- 1974 period as no change in the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> occurred post- 1974 in the U. S. This thesis intends to address the above limitations by providing a direct examination of the effect of <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> on return, volume, and volatility of individual companies and by using more recent data in the Canadian stock market. Using the methodologies of variance ratio test and event study with conditional volatility (EGARCH) model, we find no convincing evidence that change in <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> affects subsequent stock return volatility. We also find similar results for returns and trading volume. These empirical findings lead us to conclude that the use of margin policy by regulators fails to achieve the goal of inhibiting speculating activities and stabilizing volatility...|$|R

50|$|Portfolio margin is a risk-based margin policy {{available}} to qualifying US investors. The goal of portfolio margin is to align <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> {{with the overall}} risk of the portfolio. Portfolio margin usually results in significantly lower <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> on hedged positions than under traditional rules. While <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> of Regulation T generally limit leverage on equity to 2:1, with portfolio margin, leverage of 6:1 or more is possible.|$|E
5000|$|Further, {{many investors}} face funding {{constraints}} (e.g., leverage constraints and <b>margin</b> <b>requirements),</b> and funding liquidity problems affect security prices.

50|$|President John F. Kennedy {{was asked}} by many to address {{the public about the}} state of the economy, but he {{ultimately}} decided not to do so. Kennedy’s advisors pushed for all sorts of remedies, from reducing the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> to announcing a tax cut of $5-$10 billion to holding a “fireside chat” and discussing the health of the economy. Six weeks after deciding on not taking an action, however, Kennedy reduced the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> and decided on a tax cut, hoping to incentivize large, self-financing companies.|$|R

5000|$|SMA and {{portfolio}} margins offer alternative {{rules for}} U.S. and NYSE regulatory <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E
50|$|The rule {{provides}} {{day trading}} buying power {{to up to}} 4 times a pattern day trader's maintenance margin excess. The excess maintenance margin is the difference of the account equity and the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement.</b> For example, if a trader has $100,000 worth of equities with no margin loan, the leverage ratio is 4:1, meaning that it can buy securities of up to $400,000. If the account has a margin loan, the day trading buying power is equal to four times the difference of the account equity and the current <b>margin</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Example 3: An {{investor}} is long 50 {{shares in}} Universal Widgets Ltd, trading at 120 pence (£1.20) each. The broker sets an additional <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> of 20 pence per share, so £10 {{for the total}} position. The current liquidating margin is currently £60 [...] "in favour of the investor". The minimum <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> is now -£60 + £10 = -£50. In other words, the investor can run a deficit of £50 in his margin account and still fulfil his margin obligations. This {{is the same as}} saying he can borrow up to £50 from the broker.|$|R
50|$|The initial <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> is {{the amount}} of {{collateral}} required to open a position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the maintenance requirement. The maintenance requirement is the minimum amount of collateral required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total value of collateral after haircuts dips below the maintenance <b>margin</b> <b>requirement,</b> the position holder must pledge additional collateral to bring their total balance after haircuts back up to or above the initial <b>margin</b> <b>requirement.</b> On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, the regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the maintenance requirement higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives clearing accounts, futures commission merchants may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements. This is typically an additional 10%-25%.|$|R
5000|$|A bear call spread {{is simply}} the upper side of a long iron condor and has {{virtually}} identical initial and maintenance <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of the {{practical}} advantages of an iron condor over a single vertical spread (a put spread or call spread), is that the initial and maintenance <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> for the iron condor are often {{the same as the}} <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> for a single vertical spread, yet the iron condor offers the profit potential of two net credit premiums instead of only one. This can significantly improve the potential rate of return on capital risked when the trader doesn't expect the underlying instrument's spot price to change significantly.|$|E

40|$|All {{buyers and}} sellers of futures {{contracts}} have to post margin money through their brokers {{to act as a}} performance bond. This margin money financially secures their position and protects the party {{on the opposite side of}} the transaction from default. Generally, the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> for a futures contract is established at a level close to the maximum amount that any short or long trader could lose in any one-day trading period because each day the account is “marked-to-the-market” and the daily gain or loss is reflected in the account balance at the end of the day. The maximum amount of loss is determined by the daily price limit. For example, the daily price limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group Live Cattle futures contract is $ 3. 00 /cwt. So, for the 400 cwt. contract, the largest increase in contract value in a one-day period would be $ 1, 200 (which would be a loss for the short trader), and the largest daily decrease in contract would be $ 1, 200 (which would be a loss for the long trader). The <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> is also established according to the volatility of the futures contract price. The more volatile prices are, the more likely the daily price limit will be reached, and thus the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> increases...|$|R
