40|$|Do {{people change}} their <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> in social {{interactions}} where social class is particularly salient? It remains unclear whether <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> vary across interactions {{or whether they}} are stable over time. We argue that individuals may alter their <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> over time and {{that this will be}} influenced by both the specifics of a particular social interaction and the ‘cultural politics of class’ in which that interaction is embedded. Using a lab-based split-ballot experiment in a research university in the East of England (n = 300), we examine preferences towards music genres depending on whether respondents are assigned to one of three experimental conditions: (1) a vignette describing someone who is working class, (2) a vignette describing someone who is middle class or (3) no vignette. Those born in the UK alter the strength of their preferences towards highbrow music genres when social class is made more salient. When the salience of class is increased it also activates particular cultural stereotypes and these stereotypes influence the strength of respondents’ preferences towards highbrow music genres. This mechanism suggests that individuals use cultural stereotypes in social interaction to position themselves and others in the social hierarchy through <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences...</b>|$|R

In the present work, we attempt to validate one such model of the conversion of cultural capital to network position.

40|$|Being a {{culturally}} responsive mediator {{has become increasingly}} challenging amidst the growing cultural complexity within many societies. Drawing on the existing research on culture and the authors’ experiences of mediating disputes amongst diverse disputants in Australia and Singapore, this paper proposes an emic-constructivist approach for the mediator to understand the individual disputant’s unique <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences.</b> It also recommends bringing forward the exercise of understanding <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> through conducting pre-mediation intake interviews. It is argued that this approach enables the mediator to embrace the parties’ cultural complexity and to design the mediation process based on their rich milieu of preferences. Finally, the paper puts forward a framework for the pre-mediation intake instrument...|$|R
40|$|Summary This paper {{examines}} how agricultural modernization and tradition interact among small-scale commercially-oriented maize farmers by studying shifts in area {{and number of}} farmers planting hybrids and landraces. Results show substantial yield increases but reductions in production and area planted, associated with widespread hybrid adoption and landrace abandonment. Agricultural government programs have {{played an important role}} fostering commercialization and hybrid adoption. <b>Cultural</b> <b>preferences,</b> and possibly an anti-poverty program coupled with women's empowerment, have fostered landrace retention. Hybrids and landraces have overlapping functions in farmers' livelihoods influenced by interdependent production and consumption decisions, <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences,</b> and imperfect markets even under agricultural modernization. government programs NAFTA Oportunidades Mexico Latin America...|$|R
40|$|China {{is engaged}} in the largest {{healthcare}} construction program in history, expecting to build more than 2, 000 hospitals {{and a large number}} of healthcare facilities at all scale over the next few years. This once-in-a-lifetime construction boom provides a valuable opportunity to rethink Chinese hospital design, and especially to consider how to design modern hospitals that are effective and efficient in delivering care, and are responsive to the cultural needs of the Chinese people as well. This dissertation seeks to rigorously define these issues and develop metrics that link design to key healthcare processes. This study uses a range of concepts and analysis tools drawn from cross-culture organizational communications, evidence-based design, space syntax and other research traditions. This thesis develops and refines metrics for four main drivers of nursing unit design: space economy, staff efficiency, natural light and <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> for communication. Communication among Chinese healthcare workers is strongly influenced by <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> for patterns of authority and decision-making reflected in organizational culture and rooted in Confucian principles of hierarchical social structure (Dengji), social network (Guanxi) and face (Mianzi). While the dissertation builds on a longstanding tradition of research focusing on healthcare space economy and staff efficiency, new measures for <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> are proposed and tested. Based on emerging theories of cross-cultural organizational communication by Hofstede and other scholars, and space syntax, this study particularly explores how <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> for face-to-face communication are reflected in the design of Chinese nursing units. Based on the proposed metrics, the dissertation analyzes six pairs of Chinese and US nursing units, matched on layout type. While the Chinese nursing units appear Western, deeper quantitative analysis of their layouts reveals significant national differences in the application of unit typologies in China when compared to those in the U. S. It shows that Chinese hospital design is rooted in <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> such as for positive energy (qi) based on Fengshui theory, and in Confucian principles of hierarchy, social networking and face.

40|$|According to the {{dominant}} models of medical ethics in the United States and many Western coun-tries, physician disclosure of information such as diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis is considered an essential precondition for patient informed consent.

A systematic review of research ex-amining <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> for disclosure of medical “bad news ” was conducted. Results sug-gested that <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> are more heterogeneous than has often been portrayed.

Results show that users were 22 % faster using the culturally adapted interface, needed less clicks, and made fewer errors, in line with subjective results demonstrating that they found the adapted version significantly easier to use. Our findings show that interfaces that adapt to <b>cultural</b> <b>preferences</b> can immensely increase the user experience...|$|R
40|$|Life style {{research}} {{has become an}} independent branch of social structural analysis that systematically complements the role of classical research on social inequality in explaining social action. However, there are important gaps in life style research. First, theoretical bases for explaining the statistical connection between life styles and social action are lacking.
