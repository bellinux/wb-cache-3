Antibacterial properties of A.marina has been proven against urinary tract infection bacterial pathogens by (Ravikumar et al. 2010) and against Staphylococcus aureus by (Dhayanithi et al. 2012); however, no study has been carried out against the LAB contaminants. Similarly, Al-Zoreky and Al-Taher (2015) demonstrated the antibacterial activity of the spathe of the date palm against food borne pathogens and Kchaou et al. (2016) studied the antibacterial property of second grade extracts of date palm against human pathogens. No antibacterial property of the halophytes S.bigelovii and S.sinus persica against LAB has been reported before. Other plant derived compounds which have proven to prevent contamination include essential oils. Neyret et al.

40|$|Background Antimicrobial {{resistance}} {{is driven by}} multiple factors. Resolving the threat to human and animal health presented by drug-resistant infections remains a societal challenge that demands close collaboration between scientists and citizens. We compared current public views about key contributing factors to antimicrobial resistance with those expressed by experts. Methods Overarching factors contributing to antimicrobial resistance were identified following a review of literature. The factors were then described in plain language and attached to ballot boxes at a public engagement event organised by a university. Responses to each factor were counted {{at the end of}} the event. Results Four hundred five responses were received from 3750 visitors (11 % response rate). Nearly half of responses (192 / 405, 47 [*]·[*] 4 %) considered <b>the</b> misuse/overuse of <b>antibiotics</b> in humans as the main determinant of antimicrobial resistance. <b>The</b> <b>misuse</b> of <b>antibiotics</b> in animal health obtained 16 [*]·[*] 3 % (66 / 405) responses. However, the lack of quick tests to diagnose infections received 10 / 405 votes (2 [*]·[*] 47 %), and the lack of effective vaccines received one vote (0 [*]·[*] 25 %). Conclusions The majority of responses ascribed the emergence of drug-resistant infections to <b>the</b> <b>misuse</b> of <b>antibiotics</b> in human and animals.

Official statistics of the Vietnam Food Administration point to microorganisms {{as the major}} cause of blood poisoning outbreaks. This paper reviews the current situation of food safety in Vietnam focusing on microbial hazards of food from animal origin. Retail meat sample analyses (pork and chicken meat) showed high prevalence of Salmonella spp. in different regions including the main cities Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. High levels of antimicrobial resistance are reported for pathogens in food-producing animals and raw foods sold on the market. Multidrug resistant Salmonella spp. to up to 12 different antibiotics has been found. Escherichia coli has also been reported as a significant reservoir of resistance and virulence genes in chicken and pork. Furthermore, resistance to chloramphenicol still occurs at high frequency in pig isolates and in aquaculture, although this drug has been banned from use in food-producing animals for a decade, suggesting a <b>misuse</b> of <b>the</b> <b>antibiotic</b> or a cross-resistance provided {{by the use of}} other antibiotics.

This study was aimed at identifying the {{antimicrobial agents}} available for poultry use and highlighting their possible impact on public health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three randomly selected poultry farms and all veterinary pharmacies in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia were surveyed for <b>the</b> <b>antibiotics</b> used or dispensed. Further, a comprehensive literature survey was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine antimicrobial agents were identified as being available for poultry use, of which 22 (75. 9 &#x 0025;) were important for the treatment of human infections. Enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline, ampicillin, neomycin, sulphamethoxazole, colistin, doxycycline and erythromycin were the most frequently used drugs.

The study of QS may yield another strategy for disease control by interference with QS signals. Scientific research on complementary therapies such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has focused mainly on its antibacterial properties. To test for anti-QS activity, 10 TCM herbs were screened using two biomonitor strains, Chromobacterium violaceum CV 026 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA 01. Interference with violacein (purple pigment) production in CV 026 (exogenously supplied with homoserine lactone signals), and swarming in PA 01, both QS-regulated phenomena, was used as indication of anti-QS activity. Eight of the selected TCM (80 %) yielded QS inhibitors: Prunus armeniaca, Prunella vulgaris, Nelumbo nucifera, Panax notoginseng (root and flower), Punica granatum, Areca catechu, and Imperata cylindrica.

Moreover, mucroporin-M 1 also inhibited gram-negative bacteria. The modes of action of mucroporin and mucroporin-M 1 were both rapid killing by disrupting the cell membrane of bacteria, and the number of surviving bacteria was reduced by about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude immediately after peptide delivery.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is not {{a recent}} phenomenon, {{but it is a}} critical health issue today. Over several decades, to varying degrees, bacteria causing common infections have developed resistance to each new antibiotic, and AMR has evolved to become a worldwide health threat. With the dearth of new antibiotics coming into market, the need for action to avert a developing global crisis in health care is increasingly urgent. Much of the AMR problem stems from <b>the</b> <b>misuse</b> of <b>antibiotic,</b> particularly excessive use. The eradication of AMR is neither a realistic nor a desirable goal. The aim should therefore be to contain resistance, to optimize the balance between the effective use of antimicrobials against infections, thus reducing morbidity, mortality and further spread of infection. Effective antibiotic stewardship is required to ensure that antibiotics are prescribed and used responsibly. This also requires a multistakeholder approach including the governments, policy-makers and planners, pharmaceutical industry, World Health Organization, health care professionals, public and the patients. WHO is engaged in guiding the response to AMR through: policy guidance, support for surveillance, technical assistance, knowledge generation and partnerships, including through disease prevention and control programmes; essential medicine quality; supply and rational use; infection prevention and control; patient safety; and laboratory quality assurance...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{resistant}} bacteria {{have been}} a growing threat {{to the community and}} hospitals due to <b>the</b> <b>misuse</b> of <b>antibiotics</b> by humans, industrialization, and lack of novel antimicrobials currently available. Little is known about the prevalence of drug resistant bacteria in nonhealthcare environments in Brunei Darussalam and about how antibiotic resistant genes are transferred within these environments. Human contact points from different types of environments in Brunei Darussalam, varying from urban to jungle settings, were swabbed and cultured onto selective media to isolate staphylococci bacteria before performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing on the isolates. The identity of the isolates was determined using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). Staphylococci isolates resistant to oxacillin were further tested for their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). PCR analysis of the mecA gene, a gene that confers resistance to oxacillin, is done to determine the level of resistance to oxacillin. Ten different staphylococcal species were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Out of the 36 staphylococci isolates, 24 were resistant to multiple antibiotics including two isolates which were oxacillin resistant. Some staphylococci isolates had similar antibiotic resistance profiles to other staphylococci isolates of different species in the same location. This work provides the first-ever evidence of drug resistant staphylococci in the nonhospital environment in Brunei Darussalam...|$|R
