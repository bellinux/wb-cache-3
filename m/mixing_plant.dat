500|$|In the 1920s, Brundage and {{his company}} became very active in {{constructing}} high-rise apartment buildings in Chicago. He used rapid construction methods, allowing clients to begin realizing income from their investments quickly—the Sheridan-Brompton Apartments (1924) overlooking Lincoln Park, were built in five months, allowing the start of $40,000 in monthly rental income, offsetting a monthly mortgage payment of $15,000. Often, the Brundage Company {{was involved in the}} ownership of the apartments: 3800 Sheridan Road (1927), a 17-story building costing $3,180,000, was owned by a company which had as its president and treasurer Chester Brundage, Avery's younger brother. It was constructed in eight months, through the Chicago winter, using an onsite concrete <b>mixing</b> <b>plant.</b> This temporary structure also provided office space for the construction. Another source of income for Brundage {{and his company}} was hotel construction, for which he was often paid in part with stock in the new facility. One president of an engineering firm specializing in large structures called Brundage's methods on the Shoreham Hotel [...] "progressive, snappy, [...] up-to-date" [...] and [...] "straightforward and honest".|$|E
2500|$|In general usage, {{concrete}} plants come in {{two main}} types, ready <b>mix</b> <b>plants</b> and central <b>mix</b> <b>plants.</b> [...] A ready <b>mix</b> <b>plant</b> <b>mixes</b> all the ingredients except water, while a central <b>mix</b> <b>plant</b> <b>mixes</b> all the ingredients including water.

40|$|Hot mix asphalt (HMA) paving {{materials}} are {{a mixture of}} size-graded, high quality aggregate (which can include reclaimed asphalt pavement [RAP]), and liquid asphalt cement, which is heated and mixed in measured quantities to produce HMA. Aggregate and RAP (if used) constitute over 92 percent by weight of the total mixture. Aside from the amount and grade of asphalt cement used, mix characteristics {{are determined by the}} relative amounts and types of aggregate and RAP used. A certain percentage of fine aggregate (less than 74 micrometers [µm] in physical diameter) is required for the production of good quality HMA. Hot mix asphalt {{paving materials}} can be manufactured by: (1) batch <b>mix</b> <b>plants,</b> (2) continuous <b>mix</b> (mix outside dryer drum) plants, (3) parallel flow drum <b>mix</b> <b>plants,</b> and (4) counterflow drum <b>mix</b> <b>plants.</b> This order of listing generally reflects the chronological order of development and use within the HMA industry. In 1996, approximately 500 million tons of HMA were produced at the 3, 600 (estimated) active asphalt plants in the United States. Of these 3, 600 plants, approximately 2, 300 are batch plants, 1, 000 are parallel flow drum <b>mix</b> <b>plants,</b> and 300 are counterflow drum <b>mix</b> <b>plants.</b> The total 1996 HMA production from batch and drum <b>mix</b> <b>plants</b> is estimated at about 240 million tons and 260 million tons...|$|R

2500|$|Construction {{contracts}} {{were drawn}} up in late February, and excavation {{work on the}} D.C. abutments began in March. The first coffer dam for construction of the piers was sunk in May 1918, and the old Aqueduct Bridge formally closed on July 9. [...] Immense amounts of concrete were needed to construct the bridge. One concrete <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> was constructed on the D.C. shore, and concrete was delivered to the worksite in the river by ropeway conveyor. A second <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> was constructed in mid-river: The plant was floated into position, and then allowed to sink down to the riverbed. Steel for the reinforced concrete structure and for the steel arches within its spans was assembled on the D.C. shoreline, then floated by barge to the worksite. Progress was slow, as reinforced concrete was a relatively new type of construction. The project ran out of money, and Tyler requested and won an additional $1.1 million from Congress in 1920 to finish the work.|$|E

2500|$|Building of the dam's main {{concrete}} structure started in July 1940 after the cable systems {{had been completed}} and the <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> came on line. Steel buckets capable of carrying [...] of concrete, weighing 16 tonnes when full, traveled back and forth along the lines. For three years, thousands of men labored building the dam's massive abutments, pouring concrete into large modular [...] "blocks" [...] square and [...] deep. These blocks were shaped using wooden forms, which were removed when the concrete dried and rebuilt to handle the next block above it. The concrete was [...] "vibrated" [...] into place using specialized equipment, filling in any accidental cavities and bubbles to ensure maximum density and strength.

2500|$|The [...] {{gauge line}} soon reached Pateley Bridge, and Angram became the 'route engine', working the main line, with another named Bunty {{shunting}} the sidings there. The standard gauge rails were laid from Lofthouse outwards in both directions, {{and when the}} first standard gauge locomotive arrived, it was towed {{along the road to}} Sykes Bank by a Foden steam lorry, its flanged wheels making a mess of the road surface. The main line and sidings became mixed gauge for a while, although the third rail was gradually removed from 1906. At the Angram Dam site, a village for the workers was built, and the railway terminated in several sidings, which included a locomotive shed. The sidings were at a similar level to the crest of the dam. A branch left the main line and descended to the valley floor, where there was a cement <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> and more sidings. This line included a winch-operated incline which descended on a gradient of 1 in 15 (6.7%). Another incline, or [...] gauge, ascended {{the far side of the}} valley, giving access to Nidd sluice and lodge. A third incline brought rock down to the main line from a quarry, some [...] below the terminus.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFlash floods, erratically {{striking}} semi-arid regions, often cause field {{flooding and}} soil anoxia, resulting in crop losses on food staples, typically pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Recent glasshouse {{studies have indicated}} that rice (Oryza spp.) can enhance flood stress tolerance of co-growing dryland cereals by modifying their rhizosphere microenvironments via the oxygen released from its roots into the aqueous rhizosphere. We tested whether this phenomenon would be expressed under field flood conditions. The effects of mix-planting of pearl millet and sorghum with rice on their survival, growth and grain yields were evaluated under controlled field flooding in semi-arid Namibia during 2014 / 2015 – 2015 / 2016. Single-stand and <b>mixed</b> <b>plant</b> treatments were subjected to 11 – 22 day flood stress at the vegetative growth stage. <b>Mixed</b> <b>planting</b> increased plant survival rates in both pearl millet and sorghum. Grain yields of pearl millet and sorghum were reduced by flooding, in both the single-stand and <b>mixed</b> <b>plant</b> treatments, relative to the non-flooded upland yields, but the reduction was lower in the <b>mixed</b> <b>plant</b> treatments. In contrast, flooding increased rice yields. Both pearl millet–rice and sorghum–rice mixtures demonstrated higher land equivalent ratios, indicating a <b>mixed</b> <b>planting</b> advantage under flood conditions. These results indicate that mix-planting pearl millet and sorghum with rice could alleviate flood stress on dryland cereals. The results also suggest that with this cropping technique, rice could compensate for the dryland cereal yield losses due to field flooding...|$|R

The experiment was arranged in a split plots based on randomized complete blocks design with three replications. Results showed that sesame RUE was higher than chickpea RUE in all treatments.
