50|$|The broad-striped <b>Malagasy</b> <b>mongoose</b> (Galidictis fasciata) is {{a species}} of Galidiinae, a {{subfamily}} of mongoose-like euplerids native to Madagascar. The species contains two known subspecies: Galidictis fasciata fasciata and Galidictis fasciata striata.|$|E
50|$|If {{threatened}} by a predator (most commonly a fossa or <b>Malagasy</b> <b>mongoose),</b> a streaked tenrec erects the barbed quills on its back and on the crest around its head, pointing them completely forward, and drives them in to the attacker's nose or paws with body and head movements. The unbarbed quills are clustered {{in the middle of}} the back, and produce a faint chattering sound when vibrated, and are used to communicate within family groups.|$|E
50|$|Grandidier's {{mongoose}} (Galidictis grandidieri), {{also known}} as the giant-striped mongoose or Grandidier's vontsira, is a small carnivoran that lives only in a very small area of southwestern Madagascar, in areas of spiny forest vegetation. It is a pale brown or grayish coloured mongoose, with eight wide, dark stripes on its back and sides. Grandidier's mongoose is larger than the related broad-striped <b>Malagasy</b> <b>mongoose,</b> G. fasciata, and its stripes are not as wide. The species is named after Alfred Grandidier.|$|E

50|$|The brown-tailed <b>mongoose,</b> <b>Malagasy</b> brown-tailed <b>mongoose,</b> or salano (Salanoia concolor) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Eupleridae. It is endemic to Madagascar. Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical dry forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|Eupleridae is {{a family}} of carnivorans endemic to Madagascar and {{comprising}} 10 known living species in seven genera, commonly known as euplerids, or <b>malagasy</b> <b>mongooses.</b> The best known species is the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), in the subfamily Euplerinae. All species of Euplerinae were formerly classified as viverrids, while all species in the subfamily Galidiinae were classified as herpestids.|$|R
50|$|Galidiines are {{generally}} found in forest, but the Grandidier's and narrow-striped mongooses live in open habitats. All species dig burrows for shelter, and several species may also use tree holes. All six species {{can be found}} on the ground, but the narrow-striped and ring-tailed mongooses also climb trees. Like true mongooses, galidiines are usually active during the day, with the exception of the two species of Galidictis. Breeding occurs during the (Southern Hemisphere) summer, except in Grandidier's mongoose, which breeds year-round. Usually, only a single young is born. The ring-tailed, Grandidier's, and brown-tailed mongooses live alone or in pairs, sometimes with their offspring, but the broad-striped <b>Malagasy</b> and narrow-striped <b>mongooses</b> also occur in larger social groups. The diet varies among the species, with the ring-tailed and broad-striped <b>Malagasy</b> <b>mongooses</b> eating mainly small vertebrates like lizards, frogs and rodents, and the other three species eating more invertebrates like insects and scorpions. The ring-tailed and brown-tailed mongooses are also known to eat fruit.|$|R
50|$|The {{differences}} in form {{make it difficult}} to concisely summarise the species in this family. The range in size is as diverse as the range in form, with smaller species at less than 500 g (1 lb) and the largest species at up to 12 kg (26 lb). Some have retractile or semi-retractile claws (the fossa and the Malagasy civet) and others do not (the falanouc and <b>Malagasy</b> <b>mongooses).</b> They all tend to have slender bodies and pointed rostra (except the fossa, which has a blunt snout). Diet varies with size and form of the species and, like their mainland counterparts, ranges from small mammals, insects and invertebrates through to crustaceans and molluscs.|$|R
5000|$|Family Eupleridae (the [...] "Malagasy carnivorans") {{includes}} fossa, falanouc, Malagasy civet and <b>Malagasy</b> <b>mongooses,</b> all {{of which}} are restricted to the island of Madagascar. The eight species in the family exhibit significant variations in form. These differences initially led to the species in this family sharing common names with, and being placed in the different families of, apparently more similar species on the mainland (e.g. civets and mongoose). However, phylogenetic analysis of DNA provides strong evidence that all Malagasy carnivorans evolved from a single common ancestor that was a herpestid (Yoder et al. 2003). Recent phylogenetic analysis supports this view and places all of the Malagasy carnivorans in the family Eupleridae (Gaubert et al. 2005).|$|R
