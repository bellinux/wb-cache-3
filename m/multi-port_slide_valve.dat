40|$|This paper fully {{describes}} the working principle of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> in single-screw expanders (SSEs). A geometric analysis of suction and volume ratio <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{is presented to}} determine the relations between volume ratio, suction closure volume, discharge opening volume and <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) thermodynamic model with SSE integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> is developed to analyze the power output of SSE and the net power output of ORC system and variation law of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. Analysis of a typical ORC system under changing operating conditions shows that the power output of the expander and the net output power of the ORC system with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> are much better than those without <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b> When the condensing temperature is 40 Â°C and the waste availability is 80 kW, the increase in output power and net output power are approximately 3. 4 kW and 5 kW, respectively. The presented geometric analysis of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> and the thermodynamic model integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{can be used to}} provide a theoretical and technical basis for designing the <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> of SSEs and the control strategies of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> under varied operating conditions...|$|R

If Swim Out Mode is selected, the <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> remains closed. The <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> allows water from the {{ejection}} pump to enter the tube.|$|R

50|$|Locomotives {{usually had}} their <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{replaced}} with piston valves upon being fitted with superheated Watson Standard boilers, but the Class 3R retained their <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> throughout their working lives.|$|R
50|$|The {{first seven}} {{locomotives}} had <b>slide</b> <b>valves,</b> while the remainder had piston <b>valves.</b> The <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> engines were later fitted with piston valves. Schmidt superheaters were fitted between 1913 and 1925.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} used Murdoch's D unbalanced <b>slide</b> <b>valves,</b> arranged horizontally {{above the}} cylinders outside the plate frames and actuated by Heusinger valve gear. These valves caused considerable wear on motion pins and were later replaced by Trick ported balanced <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In the 19th century, steam {{locomotives}} used <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{to control}} the flow of steam {{into and out of}} the cylinders. In the 20th century, <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> were gradually superseded by piston valves, particularly in engines using superheated steam. There were two reasons for this: ...|$|R

50|$|Later {{compound}} mill engines {{with sophisticated}} valve gears often fitted the complex gear to the HP cylinder whilst retaining a simpler traditional <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> for the LP cylinder.

New crank webs were fitted, which enabled solid bushed connecting and coupling rods to be fitted in place of the original split brass type. The original unbalanced <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> were replaced with balanced <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
