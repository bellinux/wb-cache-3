Fanny voices the conventional values of her caste and society, particularly the importance of promiscuity: she advises Lenina {{that she should have}} more than one <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> because it is unseemly to concentrate on just one. Fanny then, however, warns Lenina away from a new lover whom she considers undeserving, yet she is ultimately supportive of the young woman's attraction to the savage John.|$|E
500|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based Suara Merdeka, drew a {{parallel}} between The Mirror Never Lies and Samuel Beckett's play Waiting for Godot. He suggests that they both have the same message: that awaiting somebody who never comes is ultimately futile. Benke further suggests that the film is centred around {{the conflict between the}} [...] "utopian" [...] Pakis and her [...] "realistic" [...] mother. Meanwhile, Maggie Lee, reviewing in The Hollywood Reporter, considered the film more of a coming-of-age story, with Pakis [...] "discovering her womanhood just when the most significant <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> is gone". Lee also noted Pakis' burgeoning sensuality and [...] "nascent physical stirrings" [...] for her friend Tudo. Ultimately, Lee suggested that Andini was expressing her desire to [...] "break away from her father' artistic influence and swim alone" [...] through the film.|$|E

Smith told Cook [...] "I don't know whether Daphne actually needs a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> but she's certainly got two men there. It's a triangle that's developed, but {{to try and}} give a rational explanation to it is next to impossible." [...] Smith thought Daphne was ideal for Shane {{and that she had}} a great deal of love for him. On the other hand, Daphne also loved Des, who she trusted and had become good friends with. O'Brien stated that as far as Shane was concerned, Daphne was the only woman he ever loved and thought that he was more suited to her than Des. Keane commented that despite being engaged five times and stood up once by Daphne, Des had always loved her. He added [...] "It was love at first sight for Des." ...|$|E

Lisa reluctantly admits that she knows {{everything}} about Roy, that her relationship with Roy is a sham, and that Roy is {{the first and only}} <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> as she had no other. Coach is shocked with disbelief and tells her that she's [...] "beautiful", but Lisa objects and begs him for one moment to analyze her physical appearance, which she is insecure about. Coach then realizes that Lisa resembles her mother, and says so. Lisa agrees and tries to continue on that her mother was not beautiful either, but finds herself unable to say it. Coach tells Lisa that she is more beautiful every day, regardless of her appearance, just as her mother was more beautiful every day. Finally, Lisa feels self-confident and thanks her father for his comments.|$|E
500|$|Idolator's {{staff members}} wrote that [...] "Dance for You" [...] is a [...] "dangerously slick slow-jam".

Online {{described}} the song as a [...] "come-hither love letter to the <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> set to a sultry beat".

After she fights with her father about his son, Debayo Taiwo, she leaves her father’s house for Mike’s and finds him with another woman.

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{found the}} scenes of the rural area and rural life to be [...] "splendid". His strongest {{criticism}} is that the film missed {{the point of the}} small society of rural life:Thomas Hardy's novel told of a 19th century rural England in which class distinctions and unyielding social codes surrounded his characters. They were far from the madding crowd whether they liked it or not, and got tangled in each other's problems because there was nowhere else to turn. It's not simply that Bathsheba (Julie Christie) was courted by the three <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> but that she was courted by ALL three <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a midtempo pop number about {{restoring}} someone's faith in love and family relationships.

Written in a first-person narrative, Clarkson introspectively co-wrote the song to her father, whose abandonment of his family when she {{was six years old}} was utilized as a [...] in contrast to her husband's unconditional love to her and their daughter, whom they had both promised in the song to never leave behind.|$|E
2500|$|By the {{syndicated}} run, the storylines had clearly started to mature. Many more of Punky and Cherie's friends were seen (although most only made {{a handful of}} guest appearances each), with Margaux becoming their comic foil and source of friction. Early in the third season, Allen moved away to Kansas with his mother, following his parents' divorce. As Punky herself embarked on junior high, her avant-garde day-glo and multicolored attire, along with her pigtails, segued into more traditional teenage styles, and her declaration of, and reliance on [...] "Punky Power!" [...] {{gave way to the}} realization that intelligence, common sense and a strong will can get one out of any problem. More of her dalliances with boys entered the stories, with the ones she chased and those that tried to pursue her. Punky's spunk and vivacious attitude toward life did remain though, {{thanks in part to the}} sunshine brought in by the most important <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> her adoptive dad.|$|E

60|$|The cloud {{lingered on}} Dartrey's face. He ate and drank {{in his usual}} sparing fashion, silently and {{apparently}} wrapped in thought. From {{the other side of}} the pink-shaded lamp which stood in the middle of the table, Nora watched him with a curious, almost a sardonic sadness in her clear eyes. An hour ago she had looked at herself in the mirror and had been startled at what she saw. The lines of her black gown, the most extravagant purchase of her life, had revealed the beauty of her soft and shapely figure. Her throat and bosom had seemed so dazzlingly white, her hair so rich and glossy, her eyes full of the hope, the softness, almost the anticipatory joy of the woman who has everything to offer to the one <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> She had felt as she had looked: almost a girl, with music on her lips and joyous things in her heart, nursing that wonderful gift to her sex,--the hopeless optimism begotten of love. And her little house of cards had tumbled so quickly to the ground, the little denouement on which she had counted had fallen so flat. They two were there alone. The little dinner which she had planned was as near perfection as possible. The champagne bubbled in their glasses. The soft light, the solitude, the stillness,--nothing had failed her, except the man. Stephen sat within a few feet of her, with furrowed brow and mind absorbed by a possible political problem.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have spoken}} of the closed doors of her life. I {{was aware that}} a young, {{unmarried}} Frenchwoman has usually less liberty than her English sister. And yet {{in the case of}} this lady it continually came out in her conversation that she had seen and known much of the world. It was the more distressing to me as whenever she had made an observation which pointed to this she would afterwards, as I could plainly see, be annoyed by her own indiscretion, and endeavour to remove the impression by every means in her power. We had several small quarrels on this account, when I asked questions to which I could get no answers, but they have been exaggerated in the address for the prosecution. Too much has been made also of the intervention of Mrs. Murreyfield, though I admit that the quarrel was more serious upon that occasion. It arose from my finding the photograph of a man upon her table, and her evident confusion when I asked her for some particulars about him. The name [...] "H. Vardin" [...] was written underneath--evidently an autograph. I was worried by the fact that this photograph had the frayed appearance of one which has been carried secretly about, as a girl might conceal the picture of her lover in her dress. She absolutely refused to give me any information about him, save to make a statement which I found incredible, that it was a man whom she had never seen in her life. It was then that I forgot myself. I raised my voice and declared that I should know more about her life or that I should break with her, even if my own heart should be broken in the parting. I was not violent, but Mrs. Murreyfield heard me from the passage, and came into the room to remonstrate. She was a kind, motherly person who took a sympathetic interest in our romance, and I remember that on this occasion she reproved me for my jealousy and finally persuaded me that I had been unreasonable, so that we became reconciled once more. Ena was so madly fascinating and I so hopelessly her slave that she could always draw me back, however much prudence and reason warned me to escape from her control. I tried again and again to find out about this man Vardin, but was always met by the same assurance, which she repeated with every kind of solemn oath, that she had never seen the <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> Why she should carry about the photograph of a man--a young, somewhat sinister man, for I had observed him closely before she snatched the picture from my hand--was what she either could not, or would not, explain.|$|E
