50|$|Haydn {{continues}} the odd phrase {{structure in the}} minuet, which is built of five-measure units. Aside from its undanceable meter, the minuet is a sombre work, emphatically <b>minor</b> <b>in</b> <b>character.</b> The trio section of the minuet offers a brief respite with a first strain in E-flat major; but the second strain returns to the minor, modulating down through several minor keys. The trio ends with a plagal cadence to G major, for a Baroque-like Picardy third conclusion; but then the minuet recapitulates in G minor. The move from G major back to G minor is so jolting that Drabkin speculates that the trio might possibly have been borrowed from another piece.|$|E
5000|$|The three-note motif from [...] "Ist es wahr?", {{presented}} in an opening Adagio {{in the key}} of A Major, establishes the cyclic form of the quartet; derivatives of the motif appear in {{all four of the}} movements, and the opening theme concludes the quartet. [...] After the Adagio introduction, the quartet breaks into a tumultuous Allegro Vivace in Sonata form in A minor. [...] "You will hear its notes resound in the first and last movements, and sense its feeling in all four" [...] wrote Mendelssohn to a friend. [...] So the quartet, which is mostly in minor keys, and is primarily <b>minor</b> <b>in</b> <b>character,</b> opens and closes in a major key — a rather daring departure from standard quartet-writing practice of the time. Many writers have seen a resemblance to Beethoven's Op. 132 quartet: that quartet, also, has an opening adagio, then a first theme built of running sixteenth notes and a lyrical passage, which is loosely akin to an inversion of Mendelssohn's theme.|$|E
