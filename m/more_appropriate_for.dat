5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> an early first-season episode, not being as pertinent or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E
5|$|During 1983–1984, the {{painting}} was exhibited at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, and after this exhibit an art dealer offered to donate or sell {{the painting}} to Nationalmuseum. The board rejected the offer {{with the statement that}} the Old Norse motif was <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the Museum of National Antiquities, which at the time still shared the same building as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities had been moved to a building of its own, the painting should be moved there too.|$|E

5|$|Mary Shelley {{submitted}} the play for publication to The Browning Box, edited by Bryan Walter Procter, in 1824; it was rejected. In 1830, she submitted it to Rudolph Ackermann {{for publication in}} his children's magazine Forget-Me-Not; it was again rejected. In 1832, she sent it to Alaric Alexander Watts for consideration in his annual Literary Souvenir, however in her letter she suggested that the drama may be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the juvenile publications edited by his wife, Priscilla Maden Watts. The drama {{was first published in}} 1922 by literary scholar A. Koszul.|$|E
5|$|Order of Weavers Formed on 17 July 1947, the Orde van Weefsters Vita Feminea Textura, or the Order of Weavers was the {{creation}} of the wives of Dutch Freemasons. They constructed a ritual system using the tools of weaving in their symbology, which they judged to be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> women than stonemasons tools. There are now 17 lodges spread through the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|According to Russian {{scholars}} Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, {{the cross}} was originally {{kept in the}} Prečista Krajinska Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir. The peak of Islamization of the Krajina region was reached {{at the end of}} 18th century. The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but the cross was preserved by the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had converted to Islam. The cross was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too converted to Islam, they entrusted the cross to the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors. The Mrkojevići considered it <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the cross to be kept in a Christian home, rather than in a Muslim one.|$|E
5|$|Black Sabbath {{was made}} {{at the end of}} {{production}} of The Girl Who Knew Too Much during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. American International Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as {{it had to be done}} rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> American audiences which led to decreasing the amount of violence in the film. The film was first conceived under the title The Fear.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{performances}} are strung together from the meditative and measured alap (non-metrical introduction) and jor (performance with pulse) in dhrupad style, {{followed by a}} faster and less reserved gat section (composition with rhythmic pattern provided by the tabla) in khyal style. He experimented with a style of jhala (performance with rapid pulse) developed by Bundu Khan, but considered it <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> plucked instruments and stopped performing it. The gat section includes one or two parts with compositions. When two gats are used, the first one tends {{to be at a}} slow or medium tempo, and the second one is faster; the gats are usually performed in the 16-beat rhythmic cycle tintal. Narayan often completes performances with ragas associated with thumri (a popular light classical genre), which are referred to as mishra (Sanskrit: mixed) because they allow for additional notes, or with a dhun (song based on folk music).|$|E

Both techniques were implemented in VHDL and tested in two target applications: arithmetic circuits with pipeline and registers files. Area overhead results show that TMR is <b>more</b> <b>appropriated</b> <b>for</b> modules using single registers like in pipelines, control and datapath circuits, while Hamming code is a better trade-off for groups of registers, such as register files, caches and embedded memories. 1...|$|R

For instance, university education and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK.

5|$|The {{day after}} {{having sex with}} Tammy, Ron comes to work wearing a red shirt and black pants, which prompts Tom to observe that Ron always dresses like golf pro Tiger Woods after having sex. This joke was written before the story of Woods' extramarital affairs scandal broke in the news in November 2009. Andy {{is said to have}} auditioned for the reality {{television}} show Survivor and the television game show Deal or No Deal. During an audition tape, he is shown gutting a fish to prove he could perform on Deal or No Deal, even though the action is far <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> Survivor. During one scene, to Leslie's shock and confusion, Tammy said she would rather be Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, than Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady and wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July, {{the day of}} the ceremony, pilgrims {{spent the}} morning and early {{afternoon}} exploring the landscape of the memorial park before congregating at the monument. For the ceremony, sailors from HMCS Saguenay provided the guard of honour. Also present were The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band, French army engineers, and French-Moroccan cavalry who had fought on the site during the Second Battle of Artois. The ceremony itself was broadcast live by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission over shortwave radio, with facilities of the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitting the ceremony to Canada. Senior Canadian, British, and European officials, including French President Albert Lebrun, and a crowd of over 50,000 attended the event. Absent, though, was Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, it being well understood that he was generally not comfortable around veterans and felt it <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> a war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} years, Big Data {{has become a}} hot topic across several {{business}} areas. One of the main concerns regarding this concept is {{how to handle the}} massive volume and variety of data efficiently. Due to the notorious complexity of the data associated to the Big Data concept, usually motivated by data volume, efficient querying analysis mechanisms are mandatory for data analysis purposes. Motivated by the rapidly development of tools and frameworks for Big Data, there is much discussion about querying tools and, specifically, those <b>more</b> <b>appropriated</b> <b>for</b> specific analytical needs. This paper explores some of the available querying tools, describing and comparing their main characteristics and architectures, crucial knowledge <b>for</b> selecting the <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> ones <b>for</b> inclusion in a specific Big Data analytical architecture.

5|$|She was a costumed crime-fighter like Batman, yet in {{many ways}} not an exact counterpart. For example, the {{contents}} of her utility purse were actually weapons disguised as stereotypical feminine products such as lipstick, cosmetic compacts, charm bracelets, and hair nets. Batwoman appeared regularly {{in the pages of}} Batman and Detective Comics through the early 1960s. Although letters from fans indicated Batwoman had become popular with readers, editor Julius Schwartz considered the heroine, as well as other Batman-related characters, to be inappropriate for the new direction he planned to take the Batman universe. Following the revamp to Detective Comics in 1964, Batwoman was removed from the series. The 'new' Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, not only replaced Batwoman as Batman's female counterpart, she surpassed the original heroine in popularity. Batgirl also proved to be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> her time period and the realistic approach DC Comics began taking with its characters. Unlike Batwoman, Gordon's Batgirl used a utility belt and various gadgets similar to Batman's, {{in addition to being a}} skilled martial artist and possessing a doctorate in her civilian identity. Despite requests from readers to revive Batwoman, DC's editorial staff initially declined to bring the character out of retirement, considering the fact that she was specifically created to be a love interest for Batman.|$|E
5|$|The Columbian mammoth {{was first}} scientifically {{described}} in 1857 by Scottish naturalist Hugh Falconer, who named the species Elephas columbi after Christopher Columbus. The animal {{was brought to}} Falconer's attention in 1846 by Charles Lyell, who sent him molar fragments found during the 1838 excavation of the Brunswick–Altamaha Canal in Georgia, in the southeastern United States. At the time, similar fossils from across North America were attributed to woolly mammoths (then Elephas primigenius). Falconer found that his specimens were distinct, confirming his conclusion by examining their internal structure and studying additional molars from Mexico. Although William Phipps Blake and Richard Owen believed that E. texianus was <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the species, Falconer rejected the name; he also suggested that E. imperator and E. jacksoni, two other American elephants described from molars, were based on remains too fragmentary to classify properly. More complete material that may be from the same quarry as Falconer's fragmentary holotype molar was reported in 2012, and could help shed more light on that specimen, since doubts about its adequacy as a holotype have been raised.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment {{in children with}} drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E
