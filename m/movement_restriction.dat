5000|$|An Independent Inquiry into Foot and Mouth Disease in Scotland {{initiated}} by the Royal Society of Edinburgh was chaired by Professor Ian Cunningham. This embraced not only the scientific aspects of the outbreak, but also economic, social and psychological effects of the event. The costs to Scottish agriculture of the FMD outbreak were estimated to be £231m {{and the loss of}} gross revenue to tourism to be between £200-250m for Scotland as a whole. There should be a regional laboratory in Scotland, and priority be given to the development of testing procedures. The delay in imposing a ban of all movements until the third day after confirmation, the use of less than transparent modelling techniques and the failure to call on more than a fraction of the considerable relevant scientific expertise available in Scotland were criticised. The case for emergency protective vaccination, without subsequent slaughter, was supported by the evidence and it was recommended that contingency plans should include emergency barrier, or ring. vaccination as an adjunct to slaughter in clinical cases. Reservations about the consumption of meat and milk from vaccinated animals were unjustified. The importance of biosecurity at all times and throughout the agricultural industry was emphasised and SEERAD (The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department) should take the lead in establishing standards to be applied in normal times and at the start of an outbreak. A Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland) should be appointed and a [...] "Territorial Veterinary Army" [...] formed from professionals to be called upon should need arise. Burial of carcasses, where conditions permit, is the preferred option for disposal of slaughtered animals. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) should have a clear role in contingency planning and management of any future emergency. There was a need for operational guidelines for slaughtermen. In formulating <b>movement</b> <b>restriction,</b> the dispersed nature of many holdings should be taken into account. There should be a clear and consistent strategy for compensation for slaughtered animals. The closing down of the country initially for no more than three weeks and then reopening in non-affected areas was recommended. Great importance was placed on contingency planning, on the need for regular exercises and on the setting up of an independent standing committee to monitor the maintenance of effective planning. In all, some twenty seven recommendations were made to the Scottish Executive.|$|E

Although several research groups have proposed the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to enhance neuroprotection and recovery in patients with TBI, few studies have obtained sufficient evidence regarding its effects in this population. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the effect of intermediate-frequency rTMS (2 [*]Hz) on behavioral and histological recovery following TBI in rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into six groups: three groups without TBI (no manipulation, <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> plus sham rTMS, and <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> plus rTMS) and three groups subjected to TBI (TBI only, TBI plus <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> and sham rTMS, and TBI plus <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> and rTMS). The <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> groups were included so that rTMS could be applied without anesthesia. Our results indicate that the restriction of movement and sham rTMS per se promotes recovery, as measured using a neurobehavioral scale, although rTMS was associated with faster and superior recovery. We also observed that TBI caused alterations in the CA 1 and CA 3 subregions of the hippocampus, which are partly restored by <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> and rTMS. Our findings indicated that <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> prevents damage caused by TBI and that intermediate-frequency rTMS promotes behavioral and histologic recovery after TBI...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Movement</b> <b>restriction</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an important modulator of changes in sensory and perceptual function and motor imagery performance that are observed in musculoskeletal pain syndromes. There are no empirical data to support this view. PURPOSE: The primary objective of this experiment {{was to determine the}} effects of <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> on local and widespread sensory, perceptual and motor imagery changes after exercise-induced muscular pain. Further objectives were to investigate whether changes in sensory perception are correlated with pain intensity and tactile acuity or motor imagery performance. METHODS: In forty healthy volunteers, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) of the non-dominant elbow flexors was induced using eccentric contractions until exhaustion. Participants were then randomised into two groups: a <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> group (wearing a sling) or a control group (not wearing a sling). Sensory and perceptual functions were measured using a range of sensory tests and a motor imagery performance task (left/right limb judgements). RESULTS: <b>Movement</b> <b>restriction</b> did not modulate any of the measures. We found concurrent mechanical hypoesthesia (p 3 ̆c 0. 01), reduced tactile acuity (p = 0. 02) and pressure hyperalgesia (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) at the painful side. We found evidence of widespread pressure hyperalgesia. Impaired tactile acuity was associated with a decrease in pain threshold to pressure (r = - 0. 34, p = 0. 03). Motor imagery performance was unchanged (p 3 ̆e 0. 35) by pain or <b>movement</b> <b>restriction.</b> CONCLUSION: Short-term <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> did not influence local and widespread sensory changes induced by experimentally induced muscular pain...|$|E

The recent finding that human subjects with chronic low back pain (LBP) have increased thickness and decreased mobility of the thoracolumbar fascia measured with ultrasound suggest that the fasciae of the back {{may be involved in}} LBP pathophysiology. This study used a porcine model to test the hypothesis that similar ultrasound findings can be produced experimentally in a porcine model by combining a local injury of fascia with <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> using a "hobble" device linking one foot to a chest harness for 8 weeks. Ultrasound measurements of thoracolumbar fascia thickness and shear plane mobility (shear strain) during passive hip flexion were made at the 8 week time point on the non-intervention side (injury and/or hobble). Injury alone caused both an increase in fascia thickness (p =. 007) and a decrease in fascia shear strain on the non-injured side (p =. 027). <b>Movement</b> <b>restriction</b> alone did not change fascia thickness but did decrease shear strain on the non-hobble side (p =. 024). The combination of injury plus <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> had additive effects on reducing fascia mobility with a 52 % reduction in shear strain compared with controls and a 28 % reduction compared to <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> alone. These results suggest that a back injury involving fascia, even when healed, can affect the relative mobility of fascia layers away from the injured area, especially when movement is also restricted...|$|E

40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease (FMD) is {{regarded}} as one of the greatest biological threats to the U. S. livestock industry because of its potential to cause catastrophic economic damages and massive livestock depopulation. Current U. S. contingency plans call for "stamping out" of FMD. An integral component of a "stamping out" policy is <b>movement</b> <b>restrictions.</b> The main purpose for <b>movement</b> <b>restrictions</b> is to stop the spread of disease, but they also disrupt the agribusiness sector. Welfare slaughter, the depopulation of healthy quarantined animals, is a possibility if <b>movement</b> <b>restrictions</b> are kept in place for prolonged periods of time. Many studies have analyzed the economic consequences of alternative mitigation strategies, but generally these studies have ignored the costs that might arise because of <b>movement</b> <b>restrictions</b> affecting uninfected premises located within the quarantine zone. Ultimately this study seeks to improve preparedness in the event of a FMD outbreak. It does this by developing information for those formulating plans on the costs associated with <b>movement</b> <b>restrictions</b> regarding quarantined, uninfected large feedlots located in the Texas High Plains Region. To accomplish this objective two strategies were compared: an unrestricted feed strategy, where feed is allowed to be brought onto uninfected premises and finished cattle are sold; and a welfare slaughter strategy, where feed isn't allowed to be brought onto the uninfected premises so animals are depopulated. In addition, seasonal differences in total costs were examined. This study expanded on the High Plains Study conducted by M. Ward, L. Highfield, P. Vongseng, and M. Garner by using their epidemiological data combined with a cost accounting framework to estimate the total cost of each strategy. This study examined direct disease management costs (indemnity payments, feed costs, marketing costs, surveillance costs, cleaning and disinfecting costs, appraisal cost, euthanasia costs, and disposal costs). Overall, the unrestricted feed strategy was less expensive than the welfare slaughter strategy, costing on average $ 22. 6 million compared to $ 48. 5 million, respectively. Disease outbreak timing did impact the overall cost of both strategies. The results suggest the policy makers should strongly consider creating movement policies that address feed supply and finished cattle movement for uninfected large feedlots in prolonged quarantine zones; as such policies appear to reduce outbreak related costs for stakeholder and the U. S. government...|$|R

Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether passive {{mobilization of}} shoulder region joints adds treatment benefit over exercise and advice alone for people with shoulder pain and minimal <b>movement</b> <b>restriction.</b> Design: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial with short-, medium- and longer-term follow-up. Setting: The study was conducted in a metropolitan teaching hospital. Patients: Ninety-eight patients with shoulder pain of local mechanical origin and minimal shoulder <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> were randomly allocated to either a control group (n= 51) or an experimental group (n= 47). Intervention: Participants in both groups received advice and exercises designed to restore neuromuscular control at the shoulder. In addition, participants in the experimental group received passive mobilization specifically applied to shoulder region joints. Measurements: Outcome measurements of shoulder pain and functional impairment, self-rated change in symptoms, and painful shoulder range of motion were obtained at 1, 3, and 6 months after entry into the trial. All data were analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle by repeated-measures analyses of covariance. Results: No statistically significant differences were detected in any of the outcome measurements between the control and experimental groups at short-, medium-, or longer-term follow-up. Limitations: Therapists and participants were not blinded to the treatment allocation. Conclusion: This randomized controlled clinical trial does not provide evidence that the addition of passive mobilization, applied to shoulder region joints, to exercise and advice is more effective than exercise and advice alone in the treatment of people with shoulder pain and minimal <b>movement</b> <b>restriction...</b>|$|E

The study aims were to estimate the magnitude and pattern of a CSF outbreak, to evaluate the effects of various <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> zone sizes, and to estimate the extent of animal welfare mitigation strategies in CSF outbreak control in Indiana. Risk metrics were developed to identify the most likely CSF outbreak scenarios in Indiana. The impacts of various <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> zone sizes (3 km, 5 km, 9 km, and 11 km) were evaluated and compared to a 7 km zone size. Risk assessment models were developed to estimate the time to animal welfare concerns, the number of swine premises to experience animal welfare concerns, and the extent of animal welfare mitigation strategies (e. g., on-farm euthanasia, movement of pigs to slaughter plants). ^ Nineteen single-site (i. e., with one index premises at the onset of an outbreak) and 15 multiple-site (i. e., with 3 ̆e 1 index premises at the onset of an outbreak) CSF outbreak scenarios were selected and simulated. The median (5 th, 95 th percentiles) epidemic duration (days) was estimated to be 224 (24, 343) in the single-site, and 201 (161, 285) in the multiple-site outbreak scenarios.

40|$|Purpose To {{report a}} series of {{patients}} with extra-ocular <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> and diplopia after orbital fracture repair, and {{determine the effect of}} timing of repair and the type of implant used. Methods A chart review was conducted identifying all patients > 18 years of age at our institution between June 2005 and June 2008 who underwent orbital fracture repair, and presented with clinically significant diplopia and extra-ocular <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> persisting longer than one month after repair. Data collected included timing of repair, implant used within the orbit, and need for revision. Results Ten patients were identified with a mean time to primary orbital fracture repair at 9 days (range 1 – 48). Seven patients underwent revision of their orbital fracture repair with removal of the previously placed implant and replacement with non-porous 0. 4 mm Supramid Foil, whereas one patient underwent lateral and inferior rectus recessions without revision of primary fracture repair. Titanium mesh was the intra-orbital implant found in all patients requiring revision of orbital fracture repair. All revisions resulted in resolution of clinically significant diplopia. Conclusions Clinically significant diplopia and extra-ocular <b>movement</b> <b>restriction</b> is not an uncommon complication after orbital fracture repair. In our series, there was a strong association between these complications and the use of porous titanium mesh implants. Revision of fractures significantly improved diplopia in all but one patient.
