This {{was different from}} the distinctive northwest European pattern of late marriage and high proportions never married late in life. But the underlying neolocal family formation behavior was the same in both colonial North America and the areas of origin of this population. Thus, Malthus was correct. Abundant resources rather than basic behavioral differences made early and extensive marriage possible in the colonies. Between 1800 and the present there have been long cycles in nuptiality. Since about 1800, female age at first marriage rose from relatively low levels to a peak around 1900. Thereupon a gradual decline commenced with a trough being reached about 1960 {{at the height of the}} baby boom. There then began another rapid upswing in female marriage age. Proportions never married at ages 45 - 54 replicated these cycles with a lag of about 20 - 30 years. Since 1880 (when comprehensive census data became available), <b>male</b> <b>nuptiality</b> patterns have generally paralleled those of women. Male marriage ages were higher than those of females with proportions never marrying also usually higher. Considerations of differentials by race and ethnicity are important in looking at the American experience over time. Black ages at marriage have, for example, moved from being lower to being higher than those for whites. More work is needed in the period 1800 to 1880 when we lack comprehensive census, vital, and other data. ...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, demographers {{have studied}} the {{determinants}} of nuptiality, sexual behaviour and fertility patterns {{from the perspective of}} women. The 1994 Cairo UN International Conference on Population and Development was an important turning point in demography. Since then, there have been efforts to understand the role of men in shaping nuptiality, sexual behaviour and fertility patterns and how men can be involved in population policies. This analysis of <b>male</b> <b>nuptiality,</b> sexual behaviour and fertility is based on data from the 1992 and 1996 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the 1994 Zimbabwe DHS. The aim was to investigate issues of male demography for these two countries. Methods of analysis included descriptive statistics, life table analysis, logistic and hazard regression models. Results show that most of the socio-economic characteristics are not very important determinants of male demography in these two countries. Age at marriage is higher than that of women but {{there is little evidence that}} age at marriage for men is rising. Polygamy remains popular in Tanzania, where the proportion of men in polygamous unions is more than twice that in Zimbabwe. However, intensity of polygamy is low, as the majority of polygamous men have only two wives. Age at first sex is earlier in Tanzania than in Zimbabwe and is falling in both countries, more so in Zimbabwe than in Tanzania. Fertility, measured in terms of the number of children ever born per man, is higher in Tanzania than in Zimbabwe. Then again, the differentials in the rate of childbearing did not widely vary once controls for marriage duration and type of union are made. The study makes recommendation for the improvement of the quality of demographic data collected from men. Questionnaires need to be more detailed by, for example, including questions on the timing of various unions that men might have. In the study of male fertility, there is also need for information from more than one partner that a man has had. Given the early initiation into sexual relations, the study recommends intervention policies such as early sex education and a wider campaign for safe sex given the large number of single men who have more than one sexual partner...|$|E
40|$|Studies of ma rriage market should {{capture the}} {{simultaneous}} determination of <b>male</b> and female <b>nuptiality</b> by socio-economic characteristics of both sexes. In this line, {{an extension of}} Cox proportional hazard model into two sexes is proposed. The basic assumption is that the marital hazard {{of male and female}} characteristics (i,j) is proportional to that of reference combination (0, 0). Two-sex partial likelihood function is defined by taking not an individual but a pair of male and female as the unit of analysis. The maximum likelihood estimator can be obtained by optimizing the function. Tied data can be treated {{in the same way as}} the one-sex model. Some methodological and interpretational problems are discussed. The author cannot provide either a complete computer program or a strict proof of asymptotic efficiency of the two-sex model but a small numerical example...|$|R
