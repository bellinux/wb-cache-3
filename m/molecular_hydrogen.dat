5|$|Water maser {{emission}} {{is observed}} primarily at 22GHz, {{due to a}} transition between rotational energy levels in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper maser level requires number densities of <b>molecular</b> <b>hydrogen</b> of order 108 cm−3 or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at <b>molecular</b> <b>hydrogen</b> number densities of roughly 1011 cm−3, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region. Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind shock waves propagating through dense regions in the interstellar medium. These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in the interstellar medium) required for maser emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.|$|E

These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction is measured by the ratio of the luminosity produced by hydrogen cyanide (HCN) relative to the luminosity of carbon monoxide (CO).|$|E

A mass spectrometer on the craft detected <b>molecular</b> <b>hydrogen</b> (H2) from the plume, and after months of analysis, the conclusion was made that the hydrogen was most likely the result of hydrothermal activity beneath the surface.

5|$|Throughout the universe, {{hydrogen}} is mostly {{found in the}} atomic and plasma states, with properties quite {{different from those of}} <b>molecular</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to redshift z=4.|$|E
5|$|Standard {{planetary}} models {{suggest that}} the interior of Saturn {{is similar to that}} of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles. This core is similar in composition to the Earth, but more dense. Examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of the Earth, which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000km. This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated <b>molecular</b> <b>hydrogen</b> that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000km and consists of gas.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter {{is thought}} to consist of a dense core {{with a mixture of}} elements, a {{surrounding}} layer of liquid metallic hydrogen with some helium, and an outer layer predominantly of <b>molecular</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> Beyond this basic outline, there is still considerable uncertainty. The core is often described as rocky, but its detailed composition is unknown, as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths (see below). In 1997, the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements, indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times that of Earth, or roughly 4%–14% of the total mass of Jupiter. The presence of a core during at least part of Jupiter's history is suggested by models of planetary formation that require the formation of a rocky or icy core massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the protosolar nebula. Assuming it did exist, it may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mixed with the molten core and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior. A core may now be entirely absent, as gravitational measurements are not yet precise enough to rule that possibility out entirely.|$|E
5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite <b>molecular</b> <b>hydrogen</b> causing ultraviolet emission. The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as Joule heating. This heating, which produces up to 300TW of power, {{is responsible for the}} strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter.|$|E
