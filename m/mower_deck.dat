50|$|If a flail strikes an {{immovable}} object, {{it simply}} bounces off. Other rotary type mowers {{have a tendency}} to grab and throw the object out of the <b>mower</b> <b>deck</b> if its small enough. This fact makes the flail mower best suited for areas where thrown objects would cause damage.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, the General Combustion company, {{which later}} merged with Mechtron International, boosted to over 1500 units per year. In this time, the First fully {{floating}} <b>mower</b> <b>deck</b> was manufactured. As the years progressed, a newer style frame and model line would be introduced. The 832 {{was a small}} frame tractor with a diesel engine.|$|E
40|$|Two common {{methods are}} {{currently}} used {{to clean the}} underside of a <b>mower</b> <b>deck.</b> Scraping {{the underside of the}} deck and spraying the underside of the deck with a hose. Both methods require the mower to be tilted on its side, which can lead to engine fluid leakage and other safety concerns. Team Mow Mat would like to construct a push mower mat to provide a safe and efficient way to clean the underside of a <b>mower</b> <b>deck</b> on a push mower. The mow mat will not only provide a safe and convenient of cleaning the underside of a push mower, it will be lightweight and fold for easy storage. Aluminum will be the material used to make it lightweight and a hinge system for easy storage...|$|E
5000|$|To {{fold the}} <b>mower</b> <b>decks</b> for {{transport}} and to unfold them into operating position Claas uses a special hydraulic folding design. For road transport the Cougar's cab is rotated 180Â°, {{so that the}} lifted and folded front and side mowers are located at the vehicle's rear then. Both, folding and cab rotating operations, are automatically managed and can easily be activated by the driver from within the cab. They only take a few seconds or minutes.The cab is air-conditioned and has airride seats, each window has its own wiper.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of Gravely riding tractors are, like the walk-behinds, characterized as [...] "all-gear", that is, with a rear-mounted engine mated to a transaxle powering the tractor's rear wheels. This design thus {{eliminates the need}} for drive belts to power the tractor forward or backwards. The only belts required on Gravely equipment (with the exception of the 408) is the blade drive belt for its <b>mower</b> <b>decks,</b> which is powered by a gear box on the deck, which receives power from a PTO driveshaft connected to the tractor's drivetrain. The tractor's direction is controlled by a lever {{to the right of the}} operator for forward, neutral, or reverse operation. Because of this, this tractor is often mistaken for having a hydrostatic drive.|$|R
5000|$|Professional {{grass-cutting}} equipment (used {{by large}} establishments such as universities, sports stadiums and local authorities) usually {{take the form}} of much larger, dedicated, ride-on platforms or attachments that can be mounted on, or behind, a standard tractor unit (a [...] "gang-mower"). Either type may use rotating-blade or cylindrical-blade type cutters, although high-quality mowed surfaces demand the latter. Wide-area mowers (WAMs) are commercial grade <b>mowers</b> which have <b>decks</b> extended to either side, many to 12 ft. These extensions can be lowered for large area mowing or raised to decrease the mower's width and allow for easy transport on city roads or trailers. Commercial lawn-mowing companies have also enthusiastically adopted types such as the zero-turn mower (in both ride-on and stand-on versions), which allow high-speed over the grass surface, and rapid turn-around at the end of rows, as well as excellent maneuverability around obstacles.|$|R
40|$|When the airflow {{patterns}} {{inside a}} lawn <b>mower</b> <b>deck</b> are understood, the deck can be redesigned to be efficient {{and have an}} increased cutting ability. To learn more, a combination of computational and experimental studies was performed to investigate the effects of blade and housing designs on a flow pattern inside a 1. 1 m wide corotating double-spindle lawn <b>mower</b> <b>deck</b> with side discharge. For the experimental portion of the study, air velocities inside the deck were measured using a laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) system. A high-speed video camera was used to observe the flow pattern. Furthermore, noise levels were measured using a sound level meter. For the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) work, several arbitrary radial sections of a two-dimensional blade were selected to study flow computations. A three-dimensional, full deck model was also developed for realistic flow analysis. The computational results were then compared with the experimental results. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{brief history}} of the lawn mower and the {{different}} innovations that developed over the years will be researched and discussed. This discussion will include the functionality of the different styles over the ages, especially the abilities of the powerful mowers of today. The research will then be utilized {{in the design of}} our commercial riding <b>mower</b> <b>deck</b> lift system for capstone, along with discovering othe...|$|E
40|$|Machine Tech Inc. {{has been}} {{assisting}} the author {{with the development}} of the peripheral mower blade decks. Machine Tech Inc. is still developing the batwing <b>mower</b> <b>deck,</b> which was started last fall after the completion of the mounted deck. The completion date of this program is slated for February. The wing covers and the center section of the batwing have been completed, the frame and drive-lines are now under development. Information from the nineteen-foot bat-wing deck prototype that they have been testing is now being used {{in the development of a}} more acceptable bat-wing mower. This unit will be able to maintain the same peripheral mower benefits, but will be much lighter and easier to pull requiring less fuel and damage to highway right of ways in soft areas. The mounted deck has been completed and is in the pilot stage with reports yet to be compiled. Machine Tech Inc. has also worked in an agricultural deck which is closely related to the mounted peripheral <b>mower</b> <b>deck</b> developed for the highway right of way. This will be one more outlet for the peripheral mower machines into the hands of the public...|$|E
