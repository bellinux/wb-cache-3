40|$|XI International Symposium on Vulcanospeleology, Pico Island, Azores, May 12 - 18, 2004. All Azorean lava-tubes and {{volcanic}} pits with fauna {{were evaluated}} for species diversity and rarity based on arthropods. To produce an unbiased <b>multiple-criteria</b> <b>index</b> (importance value for conservation, IV-C) incorporating arthropod species diversity based indices and indices qualifying geological and management features (e. g. diversity of geological structures, threats, accessibility, etc.), an iterative partial {{multiple regression analysis}} was performed. In addition, the complementarity method (using heuristic methods) was used for priority-cave analyses. Most hypogean endemic species have restricted distributions, occurring only in one cave. It was concluded that several well-managed protected caves per island are absolutely necessary {{to have a good}} fraction of the endemic arthropods preserved. For presence/absence data, suboptimal solutions indicate that at least 50 % lava-tubes with known hypogean fauna are needed if we want that 100 % of endemic arthropod species are represented in a minimum set of reserves. Based both on the uniqueness of species composition and/or high species richness and geological value of the caves, conservation efforts should be focused on the following caves: Gruta da Beira, Algar das Bocas do Fogo (S. Jorge); Montanheiros, Henrique Maciel, Soldão, Furna das Cabras II and Ribeira do Fundo (Pico); Algar do Carvão, Balcões, Agulhas and Chocolate (Terceira); Água de Pau (S. Miguel); Anelares and Parque do Capelo (Faial) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cave entrances in the Azores are {{particularly}} humid habitats. These {{provide opportunities for}} the colonization of a diverse assemblage of bryophyte species. Using both published data and new field sampling, we evaluated species diversity and rarity of bryophytes {{at the entrance of}} all known Azorean lava tubes and volcanic pits with such flora. Frequent species include the liverworts: Calypogeia arguta, Jubula hutchinsiae or Lejeunea lamacerina, and the mosses: Epipterygium tozeri, Eurhynchium praelongum, Fissidens serrulatus, Isopterygium elegans, Lepidopilum virens and Tetrastichium fontanum. Several rare Azorean bryophyte species appear at some cave entrances (e. g. Archidium alternifolium; Asterella africana; Plagiochila longispina), which reinforces the importance of this habitat for the regional conservation of these plants. To produce an unbiased <b>multiple-criteria</b> <b>index</b> (Importance Value for Conservation, IV-C), several indices based on bryophyte diversity and rarity, and also geological and management features, were calculated for each cave, and an iterative partial multiple regression analyses was performed. Data sows that three pit caves {{are particularly}} diverse in bryophytes (Algar do Carvão, Terceira Island, Bocas do Fogo, S. Jorge and Furna do Enxofre, Graciosa). Lava tubes with a diverse troglobitic fauna also are diverse in terms of bryophyte species (e. g., Algar do Carvão, Gruta dos Montanheiros, Gruta da Agostinha, Furna do Henrique Maciel). We also evaluate the utility of several cave management indices as surrogates of bryophyte diversity in Azorean volcanic cavities...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © Springer 2005. Nineteen {{areas in}} seven of the nine Azorean islands were {{evaluated}} for species diversity and rarity based on soil epigean arthropods. Fifteen out of the 19 study areas are managed as Natural Forest Reserves and the remaining four were included due to their importance as indigenous forest cover. Four of the 19 areas {{are not included in}} the European Conservation network, NATURA 2000. Two sampling replicates were run per study area, and a total of 191 species were collected; 43 of those species (23 %) are endemic to the archipelago and 12 have yet to be described. To produce an unbiased <b>multiple-criteria</b> <b>index</b> (importance value for conservation, IV-C) incorporating diversity and rarity based indices, an iterative partial multiple regression analysis was performed. In addition, an irreplaceability index and the complementarity method (using both optimisation and heuristic methods) were used for priority-reserves analyses. It was concluded that at least one well-managed reserve per island is absolutely necessary to have a good fraction of the endemic arthropods preserved. We found that for presence/absence data the suboptimal complementarity algorithm provides solutions as good as the optimal algorithm. For abundance data, optimal solutions indicate that most reserves are needed if we want that at least 50 % of endemic arthropod populations are represented in a minimum set of reserves. Consistently, two of the four areas not included in the NATURA 2000 framework were considered of high priority, indicating that vascular plants and bird species used to determine NATURA 2000 sites are not good surrogates of arthropod diversity in the Azores. The most irreplaceable reserves are those located in older islands, which indicates that geological history {{plays an important role in}} explaining faunal diversity of arthropods in the Azores. Based both on the uniqueness of species composition and high species richness, conservation efforts should be focused on the unmanaged Pico Alto region in the archipelago’s oldest island, Santa Maria...|$|E
