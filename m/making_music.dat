5|$|One of the boys, Hugh Masekela at St Peter's School, told Father Huddleston of his {{discovery}} of the music of Louis Armstrong. Huddleston found a trumpet for him and as the interest in <b>making</b> <b>music</b> caught on among the other boys, the Huddleston Jazz Band was formed. Hugh Masekela did not stay very long in Sophiatown. He was in the orchestra of King Kong and then made his own international reputation.|$|E
5|$|Helms and {{his friend}} Shannon Moore signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in May 1999. In WCW, Helms, along with Moore and Evan Karagias, formed the heel (villainous) stable (faction) 3 Count, and the trio debuted on the December 23 episode of WCW Thunder. The trio was a parody of the boy bands 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys, and their gimmick {{involved}} <b>making</b> <b>music</b> videos and performing songs before their matches.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{perceived}} impact of music students' active engagement in <b>music</b> <b>making.</b> Seventy-eight <b>music</b> {{students were asked to}} report on the impact that their participation in <b>music</b> <b>making</b> had on their lives. The data were analysed using Atlas. ti software. The findings fell within three categories: <b>music</b> <b>making</b> as a musical act, which allowed participants to deepen their musical knowledge and understanding; <b>music</b> <b>making</b> as a social act, where students felt that they were active contributors to a group outcome, developed a strong sense of belonging, gained popularity and made friends with 'like-minded' people, enhancing their social skills, and building up a strong sense of self-esteem and satisfaction; and <b>music</b> <b>making</b> influencing the self in terms of personal skill development facilitating the students' personal identity and encouraging the development of self-achievement, self-confidence and intrinsic motivation...|$|R

5|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with many commending the band for <b>making</b> <b>music</b> with a darker tone. However, {{the album was}} criticized for lacking a stand-out lead single. Commercially, the album was not as successful as Flood (1990), peaking at number 99 on the Billboard 200 and spending only six weeks on that chart. In addition, some fans were upset that and Flansburgh and Linnell opted to use a backing band for the album's tour, with some even boycotting shows.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, {{given the}} {{negative}} {{reaction to the}} Never Let Me Down album and this tour, Bowie found himself creatively exhausted and in low critical standing. Bowie {{decided to return to}} <b>making</b> <b>music</b> for himself, and, having been put in touch with Reeves Gabrels through his publicist for the Glass Spider Tour, Bowie formed his band Tin Machine in 1989 and retired his back catalogue of songs from live performance with his Sound+Vision Tour in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams {{was born}} to a well-to-do family with strong moral views and a {{progressive}} social outlook. Throughout his life he sought to be of service to his fellow citizens, and believed in <b>making</b> <b>music</b> as available as possible to everybody. He wrote many works for amateur and student performance. He was musically a late developer, not finding his true voice until his late thirties; his studies in 1907–08 with the French composer Maurice Ravel helped him clarify the textures of his music.|$|E

5|$|Rise Against {{was formed}} in 1999 after the {{dissolution}} of the Chicago punk rock band 88 Fingers Louie. Bassist Joe Principe and guitarist Dan Wleklinski were still interested in <b>making</b> <b>music,</b> and decided to start a new band. The two recruited drummer Toni Tintari, guitarist Kevin White, and lead vocalist Tim McIlrath, the former lead vocalist of the punk band Baxter. They called themselves Transistor Revolt, and released the extended play Transistor Revolt in 2000. Transistor Revolt garnered the attention of Fat Mike, the co-founder of the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. He signed the band to a recording contract in 2000, with the stipulation that they change their name; the band members ultimately decided on Rise Against.|$|E

The presenter of Body Move encourages children to participate in movement and dance, developing physical coordination and motor development. Linguistics and aural skills are at the centre of the Word Play segment, featuring a puppet named Chatterbox who assists in the exploration of language through stories and rhymes. Puzzles and Patterns has a focus on logical thinking and mathematics, with a puppet named Jup Jup used as a tool for the presenter to complete puzzles or solve problems.|$|E

5|$|The album charted {{at number}} 19 on the US Billboard 200, selling 18,000 copies {{in its first}} week in the United States. It also charted inter{{national}}ly on the national album charts in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Upon release, The Drug in Me Is You received mixed reviews. Critics consistently noted the contrast between hardcore music and pop music on the tracks, but to mixed reception. Overall, the lyrics were viewed as being cliché while Radke's singing and return to <b>making</b> <b>music</b> were noted. In addition, critics focused on the bitter relationship between Radke and his former band, Escape the Fate, in which reviewers noticed the choice to attack the band {{in many of the}} album's tracks. The Drug in Me Is You was chosen by the Guitar World magazine as the album number 21 among the top 50 albums of 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{album is}} the band's first after joining the main Victor Entertainment roster, after {{releasing}} two albums with Victor sub-label BabeStar. After {{the release of}} Night Fishing, the band began {{looking for a new}} management company to sign a contract with. Originally, the members did not want to leave Sapporo, especially guitarist Motoharu Iwadera and bassist Ami Kusakari. Of the five management companies they were choosing between, none of them needed the band to relocate, except for Hipland Management. Vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi realized that staying in Sapporo was against the band's goal of <b>making</b> <b>music</b> for a much wider group of listeners, and was surprised when all of the members agreed with him. In Spring 2008, the band moved to Tokyo from Hokkaido.|$|E
5|$|Wolfgang {{prepared}} for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which {{he had learned to}} play apparently without any tuition whatsoever. As for more general preparation, the children delighted in <b>making</b> <b>music</b> together, something they never lost. On tour, even during the busiest travelling days they would fit in their daily practice, appearing to thrive on the hectic schedule. Before the journey could begin, Leopold needed the consent of his employer, the prince-archbishop. Leopold had only been appointed deputy Kapellmeister in January 1763; nevertheless the archbishop's consent to an extended leave of absence was granted, {{on the grounds that the}} Mozarts' successes would bring glory to Salzburg, its ruler, and to God.|$|E

40|$|People {{make music}} {{for a variety}} of {{different}} reasons. The motivations to make music - and the roles of <b>music</b> <b>making</b> - are as unique and idiosyncratic as are the musicians. There are a number of studies that explore the roles of <b>music</b> <b>making</b> in the lives of young people (Adderley, Kennedy, & Berz, 2003; Campbell, Beegle, & Connell, 2007; Fetter, 2011; Parker, 2010, 2011). However, when examining young people’s perceptions of <b>music</b> <b>making,</b> there is little to no research capturing the voices of youth who do not identify as being heterosexual or cisgender. By illuminating the experiences of sexual and gender minority youth, researchers, music educators, school administrators, policy officials, and other community members can gain a greater understanding of their daily school and music experiences and begin to make changes to ensure a safer, more supportive school and music learning environment. The purpose of this qualitative, multiple case {{study was to examine the}} roles of <b>music</b> <b>making</b> in the lives of sexual and gender minority youth. Three research questions guided this inquiry: 1. 	How did participants describe their past and present <b>music</b> <b>making</b> experiences? 2. 	How did participants describe their sexual orientation and gender identity? 3. 	In what ways did participants’ answers to questions 1 and 2 provide information on the roles of <b>music</b> <b>making</b> in the lives of sexual and gender minority youth? Data sets were generated through multiple individual interviews, a focus group interview, video recordings of participant <b>music</b> <b>making,</b> participant supplied artifacts, participant-researcher communications, and researcher journal entries. <b>Music</b> <b>making</b> intersected with sexual orientation and gender identity in multiple ways. <b>Music</b> <b>making</b> allowed participants to explore aspects of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Participants’ <b>music</b> <b>making</b> also helped them express thoughts and feelings they found difficult to express with words. Additionally, for participants who felt disconnected from the queer community, <b>music</b> <b>making</b> in ensembles (e. g. drum corps, choir, quintets, etc.) fulfilled their need for socializing and support, for the time being. Finally, participants were most happy when they experienced an integration of identity and community...|$|R
5|$|When he {{was four}} years old, Gustav {{discovered}} his grandparents' piano and took to it immediately. He developed his performing skills sufficiently {{to be considered a}} local Wunderkind and gave his first public performance at the town theatre when he was ten years old. Although Gustav loved <b>making</b> <b>music,</b> his school reports from the Iglau Gymnasium portrayed him as absent-minded and unreliable in academic work. In 1871, in the hope of improving the boy's results, his father sent him to the New Town Gymnasium in Prague, but Gustav was unhappy there and soon returned to Iglau. On 13 April 1875 he suffered a bitter personal loss when his younger brother Ernst (b. 18 March 1862) died after a long illness. Mahler sought to express his feelings in music: {{with the help of a}} friend, Josef Steiner, he began work on an opera, Herzog Ernst von Schwaben ("Duke Ernest of Swabia") as a memorial to his lost brother. Neither the music nor the libretto of this work has survived.|$|E
