40|$|Phase I {{retrieval}} of post- 1970 TRU wastes from burial ground 218 -W- 4 C {{can be done}} in a safe, efficient, and cost-effective manner. Initiating TRU retrieval by retrieving uncovered drums from Trenches 1, 20, and 29, will allow retrieval to begin under the current SWBG safety authorization basis. The {{retrieval of}} buried drums from Trenches 1, 4, 20, and 29, which will require excavation, will commence once the uncovered drum are retrieved. This phased approach allows safety analysis for drum venting and drum module excavation to be completed and approved before the excavation proceeds. In addition, the lessons learned and the operational experience gained from the retrieval of uncovered drums {{can be applied to the}} more complicated retrieval of the buried drums. Precedents that have been set at SRS and LANL to perform retrieval without a trench cover, in the open air, should be followed. Open-air retrieval will result in significant cost savings over the original plans for Phase I retrieval (Project W- 113). Based on LANL and SRS experience, open-air retrieval will have no adverse impacts to the environment or to the health and safety of workers or the public. Assaying the waste in the SWBG using a <b>mobile</b> <b>assay</b> system, will result in additional cost savings. It is expected that up to 50 % of the suspect-TRU wastes will assay as LLW, allowing those waste to remain disposed of in the SWBG. Further processing, with its associated costs, will only occur to the portion of the waste that is verified to be TRU. Retrieval should be done, to the extent possible, under the current SWBG safety authorization basis as a normal part of SWBG operations.

The defense mission generated wastes that were either retrievably stored (i. e. retrievably stored waste) and/or disposed of in burial grounds. Challenges have emerged from retrieving suspect TRU waste including adequacy of records, radiological concerns, container integrity, industrial hygiene and safety issues, the lack of processing/treatment facilities, and the integration of regulatory requirements. All retrievably stored waste is managed as mixed waste and assumed to be TRU waste, unless documented otherwise. Mixed waste is defined as radioactive waste that contains hazardous constituents. The Atomic Energy Act governs waste with radionuclides, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs waste with hazardous constituents.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of measuring the transuranic (TRU) nuclide content of equipment removed from Hanford`s high-level radioactive-waste tanks {{has been established}} for components heavier than about 30 kg/m (20 lbs/ft). This conclusion has been reached based on experience with the TRU assay of waste burial boxes, planned improvements to the <b>assay</b> <b>equipment</b> design and <b>assay</b> methodology, and experimental investigation of neutron detector performance in high gamma-ray fields. The experiments indicate that the neutron detectors presently used with Pacific Northwest Laboratory`s box scanner perform correctly in gamma-ray exposure rates of at least 3 R/h. The design of equipment proposed for measuring TRU content incorporates multiple, BF{sub 3 }-gas-filled neutron counters in a configuration that is approximately 0. 5 m wide and 2 m long, with polyethylene to moderate high-energy neutrons down to thermal energy. Specially developed electrical systems are used to eliminate response to gamma-rays. Performance of the assay would require 10 to 14 hours of time during which close-range access is provided to the waste and its burial container. A standard neutron source, will be placed within the burial container (before inserting components) to allow calibration of the detector. Final calculation of the TRU contamination will utilize plausible conservative assumptions concerning the spatial, isotopic, and elemental distributions of any TRU present. For long-length equipment, the detector array collects data at various positions {{along the length of}} the equipment. Separate monitoring of the cosmic-ray-induced neutron background during the assay period will provide confidence that observed changes in counts at the equipment are not related to changing background.
