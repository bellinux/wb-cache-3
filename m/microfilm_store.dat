5000|$|... (also 'ultramicrofiche') is an {{exceptionally}} compact {{version of a}} microfiche or <b>microfilm,</b> <b>storing</b> analog data at much higher densities. Ultrafiche can be created directly from computers using appropriate peripherals. They are typically used for storing data gathered from extremely data-intensive operations such as remote sensing.|$|R
50|$|Records stored include genealogical {{and family}} history {{information}} contained in over 2.4 million rolls of microfilm and 1 million microfiche. This equals about three billion pages of family history records. The vault's library of microfilm increases by up to 40,000 rolls per year. Since 1999, the church has been digitizing the genealogical <b>microfilms</b> <b>stored</b> in the vault. The church makes the records publicly available through its Family History Centers, as well as online at its FamilySearch website.|$|R
5000|$|The drum stands {{approximately}} {{ten feet}} high on its carriage. Purdue {{is reluctant to}} disclose the exact measurements of the drum. Hayleigh Colombo of the IndyStar was able to confirm the drum's original size of 7 feet 3 inches in diameter and 3 feet 9 inches wide from <b>microfilm</b> <b>stored</b> at the Tippicanoe County Public Library. [...] Many of the original components, the carriage, axle, wheels, and wood shell of the drum are all intact and well preserved. Since its trip to Ireland with the [...] "All-American" [...] Marching Band {{in the spring of}} 2013, the drum has been remastered with new paint and select new parts to replace ones damaged on the trip. The carriage is built upon a Ford Model T back axle and wheelbase. The rims are steel wire spoke rims common during the 1910s in the racing circuit.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the book}} Spycatcher by Peter Wright (published in 1987) the {{technique}} is standard practice {{that has been used}} by MI5 (and other intelligence agencies) for many years, under the name [...] "barium meal test". A barium meal test is more sophisticated than a canary trap because it is flexible and may take many different forms. However, the basic premise is to reveal a secret to a suspected enemy (but nobody else) then monitor whether there is evidence of the fake information being utilised by the other side. For example, the double agent could be offered some tempting [...] "bait": e.g. be told that important information was stored at a dead drop site. The fake dead drop site could then be periodically checked for signs of disturbance. If the site showed signs of being disturbed (for instance, in order to copy <b>microfilm</b> <b>stored</b> there), then this would confirm that the suspected enemy really was an enemy: i.e. a double agent.|$|R

5000|$|The Kinkajou Microfilm {{projector}} {{is designed}} to assist night-time adult literacy education in developing countries. [...] The Kinkajou uses <b>microfilm</b> to <b>store</b> up to 10,000 reference images on a US$5 cassette. Using a high-intensity LED light source and inexpensive plastic optics adapted from Fisher-Price toys, the device is able to project the references images onto a classroom wall. The device draws power from a motorcycle battery, which users charge during the day using a small solar panel.|$|R
40|$|The British Library has {{recently}} unveiled plans {{for improving the}} collection care of, and digital access to, one of the world's greatest newspaper collections. The collection, which dates from the 16 th century, contains UK titles as well as 200 overseas titles and is at risk. 15 % of the collection is unusable because of its deterioration, and there are pressures on space and a need to develop greater digital content for access. The solution is to place all of the physical newspapers into a new, {{state of the art}} Newspaper Storage Building at Boston Spa, the British Library's main storage and logistics site, and home to its document delivery service. The building will comprise of 160 km of high density shelf space, fully automated under special environmental conditions including low oxygen, regulated 16 degree Celsius temperature, and 52 % humidity. Future access to the collection will be at the BL's main Library site at St Pancras, in a specially equipped reading room, so that researchers can integrate other collection items into their studies. However, access will be by surrogate means, initially <b>microfilm,</b> <b>stored</b> in London, and then, increasingly, digital access. By March 2009, the British Library will have digitised 3 million historic newspapers with JISC funds, and this content will be available to readers for free in reading rooms and on a paid for basis online, or via subscriptions. The Library is investigating a similar model going forward with a private sector partner who is willing to digitise and sell online out of copyright newspapers from the BL's collection for a fixed period. This will provide digital content for customers in reading rooms, free at the point of access...|$|R
5000|$|... 16 mm or 35 mm film to {{motion picture}} {{standard}} is used, usually unperforated. Roll <b>microfilm</b> is <b>stored</b> on open reels or put into cassettes. The standard lengths for using roll film is 30.48 m (100 ft) for 35mm rolls, and 100 ft, 130 ft and 215 feet for 16mm rolls. One roll of 35 mm film may carry 600 images of large engineering drawings or 800 images of broadsheet newspaper pages. 16 mm film may carry 2,400 images of letter sized images {{as a single}} stream of micro images along the film set so that lines of text are parallel {{to the sides of}} the film or 10,000 small documents, perhaps cheques or betting slips, with both sides of the originals set {{side by side on the}} film.|$|R
50|$|Worried at the {{outbreak}} of World War II and reminded of the devastation she witnessed during World War I, in 1941 Helen had every single record in the art archives <b>microfilmed,</b> which were <b>stored,</b> at first, in an underground bank vault, and later moved to the Midwest. As early as 1943, the Committee for the Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas was consulting with the library, compiling lists for the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, which located, identified and returned looted art {{at the end of}} World War II.|$|R
40|$|Components of a {{videotape}} storage and retrieval system originally developed for NASA have been adapted {{as a tool}} for law enforcement agencies. Ampex Corp., Redwood City, Cal., built a unique system for NASA-Marshall. The first application of professional broadcast technology to computerized record-keeping, it incorporates new equipment for transporting tapes within the system. After completing the NASA system, Ampex continued development, primarily to improve image resolution. The resulting advanced system, known as the Ampex Videofile, offers advantages over <b>microfilm</b> for filing, <b>storing,</b> retrieving, and distributing large volumes of information. The system's computer stores information in digital code rather than in pictorial form. While microfilm allows visual storage of whole documents, it requires a step before usage [...] developing the film. With Videofile, the actual document is recorded, complete with photos and graphic material, and a picture of the document is available instantly...|$|R
5000|$|Three {{layers of}} {{protection}} are recommended for {{the storage of}} film base photographic materials. Negatives and positives should be placed in sleeves or envelopes, which are then placed in a box or drawer, and these boxes or drawers on shelves or in a cabinet. Motion picture film and <b>microfilm</b> should be <b>stored</b> in unsealed containers in cabinets or on shelves. Labels such as acid-free, lignin-free, or buffered do not guarantee that a material is safe to use with photographic materials. Chemically inert papers may be harmful to the photographic image; {{the only way to}} be certain of the stability of the paper is to purchase materials that have passed the Photographic Activity Test (PAT). There are also considerations to be made regarding paper or plastic enclosures. Factors such as use, handling, and cost should be considered when selecting archival storage materials. There are several resources provided in the external links section below that can assist with the selection of proper storage materials for photographic materials.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, a few {{libraries}} {{began to}} implement microfilm as a means of preserving records. A 1904 fire in the National Library of Turin that destroyed more than half the manuscripts stored there raised concerns of preservation of unique and rare materials. In 1905, these issues were addressed at the Congres International pour la reproduction des Manuscripts, des Monnaies et des Sceaux. It was decided that a photographic library would be established in all libraries. In 1956, Unesco set up a special microfilm unit with the intention of visiting various countries to micro film books, documents, and other cultural material in danger of being destroyed and those which are irreplaceable. This special unit also trained technicians to handle microfilm. <b>Microfilm</b> readers are <b>stored</b> in special rooms known as “Reading rooms”, with two prevalent types of readers. The first is for use of transparent microphotographs and the other used for micro opaque cards. In modern translucent microfilm readers, light is projected into a film producing an enlarged image of the film on a translucent screen, and in opaque readers the same process occurs except the image in on an opaque screen. In using a translucent screen, the image can be seen in daylight, provided no direct sunlight in on the screen. The opaque screen however, is cheaper to produce but requires a darker room.|$|R
