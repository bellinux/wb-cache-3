50|$|This area plays a {{significant}} role in the annual cycle of waterfowl. The funnel-shaped outline of Hudson and James bays causes birds migrating from the Arctic to concentrate at the southern end of James Bay each autumn, particularly in the late autumn, where the extensive coastal wetlands provide critical staging and <b>moulting</b> <b>areas</b> for migrating lesser snow geese, dabbling ducks and shorebirds such as red knot, short-billed dowitcher, dunlin, greater yellowlegs, lesser yellowlegs, ruddy turnstone, and American golden plover.|$|R

40|$|Bird {{migration}} is generally scheduled to avoid other energetically expensive {{events in the}} annual cycle (e. g. moult) and seasons when survival can be difficult (e. g. northern winters). Purple Sandpipers winter at relatively high latitudes compared to other waders. It is suspected that the majority that winter in Britain and Ireland originate from Canada, {{but there is no}} primary evidence of their breeding grounds and migratory routes. These birds, characterised by their long bills, start to arrive in Britain and Ireland in late October/early November, after completing their post-nuptial moult at an unknown location. Fifty geolocators were attached to Purple Sandpipers in northern Scotland and southwest Ireland and we established for the first time their Canadian origin (Baffin Island and Devon Island), migration routes and post-nuptial <b>moulting</b> <b>areas.</b> Spring departure from Scotland and Ireland took place mainly in late May, followed by staging in Iceland and/or southwest Greenland before reaching the breeding grounds. Those that staged in Iceland departed earlier than those that flew directly to Greenland. Post-nuptial <b>moulting</b> <b>areas</b> were in southern Baffin Island, northern Quebec/Labrador (the Hudson Strait), and southwest Greenland. Migration from Baffin Island and Labrador took place during late October – early November, and during mid to late December from Greenland, usually in a single trans-Atlantic flight. Therefore, this migration was scheduled {{at a time when most}} other wader species are already on their wintering grounds. No birds staged in Iceland on the return trip. The flight from Baffin Island to Scotland and Ireland was accomplished in about 2. 5 days at an average speed of about 1400 km per day. Freezing of coastal waters may be the reason for the eventual departure from the Hudson Strait. The more northerly route via Iceland, taken in spring by most birds, and the more southerly route in early winter were associated with seasonal shifts in the Atlantic low pressure systems (depressions) whose anti-clockwise wind-flows would have assisted flights...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Westward moult migrations of seaducks {{were studied}} in the summers of 1972 and 1975 (northern Yukon) and 1977 - 78 (west of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska). Methods used were visual {{observations}} from the coast, aerial surveys, and (in 1975) DEW radar. Many male Oldsquaws (Clangula hyemalis) fly west near the north coast of Alaska in early July. Most seem to travel only a short distance; tens of thousands subsequently moult in various lagoons along northern Alaska. Few of the male eiders (Somareria spp.) that leave the Beaufort Sea in summer travel west along the coast past the two study areas. Instead, the main route may be seaward of the barrier islands until the eiders approach Point Barrow. In late June and July, several thousand male Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) fly west near the Yukon and Alaskan coast to <b>moulting</b> <b>areas</b> in lagoons. This flight, unlike moult migrations of most scoters, is not directed toward the wintering areas...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Moulting and post-breeding king eiders {{in western}} Greenland were {{surveyed}} in late August and early September of 1993, 1994, and 1995. We counted all eiders observed during fixed-winged aircraft flights along coastlines and offshore transects. The coastline {{in the survey}} area is roughly 13400 km long, and our flightlines totaled approximately 16 500 km. The areas optimal for the birds were covered fully several times; in less suitable areas, {{only a fraction of}} the coastline was covered. Using the largest count for coastlines covered more than once, we counted a total of 22 980 king eiders. Large numbers of king eiders were observed at a number of remote localities on the west coast of Disko Island and in southern Upernavik. At localities considered to have frequent human disturbance, few birds were observed. Highest densities were found along coasts with sandy or muddy areas at the shorelines. Overall we estimate that 30000 to 40 000 king eiders reside in the coastal zone of western Greenland in late August. Even allowing for a high turnover rate, as different individuals may occupy the <b>moulting</b> <b>areas</b> during the extended period from July to October, this figure can account for only half of a 1950 s estimate that 200 000 males and immatures were moulting in western Greenland...|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} a partial migrant, with birds {{moving away from}} areas where rivers and major lakes freeze in the winter, but {{resident}} where waters remain open. Eastern North American birds move south in small groups to the United States wherever ice free conditions exist on lakes and rivers; on the milder Pacific coast, they are permanent residents. Scandinavian and Russian birds also migrate southwards, but western European birds, and a few in Japan, are largely resident. In some populations, the males also show distinct moult migration, leaving the breeding areas {{as soon as the}} young hatch to spend the summer (June to September) elsewhere. Notably, most of the western European male population migrates north to estuaries in Finnmark in northern Norway (principally Tanafjord) to moult, leaving the females to care for the ducklings. Much smaller numbers of males also use estuaries in eastern Scotland as a <b>moulting</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
40|$|Individual-based data {{on little}} terns Sterna albifrons at a post-breeding <b>moulting</b> <b>area</b> {{were used to}} {{investigate}} the spatial extent at which this site attract birds. Combining information collected on young terns, ringed at the natal colonies, with that on birds captured {{a few months later}} at the moulting site, we estimated a survival/movement parameter for each age-by-colony combination. This parameter is the product between the survival probability and the probability to visit the moulting site. The distance between the natal colony and the moulting site negatively influenced the probability of reaching the site in yearlings. Having corrected for the distance from the <b>moulting</b> <b>area,</b> colony characteristics explained only about 10 % of the spatial variation in the survival/ movement parameter of juveniles. In older birds that had visited the site at least once in their life, neither the colony nor the distance affected the survival/movement parameter significantly. The average annual adult survival/movement probability was 0. 90. Juvenile survival between June and September was 0. 60. Overall results suggest that the <b>moulting</b> <b>area</b> could act as a 'population funnel' within a system of moult migration that involves birds breeding up to 500 km away. However, other unknown moulting site must exist within this area that could be important for the conservation of the species. © Journal of Avian Biology. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The moult {{migration}} of Greylag Geese Anser anser from Scania, southernmost Sweden, was studied based on resightings of neck-banded individuals marked in the breeding areas.

Lip to 1992, 72 % of all neck-banded Greylag Geese recorded front a <b>moulting</b> <b>area</b> were reported from Oostvaardeusplassen in the Netherlands, 600 km from the marking area. After 1992, there was a change in the moult migration and the majority of the reports of moulting Greylag Geese from Scania were from the Danish island of Saltholm a distance of 50 km away. Owing to the increase in the Greylag Goose population, the moulting sire at Oostvardersplassen probably reached its carrying capacity and the geese had to move their moult site.

40|$|Harbour seals {{were counted}} {{along the entire}} Norwegian coast at known {{moulting}} haulout sites in the period mid-August to early September 2003 - 2006. In 2003 - 2005, almost all known <b>moulting</b> <b>areas</b> from Finnmark to Vestfold counties were covered by aerial photo surveys flown at altitudes of approximately 800 - 900 ft (243 - 274 m), and at low tide (± 2 hours). Surveys in the Østfold County were flown in 2003 - 2006 at 300 ft (91 m), and the small tidal amplitudes permitted counts {{to be carried out}} irrespective of the tidal cycle. In some sub-areas, two or three independent surveys were conducted. Visual counts using binoculars from smaller boats and islands were carried out in some selected areas. The surveys revealed a total minimum population of 6, 705 harbour seals in Norwegian waters. Harbour seals were most abundant in the Nordland and Sør-Trøndelag counties with minimum estimates of approximately 2, 500 and 1, 500 seals, respectively. The presented minimum estimate is approximately 800 seals lower than an estimate obtained in a comparable study carried out during the moult in 1996 - 1999. Increased anthropogenic removals, and the phocine distemper virus (PDV) epidemic in the Skagerrak region in 2002, {{may have contributed to the}} current lower estimate. </div...|$|R
40|$|Some {{details of}} the Mallard ((Anas Platyrhynchos L.) ecology in Portugal, {{relevant}} for its management, were studied. Seven main subjects were included in that study: movements and migratory status; effects of loss and change of habitat; summer diet on rice fields; lead poisoning risk; the use of nasal saddles for population monitoring; sex and age effects on monthly survival rates during the shooting season; a preliminary model for a local population. The existence of a resident meta population composed by two groups was confirmed: one from Mondego to North and another from Tagus to South. Population dynamics was affected by environmental conditions on the refuge areas and rice fields. Mallards, however, didn't cause significant damages on rice production. Lead poisoning was confirmed, with estimation of monthly survival rates during the shooting period: the juveniles survived less than adults during the first month, as well as adult females in relation to males, suggesting a need to improve protection of <b>moulting</b> <b>areas,</b> because many females can not fly {{at the beginning of}} the shooting period.

40|$|International audienceThe {{non-breeding season}} of seabirds is {{extremely}} challenging to study because it isoften spent offshore under harsh environmental conditions. We used stable isotope analysis to investigatelittle auk Alle alle feeding ecology throughout the annual cycle. The geographic distribution oflittle auks in the Arctic covers {{a wide range}} of oceanographic conditions. We sampled birds from 5 different colonies located in the most important breeding areas (Greenland and Spitsbergen) toexamine how individuals breeding in contrasting marine environments differ in their trophic nichethroughout the year. We found differences in summer δ 15 N values among the colonies, suggestingdifferent target species despite low overall δ 15 N values in blood, which indicates a diet that is primarilycomposed of copepods. A rise in δ 15 N values between summer and autumn indicated that adultschanged their trophic status to feed at a higher trophic level. During autumn, a large overlap infeather δ 13 C values between colonies suggests a common <b>moulting</b> <b>area</b> off Northeast Greenland. During winter, the isotopic signatures show that the trophic status of Greenland and Spitsbergenbirds differed, with birds from Greenland feeding at low trophic levels (probably mostly on copepods),and birds from Spitsbergen maintaining a higher trophic level.

40|$|Many marine predators migrate between {{breeding}} and non-breeding areas to target {{resources that are}} seasonal but spatio-temporally predictable, and so are vulnerable to climate-induced changes in prey phenology and abundance. In the Southern Ocean, small petrels are major consumers, but perturbations in the ecosystem through ocean warming are altering food-web structure and {{have been linked to}} poleward shifts in distribution of their cold-water zooplankton prey. In this study, we focus on 2 small congeneric petrels; the broad-billed prion Pachyptila vittata, and the Antarctic prion P. desolata. Both are planktivorous, but the broad-billed prion specialises in feeding on large copepods. We investigate historical trends in non-breeding distribution by analysing feather stable isotope ratios from a time-series dating back to 1926, and examine contemporary non-breeding distributions of broad-billed prions tracked using miniaturised geolocation-immersion loggers. After controlling temporally for the Suess effect, we found that the δ 13 C signatures of Antarctic prions, but not broad-billed prions, declined during the study period. This suggests a southward shift in Antarctic prion non-breeding distribution over the last century. Both species exhibited significant declines in δ 15 N during the same period, indicative of long-term decreases in marine productivity in their <b>moulting</b> <b>areas,</b> or changes in the trophic structure of prey communities. Tracked broad-billed prions migrated ca. 1000 km to an area east of the breeding colony where the Louisville seamount chain bisects the subtropical front. Topographically driven upwellings are stable and predictable features and may be crucial in aggregating plankton. Targeting seamounts could therefore mitigate the impact of climate-induced prey shifts by providing refugia for the broad-billed prion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{determine}} whether stable isotope measurements of bird feathers {{can be used}} to identify <b>moulting</b> (interbreeding) foraging <b>areas</b> of adult seabirds, we examined the stable-carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) isotopic composition of feathers of chicks and adults of black-browed albatrosses (Diomedea melanophrys) from Kerguelen Islands, southern Indian Ocean. Albatross chicks are fed primarily fish (75 % by mass), the diet being dominated by various species of the family Nototheniidae and Channichthyidae which commonly occur in the shelf waters {{in the vicinity of the}} colony. d 13 C and d 15 N values in chick feathers, which are grown in summer in the breeding area, were lower than values in adult feathers, which are grown in winter (d 13 C: – 19. 6 ‰ versus – 17. 6 ‰ and d 15 N: 12. 4 ‰ versus 15. 7 ‰, respectively). No differences in d 13 C and d 15 N values were found in adult wing feathers moulted in 1993 and 1994 and in adult feathers formed at the beginning, middle and end of the 1994 moulting period. These data are consistent with adults moulting in the same area and feeding at the same trophic level from one year to the next and with no major changes in foraging ecology within a given moulting season; they suggest that foraging grounds were different in summer and winter and that these differed in their stable-isotope signature. Changes in both feather d 13 C and d 15 N values indicated feeding south of the Subtropical Front (STF) during chick rearing, which is in agreement with the known foraging ecology at this time and feeding north of the STF during moult. This, together with band recoveries from adult birds, indicates that black-browed albatrosses from Kerguelen Islands wintered in subtropical waters off southern Australia. The stable-isotope markers in feathers, therefore, have the potential for locating <b>moulting</b> <b>areas</b> of migratory seabird species moving between isotopically distinct regions and for investigating seabirds' foraging ecology during the poorly known interbreeding period.

The present paper describes the results of a number of aerial counts of the moulting population during 1959. The first migrants appeared in July but many of these appeared to leave {{before the end of the}} month v/ithout moulting. There is evidence of a second peak in early August followed by a steady build up in numbers to the seasonal maximum of nearly 3, 300 recorded at the beginning of September. The largest number of moulting birds (roughly estimated at 2, 700) was found at this time also with a smaller concentration later on in October. It is believed that there were at least two and possibly three waves of immigrants in July, (August) and September. Moulting birds were found during August. September and October with maxima in September and October. It seems probable that the first Shelduck were largely passage birds followed by the moult migrants with the non-breeders preceding the breeding birds.

40|$|Six {{adult male}} pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus), tagged with {{satellite}} transmitters, were tracked in Svalbard {{during the period}} of June–September in 2003 and 2004. The {{purpose of the study was}} to describe the movements and staging periods of individual geese during the post-breeding period to investigate a possible moult migration among pink-footed geese in Svalbard. All geese moved about 200 km east from their potential breeding (summering) areas in western Spitsbergen. The preferred <b>moulting</b> <b>area</b> was the island of Edgeøya, where four geese staged prior to a southward autumn migration. Five geese left potential breeding areas between 11 and 30 June, and remained for more than 25 days in eastern areas during most of July, which we interpret as the moult migration of either failed or non-breeders. Geese left moulting areas in mid-August, using an average of 1. 4 staging areas before the autumn migration, suggesting that moult sites support pre-migration hyperphagia. Only one goose remained at the suspected breeding site from early June to early September. Mean monthly temperatures in the summering and moulting ranges of the geese were calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. The mean June moult range temperature (− 0. 9 °C) was significantly lower than that of the summering ranges (4. 6 °C). The July mean moult range temperature did not differ significantly from that in June on the summering ranges. We contend that failed or non-breeding pink-footed geese move eastward in Svalbard to exploit the early stages of summer plant growth as a result of the delayed thaw compared with central and southern Spitsbergen...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{predation}} by an avian predator (great crested grebe Podiceps cristatus) and a predatory fish (perch Perca fluviatilis) {{on a common}} resource, the small planktivorous fish smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) was studied in Lake IJsselmeer, The Netherlands, in July-October 1985 - 1988. At {{this time of the}} year the grebes are in simultaneous wing-moult and therefore temporarily flightless. Four factors limit the predation pressure by grebes: (1) an underwater visibility threshold of c. 40 cm Secchi depth is the lower limit at which large numbers attend the moulting site, (2) a lower density threshold of exploitable smelt biomass of c. 30 kg/ha determines the actual fishing areas, (3) a fish size threshold of 6. 5 cm total length further limits prey availability, and (4) the vertical movements of the prey impose a strong (diel) time constraint on the birds, allowing only crepuscular foraging. Perch, the other main predator in this system, is less restricted in its foraging. Perch were found to be in direct competition with the grebes, preying heavily on the juvenile smelt. Over the 4 years of study 90 % of all predation from 15 July to 15 October (72 - 233 kg/ha) was due to perch. The high level of predation by birds and fish was only possible due to a continuous immigration of smelt into the area (1. 45 kg/ha per day). In three of the four years, however, the combined predation by fish and birds surpassed the immigration rate of the prey, which led to a strong reduction in smelt stocks in the study area. A conceptual model is developed to describe the different sets of constraints on the grebes' foraging. First, the state of eutrophication in relation to the weather condition determines the degree of algal blooms, and thus underwater visibility, in late summer. This is the major factor governing the numbers of grebes on the <b>moulting</b> <b>area.</b> Second, the size of the population of predatory fish determines the overall food availability (biomass and size distribution of smelt). These factors are partly interconnected and related to human action (pollution, fisheries). It is suggested that, despite deteriorating visibility conditions, the largest moulting site for grebes in Europe at Lake IJsselmeer exists because the stocks of predatory fish are kept low by overfishing. ...|$|E

40|$|Following a large kill of Black Guillemots in the Esso Bernicia {{oil spill}} in Shetland, this study was {{initiated}} to determine the population size and distribution of the species {{at different times of}} year and to investigate its ecology. The results will enable oil spill contingency plans to be made for this species and provide a base-line against which future work can be compared. This is the first major study of Black Guillemots in the UK. There were large diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in colony attendance patterns which were investigated in relation to various factors. Reliable census techniques were devised and suitable stretches of coastline were established as monitoring units. Black Guillemots rarely foraged in water more than 40 - 50 m deep, and seldom moved more than 3 km from the nest during the breeding season. The proximity of suitable breeding sites to shallow water feeding grounds accounted for the fairly regular breeding dispersion. On islands with mammalian predators only nest sites in inaccessible cliffs were used. In many areas breeding numbers were limited by nest site availability. The distribution at other times of year was more irregular. After breeding adults congregated in traditional <b>moulting</b> <b>areas</b> where they became flightless for 4 - 5 weeks. These flocks of up to c. 600 adults constitute vulnerable "hot spots" at which the effect of oil pollution would be most severe. In winter there was some movement away from exposed coasts, resulting in concentrations in more sheltered, inshore waters. A wide range of fish and invertebrates were eaten by adults, largely reflecting the diversity of inshore benthic communities. There appears to be a greater dependence on invertebrates during the winter months, when fish are scarcer. Chicks were fed almost exclusively on fish: their diet composition was determined primarily by local availability, although some adults specialised on particular species. When large gadoid fish became available in late summer adults were able to provide more energy per feed and consequently chicks were heavier at fledging. Breeding parameters were quantified and analysed in relation to various factors. Breeding success and chick growth compared very favourably with results of studies elsewhere, indicating that conditions for breeding were good for Black Guillemots in Shetland. In a year of more favourable environmental conditions a greater proportion of inexperienced birds were able to reach the condition threshold for breeding. These birds tended to lay single-egg clutches, in sub-optimal sites at which egg predation was heavy and breeding success low. Some pairs of Arctic Skuas benefit ed considerably from kleptoparasitism of chick feeds at larger colonies, but Black Guillemot breeding success was not affected and chick growth was only depressed at high rates of piracy. Overall, conditions in Shetland are favourable throughout the year for this seabird, whose ecology is moulded to the exploitation of an inshore feeding niche. </p...|$|R

Adult barnacle geese (341) were captured, marked and measured during their annual wing moult. Birds with broods started to moult approximately 2 weeks later than non- and failed breeders. Weight loss during moult was 3 times as rapid as reported for barnacle geese breeding in the Baltic, and a large cost of reproduction seemed to exist in the form of reduced body weight at the onset of moult for birds leading broods. Work in the area will continue over the coming years to document and explain the differences in major life-history parameters, dynamics and environmental effects between arctic and temperate breeding barnacle-goose populations...|$|R
40|$|Data on {{counts of}} {{shorebirds}} and information from ringing and colour-marking studios are examined and integrated to provide {{detailed information on}} seasonal changes in distribution, and movements of' Knot, Bartailed Godwit and Grey Plover in North- West Europe, particularly Britain. Several factors which may lead to the movements observed, particularly those factors affecting energy balance, are considered. Published information on seasonal changes in weather conditions in Britain and Europe, and on prey abundance in different estuaries, is reviewed and supplemented by studies from Morecambe Bay and the Tees and Humber estuaries. It is suggested that late autumn movements of Knot and Bar-tailed Godwit from the eastern North Sea to Britain permit birds to avoid severe winter weather conditions. Movements of many Knot northward from the Wash along the east coast of Britain also occur in November, perhaps to reach estuaries less influenced by cold sir masses from Europe. The reasons for most other movements are unclear. No evidence was found of major differences between estuaries in the timing of breeding or growth rates of invertebrate prey, which might have led to the differences in timing of peak prey biomass for shorebirds to exploit. Differences have been found in the seasonal patterns of depth distribution of Macoma balthica between Morecambe Bay, the Wash and Humber. However, the timing of movements of' Knot between these estuaries could not be related to these differences in availability of prey. Availability of Macoma on Morecambe Bay in spring is high and may partly explain why high numbers of Knot collect there to put on pre-migratory fat reserves. Movements of Knot through the Tees estuary appear to be unrelated to changes in prey abundance or availability. Two alternative survival strategiesare suggested for this species: (1) itinerancy, visiting two or more British estuaries after moult, and (2) sedentary behaviour, visiting only one estuary after moult, or staying on the <b>moulting</b> <b>area.</b> Seasonal use of the Tees estuary by, and movementsto and from there of, Grey Plover were studied in relation to spacing behaviour and prey availability. Two strategies of use of space by Grey Plover were found. Territoriality was shown to be particularly advantageous during periods of severe particularly windy, weather. Flock feeding was adopted by some birds which could not, and by some individuals which chose not to, obtain a territory. Some movements of Grey Plover from the estuary were probably determined by social status. A few of those which were unable to obtain a territory in autumn left the estuary. No evidence of movement in relation to prey availability was obtained...|$|E
40|$|Today's {{intensive}} farming {{practices are}} known to have affected farmland biodiversity negatively in many different ways. As far as birds are concerned, they {{are known to}} have suffered during both summer and winter. Relatively {{little is known about the}} effects on birds during migration. We studied the stopover ecology of the Eurasian golden plover Pluvialis apricaria, a species listed in EU Birds Directive, in intensively farmed arable land in southernmost Sweden in the autumns of 2003 - 2007. We used key ecological variables (length of stay, fat deposition and moult) as fitness proxies to evaluate how the birds manage in this habitat. Eurasian golden plovers were present in large numbers mainly on arable fields from early August to November and radio-tagged birds were found to stay in the area for up to three months. Adult birds carried out a substantial part of their flight feather moult during their stay. Body mass increased only somewhat during moult, but from the last stages of moult and onwards fuel loads corresponding to 24 % above lean body mass (LBM) were accumulated at a rate of 0. 5 % of LBM per day, before the birds departed. Juveniles arrived later, from mid Sep., and had a similar pattern of fuel deposition. The fact that the birds choose to stay for long periods, <b>moult</b> in the <b>area,</b> and manage to store substantial fuel loads strongly suggests that Eurasian golden plovers do well in this intensively farmed arable land...|$|R
40|$|Myers {{proposed}} the Migration Distance Hypothesis (that {{the costs of}} long-distance migration force a compensating reduction in breeding investment) to explain parental care differences between species and sexes in shorebirds. This thesis proposes that seasonally increasing predation danger during migration is the main cost of extending breeding investment, and examines whether danger and other cross-seasonal factors predict reproductive patterns of Pacific Dunlins (Calidris alpina pacifica) and other shorebird species breeding in Alaska. The Predation Danger Hypothesis assumes that moult and migration schedules of shorebirds evolved to minimize exposure to raptors, especially migratory Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus). The hypothesis predicts that these scheduling considerations affect parental care because they either require shorebirds to depart breeding areas early and in advance of falcon migration and <b>moult</b> on non-breeding <b>areas</b> prior to the migratory arrival of falcons; or to remain on or near northern breeding <b>areas</b> to <b>moult,</b> and migrate after falcon passage. Following breeding, Pacific Dunlins linger in Alaska until October, arriving on wintering areas after peak falcon passage. I found that breeding Pacific Dunlins renested and double-brooded extensively. Female Pacific Dunlins invested more time to reproduction and remained longer on the breeding grounds than female Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri), their sympatrically-breeding, ecologically-similar, and early-migrating congener. The breeding seasons of both species were initiated on almost the same day, but the breeding investment of female Pacific Dunlins exceeded that of female Western Sandpipers by 7. 2 days, and the seasonal decline in parental care duration of Western Sandpipers was steeper than in Pacific Dunlins. As predicted, Western Sandpipers but not Pacific Dunlins departed sooner in years with early falcon southward migration (related to snowmelt timing), and they gave up more breeding opportunity to do so. Stable isotope analyses showed that Dunlins and other sandpipers are primarily income rather than capital breeders and I found little support for the Differential Parental Capacity Hypothesis (that female shorebirds truncate care due to higher investment in egg production). These findings support the Predation Danger Hypothesis and highlight how predation danger can have far-reaching impacts on the life histories of potential prey species...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand Woodpigeon or Kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) is a {{monomorphic}} pigeon that {{is often}} seen in urban and rural areas, feeding on native or introduced plants throughout the year. The Department of Conservation (DoC) offices around New Zealand, in particular the lower North Island, receive many Kereru each year due to predation and fatalities caused by impacts with windows and vehicles. Little scientific work has been conducted on such a valuable resource to date, so in this study I accessed and used 50 of these Kereru, as well as 76 reports from the Massey Wildlife Clinic (the wildlife surgery and rehabilitation wing of the Institute of Animal, Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences (IVABS)), 20 specimens from Massey‟s necropsy database and 119 moult records from other workers, to study four aspects of impact injuries and Kereru biology as outlined below. (1) The type and extent of injuries that were sustained through collision events and how this affected rehabilitation. We used radiographs and necropsies to determine the skeletal and soft tissue injuries in 70 Kereru that died in such collisions, and radiographs of 61 birds that were assessed or treated having survived initial impacts. Vehicle collisions tended to result in damage to the extremities (wing and femur), whereas collisions with windows resulted in trauma to the head, fractures/dislocations of the coracoids and clavicles, and ruptured internal organs. Fractured coracoids frequently damaged flight muscles and ruptured the heart. Extensive bruising of pectoral muscles and haemorrhaging of the lungs {{was due to the}} force of impact. Rehabilitation time was not related to the number of skeletal injuries sustained, nor was the time until death for those that did not survive. Flight speed and force calculations suggest that a 570 g Kereru would collide with 3 - 70 times the force that smaller birds (5 - 180 g) would; this may explain the discrepancies between the injuries characterised here and those reported for North American passerines. The differences in injuries sustained from collisions with windows and cars can be used to inform rehabilitators about the possible nature of injuries if the source of impact is known. (2) Morphometry, gastrointestinal organ masses and crop contents. Of 50 Kereru that died due to impact collisions, little physical variation was found between sexes; males had longer head/bill lengths. Overall, different structural measures were positively related (mass and tarsus, wing and tail, mass and head-bill and head-bill and tarsus) but variation was generally high between individuals. Fat scores of Kereru were closely related to environmental seasonal variation and 80 % of birds were in good body condition. Kereru lack caeca and there were no sexual differences in reference to dry organ mass (liver, intestine, gizzard and crop). Organ masses reflected body mass and size to varying degrees: liver mass was best explained by body mass, gizzard mass by tarsus length as much as body mass, and intestine mass only by body mass. Kereru intestines were proportionately shorter than those of herbivorous grouse, despite grouse having long caeca to help with digestion of plant matter. Kereru seem to rely on long retention times instead, and up to 68 g of plant matter were found in the crop, gizzard and intestines. There were no sexual differences in mass of consumed materials found within the gastrointestinal tract, consisting of introduced and native material (foliage/flowers/buds/fruits). Digesta accounted for 0. 12 – 13. 4 % of total Kereru body mass. (3) Kereru flight feather <b>moult,</b> wing <b>area</b> and wing loading. One hundred and sixty nine Kereru moult records showed that Kereru moult over a nine month period (July – March/April), with a restricted moult of tail feathers during the breeding season. Kereru moult is symmetrical in relation to the number of primary feathers moulted, but not in respect to the position on the wing. Kereru often have multiple moult loci and do not follow a conventional moult sequence. This moult strategy reduces the effect that feather gaps have on wing area and thus wing loading. The moult strategy of Kereru is a solution that works to minimise the change in wing area, but at the cost of having a prolonged moult. (4) Plumage colouration assessed using reflectance measurements from light spectrometry. This study is the first to assess UV signals in Kereru and UV signals were found in all eight regions investigated, five plumage (Breast, Crown, Mantle, Wing and Rump) and three bare parts (Bill base, Bill tip and Foot). The greatest intensity of maximum UV signal (uvmax) was in the bare parts with a covariance of the bill tip and foot. No sexual differences or condition dependent signals were found, but age-related UV signals were found in the crown and foot. In the visual spectrum, females had a greater intensity of maximum colour signal (rmax) in the wing. Age-related colouration was seen predominately in the bare parts, in particular the foot which has a higher intensity of colour in juveniles. Even with single-angle light spectrometry Kereru are a highly cryptic species...|$|R
