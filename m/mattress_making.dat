Emphasis is given to noise emitted by individual industrial machinery from the selected industries. Event L Aeq and LN cycle were studied to identify the noisy machines and to generate baseline data. Findings show that, hammer mill machine from mineral crushing mills produced the highest average noise (98. 4 dB(A), electric generator 1 (95. 6 dB(A) from soft drink bottling industry, electric generator (97. 7 dB(A)) from beer brewing and bottling industry, vacuum pump (93. 1 dB(A)) from tobacco making industry and electric generator 2 (94. 1 dB(A) from <b>mattress</b> <b>making</b> industry. The highest and lowest average noise exposure levels are recorded in mineral crushing mills (93. 16 dB(A)) and <b>mattress</b> <b>making</b> industry (84. 69 dB(A)) respectively. The study shows that at 95 % confidence level, there is significant difference (p< 0. 05) in noise levels in the industries surveyed. The percentages of machines emit noise above FEPA and OSHA recommendation (90 dB(A)) are: soft drink bottling industry (83. 3 %), beer brewing and bottling industry (42. 9 %), tobacco making industry (71. 4 %), <b>mattress</b> <b>making</b> industry (11. 1 %) and minerals crushing mills (87. 5 %).

40|$|The Texas Department of Criminal Justice Utilities and Energy Department (TDCJ-U&E) has {{completed}} {{the first phase}} of a detailed energy use submetering system that {{will be one of the}} largest such installations in the United States at the second largest state prison system in the nation. Through responsibility accounting, TDCJ unit wardens and other staff needed to be able to monitor and justify the utility and energy use and expenses for the various prison industries and agricultural operations. These facilities are scattered at many locations around the state and cover a diversity of prison industries and agricultural operations from meat packing operations to metal fabrication, furniture restoration, garment and shoe factories, vehicle restoration, soap and detergent plants, <b>mattress</b> <b>making</b> and graphics that include sign and license plate manufacturing. The Energy Systems Laboratory (ESL) with New Horizon Technologies, Inc. (NHT) proposed to install a state-of-the-art submetering system that would meet the needs of the TDCJ system well into the future. Upon award of the contract, TDCJ-U&E assisted the ESL and NHT in conducting numerous surveys of the proposed metering locations, coordinated installations of the equipment with local unit wardens and staff, then installed the system hardware and software. The system uses a web-based user interface and is capable of real-time data acquisition and display. SquareD supplied the components for the field metering installation and local plumbing contractors either retrofitted existing gas meters or installed new meters as required. Preliminary testing began in late summer of 2000 and the system is collecting 15 minute interval utility and energy consumption data.

Osvrnuvši se na problematiku istraživanja i analize tkanih nosilaca te na usporedbe parametara s obzirom na vrijeme i mjesto nastanka te tehnologiju izrade slika, autorica se dotiče i razloga odabira platna za madrace u povijesnom slikarstvu. Striped cloths {{appear as}} painting supports from the 16 th to the 20 th century {{in and outside}} Europe. These are mostly flax matress ticking, woven into varieties of twill (diagonal weave) and especially reverse twill (herringbone). Only few historical mattresses have been preserved, e. g. those in royal palace interiors {{such as the one}} in Hampton Court in London. Dark blue striped pattern appeared on mattresses as early as the Antiquity, and the terminology for the twill fabrics used (also) for <b>mattress</b> <b>making</b> originated in this period in the regions ruled by the Roman Empire. Reasons for the use of various types of fabrics, including the mattress ticking as painting supports, are not investigated enough, but it does appear that their availability and economic reasons were often the only selection criteria. Although it is impossible to make general conclusions, some documents and examples indicate that the twill fabrics were used for exceptionally large paintings. In the context of painting, mattress ticking is mentioned in Flemish, English and French documents and painter’s manuals published from the 17 th to the 19 th century. In Ita ly, Istria, Dalmatia and Spain, the historical terms for the twill fabrics used for making mattresses and work clothes (traliccio, terlise, trliš, terliz etc.) is of Latin origin (trilix) and initially did not denote the fabric’s designation but {{had to do with the}} type of weave. Variants of these terms are mentioned in the trading documents and archives of textile manufacturers in north Italy, and in connection with the painting commissions in 16 th- and 17 th-century Italy and Spain. The studies of painting supports in Flemish and Dutch art of the 17 th and 18 th century provide the most details about paintings on mattress ticking, with detailed accounts of canvases by Maarten de Vos, Pieter Pieters, Nicolas de Liemaker and Pieter Johannes van Reysschoot. The weave is described as a warp-faced reverse twill (chevron) 3 / 1. The earliest example of a painting on a mattress ticking from blue-striped reverse twill that is known to the author is The Battle of the Spurs by an unknown artist, made in England around 1540 (Hampton Court Palace, London). Also in England, Anthony van Dyck painted several extraordinarily large pieces, and there are known works by other artists on this type of canvas from the 17 th, 18 th and 19 th century. In France, artists had from the 17 th to the 20 th century sometimes painted on a similar support, among them Philippe de Champaigne and François Boucher. The author is aware of only two examples of paintings on canvas with blue stripes in Italy. The paper also touches upon the issue of research of painting canvases. The technology of making a painting, the natural processes of deterioration and historical alterations and treatments make analyses of the structure, colour and finishing difficult, and by that also make it hard to determine the original characteristics and designation of the fabric the painter had used. With still few specialist studies which would have differing approaches to canvas research, the analytical parameters are sometimes hard to compare or apply. Although their number is in continual decline, in Dalmatia there are still paintings that haven 2 ̆ 7 t been restored i. e. lined. Given that indirect methods of analysis of the original canvases for lined paintings still have limitations, amid their many possibilities, each unlined painting represents a precious possibility to study the history of painting supports but also of historical textiles. The differentiation between the warp and the weft is a precondition for a comparison of the parameters of painting canvases; however, selvedges of the fabric are relatively rarely preserved. According to a study by van der Wetering, the differences in the quality of threads that can be seen with some types of handwoven canvases are for the time being the most reliable criterion for differentiating between the warp and weft. The second criterion, that is applicable to canvases without the visible difference in the quality of threads, is the difference in the number of threads. The comparative analysis of several 17 th- and 18 th-century canvases from Dalmatia included these parameters: dimensions of the canvas support, width of the fabric, direction of the warp, description of the characteristics of threads in both directions, number of threads of the warp and weft by centimetre, type and unit of the weave, description of the striped pattern. Parameters for painting canvases are difficult to compare according to the place and time of their origin. They vary considerably within the same period and region, even within a single artist’s body of work. Depending on their original designation, they differ in the quality of the material and making, as well as in the type of weave and treatment. Among Dalmatian examples of 17 th- and 18 th-century paintings on the canvas for mattresses, the one from Šibenik is the oldest. Compared to examples from abroad, it is also among the earliest ones. Out of forty paintings on striped canvas from the 16 th – 18 th century in England, Holland, Belgium, France and Italy, the most were authored by 17 th-century Flemish artists (twenty eight). Judging by the information and examples collected in the research, striped cloths for mattresses with twill pattern from abroad that were described in the paper are much finer than those from Dalmatia (have more threads per cm) and the fabrics are much wider, but they are mostly large-size paintings. With a little over a half of the cases, the warp was set in the length direction of the painting. From the photographs of the canvases of several foreign examples it is evident that the paintings were done on the face of the fabric where the herringbone pattern is more pronounced, as well as the blue stripes. Although this could lead to a conclusion that the choice of the fabric face was a conscious one, owing to its texture, the reasons need to be examined more closely. All Dalmatian paintings featured here were also painted on the fabric face – except the one from Brač that was composed of several assorted pieces of cloth – and with the warp facing opposite directions and the fabric face on opposing sides. Also, there can be observed a rather different relation toward the texture of the canvas – some artists leave it visible, others cover it in a thick painted layer. For now it appears that this research too leads to the conclusions of earlier studies of painting canvases – the reason for choosing striped mattress ticking as painting support may well have been its availability in a certain size, at a particular moment in history...|$|E

40|$|Background 2 ̆ 6 Rationale: In 1917, when {{occupational}} therapy was formally organized, {{there was no}} such area of occupation as ADL, daily living skills, or everyday living activities as we know them today. Occupational therapy practice was organized around scheduling daily events (habit training), work activities for the institution (cooking, clothing, gardening, <b>making</b> <b>mattresses</b> and brooms), reconstruction work (strengthening, work tolerance, curative workshop) and convalescent work (homebound work, sheltered workshops, homemade arts and crafts). Evaluating daily living skills began in 1935 with Margaret Sheldon’s work, who was a physical educator (Sheldon, 1935) but did not have significant influence on {{occupational therapy}} until the 1950 time period (Livingston, 1950); some 30 plus years after the formal beginning of occupational therapy Statement of Intent: The purpose is to illustrate the development of an area or category of occupation and how it became part of the organization of activities or tasks recognized as occupations in the practice of occupational therapy beginning in 1935 in education through development in physical therapy (Deaver 2 ̆ 6 Brown, 1946) to the present statement in the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework, Third Edition (2014). Argument: Occupation is an evolving area of study in and of itself. What is classified as occupation changes over time and will likely change in the future. This review of ADLs as a recognized area of occupation is designed {{as an example of how}} the study of occupation arises. Importance to OS. OS is the major area of study designed to explore and bring to our attention how and where occupation is occurring and may have implications for the practice of occupational therapy. Reviewing the rise of ADLs as a focus of study may provide guidelines for recognizing and documenting changes in the focus on occupation in the future. Conclusions: The study of occupation is a fluid and changing process influenced by what is viewed as important human activities at any given time and place. The study of ADLs illustrates the dynamics of changing views of occupation. Such changes will likely occur again. Can we learn from the past to illuminate the future? Key Words: Activities of daily living, physical demands of daily living, achievement record Learning/Discussion Objectives Document and trace the beginning of ADLs as an occupation or group of occupations Explore the interdisciplinary process of identifying and clarifying occupation Illustrate how the study of occupation can change from initial recognition to current statu...|$|R
