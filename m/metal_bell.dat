For many years the ancient wooden bell frame had been unsafe for ringing, although the tenor bell could be tolled.

During this work, one of the old bells (now the 5th) which was cracked was repaired by welding.|$|E

[...] The original 1906 bell molds were used to fabricate the replacement bells. [...] The replacement and original bells were produced by the California Bell Company, and are most typically marked 1769 & 1906, and include a designer's copyright notice.

60|$|We found Prince's in a {{state of}} unusual jollity, {{drinking}} the proceeds of their three puncheons, dancing and playing what Sá Leone calls 'warry.' [Footnote: A game with counters and holes in the ground or a board hollowed with cups. The same, called báo, or tables, is found in East Africa (Zanzibar) and Cameron traced it extending clear across the Dark Continent.] The bell and the psalm blended curiously with the song and the palm-clapping that announces negro terpsichore. Of course 'fetish' was present, {{in the shape of a}} woman peculiarly ornamented. Her very black face was dazzlingly chalked, lines by threes running from hair-roots to nose-bridge and meeting others drawn across the temples; the orbits of the eyes were whitened, and thence triple streaks stretched up the nose and across the cheeks. Hung to the extensive necklace of beads and other matters were tassels of dry white fibre; her forearms carried yellow bunches of similar material, and she held a broom of blackened bamboo and the <b>metal</b> <b>bell</b> familiar to Unyamwezi. Whilst the juniors danced and sang the elders drank and gambled.|$|E

50|$|The bell {{companies}} {{that dominated the}} economy of East Hampton by making <b>metal</b> <b>bells</b> continued to flourish until {{the era of the}} bells used for horses and buggies gave way to the era of automobilesThe Great Depression. Two firms continued to flourish into the 1950s by changing from making predominantly <b>metal</b> <b>bells</b> with bell toys being a minor part of their production in the 1800s, to primarily making bell toys. These two firms N. N. Hill Brass Co. and Gong Bell Mfg. Co., survived till the 1960s. The last remaining original operating bell shop, operated by Bevin Brothers, was razed by fire on May 27, 2012, but continues in full operation in a new East Hampton location; some other structures shut down while still structurally intact but remained unavailable for adaptive re-use, due to the presence of toxic substances at levels that resist remediation. Other mills, which were remediated or did not contain toxics, have been converted into offices, stores, and other small businesses.|$|R

5000|$|Bellfounding {{has been}} {{important}} {{throughout the history}} of ancient civilizations. Eastern bells, known for their tremendous size, were some of the earliest bells, cast many centuries before the European Iron Age. The earliest bells were made of pottery, developing later into the casting of <b>metal</b> <b>bells.</b> Archaeological evidence of bellfounding appears in Neolithic China. The earliest <b>metal</b> <b>bells,</b> with one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, are dated to about 2000 BCE. [...] Portable bells came to Britain with the spread of Celtic Christianity, and most of those still remaining share an association with Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Bells are traditionally cast in foundries for use in churches, clocks, and public buildings. A practitioner of the craft is called a bellfounder or bellmaker.|$|R

50|$|Most modern bass {{clarinets}} are straight-bodied, {{with a small}} upturned silver-colored <b>metal</b> <b>bell</b> and {{a curved}} metal neck. Early examples varied in shape, some having a doubled body making them look similar to bassoons. The bass clarinet is fairly heavy and is supported either with a neck strap or with an adjustable peg attached to its body. While Adolphe Sax imitated its upturned <b>metal</b> <b>bell</b> in his design of the larger saxophones, the two instruments are fundamentally different. Bass clarinet bodies are most often made of grenadilla (African Blackwood) or (more commonly for student-instruments) plastic resin, while saxophones are typically made entirely of metal. (All-metal bass clarinets do exist, but are rare.) More significantly, all clarinets including the bass have a bore that is basically the same diameter along {{the body of the}} instrument. This cylindrical bore differs from the saxophone's conical one and gives the clarinet its characteristic tone, causing it to overblow at the twelfth compared with the saxophone's octave.|$|E
