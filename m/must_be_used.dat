5000|$|The North Carolina {{governor}} signed H.B. 36 {{into law}} on 23 June 2011. All counties and municipalities {{were required to}} begin using E-Verify by 1 October 2011. The law also requires private businesses to use E-Verify for new employees, but exempts any [...] "seasonal temporary employee who is employed for 90 or fewer days during a 12-consecutive-month period". Employers with 500 or more employees <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>using</b> E-Verify by 1 October 2012; employers with 100 to 499 employees <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>using</b> E-Verify by 1 January 2013; and employers with 25 to 99 employees <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>using</b> E-Verify by 1 July 2013.

5|$|The {{environment}} <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to the player's advantage {{more often}} {{as the game}} progresses.

The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts, as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, such as those of 31P can be measured.|$|E
5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{is equipped}} with three Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18b/15Ub (VB210) 18-cylinder diesel engines, which are each connected to a 1,400kW, 440-volt DC Jeumont-Schneider generator. The combined electrical generation capability of each submarine is 4.2 megawatts. The Hedemora diesels were chosen because of modular construction, which made servicing easier; they could be installed three across in the available space, while other contenders required at least two banks of two; and they had turbochargers driven by the exhaust gas. Fifteen fuel tanks are located throughout the submarine: they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in specific sequences to preserve the submarine's buoyancy and trim.|$|E
5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> which match the specific ratio model, {{and the specific}} ratio will only be relevant to a limited range of depths. As the parameters {{move away from the}} base conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E

5|$|Of the two, lateral {{dynamics}} {{has proven}} to be the more complicated, requiring three-dimensional, multibody dynamic analysis with at least two generalized coordinates to analyze. At a minimum, two coupled, second-order differential equations are required to capture the principal motions. Exact solutions are not possible, and numerical methods <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> instead. Competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found in print and online. On the other hand, as shown in later sections, much longitudinal dynamic analysis can be accomplished simply with planar kinetics and just one coordinate.|$|E
5|$|On Windows 10, SmartGlass is {{succeeded by}} the Xbox App, which {{supports}} the local streaming of games from Xbox One to personal computers and tablets running Windows 10. An Xbox One controller <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used,</b> but Windows-compatible headsets and microphones {{can be used}} for voice chat. Games requiring Kinect are not supported, while Game DVR and online streaming are not available while using this functionality.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are further}} {{encouraged}} to customize their characters through nano-augmentations—cybernetic devices that grant characters superhuman powers. While the game contains eighteen different nano-augmentations, the player can install {{a maximum of}} nine, as each <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> on a certain part of the body: one in the arms, legs, eyes, and head; two underneath the skin; and three in the torso. This forces the player to choose carefully between the benefits offered by each augmentation. For example, the arm augmentation requires the player to decide between boosting their character's skill in hand-to-hand combat or his ability to lift heavy objects.|$|E

The Hebrew Ashuri script <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> and there are three main styles of lettering used: Beis Yosef – generally used by Ashkenazim; Arizal – generally used by Hasidim; Velish – used by Sefardim. The passages contain 3,188 letters, which take a sofer (scribe) between 10–15 hours to complete. The arm-tefillin has one large compartment, which contains all four biblical passages written upon a single strip of parchment. The head-tefillin has four separate compartments in each of which one scroll of parchment is placed.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rover and its {{bridging}} kits, Jetman {{has access to}} three other pieces of equipment, {{all of which can}} be carried on the bonnet of the rover, albeit one at a time. Bombs <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, which can only be accomplished when Jetman is flying above them. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E

5|$|In {{a further}} change of regulations, tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli now made three {{instead of two}} tyre compounds available for each Grand Prix. For the Australian Grand Prix, these were the super-soft, soft and medium compounds. With Pirelli providing every driver with two sets of tyres for the race (of which one <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used)</b> and an additional one for the third part of qualifying, drivers were able to choose ten additional sets of tyres out of the three compounds available. Notably, Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg made different choices, with Rosberg opting for an additional set of mediums instead of soft tyres. The two Manor drivers chose the most conservative way, taking on four sets each of the medium and soft compounds.|$|E
5|$|Newly formed astatine-211 is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{research}} in nuclear medicine. It <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2hours; this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay). Polonium X-rays emitted {{as a result of the}} electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92keV, enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients. Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} World WarII, the Ministry of Education {{has issued}} {{statements}} and regulations to promote the usage of both the Hinomaru and Kimigayo at schools under their jurisdiction. The first of these statements was released in 1950, stating that it was desirable, but not required, to use both symbols. This desire was later expanded to include both symbols on national holidays and during ceremonial events to encourage students on what national holidays are and to promote defense education. In a 1989 reform of the education guidelines, the LDP-controlled government first demanded that the flag <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in school ceremonies and that proper respect {{must be given to}} it and to Kimigayo. Punishments for school officials who did not follow this order were also enacted with the 1989 reforms.|$|E
