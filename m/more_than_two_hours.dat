5|$|A large {{squadron}} of ten frigates, including Aigle, was eventually {{able to make}} its way up the western passage on 9 August, enduring fire from batteries {{on both sides of}} the river for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> Aigle, in the centre, had her stern frame shattered when a shell fell through the deck and exploded, killing a marine and wounding four other members of the crew. She was the only ship to suffer any damage and her casualties amounted to almost half the total of two killed and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse {{to be cut}} away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals {{in an effort to}} engage the beached French ship. For <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|The parade lasted <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> {{during the}} {{afternoon}} and early evening following the inaugural ceremony. Parade participants included 15,000people, 240horses, a mariachi band, dozens of marching bands, the Virginia Military Institutecorps of cadets, and two drum and bugle corps: The Cadets and the Colts. Obama invited the marching band from Punahou School, his high school in Hawaii, to perform in the parade along with the marching unit of its Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps.|$|E

5|$|Saumarez {{immediately}} {{moved to}} engage the French ship and managed to isolate the frigate and subject it to a fierce barrage of fire for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> Captain François A. Dénian on Réunion responded, but aside from inflicting minor damage to Saumarez's rigging achieved little while his own vessel was heavily battered, suffering severe damage to rigging masts and hull and more than 80 and possibly as many as 120 casualties. British losses were confined to a single man wounded by an accident aboard Crescent. Eventually Dénian could not hold out any longer {{and was forced to}} surrender on the arrival of the 28-gun British frigate HMS Circe. Réunion was later repaired and commissioned into the Royal Navy, while Saumarez was knighted for his success.|$|E
5|$|Tecumseh, not {{yet ready}} to oppose the United States by force, was away {{recruiting}} allies when Harrison's army arrived. Tenskwatawa, a spiritual leader but not a military man, was in charge. Harrison camped near Prophetstown on November 6 and arranged to meet with Tenskwatawa the following day. Early the next morning, however, warriors from Prophetstown attacked Harrison's army. Although the outnumbered attackers took Harrison's army by surprise, Harrison and his men stood their ground for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> The Native Americans were ultimately repulsed when their ammunition ran low. After the battle, they abandoned Prophetstown and Harrison's men burned it to the ground, destroying the food supplies stored for the winter. The soldiers returned to their homes.|$|E
5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While {{on the small screen}} the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks and tears did not show up on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E
60|$|The weary dogs snapped and whimpered when kicked {{from their}} sleep. The going was slow, not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> miles an <b>hour,</b> {{and the animals}} took every {{opportunity}} to lie down in the wet snow.|$|R

5|$|Pathan gained {{selection}} for the 2007–08 tour of Australia, {{but did not}} play {{in the first two}} Tests with only two pacemen chosen. Zaheer and Singh were the first-choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant, who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test. With the Third Test held on the bouncy WACA Ground in Perth, Pathan replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh. He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively. His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day. After entering at the fall of the first wicket, he batted for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> and was the sixth man to fall. Pathan rediscovered his ability to swing the ball, taking 2/63 and 3/54, including both Australian openers in each innings, having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored. He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw. India won by 72 runs and Pathan was recognised with the man of the match award.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Valve {{created a}} formal process to allow purchasers to request full refunds on games they had {{purchased}} on Steam for any reason, with refunds guaranteed {{within the first}} two weeks as long as the player had not spent <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> in the game. Prior to June 2015, Valve had a no-refunds policy, but allowed them in certain circumstances, such as if third-party content had failed to work or improperly reports on certain features. For example, the Steam version of From Dust was originally stated to have a single, post-installation online DRM check with its publisher Ubisoft, but the released version of the game required a DRM check with Ubisoft's servers each time it was used. At the request of Ubisoft, Valve offered refunds to customers who bought the game while Ubisoft worked to release a patch that would remove the DRM check altogether. On The War Zs release, players found that the game was still in an alpha-build state and lacked many of the features advertised on its Steam store page. Though the developers Hammerpoint Interactive altered the description after launch to reflect {{the current state of the}} game software, Valve removed the title from Steam and offered refunds to those who had bought it. Valve also removed Earth: Year 2066 from the Early Access program and offered refunds after discovering that the game's developers had reused assets from other games and used developer tools to erase negative complaints about the title. Valve stated it would continue to work on improving the discovery process for users, taking principles they learned in providing transparency for matchmaking in Dota 2 to make the process better, and using that towards Steam storefront procedures to help refine their algorithms with user feedback.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of part-time versus full-time occlusion for treatment of amblyopia in children aged 7 - 12 years. Materials and Methods: Prospective interventional case series. One hundred children between 7 - 12 years of age with anisometropic (57), strabismic (25) and mixed (18) unilateral amblyopia were randomized (simple randomization) into four groups (25 each) to receive <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> four hours, six hours or full-time occlusion therapy. Children were regularly followed up at six-weekly intervals {{for a minimum of}} three visits. Statistical Analysis: Intragroup visual improvement was analyzed using paired t-test while intergroup comparisons were done using ANOVA and unpaired t-test. Results: All four groups showed significant visual improvement after 18 weeks of occlusion therapy (P &# 60; 0. 001). Seventy-three (73 &#x 0025;) of the total 100 eyes responded to amblyopia therapy with 11 eyes (44 &#x 0025;), 17 eyes (68 &#x 0025;), 22 eyes (88 &#x 0025;) and 23 eyes (92 &#x 0025;) being amblyopia responders in the four groups respectively, with the least number of responders in the <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> group. In mild to moderate amblyopia (vision 20 / 30 to 20 / 80), {{there was no significant difference}} in visual outcome among the four groups (P = 0. 083). However, in severe amblyopia (vision 20 / 100 or worse), six hours (P = 0. 048) and full-time occlusion (P = 0. 027) treatment were significantly <b>more</b> effective <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> occlusion. Conclusion: All grades of part-time occlusion are comparable to full-time occlusion in effectiveness of treatment for mild to moderate amblyopia in children between 7 - 12 years of age unlike in severe amblyopia, where six hours and full-time occlusion were <b>more</b> effective <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> occlusion therapy...|$|R

I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined--I am quite certain I did not, that day--but, I thought, would she be wholly prepared?
