Meanwhile, Ted continues {{to have a good time}} at the party and begins reciting a poem to everyone there, in the original Italian. As he does so, Ted is amazed no one interrupts him and realizes <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> gone too far, and wishes someone would stop him.

[...] More recently, however, in the documentary Graffiti Wars, Blek took a different tone, stating, [...] "When I see Banksy making a man with a child or Banksy making rats, of course I see immediately where he takes the idea. I do feel angry. When you're an artist you use your own techniques. It's difficult to find a technique and style in art so when you have a style and you see someone else is taking it and reproducing it, you don't like that.

5000|$|Barney and Jerry are {{eventually}} arrested after Jerry throws up on a police car. As they sit handcuffed on the curb, Jerry reveals {{that he was}} in fact never drunk, having only pretended to take the shots, while the various pranks really didn’t happen (due to Barney's drunkenness, he couldn’t tell Jerry was pretending, and it was Barney who had thrown up.) Jerry wanted to hang out with Barney {{while at the same time}} showing him he can't keep partying forever. However, because Jerry is also an aspiring magician, like Barney, they manage to free themselves from the handcuffs, and head back to Jerry’s house (getting a ride with one of Jerry's driving students) so that he can make it on time for the fishing trip. On the ride back, Barney asks Jerry how he managed to settle down and live a [...] "normal" [...] life, and confides that someday he too wishes to settle down. Jerry tells him he won’t reveal his secret, but says he must first meet the right girl. Barney says that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> already met the right girl.|$|E
5000|$|In The Jungle Book 2, he is {{voiced by}} Bob Joles and reappears as the mature Bagheera. He tries {{to reason with}} a {{depressed}} Baloo that Mowgli's place is in the Man Village, and that the jungle is not safe for him because Shere Khan has returned to get revenge on Mowgli for humiliating him, but Baloo is certain that with their help, Mowgli can handle the tiger a second time, and bypasses Bagheera. Frustrated, he calls upon Colonel Hathi and his troops to block Baloo's path. When the villagers try to find Mowgli, he suspects that Baloo has brought him back; he confronts Baloo with the news and expresses his thoughts that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> seen him. Baloo hides Mowgli from Bagheera and convinces Bagheera {{that he is not}} with him, although Bagheera does not entirely believe it. He appears again later on, when Mowgli's younger adoptive brother Ranjan and Baloo are hurrying to save Mowgli from Shere Khan, and joins them. When they reach the temple built on a lava lake, Bagheera waits outside with Ranjan and warns Baloo to be careful before he goes inside to help Mowgli. After Shere Khan is trapped, Mowgli introduces Bagheera to Shanti, the girl who is Mowgli's best friend at the village. Near the end of the film, Ranjan is shown playing with Bagheera's tail. At first Bagheera is scared, but he later enjoys playing with him while Mowgli, Shanti, and Baloo sing the reprise of [...] "The Bare Necessities".|$|E

5000|$|On {{his first}} {{appearance}} of the 2015/2016 National Hunt season Nichols Canyon was one of five horses to contest the Grade I Morgiana Hurdle over two miles at Punchestown on 15 November. The 1/6 favourite was the undefeated Champion Hurdler Faugheen, who, as the Mullins' stable's star hurdler was ridden by Ruby Walsh. Nichols Canyon, the 7/1 second choice in the betting, was ridden by the trainer's nephew David Mullins and faced another three rivals with Wicklow Brave (County Hurdle)— also trained by Mullins, Plinth (Istabraq Hurdle) and Thomas Edison (Galway Hurdle). Nichols Canyon was left to set the pace upfront and with a round of jumping described as [...] "brilliant" [...] by Racing Post he managed to maintain the lead {{for the rest of}} the race. He only looked to be headed for a brief moment on the turn for home but he found plenty and again increased the lead before the last hurdle, managing to hold off the late charges on the run-in of his stablemate and short odds-on favourite Faugheen by half a length at the finish line, with Wicklow Brave a length and a quarter back in third. Immediately after the race Mullins was puzzled by the result declaring: [...] "That worked out completely different from the way they worked on Tuesday. Faugheen left Nichols for dead... They went a good gallop and Nichols did it the hard way out in front, he jumped fantastic. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> improved more... He looks a Champion Hurdle horse now... I'm not making any excuses for Faugheen".|$|E
5000|$|The film {{received}} moderate {{reviews from}} critic. Deccan Chronicle wrote [...] "The director’s aim is good, {{but the way}} the story has been depicted on screen is not convincing. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> targeted only college students and youth and not kept family audiences in mind. That’s why unlike his earlier films, ‘Oka Criminal Prema Katha’ fails to make an impact. The publicity posters and his earlier films may bring in college youth, but this film is definitely not for all." [...] Oneindia Entertainment gave a review stating [...] "Oka Criminal Prema Katha does not offer any direct message to the audience. Indirectly, the movie shows that the parents, who are the first role models to their children, {{are responsible for the}} kind of behavior the youth have. Though the director has tried out something different, but he has failed to give a convincing picture on screen." [...] 123telugu.com gave a review stating [...] "On the whole, Oka Criminal Prema Katha sends out the intended message very loud and clear. The way today’s women and youth face problems in the society has been showcased nicely. But the way it has been narrated in a non commercial format, and with a bit of harsh reality will not be liked by one and all" [...] and rated the film 2.5/5. IndiaGlitz gave a review stating [...] "Technically, it’s quite mediocre but the narration manages to make a mark. At a time when even supposedly pro-women films parade profanity and obscenity under the pretext of exposing the vulgarity and mean-mindedness of lecherous men, this film is praiseworthy in that bold scenes have a meaningful presence. A film that works for its honesty and creative story-telling" [...] and rated the film 2/5.|$|E
