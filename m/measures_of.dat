For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E

When there are only two distributions involved this <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> affinity is related to a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> distance between the distributions. In this article the multivariate measure is characterized by a set of four axioms.
