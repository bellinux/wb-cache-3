40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a study of}} the 6. 3 -mile stretch of northbound I- 5 site that is highlighted with bold dashed line in Figure 1. The study began with detailed empirical analyses of traffic on the site during morning rush periods. The data were collected both from the sites ’ loop detectors and from videos; and analyses were performed for numerous <b>morning</b> <b>s</b> in 2006 through 2008. Findings show that serial bottlenecks on the site interact and exert significant influence on traffic delays and queuing; that one particular bottleneck formed by a horizontal curvature in the freeway alignment {{plays a key role in}} this; and that theses damaging influences occurred primarily along the freeway stretch demarcated with a lightly-drawn box in Figure 1. An on-ramp metering logic was developed in light of these observations. Field tests of this logic were conducted over multiple morning rush periods in 2009. Findings show that ramp metering can affect traffic flow through the sites ’ serial bottlenecks in favorable ways that increase output flows and thereby reduce the delays collectively incurred by commuters on the freeway site and its on-ramps. 17.

See if you can adapt this simple but smart practice developed over the last fifteen months by the Office of Information and Communication section of Fiji s ministry of agriculture. For more than a year, four members of staff writers and designers have come into work an hour early, at 7 am, spending their first 60 minutes reading the newspapers and making one. First they cull stories from all four national morning papers published in their nation s capital. On a typical day (the picture shows an issue from mid-February) there were eight such stories, including support from northern province farmers for reorganising the sugar board; a probe by US health authorities into alleged liver failure caused by consuming kava (a major Fijian export); reports of misused agricultural project funds; a failure in fertiliser quality tests, plus listings of that evening s rural radio programmes in Fijian and in Hindi. They write up summaries of these stories, adding some proverbs, quotations and photos. Then, using their desk-top publishing set up, they produce and print a newssheet of 2 or 4 pages, delivering it at 8 am to all departments in headquarters, and slipping into the <b>morning</b> <b>s</b> internal post to out-stations and extension staff.

40|$|The {{exploitation}} of resources by closely related species with similar niches may be mediated by differences in activity patterns, which may vary in nycthemeral scale and seasonal scale. Piranhas Serrasalmus gibbus and Serrasalmus rhombeus are Neotropical predators that occur sympatrically in many environments of the Amazon basin. To evaluate the strategies adopted by these two species in a restricted environment (a reservoir), nycthemeral and seasonal samples were made, identifying {{the composition of the}} diet and their activity patterns. A total of 402 specimens were collected: 341 S. gibbus and 61 S. rhombeus. Both species fed themselves primarily on fish, with some seasonal variation being found in S. gibbus during the flood season, when plant material was consumed. There was considerable temporal overlap in the foraging behavior of the two species, although S. rhombeus presented a bimodal pattern of abundance over the 24 -hour cycle. S. rhombeus was more active during the nighttime, between dusk and early <b>morning,</b> whereas <b>S.</b> gibbus was active throughout the nycthemeral cycle. These findings indicate low levels of competition between the two species, which allowed for a considerable overlap in nighttime foraging, following distinct nycthemeral patterns of foraging activity and allowing their coexistence...|$|R

Objective: This study compared the efficacy and safety of a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid with oral prednisolone in patients with worsening of their asthma after medication withdrawal. Methods: Patients tapered off their inhaled corticosteroids until they reached predefined criteria of "worsening asthma". Randomized patients (n= 130) were treated double blind with either ciclesonide 800 ?g twice daily (starting with 800 ?g hourly for 3 h after randomization) or prednisolone 40 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Spirometry, daily asthma symptoms, morning and evening peak expiratory flow and blood parameters were assessed in all, methacholine challenge and inflammatory measures were determined in induced sputum in a subset of patients.

It was hypothesized that significant treatment effects would already be present within 3 months after the initiation of treatment across a range of clinical outcomes, irrespective of COPD severity. Methods: Post hoc analysis of 3 -month post-randomization outcomes, including exacerbation rates, dropouts, symptoms, reliever use, and lung function, from three studies with similar inclusion criteria of moderate-to-very-severe COPD. Patients (n= 1, 571) were treated with budesonide/formoterol (B/F) 320 / 9 mu g or placebo, twice daily; in one study, tiotropium 18 mu g once daily was also given. Results: Over the first 3 months of treatment, fewer patients randomized to B/F experienced exacerbations versus the placebo group (111 and 196 patients with >= 1 exacerbation, respectively). This was true in each COPD severity group. Compared with placebo, B/F treatment led to significantly lower 3 -month exacerbation rates in the moderate and severe COPD severity groups (46 % and 57 % reduction, respectively), with a nonsignificant reduction (29 %) in very severe COPD. Fewer dropouts occurred among patients treated with B/F versus placebo, this effect being greater with increasing COPD severity.

40|$|Sixty artists {{explore the}} nocturnal. Curated by Tom Hammick. The evening hour too {{gives us the}} {{irresponsibility}} which darkness and lamplight bestow. We are no longer quite ourselves. – Virginia Woolf, Street Haunting: A London Adventure, 1930 Towards Night is an exhibition exploring the nocturnal through paintings, prints and drawings by over sixty artists. Drawing on the nineteenth century European Romantic tradition, the show surveys contemporary and historical connections to wonderment and dystopia at dusk, twilight, night and dawn. Towards Night juxtaposes key paintings and prints by Constable, Friedrich, Munch, Nolde, Palmer and Turner, {{some of the best}} known visionaries of the Romantic tradition with contemporary artists who work with the transformative aspects of nightfall to convey emotional responses of awe, anxiety and solitude, love and loss, revelry, insomnia, and journey’s end. The exhibition opens with direct and positive responses to the natural world; Marc Chagall’s exotic dreamlike evening in The Poet Reclining (1915) sits close to eighteenth century Indian miniatures depicting brightly painted figures offset against darkening monsoon clouds, and William Crozier’s Balcony at Night, Antibes (2007), of a plant, blue and iridescent against the cool night sky. As the exhibition progresses, the dystopias become darker and more disturbing, and the connections between artists and works intensify: Emma Stibbon’s Rome Aqueduct (2011) takes on a heightened sense of pathos alongside Caspar David Friedrich’s Winter Landscape (1811); Peter Doig’s cinematic Echo Lake (1998) conjures up an increased sense of contemporary angst; and Prunella Clough’s False Flower (1993), a magical tree defying brutalism by growing out of concrete, becomes more miraculous near Night Shift (2015) Nick Carrick’s tomblike high rise. Tom Hammick’s Violetta Alone (2015) and Michael Craig Martin’s Ash Tray (2015), reinforce hedonistic aspects of night-time revelry alongside Four AM, Betsy Dadd’s young woman drinking {{in the early hours of}} the <b>morning</b> and L. <b>S.</b> Lowry’s drunken people in a pub in The Crowd (1922). In the final room, a cluster of works explores dreams and insomnia, from Louise Bourgeois’ Spirals (2010) to Munch’s lovers embracing in The Kiss (1902). Tom Hammick, curator of the show said “This exhibition has grown way beyond its original conception, to become a magnificent survey of painting and printmaking from over two hundred years based around the central tenet of night. The exhibition is a kind of painterly response to the way figurative artists use their artistic heroes as starting points for their own work, both compositionally and emotionally. ” Artists featured in Towards Night: Christiane Baumgarter, Michael Craig-Martin, Julian Opie, Will Gill, Merlin James, Howard Hodgkin, WillIam Scott, Patrick Caulfield, George Shaw, Stephen Chambers, Basil Beattie, Betsy Dadd, Christopher Le Brun, L.
