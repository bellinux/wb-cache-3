50|$|On {{the first}} floor level which is built inside the roof space of the shed are timber framed <b>malt</b> <b>storage</b> bins lined with pine boards on a malthoid paper backing. A central {{corridor}} running north east to south west {{along the length of}} the shed allows access to the storage bins. On this level in the centre of the north west elevation is a dormered loading bay which opens via double timber doors onto the railway siding.|$|E
5000|$|In 1906 major {{additions}} were commenced. In {{addition to}} the two malthouses, there {{was already on the}} site a brewery tower (erected [...] ) and residential accommodation. The additions costing £6,999 were designed and supervised by Toowoomba architect Harry Marks of James Marks and Son. They comprised the erection of a new malthouse and kilns which were linked to the 1899 malthouse and the conversion of the existing brewery tower to a high water storage reservoir. The new malthouse included steeping tanks, a large polished cement germinating floor, two kilns, malt dressing rooms, and a number of pine storage bins. Elevators and a conveyor belt, which traversed the length of the building, transported the grain in its various stages. The <b>malt</b> <b>storage</b> chamber was fitted with 38 Marks patented reversible casement windows and a number of Marks's roof ventilators. Special kiln top ventilators were also designed by Marks, who was described as being gifted with inventive genius. The new complex, described as the biggest in the Commonwealth, was opened on 1 June 1907. The contractor was Montague Ivory with the plastering (including the cement germinating floor) by WJ Waldron, ironwork by the Toowoomba Foundry, and plumbing by Partridge and Co.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe fate of dinitroaniline {{herbicides}} (pendimethalin and trifluralin), organophosphous insecticides (fenitrothion and malathion), and pyrimidine (nuarimol) and triazole (myclobutanil and propiconazole) fungicides from barley to malt has been assessed. Several samples {{for residue analysis}} were taken after each stage of malting (steeping, germination, and kilning). Analyses of pesticide residues were carried out by GC/ITMS in SIM mode. Pesticides decline along the process although in different proportions. The carryover of residues after steeping was 45 - 85 %. A good correlation (r> 0. 92) was observed between percentages removed after steeping and the POW values of pesticides. The amount remaining after malting ranged from 13 to 51 % for fenitrothion and nuarimol, respectively. Steeping {{was the most important}} stage on the removal of pesticide residues (52 %) followed by germination (25 %), and kilning (drying and curing, 23 %). During <b>malt</b> <b>storage</b> (3 months) the fall in pesticide residues was not significant. Applying the standard first-order kinetics equation (r> 0. 95), the half-lives obtained for the pesticides during <b>malt</b> <b>storage</b> varied from 244 to 1, 533 days for myclobutanil and nuarimol, respectively...|$|E
5000|$|The Nylex Clock is {{an iconic}} neon sign sitting atop <b>malting</b> <b>storage</b> silos in the suburb of Cremorne, Victoria, Australia. It is located {{adjacent}} to the northern bank of the Yarra River and the Monash Freeway and displays the time and temperature alternately. The text also alternates displaying the words 'Nylex Plastics' that changes to 'Nylex Every Time!'. It is visible from many parts of Melbourne, particularly the Melbourne Cricket Ground. This linkage is {{referred to in the}} song [...] "Leaps and Bounds" [...] by musician Paul Kelly.|$|R

50|$|ABB Grain was Australia's largest agribusiness. Founded in 1939, {{the company}} was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange until its {{takeover}} by Viterra in 2009. For most of its history, the company focused solely on grain accumulation and marketing, but it eventually expanded its focus to other activities, such as grain receival and <b>storage,</b> <b>malting</b> and fertilisers. ABB bought grain from all growing regions in Australia and traded in all grain commodities.|$|R
40|$|Nitrogenous {{compounds}} {{are considered}} {{very important in}} beer playing {{a key role in}} determining the quality and stability of the finished product. They include amino acids, peptides, polypeptides, proteins, nucleic acids and their degradation products. These compounds affect fl avor, foam stability, haze formation, color, yeast nutrition and biological stability. The nitrogenous compounds in beer are derived mainly from barley malt and its adjuncts. Moreover the brewing process may have an important role in determining complex profile of nitrogenous compounds present in the fi nal beer. The content of nitrogen compounds in barley depends on variety and on environmental condition in cultivation. During <b>malting</b> the <b>storage</b> proteins are degraded to amino acids and other peptides. These amino acids are important in wort to promote a good fermentation and the yeast budding. During fermentation amino acids are used in different ways by yeasts and may have many effects on the final quality of beer: in particular the amino nitrogen content infl uences the flavor profi le of beer. The amino acids present in final beer could influence negatively the stability of product promoting haze formation. Nitrogen compounds may also play an important role influencing the foam quality and stability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to evaluate the influence of flakes from biologically activated hull-less barley grain and malt extract on quality of yoghurt during its storage. The results showed that the concentration of added <b>malt</b> extract and <b>storage</b> time influenced the changes of pH and lactic acid in yoghurt samples. Sensory properties – aroma, taste, consistency and appearance – of yoghurt enriched with flakes from biologically activated hull-less barley grain and malt extract changed significantly (p< 0. 05) during storage. Yoghurt with increased proportion of malt extract had sweeter taste and more flowing consistency. Sensory properties (taste, aroma, consistency and appearance) of yoghurt samples enriched with 5 % flakes from biologically activated hull-less barley grain (YFBG 5 %) and 5 % flakes from biologically activated hull-less barley grain and 2 % malt extract (YFBG 5 % ME 2 %) did not change significantly during one week of <b>storage.</b> Keywords—Barley flakes, <b>malt</b> extract, yoghurt, sensory analysis.

50|$|Upon Keller's {{death in}} 1865, all of Hamm's savings, {{homestead}} and stake were lost. Losing his beer garden, Hamm {{moved his family}} to the brewery. Through constant expansion and improvements, the brewery soon became {{the largest in the}} state. The most notable expansion was {{the state of the art}} Brew House, which was built in 1893. In 1897 the wash house and part of the bottling plant were built, both of which still stand. The brewery was in an almost constant state of expansion from 1933 until 1948. It added a new power house, bottling facilities, <b>malt</b> house, grain <b>storage,</b> stock houses, shipping docks, office space, garages, and more. The brewery shut its doors in 1997 under the ownership of the Stroh Brewing Company. The property was sold to a real estate investor who in turn sold the southern half (the more historic portion of the brewery) to the City of St. Paul, including the original Brew House. The city, however, left these buildings to decay and crumble. The northern portion of the brewery today is mostly inhabited by various businesses including a trapeze school. As of 2013 businesses have started to return to the historical southern portion of the brewery. The keg and wash house are currently home to the Flat Earth Brewing Company. Stock house number three is home to Urban Organics, and the carpenter shop houses the 11 Wells Distillery.|$|R
