Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main <b>mast</b> <b>cap</b> and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main <b>mast</b> <b>cap</b> which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the night}} of 7 December 1942, in a solemn ceremony, {{the ashes of the}} Japanese war dead encased in white wooden boxes were brought {{to the foot of the}} long flight of steps leading to Syonan Chureito and ceremoniously carried up the torch-lit steps for interment inside a small shrine located at the top. The guest of honour was General Homma Masaharu of Philippines fame. The Japanese {{memorial}} was a 12 metres tall wooden <b>mast</b> <b>capped</b> with a brass cone. The words [...] "chu rei to" [...] was inscribed on its side which meant [...] "the sacrifice made by the fallen soldiers". A plain, stout, wooden fence surrounded the memorial. The Allies' memorial was unveiled on the same day by one of the POW camp commanders with a speech thanking the Japanese Army. Military and Japanese officials would regularly worship the Japanese Emperor and the deified spirits of their fallen comrades at Syonan Chureito and Syonan Jinja.|$|R

However, more conventional allergy testing such as skin-prick tests can provide rapid results, are easy to conduct and inexpensive, though they may indicate false-positive or false-negative results. Current {{research has shown that}} there is an association between allergic fungal sinusitis and MHC II alleles, suggesting a genetic component to this chronic inflammatory respiratory tract disorder. Treatment for allergic fungal sinusitis includes post-operative corticosteroid and aggressive anti-allergic inflammatory regimen including itraconazole or amphotericin B, while treatment for bronchopulmonary mycosis usually does not include surgery.|$|R
