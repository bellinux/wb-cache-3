5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms <b>move</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E

5|$|When the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union began on 22 June, the corps was equipped with 1,070 tanks, including 59 flamethrower tanks and 10 BT-2 tanks, and at least 493 BT-7s. On 26 June, it was ordered to <b>move</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 16th Army to the Orsha and Smolensk area. After reaching Smolensk, it was subordinated to the 20th Army on 4 July for a counterattack to recapture Senno and Lepel {{in conjunction with the}} 7th Mechanised Corps. On 6 July the corps had 974 tanks, including: 7 KV tanks, 10 T-34 tanks, 595 BT tanks, 242 T-26 tanks, 61 flamethrower tanks, and 59 T-37/38 amphibious tanks. The corps was to advance , reaching Lepel through Senno.|$|E
5|$|In East Africa, {{the blue}} {{wildebeest}} {{is the most}} abundant big game species; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds, but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over {{a short period of}} time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to <b>move</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> herd, a fact necessary for their survival. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large carnivores, especially the spotted hyena. Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators. They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons. Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle. Some illegal hunting goes on but the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are in national parks or on private land. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both as least-concern species.|$|E

25|$|Effigies of both {{predators and}} conspecifics {{have been used}} with success to {{disperse}} gulls and vultures.

25|$|The use of {{photography}} {{as a way}} of reporting news did not become widespread until the advent of smaller, more portable cameras that used an enlargeable film negative to record images.

25|$|If the shoal {{becomes more}} tightly organised, {{with the fish}} {{synchronising}} their swimming so they all move {{at the same speed}} and in the same direction, then the fish may be said to be schooling.

25|$|In this illustration, a solid {{copper bar}} {{conductor}} on a rotating armature is just passing under {{the tip of}} the pole piece N of the field magnet. Note the uneven distribution of the lines of force across the copper bar. The magnetic field is more concentrated and thus stronger on the left edge of the copper bar (a,b) while the field is weaker on the right edge (c,d). Since the two edges of the bar <b>move</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same velocity, this difference in field strength across the bar creates whorls or current eddies within the copper bar.|$|E
25|$|Season 2007 {{was a poor}} one for Melbourne. After {{losing their}} first nine games through a {{combination}} of injury and poor form, they finally broke through with wins against Adelaide and Collingwood. But, following a loss to Richmond the next week, Daniher resigned from the club, and Mark Riley was appointed as caretaker coach. The resignation of Daniher caused significant tension at the club. It was an unpopular <b>move</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> leadership group, and captain David Neitz expressed his dissatisfaction over the decision. Winning three of their remaining nine games, Melbourne avoided the wooden spoon and finished 14th.|$|E

25|$|After {{a fire in}} 1858 {{destroyed}} around 50 {{buildings in}} High Street and Shortland Street, the commercial district began to shift towards Queen Street instead, and the first brick and plaster buildings of the 1860s started to cement this <b>move,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Bank of New Zealand building (only the façade extant today) {{being one of the}} first examples. Fires however still continued to plague the new town, with one in 1873 wiping out another 54 buildings in the Queen Street area between Wellesley Street West and Grey Street (today Greys Avenue). The fires, amongst other things, led to the establishment of the Auckland Volunteer Fire Service.|$|E
25|$|The DI and VFX for Guzaarish {{was done}} by Prime Focus, a global Visual Entertainment Services group, who had {{previously}} collaborated with Sanjay Leela Bhansali on many films including 'Black' and 'Saawariya'.The look of the film was designed to <b>move</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> narrative. The first scene shows Sophia D'Souza waking up {{and taking care of}} Ethan, for which the shafts of light have been enhanced and colors desaturated but the skin tones maintained. From the skies, to the wall colouring, every part of the movie has been enhanced in some way. The VFX team was throughout in the sets right from when the film was being shot.|$|E
25|$|In Elliott's model, {{market prices}} {{alternate}} between an impulsive, or motive phase, and a corrective phase on all time scales of trend, as the illustration shows. Impulses are always subdivided into {{a set of}} 5 lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3. Corrective waves subdivide into 3 smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. In a bear market the dominant trend is downward, so the pattern is reversed—five waves down and three up. Motive waves always <b>move</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> trend, while corrective waves move against it.|$|E

25|$|When General Robert E. Lee {{discovered}} that his route to Danville was blocked at Jetersville, {{he knew his}} army had to make another night march to Farmville. Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and Major General Philip Sheridan were convinced that Lee's army would not remain at Amelia Court House another night, but Army of the Potomac commander Major General George Meade thought that they would. Meade ordered the II Corps, V Corps and VI Corps to move toward Amelia Court House at 6:00a.m. and Grant did not order him to do otherwise, only to move swiftly. Sheridan did not <b>move</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> infantry but sent his cavalry to follow a road parallel and {{to the south of}} Lee's line of march to try to intercept the Confederates.|$|E
25|$|The inn {{was forced}} to <b>move</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{expansion}} of U.S. Route 202. U.S. 202 is a major north-south highway that passes through the town from southwest to northeast. Its construction as a modern expressway would have caused {{the destruction of the}} King of Prussia Inn; however, historic preservationists managed to prevail upon the state of Pennsylvania to avoid this important structure by building north and southbound lanes on either side of it. For more than a quarter century the inn was marooned on a median island, with motor traffic whizzing past on both sides. It was sealed up for years, surrounded by a high fence. The inn was successfully relocated in 2000 and opened to the public in October 2002.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} September, Alphin {{was signed}} onto the {{practice}} squad of the Baltimore CFL Colts, now renamed the Baltimore Stallions. The Baltimore Stallions signed Alphin to provide more depth at receiver following injuries to Reggie Perry and Robert Clark. He played in four regular season games with the Stallions, recording nine catches for 129 yards and two touchdowns. In his third Grey Cup appearance, Alphin became a Grey Cup champion when the Stallions defeated the Stampeders 37–20 in the 83rd Grey Cup. The Baltimore Stallions franchise was relocated to Montreal to become the Montreal Alouettes in 1996 after the CFL withdrew from the United States.
