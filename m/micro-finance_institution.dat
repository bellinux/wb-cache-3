40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 <b>Micro-finance</b> <b>institutions</b> {{are leading}} a {{revolution}} in the financial sector, particularly in banking. This provides a renewed focus on the way financial credit is provided to the marginalised society of the developing countries. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, small and medium enterprises constitute almost 80 % of the entrepreneurial population. There is therefore, considerable urgency to advance the performance and competitiveness of these small and medium enterprises. The aim {{of this study is to}} establish the effect of <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions,</b> on the performance of small and medium enterprises in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Literature reviewed for this study provided insights into the effects of <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions</b> on the performance of small and medium enterprises that accessed micro-loans. This study comprises of 77 small and medium entrepreneurs that participated in the empirical research. The performance of small and medium enterprises was assessed through the use of a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of statements on socio-demographics, the functioning of <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions</b> and the performance of small and medium enterprises. The study revealed that the largest group of respondents were male entrepreneurs, married, in the age group category of 30 to 50 years, have a household size of 1 to 5 people and have 1 to 5 years of experience in business. Entrepreneurs mostly utilized financial services such as saving accounts, money transfers and training and technology. Furthermore consulting services in the areas of leadership finance and operations were mainly received from <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions.</b> The study revealed that <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions</b> principally play the role of facilitator of growth, tool for social change, provider of banking systems and instrument for empowerment to SMEs. The two sources of financing utilized mostly by small and medium enterprises were loans from <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions</b> and from commercial banks. The borrowed finance was used principally to start a new business, expand an existing business and for working capital. The amounts of money borrowed from micro- loans were as follow: 5 000, 00 (US $) or less, between 6 000 and 10 000, 00 (US $) and 11 000, 00 to 15 000, 00 (US $) The interest rates paid were from 11 % to 20 %, 21 % to 30 % and 51 % and above. The collateral provided was in the form of physical assets such as a car or a house. The results of the mean score factor indicated that on average, responses for questions 14 to 19 were above 2. 5 on the scale of 1 to 4. The mean score above 2. 5 was the indication that respondents agreed to a larger extend to these statements. This leads to the conclusion that overall, the effect of <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions</b> on the performance small and medium enterprises in the Democratic Republic of Congo was positive, as proved by the mean score factor.

The result analysis showed that before the Law of Microfinance Institutions was issued, there were 3 groups of BMT, namely: BMT with the Cooperative legal entity and being supervised by the State Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs; BMT that were formed under the foundations legal entity; and BMT that were formed under Non Governmental Organisation. However, after Act No. 1 of 2013 had been issued, Microfinance Institutions should only have legal status, either as a cooperative or an incorporated company (PT). In addition, the supervision should be conducted by the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK) coordinated with both the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, and the Ministry of Home Affairs. Nevertheless, the competence of supervision has still not been clearly regulated in the Microfinance Institutions Act, because the new law might effectively run two years after being enacted while the implemention is also still not regulated yet. Thus, it should be recommended to make clear implementation rules in the legal status of Microfinance Institutions, especially for those not have legal entities as well as those should transform.

Overall, low repurchasing rates even after payouts suggest that current rainfall index insurance products are likely to continue struggling in their current form. ...|$|E

It?s right to be cautious about taking a loan, and to look carefully at the conditions for borrowing, such as interest rates, payment schedules and penalties for non payment. But taking a loan can still be a good decision, if you have a good investment plan for the money. We hear next from Wambi Michael in Uganda. He recently met a wine producer, who took a loan, used it to build her business, and has recently been recognised with an award. Here?s his report. IN:	?Lack of access to credit is? OUT:	?You are welcome. ? DUR?N:	 2 ? 47 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Thereza Namusisi, founder of the Thereza wine company in Uganda. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Wambi	Lack of access to credit is often a major problem for women in Uganda. Even where it is available many women don?t have information about how to access it. Some women have feared to seek credit from <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions</b> for fear of being debtors. I?m here in Njeru to meet Thereza Namusisi, a rural Ugandan woman who has taken credit from <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions</b> and has excelled. Thereza how did you learn about <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions?</b> Namusisi	Uganda Gatsby Trust is an organisation which started from the university. But later on they saw that only helping the university students is not enough. So they came down to the grassroots to help women who have small projects. And that?s how I came to learn about it. Wambi	Have you ever sought a loan from a commercial bank? Namusisi	No. I feared it just because of the problems I see other people facing. Wambi	And what did you use the credit for? Namusisi	I used it for increasing on my wine productivity. So I increased on the quantity of my wine, and it will make a better quality. Wambi	Why are many women in Uganda not accessing credit from <b>micro-finance</b> <b>institutions,</b> even when they are available in the country? Namusisi	Women are fearing micro-finance from those unfriendly institutions. Just because once you fail or once you get a problem, they come and confiscate your things, they take plots of land, they want to take houses of people. So it scares people, especially women. Wambi	Association of <b>Micro-Finance</b> <b>Institutions</b> and Citibank gave you an award for having got credit, used it well, paid it back. How did you manage to pay back the loan and still improve on your business? Namusisi	When I got the loan I utilised it fully. I got a profit. But don?t look at money as money. Just try to get the little money you get and inject it back in your project, that?s how you can only increase your productivity. That?s how you can sustain your project and enlarge your enterprise. That?s the only thing I did myself. Wambi	What could be done to ensure that women access more friendly credit? Namusisi	If possible they would start with a grant. We can start with something small and grow bigger. By the time you see that you are growing bigger, that?s when a woman should access a loan from the micro-financers, other than starting with a loan from the grassroots. Wambi	Thank {{you very much for your}} time. Namusisi	You are welcome. End track. A wine-maker from Uganda explains why taking a loan was the right decision for her business...|$|R
