40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} issue of lack of penetration (LOP) in Friction Stir Welding and the feasibility of using non-destructive tests to detect. Friction Stir Welding {{takes place in the}} solid phase below the melting point of the materials to be joined. It thus gives the ability to join materials which are difficult to fusion weld, for example 2000 and 7000 aluminium alloys. This process though can result in a lack of penetration, due to an incomplete penetration of the DXZ. This is frequently referred to as a "kissing bond", which requires <b>micro</b> <b>examination</b> to detect. The presentation then discusses the surface crack tension tests. It then reviews the simulated service test and results.

The images are captured by a CCD camera from a laboratory microscope slide and store in computer using the. TIF format. The new system is implemented by fuzzifying image histopathological data. These are shape and texture descriptors calculated from the spectral analysis and greyscale statistical co-occurrence matrix analysis of the microscopic cell images, using the fuzzy neural network backpropagation classifier to differentiate the images.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{dehydration}} of 5 -nitrouracil (5 NU) have resulted in it being classified as a ‘‘channel hydrate’’ in which dehydration proceeds principally by the exit of the water molecules along channels in the structure. We have re-examined this proposal and found that in fact there are no continuous channels in the 5 NU structure that would contribute to such a mechanism. Product water molecules would be immediately trapped in unlinked voids in the crystal structure and would require some additional mechanism to break loose from the crystal. Through a detailed structural analysis of the macro and micro structure of the 5 NU as it dehydrates, we have developed {{a model for the}} dehydration process based on the observed development of structural defects in the 5 NU crystal and the basic crystallography of the material. The model was tested against standard kinetic measurements and found to present a satisfactory account of kinetic observations, thus defining the mechanism.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of governing metal thickness (GMT) and stack orientation on weld quality and mechanical behaviour of resistance spot welded (RSW) AA 5754 aluminium. Individual samples from 27 different joint stacks in three test geometries; lap-shear, coach-peel and cross-tension were evaluated for quasi-static and fatigue performance; <b>micro</b> <b>examination</b> was also conducted {{on some of the}} samples to assess weld quality. The results derived from over 1000 samples show that: the GMT has a significant effect on welding quality by controlling progression of weld nugget from underdeveloped to over penetrated. The GMT also determines the feasible quasi-static joint strength regardless of stacks in the three joint geometries tested, though the effect differs with respect to test geometry. The fatigue behaviour is dominated by the effect of GMT on attainable weld size, overall joint stiffness and stress concentration, providing good quality of weld nuggets is achieved. No notable effect of stack orientation on weld quality and joint strength was found with respect to the joint stack asymmetry and welding orientation to the electrodes. These fundamental relationships between weld qualities, joint strength, GMT and stack orientation for RSW of aluminium will have significant relevance to design and manufacturing communities.

More importantly, it appears that these have been subject to relatively little critical scrutiny in absolute terms and most of the small number of critical academic papers seem to concentrate on the actions of the USA – even when they cover counter-terrorist finance (CTF) in Western countries generally. Those criticisms that do occur can be placed into four groups, namely those concerned with: the efficiency of the system; the ethical acceptability of the policies; the potential abuse of the legislation; and the actual impact of these measures on individuals, groups or sectors in a society itself. This paper has space to deal with only one of these types of criticisms and it is upon the latter of these that it will concentrate. Moreover, it will examine the negative impact these measures are alleged to have had on individuals, groups or sectors within only one society – the United Kingdom. It is this assessment of the alleged negative effects of CTF laws in the UK only that distinguishes this from previous papers.

The sepsis model was reproduced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The rats were sacrificed 24 h after operation. The levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) were assayed with enzymatic assays, endothelin 1 (ET- 1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) with ELISA, renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities with xanthine oxide method, {{and the degree of}} renal tissue injury by <b>micros</b> copic <b>examination</b> after HE staining.

Various researchers have proposed a number of machine learning and data mining approaches for identifying cancerous nodule using gene expression data. But, these existing techniques have certain limitations that do not handle the particular needs of gene <b>micro</b> array <b>examination.</b> Initially, <b>micro</b> array data is featured by a high-dimensional feature space repeatedly exceeding the sample space dimensionality {{by a factor of}} 100 or higher.

Some of the widely used Gene ranking techniques are T-Score, ANOVA, etc. But those approaches will sometimes wrongly predict the rank when large database is used. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes an efficient feature selection technique. Wrapper feature selection approach called the GA-SVM approach is used for the effective feature selection of genes. Then, the selected features are given as input to the classifier.

The damping properties of the alloys were established at all temperatures. Formulas were established to predict damping properties of each alloy at any given temperature. The prediction formulae {{were found to be}} very accurate. All of the experimental alloys were heterogenous with varying microstructure and grain size; this was the major contribution and dominated the damping properties of the alloys. Super cosmal and ZA 27 possessed the highest tensile strength but ZA 27 H 1, ZA 27 H 2 and ZM 11 showed the highest damping properties.

Stereolithography (SL), the most mature of RP technology, has primarily been used to build small to medium sized parts although there are largescale applications i. e. the automotive industry that uses “mammoth SLA”. Recent developments in SL have been aimed at increasing the speed of the additive process of most SL apparatus (SLA). Developments include the chemistry of photopolymer resins, integral-curing processes as opposed to vector-by-vector processes, and what is now called microstereolithography. Integral curing has been made possible by the advent of dynamic masking generators such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and digital micromirror devices (DMDs). Much of the theory for this new layering process has been applied to the micro-scale and awaits application for medium to large sized parts.

In the present work, investigation {{is carried out}} on Friction Welding of AISI 1030 steel and hybrid AA 6063 - 6 SiCp- 3 Grpcomposite, {{that are difficult to}} weld by fusion welding technique. Silicon carbide and graphite particle reinforced AA 6063 matrix hybrid composite was developed successfully using stir casting method and the joining feasibility of AISI 1030 steel with AA 6063 - 6 SiCp- 3 Grp hybrid composite was tried out by friction stud welding technique. During friction stage of welding process, the particulates (SiC & Graphite) used for reinforcement, tend to increase the viscosity and lead to improper mixing of matrix and reinforcement. This eventually results in lower strength in dissimilar joints. To overcome this difficulty AA 1100 interlayer is used while joining hybrid composite to AISI 1030 steel. Experimentation was carried out using Taguchi based design of experiments (DOE) technique. Multiple regression methods were applied to understand the relationship between process parameters of the friction stud welding process. <b>Micro</b> structural <b>examination</b> reveals three separate zones namely fully plasticized zone, partially deformed zone and unaffected base material zone. Ultra fine dynamically recrystallized grains of about 341  nm were observed at the fully plasticized zone.

Developed regression model could be used to predict the axial shortening distance and impact strength of the welded joint with reasonable accuracy...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the natural fiber {{composites}} have attracted substantial importance as a potential structural material. The attractive features of natural fibers like jute, sisal, coir and banana have been their low cost, light weights, high specific modulus, renewability and biodegradability. Natural fibres are lignocellulosic in nature. These composites are gaining importance due to their non- carcinogenic and bio-degradable nature. The natural fiber composites can be very cost effective material especially for building and construction industry. However in many instances residues from traditional crops such as rice husk or sugarcane bagasse or from the usual processing operations of timber industries {{do not meet the}} requisites of being long fibers. Bagasse contains about 40 % cellulose, 30 % hemicellulose, and 15 % lignin. The present use of bagasse is mainly as a fuel in the sugar cane mill furnaces. It is felt that the value of this agricultural residue can be upgraded by bonding with resin to produce composites suitable for building materials. Keeping this in view the present work has been undertaken to develop a polymer matrix composite (epoxy resin) using bagasse fiber as reinforcement and to study its mechanical properties and environmental performance. The composites are prepared with different volume fraction of bagasse fibers. Experiments have been conducted under laboratory conditions to asses the effect of different environment such as subzero, steam, saline water and natural conditions on the mechanical properties of the composites. The change in weight, volume and dimensions are studied for various treatments. Shear strength of the composites was evaluated by three point bend test as per ASTM D 2344 - 84. The volume fraction of composites having greater mechanical properties was taken for the second phase of experimentation.

Therefore, {{in accordance with the}} thesis' objectives, an original contribution is offered firstly through the detailed and <b>micro</b> level <b>examination</b> and analysis of the character of the reforms. Such analysis is largely absent from any scholarship on this topic. Secondly, it provides a comprehensive identification of the obstacles and challenges facing the implementation of future reforms and changes. The thesis focuses on a variety of differential factors within broad social, economic, political, and human rights spectrums. It provides an identification of policy relevant initiatives which would likely counter the obstacles to future reform. Here it is suffice to say that current policy relevant scholarship and indeed government practice may indicate that strategic vision exists but fails to appreciate that on a broad level there is an acute lack of detailed policy planning. This study shows how the lack of bureaucratic project management and analysis, at a bureaucratic agency level, on new initiatives is the overarching factor, which inhibits the successful advancement of reform for the future. Furthermore, attention is given to particular localised initiatives that also need to be undertaken. Finally, and most importantly, this thesis offers a new interpretation through a pragmatic analysis of this era of reform. Indeed, it offers a comprehensive understanding and meaning to the reforms and changes in Bahrain for scholarship in this field. Moreover, it builds on the existing body of scholarship on GCC states politics in particular and the Arab region in general, by showing the uniqueness of Bahrain and ultimately the need for a country specific solution to its existing barriers to future success...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecology of}} Holothuriafuscogilva was {{assessed}} in three habitats in the Republic of Maldives: marine grass beds, island gaps and lagoon floor. In the lagoon floor habitat, H fuscogilva was the dominant sea cucumber with relative abundances ranging from 70 to 94. 9 % {{in the two}} atolls studied. In one island gap area the median density (biomass), movement and growth rate were 29 ha-I (21 kg ha-I), 2 m d-I and 0. 29 % d- 1, respectively. Based upon the weight distributions in the three habitats, H fuscogilva appears to recruit to shallow marine grass beds, then migrates to deeper waters such as island gaps. It then moves to the deep waters of the lagoon floor, as it approaches sexual maturity (1. 5 kg TW), where it matures and reproduces. Growth slows as the animal matures and individuals with total weights of 5000 g or greater were estimated {{to be at least}} 12 yrs old. Based upon <b>micro</b> and macroscopic <b>examination</b> of extracted gonads, mature individuals from the lagoon floor were found primarily from August through May. Spawning of both male and females was observed between December and March or essentially the N. east monsoon season in the Maldives...|$|R
40|$|Mt Etinde eruptions are dated at 0. 65 Ma. it {{is located}} on the SW oceanic border of Mt Cameroon, and is {{composed}} essentially of nephenilitic rocks. The weathering of nephelinites has resulted in the formation of a 150 cm deep Andic Cambisol (Humic) consisting of three horizons: Ah/Bw/C. Mineral weathering was studied in detail in two profiles: one (P- 1) developed from unaltered nephelinite (nephelinite(U)) and the other (P- 2) formed from hydrothermally altered nephelinite (nephelinite(H)). Emphasis was on the impact of hydrothermal alterations on weathering profiles, to characterise the signature of halloysite in nephelinitic regoliths and to discuss the evolution of Mt Etinde soils on the Quaternary nephelinitic parent rocks. The mineralogy of nephelinite(U) consists predominantly of clinopyroxene, nepheline, leucite, hauyne, titano-magnetite, perovskite, apatite and sphene. Nephelinite(H) differs from nephelinite(U) by phillipsite-calcite occurrence. The main weathering products are halloysites (1 -nm and 0. 7 -nm) and minor occurrence of gibbsite and hematite. SEM <b>micro</b> morphological <b>examination</b> coupled with microprobe analyses showed halloysites resulting from in situ alterations of feldspathoids, phillipsites and clinopyroxenes. 1 -nm hydrated halloysite neoformation characterises the alteromorphs of the saprolite while 1 -nm and 0. 7 -nm halloysite coexist in the Bw and the Ah horizons of both soils. During weathering, these halloysites had a chemical dependence with parent mineral as follows: Ce-rich halloysite characterises alteromorph after phillipsite; Fe-rich halloysite, alteromorph after clinopyroxene: Ca-rich halloysite alteromorph, after hauyne; and K-rich halloysite, alteromorph after leucite. Ce-rich halloysite is a tracer of the hydrothermal impact in soils profile. The Si/Al ratio is also characteristic of the parent mineral. Therefore, the availability of Si is the only factor that controlled the formation of 1 -nm halloysite {{at the base of the}} saprolite while the presence of 1 -nm and 0. 7 halloysite in the upper part of the saprolite, the Bw horizon and the Ah horizon suggesting only time controls of the evolution of the profiles by both kinetic (wet-dry seasons) and thermodynamic (Si-bearing) factors. Gibbsite occurs only in the nephelinite(H) soil. Its presence is due to the hydrothermal alteration which favoured the development of an intense microporosity allowing the elimination of silica. The study highlighted the influence of past hydrothermal activity on the recent weathering process in the humid tropical area...|$|R
40|$|Die Ätiologie der Periimplantitis ist insbesondere auf dem genetischen Level weitgehend unbekannt. Diese Arbeit untersuchte immundefiziente Tiere um die Fachkenntnisse zur Entstehung und zum Verlauf der Periimplantitis mit ihren Wirtsfaktoren zu verbessern und um ferner Therapieoptionen zu evaluieren. Für diesen tierexperimentellen Versuch wurden in 40 Mäusen Titannägel (FRIOS®) median am Gaumen direkt hinter den oberen Schneidezähnen inseriert. Es erfolgte eine Einteilung in 4 Gruppen. 20 Mäuse gehörten dem Inzuchtstamm der Art C 57 BL/ 6 N (Normal) an. Weitere 20 Mäuse waren Knockoutmäuse (NOD 2 -defizient). Bei 20 Versuchstieren, jeweils bei 10 Mäusen der Art C 57 BL/ 6 N und bei 10 Knockoutmäusen der Art NOD 2, wurden die Membran-Nägel zusätzlich mit einer Ligatur versehen. Die restlichen 10 Tiere der beiden Gruppen dienten jeweils als Kontrollgruppe. Nach 6 Wochen erfolgten Histologie und Radiologie. Es konnte eine reproduzierbare Implantatinseration mit dem Hervorrufen einer Periimplantitis im Knockoutmausmodell erreicht werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Implantate mit Ligaturen klinisch, radiologisch sowie histologisch eine signifikant höhere periimplantäre Destruktion mit Implantatverlust induzieren, als die jeweiligen Kontrollgruppen. Ein Rückschluss der gewählten Immundefizienz NOD 2 der Knockoutmäuse auf die Periimplantitis konnte nicht gezogen werden. Development, {{progression}} {{and therapy}} are the mainly unsolved uprising {{problems in the}} periimplantitis. Periodontal disease models are established in knock-out mice. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the basics and the development of the periimplantitis, based on a prior study „A knock-out model for Periimplantitis“. This work considered immune deficient knockout animals to improve the knowledge for the origin and the process of Periimplantitis with their host factors. In 40 mice, 20 normal (C 57 BL/ 6 N) and 20 advertises knockout mice (NOD 2 -defizient), titanium implants (FRIOS®) in the area of the upper jaw directly behind the front teeth were inserated. With 10 mice of each of the two tribes the implants were provided in addition with ligatures so that altogether 4 groups could be formed (C 57 BL/ 6 N implant as a control group, C 57 BL/ 6 N implant and ligature, knockout implant as a control group, knockout implant and ligature). The 40 mice were fed with a special diet enriched with sugar and flavor under a steady weight check over a period of 6 weeks, then killed by means of a cervical dislocation. The specimens were processed histologically and microradiographies were prepared. The results show that implants with ligatures induce a significantly higher periimplantitis bone defect than the respective control groups. The <b>micro</b> radiological <b>examinations</b> confirm this results. At the end of the observation period, the portion of implants lost was higher in the ligature group. Indeed in the normal mouse groups as well as in the knockout mouse tribes as many implants were lost, what implies that the chosen immune-deficiency of the knockout mice does not have influence on the periimplantitis. Nevertheless this test confirms that an induce of a periimplantitis also is possible in the knockout mice model...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the increased incidence of collaborative arrangements between firms, the competitive environment characterising many industries has undergone profound change. It is suggested that rivalry is not necessarily enacted by individual firms according to the traditional mechanisms of direct confrontation in factor and product markets, but rather as collaborative orchestration between a number of participants or network members. Strategic networks are recognised as sets of firms within an industry that exhibit denser strategic linkages among themselves than other firms within the same industry. Based on this, strategic networks are determined according to evidence of strategic alliances between firms comprising the industry. As a result, a single strategic network represents a group of firms closely linked according to collaborative ties. Arguably, the collective outcome of these strategic relationships engineered between firms suggest that the collaborative benefits attributed to interorganisational relationships require closer examination in respect to their propensity to influence rivalry in intraindustry environments. Derived in large from the social sciences, network theory allows for the <b>micro</b> and macro <b>examination</b> of the opportunities and constraints inherent in the structure of relationships in strategic networks, establishing a relational approach upon which the conduct and performance of firms can be more fully understood. Research to date has yet to empirically investigate the relationship between strategic networks and rivalry. The limited research that has been completed utilising a network rationale to investigate competitive patterns in contemporary industry environments has been characterised by a failure to directly measure rivalry. Further, this prior research has typically embedded investigation in industry settings dominated by technological or regulatory imperatives, such as the microprocessor and airline industries. These industries, due to the presence of such imperatives, are arguably more inclined to support the realisation of network rivalry, through subscription to prescribed technological standards (eg., microprocessor industry) or by being bound by regulatory constraints dictating operation within particular market segments (airline industry). In order to counter these weaknesses, the proposition guiding research - Are patterns of rivalry predicted by strategic network membership? – is embedded in the United States Light Vehicles Industry, an industry not dominated by technological or regulatory imperatives. Further, rivalry is directly measured and utilised in research, thus distinguishing this investigation from prior research efforts. The timeframe of investigation is 1993 – 1999, with all research data derived from secondary sources. Strategic networks were defined within the United States Light Vehicles Industry based on evidence of horizontal strategic relationships between firms comprising the industry. The measure of rivalry used to directly ascertain the competitive patterns of industry participants was derived from the traditional Herfindahl Index, modified to account for patterns of rivalry observed at the market segment level. Statistical analyses of the strategic network and rivalry constructs found little evidence to support the contention of network rivalry; indeed, greater levels of rivalry were observed between firms comprising the same strategic network than between firms participating in opposing network structures. Based on these results, patterns of rivalry evidenced in the United States Light Vehicle Industry over the period 1993 – 1999 were not found to be predicted by strategic network membership. The findings generated by this research are in contrast to current theorising in the strategic network – rivalry realm. In this respect, these findings are surprising. The relevance of industry type, in conjunction with prevailing network methodology, provides the basis upon which these findings are contemplated. Overall, this study raises some important questions in relation to the relevancy of the network rivalry rationale, establishing a fruitful avenue for further research...|$|R
