5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood.</b> Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|Internally {{designated}} as the DH.100 and originally named the [...] "Spider Crab", the aircraft was entirely a de Havilland project, being principally worked upon at the company's facility at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The construction of the aircraft exploited de Havilland's extensive experience {{in the use of}} <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> for aircraft construction; many design features that were used upon the DH.100, such as the fuselage nacelle and tall triangular vertical surfaces, had been present on the company's preceding Mosquito, a widely produced fast bomber of the war.|$|E
2500|$|In 1903 24 {{motor cars}} and 33 {{trailers}} {{were provided by}} Westinghouse. The stock was of an American design, with a clerestory roof and open gated ends. Unheated accommodation was in saloons and the wooden bodies were British built, and the bogies {{had been made by}} Baldwin Locomotive Works in America. First and third class cars were provided, the first class seats being natural rattan and the third class seats being <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood.</b> The livery was maroon with white roofs and [...] "Mersey Railway" [...] in gold leaf on the upper fascia panels. Air brakes were provided with storage reservoirs that were recharged from static compressors at the terminal stations. The motor cars were powered with Westinghouse motors controlled by the Westinghouse low voltage multiple unit train control system.|$|E

50|$|Much of Barber & Osgerby's {{early work}} {{involved}} the folding and shaping of sheet material, {{influenced by the}} white card that they had used frequently in architectural model making. The Loop Table, Flight Stool (1998, Isokon) and Pilot Table (1999, Cappellini) were all <b>moulded</b> from sheet <b>plywood,</b> as was the experimental Hula Stool prototype (1999), a complex assemblage of compound curves. The Shell Table (2000) (nominated for the Compasso d'oro) and Shell Chair (2001) were further structural studies in folded plywood.|$|R
50|$|With a {{double-ended}} {{hull and}} relatively wide beam the St. Ayles skiff is {{a stable and}} seaworthy boat. The marine plywood planks and frames can be purchased in kit form, together with a <b>plywood</b> <b>mould</b> upon which the hull can be formed. Other parts of the boat, including the rudder, seats (thwarts), keel and gunwales, may be built using suitable timbers. Most of the timber elements, including the planking and frames, are jointed and connected using either epoxy resin or Polyurethane glue.|$|R
50|$|Whereas 1930s {{furniture}} {{had been}} heavy and ponderous, Day’s post-war designs were light {{on their feet}} and economical {{in their use of}} materials. His Reclining Chair (1952), for example, had a slim angular upholstered seat, floating wooden armrests and U-shaped steel rod legs. A minimalist frame was also adopted for the 675 Chair (1953), a dining chair with a slender floating <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> seat back. In the Q Stak Chair (1954), Day’s first one-piece <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> shell chair, the number of components was reduced to the bare minimum in order to keep costs down.|$|E
5000|$|... "She was 56ft long, {{built of}} cold <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood,</b> with a 60ft mast but only 22 inches wide." [...] The smaller, {{outrigger}} hull was 30 ft {{removed from the}} central hull.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War II, Margaret Harris and Elizabeth Montgomery travelled to the United States to design a production of Romeo and Juliet for Laurence Olivier. They stayed in America {{until the end of}} the war, designing numerous successful productions on Broadway. Margaret Harris also worked for a time with the furniture designer Charles Eames on his <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> airplane parts.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} comprised {{a wooden}} structure with the cockpit {{in the extreme}} nose transitioning with very clean lines to the integral fin at the rear. The forward opening canopy was jettisonable in case of emergency and comprising plexiglass clear portions fitted to a 'Duralumin' frame. A 300×125 mm mainwheel, with mechanically operated brakes connected to the airbrake lever, was fitted in a semi recessed position augmented by flush fitting skids under the nose and tail. The construction methods of the fuselage evolved throughout the series culminating in large panels, formed in concrete <b>moulds,</b> of <b>plywood</b> and PVC foam sandwich giving a very smooth finish, high strength and reduced weight. The pilot sat semi-reclined in an adjustable back-rest seat with headrest and non-adjustable rudder pedals. The instrument panel sits on a column above and between the pilots legs, with basic instruments and supplementary instruments as required. A single tow hook is fitted {{to the left of}} the nose-skid with a release control cable operated by a control knob at the base of the instrument panel. The forward sliding canopy comprised the entire top half of the forward fuselage which slid forward, on runners, controlled by a knob in a track on the left side of the cockpit rim. The canopy was constructed around a 'Duralumin' frame with 'Plexiglas' transparent section and moulded opaque nose section.|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{durability}} {{is dependent}} upon {{the quality of the}} concrete cover zone. The type of mould release technology used, has a direct effect on the surface finish of the formation of fair faced concrete, and this in turn affects long term durability and surface finish. This paper examines two mould release agents, one permeable formwork liner and Type 1 polypropylene fibres used with a single mould release agent. Cubes were cast in film faced <b>plywood</b> <b>moulds</b> using a C 40 concrete that enabled comparisons to be drawn between the mould release agents. The range of variables tested comprised of, two (FS and CL) commercially available solvent based mould release agents (MRA), permeable formwork and C 1 used with polypropylene fibres. The results showed that the controlled permeability formwork (CPF) liner produced the fewest blowholes and was the best performing technology used in that respect. As a consequence of this, CPF provided the most likely finish that would provide long term durability. None of the technologies employed produced a completely uniform colour throughout, however the CL MRA cubes and polypropylene fibre reinforced cubes produced the most consistent colouring...|$|R
40|$|A 24 {{year old}} man {{developed}} severe asthma {{two years after}} starting {{to work in a}} plywood plant. Four years later the patient had to stop working because of the increasing severity of his asthma. Three months after leaving his job, the patient's asthma was greatly improved. His job consisted of placing plywood sheets into a drying machine. The plywood sheets had stayed outside in wet conditions for at least four to six weeks and were usually covered with <b>moulds.</b> Drying the <b>plywood</b> sheets changed the mould into a fine orange powder. Exposure to this in the laboratory induced an isolated immediate asthmatic reaction. The same reaction was seen when the patient was challenged with an extract of the mould powder at a 0. 1 % w/v concentration. Skin prick test with the mould extract induced a weal and flare reaction and IgE antibodies against the dry mould powder were identified. A control patient with the same degree of bronchial hyperreactivity did not have any asthmatic reaction when challenged with the same mould extract. Culture of the dry mould powder on Sabouraud agar plates grew pure Neurospora sp. This mould has not been previously reported as a cause of occupational asthma. The immunological mechanism is probably related to an IgE mediated mast cell allergy...|$|R
50|$|The town prospered {{with wooden}} {{shipbuilding}} in the 19th century. While shipbuilding decline {{with the arrival}} of steel and steam vessels, Mahone Bay became known for its boatbuilding. World War I and II brought brief revivals of shipbuilding with construction of schooners, tugs and barges. After the war, the ship yard became known for innovative production of <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> boats.|$|E
50|$|The O-Jolle - (Olympiajolle) - {{was created}} as the Monotype class for the 1936 Olympic Games by {{designer}} Hellmut Wilhelm E. Stauch (GER, later RSA). The boat is a Bermuda rig and the hull was originally carvel - later GRP and cold <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> construction were allowed. The O-Jolle has very good sailing capabilities and can cater {{for a wide}} spectrum of sailors from young to old and from light to heavyweight.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from having}} a highly {{successful}} racing, cruising and sailing career, he ran successful boat design and boatbuilding businesses {{in the south of}} England. He designed many of the significant classes of boats around today, including the planing International 14, the Foxcub and Super Foxcub, the Flying Fifteen, the Flying Ten, the National 12, the National 18, the Albacore, the Firefly, the Javelin, the Pegasus Dinghy, the Jollyboat and the Day Sailer.

40|$|Concrete {{durability}} {{is in part}} {{dependent upon}} {{the quality of the}} concrete cover zone. The type of mould release technology used has a direct effect on the surface finish of fair-faced concrete, and this in turn affects long-term durability. This work examined two mould release agents (MRAs), one permeable formwork liner and a type 1 polypropylene fibre concrete combined with a single MRA. Cubes were cast in film-faced <b>plywood</b> <b>moulds</b> using C 40 concrete that enabled comparisons to be drawn between the MRAs. The pilot study examined a range of variables for two different reactive MRAs (FS (petroleum based) and CL (vegetable oil based)). The release agents used are commercially available as reactive-based MRAs. In addition, controlled permeability formwork (CPF) and a concrete mix with polypropylene fibre additions were used. The pilot study results showed that the CPF liner produced the least number of blowholes and, in that respect, was the best performing technology used. Consequently, the CPF provided the most likely finish that would provide long-term durability. None of the technologies employed produced a completely uniform colour throughout, but the CL MRA cubes and polypropylene fibre reinforced cubes produced the most consistent colouring. Two of the best performing mould release products (CPF and FS) were then tested using a high-resolution optical measurement system and the initial results were examined in much greater detail, taking account of surface roughness, pore volume and pore size. The CPF proved to produce a better finish than the FS release agent...|$|R
50|$|The {{trapezoidal}} wings {{were built}} up with heavy gauge <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> skins, supported by wooden ribs, using NACA 633-618 {{at the root}} changing smoothly to NACA 4415 at the tip. Large metal plate air brakes are fitted well aft of the main spar at approximately ¾ chord, in already turbulent air flow, to reduce drag. Roll control is provided by ailerons in the trailing edges of the outer wings (the SZD-24-2 Foka 2 was fitted with reduced area ailerons to reduce drag, but rollcontrol was dramatically reduced).|$|E

Leo Gullbring wrote, [...] "Caroline Schlyter's distinctly personal and original designs challenge Swedish furniture traditions." [...] A major exhibition {{of her work}} entitled Familjen h-son, produced by the Swedish Exhibition Agency was first held at the Lönnströms Konstmuseum, Finland, and later travelled around Swedish museums.

50|$|Although {{the war had}} impeded Day’s {{ambition}} to become a furniture designer, his fortunes changed in 1948 when he and Clive Latimer won First Prize in the Storage Section of the International Competition for Low-Cost Furniture Design organised by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Their ingenious concept {{for a range of}} multi-purpose storage units fabricated from a tube of pre-formed <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> received international acclaim. Although never mass-produced, a set of prototypes made by Heal & Son in 1949 demonstrated the principles behind the design. Supported on tubular aluminium legs, the cabinets were compact and flexible, with sliding doors, interchangeable shelf and drawer fittings and a writing desk with a drop-down flap.|$|E
5000|$|After {{training}} as a cabinetmaker, she studied at the Danish Design School in 1946, while receiving additional instruction from Kaare Klint at the Royal Academy's Furniture School. Inspired by Alvar Aalto's laminated bent-plywood furniture and Charles Eames' <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> designs, she began to develop her own boldly curved models in the 1950s. In 1963, she won a Daily Mirror competition with her [...] "He Chair" [...] and [...] "She Chair". With the help of furniture manufacturer Poul Jeppesen, {{she went on to}} design simpler models with clear, comfortable lines, which became popular both in Denmark and the United States thanks to their competitive prices. Jalk also edited the Danish design magazine Mobilia and compiled an authoritative four-volume work on Danish furniture.|$|E

50|$|The three GAL.56 {{variants}} {{employed the}} same fuselage design, married to three different wing designs. The fuselage of the GAL.56 was constructed of steel tubes and wooden ribs, covered in <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> sheeting. Accommodation was for pilot and observer, in tandem cockpits. For each variant, the wings were constructed of laminated wood spars and ribs, covered in wood/paper laminated skins. Each wing {{was attached to}} the fuselage by a joint via which the dihedral could be pre-set before flight. Elevons were provided to act as elevators for pitch control, and as servo-assisted ailerons for roll control. Two sets of split flaps were installed, of which either set could be selected before flight. A fin and rudder was mounted at each wingtip. The fixed main undercarriage struts, using existing components, were attached to the wing spars, and an extended tailwheel attached {{to the rear of the}} fuselage pod.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Eames {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen (whose son Eero, also an architect, would become a partner and friend). At the elder Saarinen's invitation, Charles moved in 1938 with his wife Catherine and daughter Lucia to Michigan, to further study architecture at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where he would become a teacher {{and head of the}} industrial design department. In order to apply for the Architecture and Urban Planning Program, Eames defined an area of focus—the St. Louis waterfront. Together with Eero Saarinen he designed prize-winning furniture for New York's Museum of Modern Art [...] "Organic Design in Home Furnishings" [...] competition. Their work displayed the new technique of wood moulding (originally developed by Alvar Aalto), that Eames would further develop in many <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> products, including chairs and other furniture, splints and stretchers for the US Navy during World War II.|$|E

5000|$|Clyde Boats {{were soon}} {{available}} in three sizes; 12', 14', and 16'. Each boat {{began as a}} wooden [...] "tub" [...] constructed of <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> and built by fishermen in Nova Scotia. Some were Ashcroft hulls, with {{the inner and outer}} layer running on the same bias, overlapping the seams, while others were cold molded hulls. The boats were soon known for their speed, compared to other boats of their size. The secret was 5 Ply Moulded Marine Aircraft Birch, which was very light, and strong. At the Clyde factory the keel was added, then the boat would be completed using the customer's choice of accessories. At first, all boats were made to order, with no [...] "tub" [...] or supplies purchased until an order was placed, but by World War II the company had begun using the winter months when business was slow to construct boats to a factory standard that could be sold as factory models, or finished with additional details of the customer's choosing.|$|E
5000|$|In 1953, Jalk {{opened her}} own design studio. Inspired by Alvar Aalto's {{laminated}} bent-plywood furniture and Charles Eames' <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> designs, {{she began to}} develop her own boldly curved models. General interest in her unconventional models grew only slowly although they were sought after for exhibitions and collections. In 1963, the English newspaper Daily Mirror launched a competition for a chair for {{a man and a}} chair for a woman. Despite the fact that Jalk won first prize with two different laminated armchairs, the He Chair and the She Chair, they never really came into production. Her associate, cabinetmaker and furniture manufacturer Poul Jeppesen, had made some prototypes but they were burnt in a fire, bringing the project to an end. In 2008, however, Lange Production began industrial production of the She Chair. This was not Jalk’s last collaboration with Jeppesen, she built upon her work in laminated plywood furniture with the creation of the side chair of 1962.|$|E
5000|$|... 1951 was an annus mirabilis for Robin Day. His {{seating for}} the Royal Festival Hall and his {{high-profile}} {{contributions to the}} Festival of Britain, held on the neighbouring site on London’s South Bank, greatly enhanced his professional reputation. The brief for the Royal Festival Hall project was complex and demanding, including restaurant and foyer furniture, auditorium seating and orchestra chairs, each with specific functional requirements. Always keen to explore new manufacturing processes, Day co-opted materials and technology from the automotive industry for his concert hall seating, which was fabricated from pressed steel, supported by cast steel stanchions. This proved so effective {{that it is still}} in use today. The chairs he designed for the restaurant and foyer had sculptural <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> seats with wing-like armrests and spindly black steel rod legs. Day was the first designer in Britain to exploit these materials in furniture. His chairs were revolutionary at the time as they appeared to hover above the ground.|$|E
5000|$|They met at {{art school}} in the 1920s {{and went on to}} great success as John Gielgud's {{designers}} during the 1930s. They started teaching theatre design at Michel Saint-Denis's London Theatre Studio (1936-1939), the first time a design course had been incorporated into a drama {{school in the}} UK. Margaret Harris and Elizabeth Montgomery spent World War II in the United States, designing for Broadway, and Harris also worked with Charles Eames on his <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> airplane parts. Sophie Harris, now married to George Devine, and mother of their child Harriet, stayed in the UK designing for stage and screen. After the war Margaret Harris returned to the UK, and both sisters once again joined Saint-Denis, teaching design at the Old Vic Theatre School (1947-1953). Elizabeth Montgomery stayed in the United States designing for many Broadway productions. All three continued to design under the name [...] "Motley" [...] for both stage and screen.|$|E
5000|$|Crosfield was a keen sailor {{who bought}} his first boat in 1938, [...] "an ancient sailing boat {{for about ten}} pounds", shared with a Dutch {{apprentice}} like himself at ASEA. They sailed her on Lake Mälaren. He bought another boat {{after the war and}} he chose a 25-foot catamaran, Orlando, because a catamarans speed, unlike a monohull sailing vessel, is not limited by its overall length. For four years he sailed around the Solent and Isle of Wight, with his family and any friend who might be aboard as crew. In 1962, he had a hankering for a larger and faster boat and was taken with a 38-foot catamaran that had won the Round the Isle of Wight race against much larger boats. Snowgoose had been built by the Prout brothers but, [...] "they seemed to have no idea how to build a family cruiser." [...] Crosfield took a drawing board home and, using Snowgooses hot <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> hulls, designed her himself. The Prout brothers built Gemini and asked Crosfield if they could use his design for future customers. The Crosfield family sailed Gemini for ten years, first in the Thames estuary and the North Sea, and then in the Western Mediterranean. In 1972, Gemini hit a heavy object in strong winds off the coast of Corsica and was irreparably damaged. In 1975 Crosfield bought a summer house on the Salcombe estuary. For some years he sailed a Salcombe yawl.|$|E

40|$|Design {{formed an}} {{important}} part of political ideology during the Cold War. At the American National Exhibition in Moscow in July 1959, US Vice President Richard Nixon asked USSR premier Nikita Khrushchev, "Would it not be better to compete in the relative merits of washing machines than in the strength of rockets? Is this the kind of competition you want?" The conversation took place in an American exhibit a General Electric lemonyellow kitchen. Famously known as the "Kitchen debate" design, it became one of the focal points of political propaganda that was disseminated through debates on affluence, efficiency, comfort, and the general happiness of society. We generally understand Cold War modernity in design to be about scientific advancement and high technology, for example, a futuristic life in space epitomised in Stanley Kubrick's 2001 : A Space Odyssey, or enormous television towers or even <b>moulded</b> <b>plywood</b> and fibreglass reinforced plastics chairs. However, Cold War design in Asia does not necessarily fit into these images...|$|E
