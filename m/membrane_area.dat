25|$|Problems with lipid {{fatty acid}} {{analyses}} include the incomplete specificity of fatty acids to AM fungi, the species- or genera-specific variation in fatty acid composition can complicate analysis in systems with multiple AM fungal species (e.g. field soil), the high background levels of certain fatty acid concentration in soils, and that phospholipids are correlated to an organism's <b>membrane</b> <b>area,</b> {{and the surface}} to volume ratio can vary widely between organisms such as bacteria and fungi.

25|$|The Mitochondrial DNA Polymerase (Pol gamma, encoded by the POLG gene) {{is used in}} the copying of mtDNA during replication. Because the two (heavy and light) strands on the {{circular}} mtDNA molecule have different origins of replication, it replicates in a D-loop mode. One strand begins to replicate first, displacing the other strand. This continues until replication reaches the origin of replication on the other strand, at which point the other strand begins replicating in the opposite direction. This results in two new mtDNA molecules. Each mitochondrion has several copies of the mtDNA molecule and the number of mtDNA molecules is a limiting factor in mitochondrial fission. After the mitochondrion has enough mtDNA, <b>membrane</b> <b>area,</b> and membrane proteins, it can undergo fission (very similar to that which bacteria use) to become two mitochondria. Evidence suggests that mitochondria can also undergo fusion and exchange (in a form of crossover) genetic material among each other. Mitochondria sometimes form large matrices in which fusion, fission, and protein exchanges are constantly occurring. mtDNA shared among mitochondria (despite the fact that they can undergo fusion).|$|E

A quantitative electron-microscopic study was undertaken {{to determine the}} relative contribution of lesions in capillary loops and mesangial basement <b>membrane</b> <b>areas</b> and their possible correlations to urinary protein excretion data. Pathologic features including the loss of foot processes (and slit diaphragms), the formation of junctional complexes in visceral epithelium, {{and the distribution of}} immune complexes in basement membrane were assessed in glomeruli of mice with lupus nephritis. Swiss albino mice served as control animals. In control animals the distribution of split pores per unit length of basement membrane was approximately 60 % higher in capillary loop compared to mesangial basement <b>membrane</b> <b>areas.</b> In mice with lupus nephritis, the {{reduction in the number of}} slit pores per unit length of basement membrane to 30 % or less of normal, the formation of epithelial junctions, and the relative distribution of immune complexes were not statistically different in capillary versus mesangial basement <b>membrane</b> <b>areas.</b> Animals with murine lupus showed poorly selective proteinuria, but the correlation between features studied and extent of protein excretion was poor. The results of these studies 1) establish the relative distribution of slit pores in mesangial and peripheral loop basement membrane, 2) demonstrate that glomerular changes associated with immune complex deposition are comparable in capillary and mesangial basement <b>membrane</b> <b>areas,</b> and 3) are consistent with a focal and nonuniform alteration in glomerular permeability properties associated with immune complex disease...|$|R

40|$|Mature {{glycoprotein}} spikes are {{inserted in}} the Lassa virus envelope and consist of the distal subunit GP- 1, the transmembrane-spanning subunit GP- 2, and the signal peptide, which originate from the precursor glycoprotein pre-GP-C by proteolytic processing. In this study, we analyzed the oligomeric structure of the viral surface glycoprotein. Chemical cross-linking studies of mature glycoprotein spikes from purified virus revealed the formation of trimers. Interestingly, sucrose density gradient analysis of cellularly expressed glycoprotein showed that in contrast to trimeric mature glycoprotein complexes, the noncleaved glycoprotein forms monomers and oligomers spanning a wide size range, indicating that maturation cleavage of GP by the cellular subtilase SKI- 1 /S 1 P is critical for formation of the correct oligomeric state. To shed light on a potential relation between cholesterol and GP trimer stability, we performed cholesterol depletion experiments. Although depletion of cholesterol {{had no effect on}} trimerization of the glycoprotein spike complex, our studies revealed that the cholesterol content of the viral envelope is important for the infectivity of Lassa virus. Analyses of the distribution of viral proteins in cholesterol-rich detergent-resistant <b>membrane</b> <b>areas</b> showed that Lassa virus buds from <b>membrane</b> <b>areas</b> other than those responsible for impaired infectivity due to cholesterol depletion of lipid rafts.

40|$|Newly fused chick myotubes undergo {{simultaneous}} {{and rapid}} changes in cell membrane properties during synchronous differentiation in culture. These changes are coordinately regulated and include increases in acetylcholine receptor, acetylcholinesterase, and resting potential, {{as well as}} the appearance of action potentials in discrete <b>membrane</b> <b>areas</b> upon stimulation. Subsequently, the acetylcholine receptor reaches maximal levels, whereas the development of electrical properties is marked by a further increase in resting potential, changes in the characteristics of the elicited action potential, and the recruitment of additional <b>membrane</b> <b>areas</b> for action potential generation. Maturation of electrical excitability, marked by the acquisition of the ability to fire repetitively and to conduct action potentials along the membrane, occurs well after resting potential has reached a maximum. During post-maturational development, myotubes exhibit spontaneous electrical and contractile activity, and levels of acetylcholine receptor accessible to externally applied 125 I-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin decrease markedly.

40|$|Eyespot {{membranes}} in zoospores, {{and male}} and female gametes of the green alga Ulva lactuca, were studied comparatively by the freeze—fracture technique. The plasmalemma and the outer chloroplast envelope membrane overlying the eyespot lipid globules are specialized in all 3 types of reproductive cells. In the eyespot region the protoplasmic face (PF) of the outer chloroplast envelope membrane contains significantly more intramembraneous particles (IMP) compared to <b>membrane</b> <b>areas</b> outside the eyespot: in female gametes there are 2 - 5 times more IMP//*ms, in zoospores 3 and in male gametes about 4.

The total number of IMP/eyespot on the PF of the outer chloro-plast membrane was calculated to be 4900 in male gametes, 5500 in female gametes and 11 200 in zoospores. The results are discussed in accordance with the view that these membrane specializations participate in photoreception relating to green algal phototaxis.

40|$|Cell {{migration}} of transformed renal epithelial cells (MDCK-F) depends–in addition to cytoskeletal mechanisms–on the polarized activity of a Ca 2 +-sensitive K+ channel {{in the rear}} part of the cells. However, {{because of the lack}} of specific markers for this channel we are not able to determine whether a polarized distribution of the channel protein underlies its functional polarization. To determine whether the migrating MDCK-F cells have retained the ability to target K+ channels to distinct <b>membrane</b> <b>areas</b> we stably transfected the cells with the voltage-dependent K+ channel Kv 1. 4. Stable expression and insertion into the plasma membrane could be shown by reverse transcription–PCR, genomic PCR, Western blot, and patch-clamp techniques, respectively. The distribution of Kv 1. 4 was assessed with indirect immunofluorescence by using conventional and confocal microscopy. These experiments revealed that Kv 1. 4 is expressed only in transfected cells where it elicits the typical voltage-dependent, rapidly inactivating K+ current. The Kv 1. 4 protein is clustered at the leading edge of protruding lamellipodia of migrating MDCK-F cells. This characteristic distribution of Kv 1. 4 provides strong evidence that migrating MDCK-F cells are able to insert ion channels into the plasma membrane in an asymmetric way, which reflects the polarization of migrating cells in the plane of movement. These findings suggest that not only epithelial cells and nerve cells, but also migrating cells, can create functionally distinct plasma <b>membrane</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper applies {{mathematical}} programming and superstructure-based optimization approaches to design multi-stage membrane systems for CO 2 capture, {{with the aim}} to systematically determine the optimal number of <b>membrane</b> stages, <b>membrane</b> <b>areas,</b> power requirements, the location of recycle streams, and operating conditions that satisfy desired CO 2 recovery−purity value pairs ranging from 90 to 98 % at minimum total cost. A superstructure that embeds several candidate configurations is represented as a NLP model {{which is used to}} investigate how these ranges of target values affect the optimal number of stages, <b>membrane</b> <b>areas,</b> operating conditions, and total cost. The results indicate that the optimal number of stages depend strongly on the desired CO 2 purity. For CO 2 purity ranging from 90 to 93 %, the optimal configuration involves two stages and one recycle stream; from 94 to 96 %, the optimal configuration involves three stages and two recycle streams; and finally, from 97 and 98 %, the optimal configuration involves all the four stages proposed in the superstructure keeping the two recycle streams. For the same design specifications, the obtained process configurations compete not only with reference cases of multi-stage membrane systems in terms of total cost, but also with absorption-based CO 2 capture processes in terms of energy requirements.
