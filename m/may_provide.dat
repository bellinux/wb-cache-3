5|$|Hospital Based Service – Hospitals <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> {{their own}} {{ambulance}} {{service as a}} service to the community, or where ambulance care is unreliable or chargeable. Their use would be dependent on using the services of the providing hospital.|$|E
5|$|Hospital funded service – Hospitals <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> the {{ambulance}} transport free of charge, {{on the condition}} that patients use the hospital's services (which they may have to pay for).|$|E
5|$|A novel {{interaction}} between millipedes and mosses {{was described in}} 2011, in which individuals of the newly discovered Psammodesmus bryophorus {{was found to have}} up to ten species living on its dorsal surface, in what <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> camouflage for the millipede and increased dispersal for the mosses.|$|E

5|$|A {{physical}} USB device may {{consist of}} several logical sub-devices that {{are referred to}} as device functions. A single device <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). This kind of device is called a composite device. An alternative to this is compound device, in which the host assigns each logical device a distinctive address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance Care Assistant – Have {{varying levels}} of {{training}} across the world, but these staff are usually only required to perform patient transport duties (which can include stretcher or wheelchair cases), rather than acute care. Dependent on provider, they may be trained in first aid or extended skills such as use of an AED, oxygen therapy and other lifesaving or palliative skills. They <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> emergency cover when other units are not available, or when accompanied by a fully qualified technician or paramedic.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells {{synthesise}} a {{wide range}} of chemicals with potential medicinal properties. They contain at least 15 biologically active compounds that <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> them with protection against insects and animals. Certain extracts – water-soluble alkaloids – are similar to compounds tested for use in combating HIV and cancer. The bulbs of bluebells are used in folk medicine as a remedy for leucorrhoea, and as a diuretic or styptic, while the sap can be used as an adhesive.|$|E

5|$|Geochemical {{observations}} {{may help}} to deduce the global level of biological activity, or the affinity of certain fossils. For example, geochemical features of rocks may reveal when life first arose on Earth, and <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> evidence {{of the presence of}} eukaryotic cells, the type from which all multicellular organisms are built. Analyses of carbon isotope ratios {{may help to}} explain major transitions such as the Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> a separate benefit.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{measures}} can include rest, caffeine intake (via coffee or intravenous infusion), and hydration. Corticosteroids <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> transient relief for some patients. An abdominal binder — {{a type of}} garment that increases intracranial pressure by compressing the abdomen — can temporarily relieve symptoms for some people.|$|E
50|$|In biology, {{paternal}} care is parental investment {{provided by}} a male animal to his own offspring. Paternal care <b>may</b> <b>provided</b> {{in concert with the}} mother (biparental care) or, more rarely, by the male alone (so called exclusive paternal care).|$|R
50|$|Public {{proposals}} for OON {{do not include}} security or authentication. Security and authentication <b>may</b> <b>provided</b> by the Integrator of the protocol. Typical security measures include encryption or signing or the protocol packets and incrementing counters to prevent replay attacks.|$|R
50|$|Joint promisees: Consideration {{given in}} return for a promise must move from the promisee; where there are joint promisees in a contract, {{consideration}} <b>may</b> be <b>provided</b> by one on behalf of both of them, or consideration <b>may</b> be <b>provided</b> by both promisees.|$|R
5|$|Investigations of the {{mathematical}} structure of M-theory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics. More speculatively, M-theory <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> {{a framework for}} developing a unified theory {{of all of the}} fundamental forces of nature. Attempts to connect M-theory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our four-dimensional world, although so far none has been verified to give rise to physics as observed at, for instance, the Large Hadron Collider.|$|E
5|$|Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} metabolites (or natural products), {{and research}} has established {{the existence of}} biochemical pathways solely {{for the purpose of}} producing mycotoxins and other natural products in fungi. Mycotoxins <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> fitness benefits in terms of physiological adaptation, competition with other microbes and fungi, and protection from consumption (fungivory). Many fungal secondary metabolites (or derivatives) are used medically, as described under Human Use below.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators {{of black}} bean aphids include both adults and larvae of ladybirds and lacewings and the larvae of hoverflies. Certain species of tiny {{parasitic}} wasps {{lay their eggs}} inside aphids and the developing wasp larvae devour their hosts from inside. Members of the wasp genera Diaeretiella and Lysiphlebus behave in this way and <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> a measure of control of the aphids.|$|E
50|$|Karl May was a {{prolific}} German writer {{who specialized in}} writing Westerns. Although he only visited America once {{towards the end of}} his life, <b>May</b> <b>provided</b> Germany with a series of frontier novels, which provided Germans with an imaginary view of America.|$|R

30|$|Maier (2015) {{discusses}} {{two main}} arguments against Schlenker’s proposal. In particular, {{with reference to}} the pronominal domain, <b>Maier</b> <b>provides</b> evidence that in FID (i) not all pronouns are evaluated relative to the context of utterance and (ii) not only pronouns are evaluated relative to the context of utterance.|$|R
5|$|Organizations {{may also}} be {{directed}} specifically at influencing persons at some stage of life. Thus, we have midwives and doctors who are legally obliged to deliver the baby; as the child grows, the school, parents, and mass media come to the fore; as they reach working age, various economic organisations pull for the agent's attention; {{the church and the}} institution of marriage impact the actor in obvious ways; and finally, the State <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> a pension to the elderly (Russell 1938:166–168).|$|E
5|$|Pharmacologically active plant {{extracts}} {{can interact}} with conventional drugs, both because they <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> an increased dose of similar compounds, and because some phytochemicals {{interfere with the}} body's systems that metabolise drugs in the liver including the cytochrome P450 system, making the drugs last longer {{in the body and}} have a more powerful cumulative effect. Plant medicines can be dangerous during pregnancy. Since plants may contain many different substances, plant extracts may have complex effects on the human body.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorylation: Ser118 of fsTnI, {{equivalent}} to Ser150 in cTnI, was reported as a phosphorylation substrate of AMPK.
