5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{the only}} Soviet factory {{suitable}} for T-26 production was the Bolshevik Factory in Leningrad, which had had experience manufacturing the MS-1 (T-18) light tanks since 1927. It was also {{planned to use}} the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which was under construction at that time. But {{the production of the}} T-26 proved to be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> than the semi-handicraft assembly of the MS-1, so the planned production of 500 T-26s in 1931 proved to be impossible. The Bolshevik Factory needed to convert all tank drawings from imperial units into metric, in order to develop a production technology, special tools, and equipment. The first 10 T-26s were assembled in July 1931 – they were identical to British Vickers 6-Ton tanks except for their armament. Soviet tanks were armed with the 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) gun in the right turret and the 7.62mm DT tank machine gun in the left turret. These T-26s from the development batch were of low quality and made from mild steel, but it was an important test of the new tank production technology.|$|E

Further more, we apply quantum physics phenomena to explore the tension time course of cardiac muscle and insect flight muscle. Most of the experimental tension transients curves found their correspondence in the theoretical output of quantum two-level and three-level model.

40|$|GOST 34. 10 is Russia's DSA. Just as it's U. S. counterpart, GOST is an ElGamal like {{signature}} scheme used in Schnorr mode. It {{is close}} to NIST DSA in many aspects. In this paper we will first overview GOST 34. 10 and discuss the three main {{differences between the two}} algorithms. ffl GOST's principal design criterion doesn't seem to be computational efficiency: The algorithm is 1. 6 times slower than the DSA and produces 512 bit signatures. This is mainly due to the usage of the modulus q which is at least 254 bit long. During verification, modular inverses are computed by exponentiation (while the Extended Euclidian algorithm is roughly 100 times faster for this parameter size) and the generation of the public parameters is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicate</b> than in the DSA.

Itsstatistical properties may pave the way of uncovering biological significances as well asevolutionary history of genetic material on molecular level. It has been shown [1, 2] that longrange correlations may contribute to delocalization of electronic wavefunctions and this inturns makes better electronic conduction when compared to non-correlated random sequences. Our group has developed a useful framework and applied to the study of 16 chromosomes inthe Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Conclusive results, which are consistent with othertheoretical predictions, have been published on Physica A in 2008 [3]. It is interesting toexplore this phenomenon in the human genome. With the understanding that human genomeis statistically <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicate</b> than Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome it is expectedthat electronic wavefunctions should be more profound in their behaviors.

40|$|Aerosol cloud {{mediated}} radiative forcing, {{commonly known}} as the aerosol indirect effect (AIE), dominates the uncertainty in our ability to quantify anthropogenic climate forcing and respectively the climate sensitivity. This uncertainty can be appreciated based on the state of our understanding as presented in this paper. Added aerosols to low clouds generally incur negative radiative forcing by three main mechanisms: redistributing the same cloud water in larger number of smaller drops, adding more cloud water, and increasing the cloud cover. Aerosols affect these components some times in harmony and most often in opposite ways that cancel each other at least partially. These processes can be highly non-linear, especially in precipitating clouds that added aerosol can inhibit from raining. It amounts to behavior of little overall sensitivity in most of the clouds, and hyper sensitivity in some of the clouds where the processes become highly non linear with positive feedbacks, causing changes of cloud regimes in some cases. This leads to very complicated and uneven AIE. Present observations assume logarithmic relation between aerosol amount and cloud response.

40|$|Abstract. This lecture {{addresses}} the different applications of polarized neutron diffraction, {{with or without}} subsequent polarization analysis, to the determination of magnetic structures, to the separation of magnetic and nuclear contributions and to magnetization distributions mapping. The first sections introduce some of the fundamental equations. Then the problems of magnetic domains, encountered in crystals and of particular importance as soon as polarized neutrons are concerned, are presented. The final sections discuss some of the different ways to use polarized neutron and are illustrated by examples. 1. PREAMBLE Neutron scattering has progressed over the last sixty years to become an invaluable tool to probe experimentally condensed matter. As far as magnetism is concerned, this technique has been recognized {{from the early days}} as unique. The most widespread use of this tool is of course the determination of magnetic structures using unpolarized beams, that is the determination of the directions in which moments point in a magnetically ordered material.

40|$|Political modernity trusted {{that it was}} {{possible}} to «program» happiness, which was regarded as the focus of politics. This project was developed in governmental, administrative and biopolitical ways. The assumption of this project was the «viability» and the odd right to the «pursuit of happiness» whose contradictions are analyzed in this issue of «Filosofia politica» (1 / 2013). The realization of this project entailed the naturalization of the human according to which the physiologic rule of the natural tendency to pleasure emerges, and wants and needs can be satisfied. By assuming that rule, it is possible to modify the pathological perversions that produced human unhappiness, and to rewrite the features of the State. Economy becomes the truth of political like, insofar as it offers strategies fit for pursuing wellbeing. The essays collected in this second issue about «happiness» (see «Filosofia politica», 3 / 2012) analyze some of the most important nodes of this political program which turned happiness into an economically governed wellbeing. Against the ethic of German idealism, the economic dimension of the positivist community, Bentham's conservative reformism, cooperative socialism, utilitarianism and wellbeing are the conceptual coordinates.

The moves incorporate rigid body transformations such as translations and rotations, as well as internal changes to the ligand’s structure including torsion angle rotations. Each of these moves in the conformation space of the ligand induces a total energetic cost of the system. Hence, the system's total energy is calculated after every move.|$|E

So the clock-synchronization by light signals could in principle be replaced by a clock-synchronization by instantaneous gravitational signals.
