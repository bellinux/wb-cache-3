5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how <b>much</b> <b>you</b> like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E

Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

Their work since this LP has included collaborations with Kim Deal and Kelley Deal, King Creosote, James Yorkston, The Mountain Goats and Sonic Boom.

[...] The annual holiday fell {{on the final day of}} school summer vacation, which made it popular among schoolchildren. It is uncertain how much Wilhelmina enjoyed the festivities; although writer Mike Peek, in a 2011 magazine article about Koninginnedag, suggests she was enthusiastic, there is a story of Wilhelmina, after a tired return from one of these birthday processions, making her doll bow until the toy's hair was dishevelled, and telling it, [...] "Now you shall sit in a carriage and bow until your back aches, and see how <b>much</b> <b>you</b> like being a Queen!" ...|$|E

Chettiar, who despaired of the film's success and thought he was [...] "doomed", refused to underwrite any more publicity: [...] "A good product needs no publicity, whereas a bad product cannot be pushed in the market however <b>much</b> <b>you</b> publicise it". During its third or fourth week of release, positive magazine reviews and word of mouth spread; Mullum Malarum became a commercial success, with a 100-day theatrical run.

500|$|Blake {{comments}} that Disraeli [...] "produced an epic poem, unbelievably bad, and a five-act blank verse tragedy, if possible worse. Further {{he wrote a}} discourse on political theory and a political biography, the Life of Lord George Bentinck, which is excellent... remarkably fair and accurate." [...] But it is on his novels that Disraeli's literary achievements are generally judged. They have from the outset divided critical opinion. The writer R. W. Stewart observed that {{there have always been}} two criteria for judging Disraeli's novels—one political and the other artistic. The critic Robert O'Kell, concurring, writes, [...] "It is after all, even if you are a Tory of the staunchest blue, impossible to make Disraeli into a first-rate novelist. And it is equally impossible, no matter how <b>much</b> <b>you</b> deplore the extravagances and improprieties of his works, to make him into an insignificant one." ...|$|E

The character was initially conceived as the sister of Sid Fairgate (Don Murray), one of the central characters on the show, who was killed off in the next season. Casting agent Barbara Miller-Gidaly introduced Mills and Jacobs. After meeting with Miller-Gidaly, Jacobs decided to have Mills test for the role, which was unusual for an established actress. She auditioned shortly after and convinced the producers that she was the right person for the part. Jacobs said, [...] "She came back that afternoon and she read and she was great, and it meant reshaping the role a little bit, but, um, not that <b>much.</b> <b>You</b> know, she still came in, she drove up in the Volvo station wagon. She had the kids in the back. It was very middle class." ...|$|E

The song is mostly set to the annual day performance by the developmentally disabled children of Tulips School. Actual students from Tulips School and Saraswati Mandir participated, and were filmed {{over a period of}} five days. The sequence originally featured numerous dance performances, but was trimmed down when test audiences found it too long. A song accompanying the scene in which Ishaan's mother is watching home videos of her son was also cut, and replaced with background music after test audiences expressed their opposition to yet another song.|$|E

He told reporters that {{he was interested in}} Bond as a human being. [...] "Bond is not just a superhero. He has flaws, he has weaknesses, he makes mistakes.... That was Fleming's genius." [...] The novel is set in 1969 when Bond is 45; Boyd intentionally picked the year, further adding that [...] "there are no gimmicks, it's a real spy story." [...] Boyd criticised how the filmmakers have portrayed Bond onscreen as a [...] "cartoon character"; he also believes that Bond should be [...] "troubled and a massive boozer."
