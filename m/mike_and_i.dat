I have traced the {{family history of}} the man who calls himself Freddy <b>Mike,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> find beyond question, and I may say even on his own admission, {{that there is not a}} shred or shadow of foundation for his story from beginning to end. He said that he had a twin brother. He had no twin brother. He said that the twin brother or a friend of the twin brother was in Eastbourne that night. There were no such people, and the whole story is an invention because, having known John Williams in the past, he did not like to think of his being hanged." ...|$|E
500|$|Armstrong's {{colleague}} on the Apollo 11 mission, Buzz Aldrin, {{said that}} he was [...] "deeply saddened by the passing. I know I am joined by millions of others in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew. I had truly hoped that on July 20th, 2019, Neil, <b>Mike</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing... Regrettably, this is not to be." [...] Apollo 11 Command Module pilot Michael Collins said, of Armstrong, [...] "He was the best, and I will miss him terribly." [...] NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said that: [...] "As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own".|$|E
500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because <b>Mike</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E

Bored with the farming lifestyle, in 1946 Blackston relocated to Los Angeles where {{he lived with his}} father, and worked for a manufacturing company. After an automobile accident in 1954 temporarily left him jobless, Blackston began avidly practicing his harp skills; recalling how he knew [...] "a guy by the name of Cleveland Weller that plays guitar and he invited me out to his house to play on a Saturday night with him. So I went out there. He gave me a <b>mike</b> <b>and</b> an amplifier <b>and</b> <b>I</b> started blowing through that <b>mike</b> <b>and</b> amplifier <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would hear all my mistakes, <b>and</b> so then <b>I</b> went down town next day bought me a amplifier <b>and</b> a <b>mike</b> <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> went <b>and</b> practised for four months".|$|R

2500|$|Regarding the {{relationship}} between Francesa and Russo, Francesa said, [...] "It was an arranged marriage and almost a quickie divorce." [...] Russo admitted that such a proposition of breaking up between the two would have been celebrated in 1992. [...] However, Russo said in an interview, [...] "I think that, in the long term, the station sees us as a tandem and {{would not want to}} break the brand up... And to tell you the truth, after almost 20 years together, <b>Mike</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him.

[...] "Seeing that all was lost, that you were down, and that further {{resistance}} was absolutely fruitless, <b>Mike</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> cut our way out; the more easily since I had struck down their leader, de Tulle, and most of his band had crowded round him. At Roanne I found your men, who had just arrived there. It matters not now why they had been detained. I got fresh horses for them and rode for Correze, placed an ambush, and turned the tables upon them. Mike shot the vicomte, and we easily defeated his followers, and rescued the baron and his daughter. I sent them to Pointdexter under charge of your intendant and followers, and rode hither, hoping against hope that I might find you still alive. Your two men, who came on here, could have told you that I had escaped." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{full title}} of the album is Bande Originale du Filme de Outre Mer. Various album reviews state the album is a soundtrack for a French film also titled Outre Mer which was never released. The liner notes include a short story by Klaus Tontine and a special thanks to Tontine Films France. When Charlie Hunter was asked in an {{interview}} with Paul Olsen if inspiration came from the film he stated:Basically, Stanton <b>and</b> <b>Mike</b> <b>and</b> Skerik <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got together <b>and</b> Stanton <b>and</b> <b>I</b> worked out a lot of grooves in the studio. That was our idea, just to put these grooves together--get “A” sections and “B” sections and just kind of build the music that way. And as far as Tontine went, I don’t really know--I’ve never met him, I don’t really have any contact with him. I was just down in New Orleans for the week that we recorded it.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{model is}} {{developed}} in the paper in which two market conditions change over time: (i) investor sentiment or price-insensitive demand; and (ii) feedback trader risk or the propensity of investors to chase trends. The model shows that these conditions partially explain the three anomalies associated with the IPO market: (i) underpricing; (ii) windows of opportunity for new issues and (iii) long-term underperformance. The model is tested using a sample of firm commitment IPOs over the 1975 - 1987 period. The paper finds that the predictions of the model are largely borne out in the data. 1 We thank Jay Ritter <b>and</b> <b>Mike</b> Vetsuypens, <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> B. E.
