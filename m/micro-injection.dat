Transformation of animal and plant cells was also investigated with the first transgenic mouse being created by injecting a gene for a rat growth hormone into a mouse embryo in 1982. In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor-inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the Ti plasmid. By removing the genes in the plasmid that caused the tumor and adding in novel genes, researchers were able to infect plants with A. tumefaciens and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants. Not all plant cells are susceptible to infection by A. tumefaciens, so other methods were developed, including electroporation and <b>micro-injection.</b> Particle bombardment was made possible with the invention of the Biolistic Particle Delivery System (gene gun) by John Sanford in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{in this thesis}} investigated the neuropharmacology of memory in the caudate nucleus, using the conditioned emotional response (CER) with visual and olfactory conditioned stimuli (CS). In experiment 1, post-training, intrastriatal microinjections of both amphetamine and LY 171555, but not SKF 38393 : (1) into the posteroventral area improved memory of a visual, but not an olfactory, CER; (2) into the ventrolateral area improved memory of an olfactory, but not a visual, CER. In experiment 2, sulpiride, but not SCH 23390, blocked the memory improving effect of amphetamine. These findings are consistant with the hypothesis that dopamine D 2 receptor stimulation mediates the memory enhancement effect of amphetamine in the neostriatum. In three experiments on a visual CER, pre-training intrastriatal <b>micro-injections</b> of scopolamine impaired acquisition; post-training <b>micro-injections</b> improved consolidation; and pre-testing <b>micro-injections</b> impaired retrieval. These findings are consistant with the hypothesis that striatal muscarinic receptor stimulation mediates some aspects of acquisition and retrieval of sensory-motor memory, and that blockade of these receptors following training {{has an effect on}} memory consolidation similar to that of D 2 -receptor stimulation. In experiment 6, destruction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons abolished the memory improving effect of intrastriatal post-training <b>micro-injections</b> of scopolamine and AFDX- 384, a specific muscarinic M 2 antagonist. These results suggest that the post-training memory improvement produced by muscarinic blockade may be mediated by an M 2 receptor, known to be located on dopaminergic nigro-striatal terminals...|$|R

Experiments designed to investigate the role of active calcium extrusion from the cells showed that extracellular lanthanum or quercetin caused a pronounced slowing of the recovery phase of the potential and conductance response to calcium injection. The metabolic uncoupler dinitrophenol also prolonged the calcium-evoked responses. The replacement of extracellular sodium by lithium or choline produced no alteration in the time course of the calcium-evoked responses, thus suggesting that sodium-calcium exchange exerts no rate control on the recovery phase of those responses...|$|R

Doses of over 25 micrograms produced a transient increase in AVP concentrations followed by a fall. Both the increase and the fall were statistically significant. Pimozide (400 micrograms/kg) blocked the fall in AVP concentrations following dopamine. A fall was still seen after the administration of haloperidol (400 micrograms/kg) but it was only significant 20 min after the injection of dopamine. The changes in AVP concentration after the administration of naloxone (400 micrograms/kg) were not statistically significant. In water-loaded rats I. C. V. <b>micro-injections</b> of dopamine produced a dose-dependent antidiuresis over the range 1 - 25 micrograms. An injection of 25 micrograms dopamine in these animals produced an increase in AVP concentrations to 1. 8 +/- 0. 51 microunits/ml and a fall in urine flow which could be approximately matched by an infusion of vasopressin of 15 microunits/min. The antidiuresis in response to dopamine could be blocked by haloperidol.

Even for {{a limited number of}} windings this geometry provides a reasonable homogeneous B1 field and a good filling factor is possible by winding the coil directly onto a holder containing the sample. Miniaturization to a scale of several hundred micrometers (µm) is not very difficult although the wire diameter (typically 20 to 50 µm) becomes very small and a freestanding coil is a very delicate object.A reduction to below 100 µm diameter is possible but the machining and handling of such coils will be rather tedious. For this reason other microsystem fabrication technology such as bulk micromachining, LIGA and <b>micro-injection</b> molding should be applied.For solenoid coils adding more turns to the coil will enhance the B1/i ratio and thus both the inductance and the signal response. At the same time the coil resistance will increase linearly, so the improvement in sensitivity will be proportional to the square root of the number of turns (n). At the same time we will have a larger ohmic heating at the center ofthe coil and an enhanced danger for arcing, so the optimum is generally found for {{only a limited number of}} turns.

BackgroundIn vivo imaging of targeted catheter-based implantation of MPC into infarcted left ventricular (LV) myocardium is unavailable. MethodsThe study was conducted in seven farm pigs (four with anterior myocardial infarction), in which autologous MPC were injected through a percutaneous catheter allowing for LV electromechanical mapping and guided <b>micro-injections</b> into normal and infarcted myocardium. Cardiac MRI was used to detect implanted MPC previously loaded with iron oxide nanoparticles. ResultsMagnetic resonance imaging data were compared with LV electromechanical mapping and cross-registered pathology. All 9 injections into normal and 12 injections into locally damaged myocardium were detected on T 2 -weighted spin echo and inversion-recovery true-fisp MRI (low signal areas) with good anatomical concordance with sites of implantation on electromechanical maps. All sites of injection were confirmed on pathology that showed in all infarct animals iron-loaded MPC at the center and periphery of the infarct as expected from MRI. ConclusionsTargeted catheter-based implantation of iron-loaded MPC into locally infarcted LV myocardium is accurate and can be reliably demonstrated in vivo by cardiac MRI. The ability to identify noninvasively intramyocardial cell implantation may be determinant for future experimental studies designed to analyze subsequent effects of such therapy on detailed segmental LV function...|$|R

Paul contributed {{equally to}} this work Ectopic {{expression}} of the ventralizing morphogen BMP- 4 (bone morphogenetic protein- 4) in the dorsal lip (Spemann organizer) of Xenopus embryos blocks transcription of dorsal-lip-specific early response genes. We investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the BMP- 4 -induced inhibition of the fork head gene XFD- 1. The promoter of this gene contains a BMP-triggered inhibitory element (BIE) which prevents activation of this gene at the ventral/vegetal side of the embryo in vivo. In the present study, we show that BMP- 4 -induced inhibition is not direct but indirect, and is mediated by Xvent homeobox proteins. <b>Micro-injections</b> of Xvent- 1 RNA and XFD- 1 promoter dele-tion mutants demonstrate that Xvent- 1 mimics the effect of BMP- 4 signalling not only by suppression of the XFD- 1 gene, but also by utilizing the BIE. Suppression could be reverted using a dominant-nega-tive Xvent- 1 mutant. The repressor domain was local-ized to the N-terminal region of the protein. Gel-shift and footprint analyses prove that Xvent- 1 binds to the BIE. Moreover, PCR-based target-site selection for the Xvent- 1 homeodomain confirms distinct motifs within the BIE as preferential binding sites. Thus, biological and molecular data suggest that Xvent- 1 acts as direct repressor for XFD- 1 transcription and mediates BMP- 4 -induced inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Lesion or {{inactivation}} of {{the superior}} colliculus (SC) of the cat results in an animal that fails to orient toward peripheral visual stimuli which normally evoke a brisk, reflexive orienting response. A failure to orient toward a visual stimulus could {{be the result of}} a sensory impairment (a failure to detect the visual stimulus) or a motor impairment (an inability to generate the orienting response). Either mechanism could explain the deficit observed during SC inactivation since neurons in the SC can carry visual sensory signals as well as motor commands involved in the generation of head and eye movements. We investigated the effects of SC inactivation in the cat in two ways. First, we tested cats in a visual detection task that required the animals to press a central, stationary foot pedal to indicate detection of a peripheral visual stimulus, presented while the animal maintained central fixation. Such a motor response does not involve any components of the orienting response and is unlikely to depend on SC motor commands. A deficit in this task would indicate that the SC {{plays an important role in}} the detection of visual targets even in a task that does not require visual orienting or any visually guided response. Second, to further investigate the visual orienting deficit observed during SC inactivation and to make direct comparisons between detection and orienting performance, we tested cats in a standard perimetry paradigm. Performance in both tasks was tested following focal inactivation of the SC with <b>micro-injections</b> of muscimol at various depths and rostral/caudal locations throughout the SC.

In the FAS population, only HA filler significantly decreased E 1 at 1 M (- 10. 9 %, p = 0. 026) and 3 M (- 10. 5 %, p = 0. 035) compared with D 0; its effect versus the control tended to be more persis-tent, with a difference between treatments at 3 M close to significance (p = 0. 063). E 2 also decreased at 1 M (- 8. 2 %, p = 0. 027 in the per protocol population, n = 53) and 3 M after HA-treatment only. Dermis thick-ness significantly increased after HA-treatment at 1 M (? 3. 4 %, p = 0. 028) and 3 M (? 4 %, p = 0. 008), and after control-treatment at 1 M only (? 2. 5 %, p = 0. 015). The HA filler significantly improved complexion radiance at 3 M compared with the control (p = 0. 012) and for 51 % of subjects, their skin status. Non-reticulated HA-based mesotherapy significantly and sustainably improves skin elasticity and complexion radiance...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{regulation}} of intracellular adhesion {{is crucial for}} the establishment of a three-dimensional organism. During morphogenesis, cells often need to detach from the site they originate in order to migrate towards another location where they contribute in the formation of various tissues and structures. The family of cadherins are the most prominent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and are mainly responsible {{for the establishment of}} homophylic adhesion junctions via their extracellular domains. Intracellularly, cadherins are linked to α- and β-catenin, through which an interaction with the actin cytoskeleton is mediated, hence providing the required strength to the junctions (Wheelock and Johnson, 2003 b). Cadherins are furthermore linked to a vast collection of interaction parners that range from proteins involved in cell adhesion to signalling molecules such as small Rho GTPases and receptors. Hence, cadherins exert influence on a whole array of processes, such as tissue morphogenesis, cell polarity, cell recognition, sorting and several others (Vleminckx and Kemler, 1999). In the present study, we investigate the interaction of N-cadherin with two newly identified partners, WAVE 1 and BMPR-IA. Since both proteins are involved in entirely different fields of cell biology, this work proves once more the versatile functional role of cadherins. WAVE 1, a member of the Wasp-Verprolin-homologous proteins, is involved in the polymerization of branched actin filaments at the tip of lamellipodia in migrating cells by binding and activating ARP 2 / 3, an actin nucleating complex (Kurisu and Takenawa, 2009). WAVE 1 was furthermore also seen to be implicated in the development of the central nervous system, as depletion of WAVE 1 resulted in aberrant axon morphology and problems with pathfinding (Dahl et al., 2003; Soderling et al., 2003; Zallen et al., 2002). BMPR-IA (ALK 3) on the other hand is one of the activin-like kinase receptors involved in BMP signalling. Upon binding of BMP proteins to a receptor complex containing BMP receptor I (BMPR-I) and II (BMPR-II), BMPR-II will phosphorylate BMPR-I, which on its turn will phosphorylate appropriate R-Smads (Smad 1, - 5 or - 8). This event enables the R-Smads to complex with Smad 4 upon which this R-Smad/Smad 4 complex enters the nucleus to activate or repress target genes depending on which nuclear cofactors are present (Chen et al., 2004). BMP signalling has been linked to various embryonic developmental processes, such as the establishment of left-right asymmetry, osteoblast differentiation, bone formation and numerous others. To unravel the biological importance of these novel interactions, we made use of cell cultures and Xenopus embryos. Xenopus is a widely used model organism in developmental biology. The exterior development of their embryos in a simple salt solution, outside the mother animal, their translucency during the early developmental stages and the fact that they are easy to manipulate (e. g. for <b>micro-injections)</b> are major advantages that contribute to their popularity in the field of developmental biology. By using depletion and overexpression studies, we showed that both novel N-cadherin interaction partners are crucial for early developmental events in Xenopus. Finally, by generating transgenic Xenopus tropicalis frogs, expressing tagged E- or N-cadherin, we want to develop a tool to purify cadherin complexes from a three-dimensional environment by tandem affinity purification. This would allow us to identify novel interaction partners of respectively E- and N-cadherin...|$|R
