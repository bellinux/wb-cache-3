5|$|Photovoltaic (PV) arrays powered Mir. The station used a 28volt DC supply which {{provided}} 5-, 10-, 20- and 50-amp taps. When {{the station was}} illuminated by sunlight, several solar arrays mounted on the pressurised modules provided power to Mirs systems and charged the nickel-cadmium storage batteries installed throughout the station. The arrays rotated in only one degree of freedom over a 180° arc, and tracked the sun using sun sensors and motors installed in the array mounts. The station itself also had to be oriented to ensure optimum illumination of the arrays. When the station's all-sky sensor detected that Mir had entered Earth's shadow, the arrays were rotated to the optimum angle predicted for reacquiring the sun once the station passed out of the shadow. The batteries, each of 60Ah capacity, were then used to power the station until the arrays recovered their <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> on the day side of Earth.|$|E
