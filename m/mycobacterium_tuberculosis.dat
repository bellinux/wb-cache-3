50|$|Many {{emerging}} {{health issues}} {{are linked to}} increasing contact between humans and animals, intensification and integration of food production, {{and the expansion of}} international travel. As the number of new infectious diseases emerged in the 20th century, scientists began to recognize the challenges societies face regarding these threats that largely come from animals. Of the 1,415 microbes that are known to infect humans, 61 percent come from animals. For example, rodents transmit plague and typhus to humans, and domestic livestock are the original source of crowd diseases such as measles, mumps, and pertussis. One important exception is <b>Mycobacteria</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Genetic evidence suggests that <b>Mycobacteria</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> originated in human populations and spread to animals. Chimpanzees were a reservoir host for the human immunodeficiency virus. Global trade of wildlife exacerbates the problem of disease emergence.|$|R

5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
5|$|Modified bases {{also occur}} in DNA. The {{first of these}} {{recognised}} was 5-methylcytosine which {{was found in the}} genome of <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> in 1925. The complete replacement of cytosine by 5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in T even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed in 1953 In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp12 and halovirus FH the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by 5-methylcytosine. 6N-methyadenine was discovered to be present in DNA in 1955. N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in 1975. 7-methylguanine was described in 1976. N4-methylcytosine in DNA was described in 1983. In 1985 5-hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of the Rhizobium phages RL38JI and N17. α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both the genomes of the Delftia phage ΦW-14 and the Bacillus phage SP10. α-glutamythymidine is found in the Bacillus phage SP01 and 5-dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the Bacillus phage SP15.|$|E
5|$|An evasion {{strategy}} used {{by several}} pathogens {{to avoid the}} innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms {{to protect themselves from}} the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).|$|E

5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAims and objectivesThis study {{evaluates the}} {{response}} of TB patients to treatment with autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccine. MethodsThere were 25 patients with MDR⧹XDR pulmonary TB included in the study. DCs were obtained both from peripheral blood monocytes and bone marrow isolated stem cells using standard protocols. DCs were primed with either autologous M. tuberculosis lysates or CFP- 10 peptides and cultured with maturation inducers. DCs were tested for immuno-phenotype, viability and sterility and injected into the patients subcutaneously three times at 2 - to 3 -week intervals. Clinical monitoring, sputum assessments, chest X-rays and immune status were performed before and 2 – 3 months after the treatment. The control group (C) consisted of 25 patients with MDR⧹XDR TB matched by sex and age. ResultsDCs obtained from all patients were sterile, viable, morphologically intact and phenotypically mature (expression of CD 83 and CD 86 being > 80 %). The number of injected DCs averaged 10. 2 (range: 8. 3 – 15. 6) × 106. Treatment of TB patients with autologous DCs was safe and well tolerated. No significant side effects which required medical aid were noted during the study. The combination of standard treatment and DC-vaccination promoted the decrease or complete clearance of <b>mycobacteria</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> from the sputum (DC-treated patients – 69. 23 ± 12. 8 % versus 30. 76 ± 12. 8 % in C, p< 0. 05) and X-ray improvement (69. 23 ± 12. 8 % versus 30. 76 ± 12. 8 % in C, p< 0. 05). Treatment with DCs was also associated with the significant increase of antigen-specific T-cells in the blood, which reflects the accumulation of antigen-specific T-cells in peripheral blood and indicates the restoration of immune response against <b>mycobacteria</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> ConclusionsDC-based treatment may become an effective valuable method of cellular immunotherapy for MDR- and XDR-TB patients...|$|R
