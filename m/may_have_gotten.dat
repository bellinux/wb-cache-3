5|$|On March 13, during Victoria's Women's Championship match, Wilson {{ran down}} and gave Victoria a facebuster costing her the victory. Later in the broadcast, it had {{appeared}} that Candice Michelle and Victoria <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> their revenge as Trish Stratus found an unconscious Wilson {{laid out in}} the Divas' Locker room with Candice's Playboy magazine lying across Wilson. At WrestleMania 22, Wilson gained revenge by defeating the evil Candice Michelle in a Playboy Pillow Fight match. On the June 12 episode of Raw, Wilson defeated Candice Michelle in the first ever Wet and Wild match, a wrestling match involving water balloons and squirt guns, in which the winner of the match would be {{on the cover of the}} WWE 2006 Summer Special magazine. After the match, the feuds and alliances between the women ended, and they continued to appear together in television segments with no mention of their time as former allies and enemies. On the July 17 episode of Raw, Candice was the Special Guest Referee during a tag team match of Stratus and Wilson against Victoria and Mickie. James entered the match without being tagged in, so Candice threw her out of the ring. Afterwards, Victoria tried to clothesline Candice, but she ducked out of the way, allowing Stratus to perform a Stratusfaction for the victory. As a result of her participation in the match, Candice became a face. Their allies between Candice and Victoria came to an end.|$|E

By most accounts, the wholesome, down-to-earth Mary Ann has consistently outpolled the glamorous bombshell movie-star Ginger by a sizable margin. Bob Denver admitted he was a Mary Ann fan. According to Bob Denver in a 2001 interview, Wells received 3,000–5,000 fan letters weekly, whereas Louise <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> 1,500 or 2,000.|$|E

25|$|Arthāpatti (अर्थापत्ति), postulation, {{derivation}} from circumstances. In contemporary logic, this pramana {{is similar}} to circumstantial implication. As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, {{and the time is}} now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this Pramana as invalid or at best weak, because the boat <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> delayed or diverted. However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable.|$|E
25|$|In 1587, Ferdinando de' Medici succeeded {{his brother}} as Grand Duke of Tuscany, and in 1588 he brought Cavalieri to Florence as an {{overseer}} of artists, craftsmen and musicians. Cavalieri was {{master of ceremonies}} for the extremely opulent intermedi that the Medici family required for events such as weddings. Count Giovanni de' Bardi, the founder and patron of the Florentine Camerata, also collaborated on these productions. In May 1589, the festivities for the marriage of Grand Duke Ferdinando to Christina of Lorraine included a performance of Girolamo Bargagli's La pellegrina, with six especially elaborate intermedi. The 1st number of the final intermedio (6) was initially a piece by Bardi but was replaced in the actual intermedio by Cavalieri's virtuosic number based on the Aria del Gran Duca which became popular all over Europe and occurs in many arrangements and variations such as that made by Peter Philips in Antwerp. Cavalieri <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> some of his ideas for monody directly from Bardi, since Cavalieri was {{not a member of}} the Camerata during its period of activity a few years earlier. He may have developed his rivalry with Giulio Caccini, another extremely important and influential early monodist during this period.|$|E

However, the shark's vertebrae <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> much bigger, and scrutiny of the specimen revealed {{that it had a}} higher vertebral count than specimens of any known shark, possibly over 200 centra; only the great white approached it.

500|$|The star which {{prompted}} Poe to write [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] {{was believed to}} foretell disaster or that humanity would be punished for breaking God's laws. Poe <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> the idea to base a poem on Brahe's astronomical discovery from poet John Keats's use of the 1781 discovery of the planet Uranus in a poem called [...] "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer" [...] (1816). The name of the star has been changed from [...] "Al Orf" [...] to [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] to become similar to the word arafa, which means distinguishing between things. Additionally, Poe was indebted to Irish poet Thomas Moore, whose poem Lalla-Rookh inspired, among other parts of [...] "Al Aaraaf", the catalogue of flowers near the beginning. Another work by Moore, The Loves of the Angels, inspired Poe's idea of uniting mortal and immortal love.|$|E
500|$|Following the Dissolution, {{during a}} period in which {{religion}} was rapidly changing in England, Bourchier managed to adapt his beliefs to stay within the hierarchy in the church: twice becoming a candidate for a bishopric, before servings as rector of Church Langton, from 1554. This benefice may have represented his true religious sympathies as the rectory was under the patronage of [...] "zealous Catholic" [...] Edward Griffin of Dingley Hall; although it also had financial incentive with a [...] "wage" [...] (income) of £60 a year: the highest in Leicestershire. Henry VIII had personally considered Bourchier for the position of Bishop of the King's proposed new bishopric of Shrewsbury but the king then decided against the bishopric's creation. In 1554 Bourchier was in touching distance of becoming a Bishop when he was suggested by Edward Griffin as a candidate for the Bishopric of Gloucester. Bourchier was even granted the income of the Bishopric in preparation for being formally appointed by Queen Mary. Mary, however, died, and Bourchier was never appointed. Mary was Catholic, where as her sister and successor, Queen Elizabeth was Protestant; Elizabeth therefore refused to appoint Mary's favoured candidates for the 5 vacant bishoprics Mary had left. Bourchier <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> off lightly as two other candidates were arrested.|$|E

2500|$|Carnufex (meaning [...] "butcher") is an extinct genus of crocodylomorph suchian {{from the}} Late Triassic of North America. The genus was first {{described}} in 2015 by Zanno et al., who named the binomial Carnufex carolinensis, meaning [...] "Carolina butcher". Two specimens are known, the holotype skull and skeleton NCSM 21558, and the referred humerus NCSM 21623. The specimens {{are from the}} Carnian-age Pekin Formation, which dates to 231 million years ago.

Foote <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> the idea for his device from an 1838 German treatise on cervical caps, or from acquaintance with the German tradition of midwifery that had been brought to the United States. Although he mentions his intention to obtain a patent, none is recorded.|$|E

2500|$|Poe <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> {{the last}} name [...] "Dupin" [...] from a {{character}} in a series of stories first published Burton's Gentleman's Magazine in 1828 called [...] "Unpublished passages in the Life of Vidocq, the French Minister of Police". The name also implies [...] "" [...] or deception, a skill Dupin shows off in [...] "The Purloined Letter." [...] Detective fiction, however, had no real precedent and the word detective had not yet been coined when Poe first introduced Dupin. The closest example in fiction is Voltaire's Zadig (1748), in which the main character performs similar feats of analysis, themselves borrowed from The Three Princes of Serendip, an Italian rendition of Amir Khusrau's Hasht Bihisht.|$|E

[...] In other words, Dean <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> some details wrong, who said what at what time, but he did get the big picture of all the conversations combined right. [...] "Nixon wanted the cover-up to succeed; he was pleased when it went well; he was troubled when it began to unravel; he was perfectly willing to consider illegal activities if they would extend his power or confound his enemies."

2500|$|Passereau's chansons {{are mostly}} light-hearted affairs, similar in content to the Italian frottola, {{although}} no direct influence {{from the earlier}} popular Italian form has been reliably demonstrated. [...] He liked to use nonsense syllables, often in imitation of animals, as in Il est bel et bon, his most popular piece, which imitates the clucking of chickens. [...] This composition was sung {{as far away as}} Venice. [...] While Passereau <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> the idea from Janequin, who was writing onomatopoeic chansons as early as 1515 (Il est bel et bon was published in 1534), its popularity rivaled that of the music of Janequin, and printer Pierre Attaingnant devoted a book entirely to the music of the two composers (in 1536). [...] It is possible that Francis I, who knew Passereau from his service at the French court, recommended the composer to the printer.|$|E

2500|$|Ginsberg used Solomon as {{an example}} of all those ground down by the machine of [...] "Moloch". Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a Levantine god to whom {{children}} were sacrificed. Ginsberg <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> the name from the Kenneth Rexroth poem [...] "Thou Shalt Not Kill", a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg's heroes, Dylan Thomas. Moloch is mentioned a few times in the Torah and references to Ginsberg's Jewish background are frequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by peyote visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it {{as a symbol of the}} city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of Fritz Lang's film Metropolis (1927) and of the woodcut novels of Lynd Ward. Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of post–World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms.|$|E
2500|$|David Brauer of MinnPost {{said that}} some Hmong liked Gran Torino and that many {{believed}} that the film was offensive.

Vang added that he engaged in [...] "explaining my obligation as an actor while also recognizing that, as a Hmong-American, I didn't feel that I could own the lines I was uttering." [...] Brauer said that in an opinion editorial released in 2011, Vang [...] "isn't kind to the Clint Eastwood film". Krissy Reyes-Ortiz of The Bottom Line of the University of California Santa Barbara said, based on Vang's testimony in a 2011 program, that [...] "Though {{many of the people}} who have seen the film <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> a sense of satisfaction and joy from seeing that Walt overcame his racism, the people who acted as the Hmong members in the movie did not" [...] and that [...] "They were offended by the traces of racism that were included in the movie and that they experienced themselves on set".

2500|$|Kris Graft for Gamasutra {{commented that}} many players and journalists had both high {{expectations}} for the game as well as wide expectations, with some believing that it would be, among other aspects, the [...] "best space sim", the [...] "best multiplayer action shooter", and the [...] "best pure exploration game". Ars Technicas Kyle Orland found that unlike Spore or Fable which had [...] "saturation PR campaigns that promised revolutionary and industry-changing gameplay features" [...] which failed {{to be present in}} the final releases, Hello Games' statements about No Man's Sky were [...] "relatively restrained and realistic about what they were promising". Orland surmises that many players and journalists [...] "layer their own expectations onto the game's gaps" [...] from what Hello Games actually claimed. Vlambeer's founder Rami Ismail considered the strength of the marketing campaign by Hello Games and Sony to generate interest in the game, calling the pitch using the concept of magnitudes and scale rather than absolutes as [...] "a little masterclass in explaining an abstract concept to the largest possible audience"; Polygons Ben Kuchera agreed on this point, but considered that the marketing <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> away from Sony and Hello Games since players did not have a concrete understanding of the game's limitations prior to launch. Murray himself was aware of the [...] "unrealistic, intangible level of excitement" [...] that fans had of the game and given that they had been waiting three years to play it, would be expecting it to be perfect. He countered that he felt he and Hello Games tried to be [...] "reasonably open and honest about what the game is" [...] all throughout the marketing cycle to set expectations. On the day before the official release, Murray cautioned players that No Man's Sky may not have been [...] "the game you imagined from those trailers" [...] and instead that the title was meant as a [...] "very very chill game", giving players a universe-sized sandbox that makes {{you feel as if you}} [...] "stepped into a sci-fi book cover"; Murray believed the game would have a [...] "super divisive" [...] response from players due to some of these expectations.|$|E
