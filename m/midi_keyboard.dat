5|$|The Nord Stage is multitimbral – {{each of the}} Piano, Organ, and Synth {{sections}} {{can sound}} independently. There are two Panels – A and B – each of which provides a separate configuration of the three sections within a single Program. Panels can be played independently, {{with one of the}} panels being controlled via an external <b>MIDI</b> <b>keyboard</b> controller, or they can be layered together, allowing for a maximum of 6 part multitimbral. Most of the buttons and knobs on the Stage, such as volume, instrument selection, drawbar levels (for organ) or filter controls (for synthesizer) can also be adjusted by the external keyboard.|$|E
25|$|A {{synthesizer}} (often abbreviated as synth, also spelled synthesiser) is {{an electronic}} musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate traditional musical instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate novel electronic timbres. They are often {{played with a}} musical keyboard, {{but they can be}} controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled via USB, MIDI or CV/gate using a controller device, often a <b>MIDI</b> <b>keyboard</b> or other controller.|$|E
500|$|Whyte {{stated that}} he began working on the album in [...] "2008 maybe" [...] and worked {{on it for a}} two-year period. Glass Swords was {{recorded}} in Whyte's father's house in Glasgow and in his home in London after Whyte had moved there. The album's music was developed with Whyte not having a strong idea for it, noting that he was [...] "just making tracks and not really thinking too much of it as being an album". The album was created using Ableton on a personal computer along with a midi guitar controller, a <b>midi</b> <b>keyboard,</b> keyboard, electric guitar and a microphone. To give the album an analogue sound, Whyte used compressors and tape distortion plugins to get the tracks what he described as a [...] "sort of warmth". Vocals on the album were done by Whyte on the track [...] "Surph" [...] while his girlfriend Nightwave performed some of the backing vocals. Whyte described his music as trying to channel [...] "good energy, just love and peace and happiness and joy. That's what I want from my music, and that's what I want other people to feel." ...|$|E

2500|$|Matt's vocals were {{recorded}} using a Brent Averill 1073, JDK R24 EQ, and a Shure SMB7 microphone. Vocal tracks were compressed {{three or four}} times, and filtering techniques with blankets and a sE Electronics Reflexion filter were used to cut out background noises of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway. The drums {{were recorded}} at the studio Rubber Tracks, with Aaron Bastinelli engineering, while the synths were performed and programmed through a <b>MIDI</b> <b>keyboard</b> in Logic. Other assistance in making Lightning included Lar Stalfors mixing [...] "Tonight". The tracks were summed using a Dangerous Music D-Box.|$|E
2500|$|The Score Editor is a piano roll style {{editor to}} input notes, lyrics, and some expressions. When {{entering}} lyrics, the editor automatically converts them into Vocaloid phonetic symbols using the built-in pronunciation dictionary. The user can directly edit the phonetic symbols of unregistered words. The Score Editor offers various parameters to add expressions to singing voices. The user {{is supposed to}} optimize these parameters that best fit the synthesized tune when creating voices. This editor supports ReWire and can be synchronized with DAW. Real-time [...] "playback" [...] of songs with predefined lyrics using a <b>MIDI</b> <b>keyboard</b> is also supported.|$|E
2500|$|The Yamaha DX7, {{the most}} well known synth of the 1980s, used entirely digital {{circuitry}} leaving it {{free from the}} need of calibration, and vast numbers of parameters that could be accessed. [...] The [...] "FM" [...] (frequency modulation) synthesis method was something {{that had not been}} explored to near this depth. [...] Most synthesizers before this were subtractive. [...] i.e. You start with a very harmonic-laden sound and you selectively subtract from them using low, high or bandpass filters, or some other methods that tended to result in stranger sounds like ring modulation. Also in 1983 Dave Smith's company SCI marketed the first polyphonic synthesizer keyboard that could play more than one sound at a time called the 'Six-Trak'. [...] It had a six track sequencer and each track could access a different sound. [...] The same year the SCI Prophet T8 with optical key sensing became the first piano action emulating <b>midi</b> <b>keyboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>MIDI</b> <b>keyboards</b> are a {{very common}} feature of a {{recording}} studio, and any DAW setup. Most include a transpose function {{and the ability to}} set different octaves. Many <b>MIDI</b> <b>keyboards</b> have pitch bend and modulation wheels. Some also have extra sets of assignable rotary knobs and/or buttons for sending custom MIDI messages to the synthesiser, sampler or DAW software. Devices with extra features (also including rhythm input, instrument selection, transport control) are sometimes called keyboard controllers.|$|R

2500|$|During 2012, Davis {{released}} two {{albums and}} an assortment of singles. The first album is called Gaming Fantasy, and it features tunes from various video games arranged for violin. Six months later An Enchanted Christmas was released (as the name suggests, this album contains a collection of warm re-arrangements of several Christmas songs). In January 2013, Davis published her third album called Game On: 2 Player mode. It has been co-produced and arranged along with Australian pianist Lara de Wit. With the help of a <b>MIDI</b> <b>keyboard</b> and the DAW [...] "Logic Pro", Davis created all of the orchestral backtracks for these works. Legendary Movie Music, the fourth album, was released in July 2013. [...] Davis released two more albums: Melodies of Hyrule: Songs from [...] "The Legend of Zelda" [...] in November 2013 and The Anime and Game Collection in July 2014. Three months later, in October, Davis launched a crowdfunding campaign for the creation of her seventh album, the first one made up exclusively of original music. The platform chosen for this project was PledgeMusic. The campaign achieved its goal in around a week, and the new album, entitled Taylor Davis, was released in March 2015 and debuted at #10 on the Billboard Classical Charts.|$|E
