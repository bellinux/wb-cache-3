5|$|Juvenile robins {{and eggs}} are preyed upon by squirrels, snakes, and some birds, such as blue jays, Steller's jay, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. Adults are {{primarily}} taken by Accipiter hawks, cats, dogs, and larger snakes (especially rat snakes). They {{may be taken}} by nearly every variety of North American accipitrid, from the smallest, the sharp-shinned hawk, {{to one of the}} two largest, the golden eagle, <b>most</b> <b>every</b> North American falcon from the smallest, the American kestrel, to the largest, the gyrfalcon, and almost all owl species from northern pygmy owls to snowy owls. Overall, 28 raptorial bird species are known to hunt robins. Adult robins are most vulnerable when distracted by breeding activities though may also be attacked on the ground or even in flight. However, when feeding in flocks, the American robin is able to remain vigilant and watch other flock members for reactions to predators.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the divorce}} {{from his first}} wife in 1926, Sir James Dunn married Irene Clarice Richards, the former wife of Francis Archibald Kelhead Douglas, 11th Marquess of Queensberry. The 1928 death of his {{daughter}} Mona Dunn {{from his first marriage}} sent him into a state of depression and for a time he thought about cutting back on his business activities and returning home to his native New Brunswick. However, in 1929, his new wife gave birth to a daughter, Anne, who lifted his spirits a great deal. Anne Dunn grew up to be an artist, studying under Henry Moore and in Paris, France with Fernand Léger and at the Académie Julian. Nevertheless, Dunn and his second wife divorced in 1942 following which he married his long-time personal secretary, Marcia Anastasia Christoforides. Thirty-six years his junior, “Christofor” as she was nicknamed, was very bright, intensely loyal, and a devoted partner. James Dunn would seek her input on <b>most</b> <b>every</b> business matter {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

25|$|Averaging {{more than}} 30 {{points per game}} every season, Galis was the indisputable leader of Aris. Playing {{alongside}} other great players at Aris such as Panagiotis Giannakis and Slobodan Subotić (who was known in Greece as Lefteris Soumpotits), Galis won 8 Greek League championships (7 of them consecutively, and 3 undefeated, in the years 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991), 6 Greek Cups (4 of them consecutively, in the years 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992), and led Aris to 3 consecutive appearances at the FIBA European Champions' Cup Final Four ('88, '89, and '90). In the one disappointment of an otherwise glittering career with Aris, all three FIBAEuropean Champions' Cup appearances ended in defeat in the semifinals, thus depriving Galis {{of the opportunity to}} shine all the way on Europe's biggest club, stage at the FIBA European Champions' Cup Finals. The team's performances and general standard of play, however, won the heart of <b>most</b> <b>every</b> basketball fan in Greece. Indeed, cinemas and theaters would often reduce their admission prices on Thursday evenings, when Aris was playing, and the entire country settled down to watch them on television.|$|E
25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in <b>most</b> <b>every</b> fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a single length of monofilament nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament butt length or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.|$|E
500|$|In Paris's Roman era, {{its main}} {{cemetery}} was located to {{the outskirts of}} the Left Bank settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholicism, where <b>most</b> <b>every</b> inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, les Innocents, were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris's parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris's stone mines outside the [...] "Porte d'Enfer" [...] city gate, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement. The process of moving bones from Cimetière des Innocents to the catacombs took place between 1786 and 1814; part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs.|$|E

500|$|She next {{starred in}} the musical {{adaptation}} of Neil Simon's The Goodbye Girl with music by Marvin Hamlisch (1993). Peters won her second Tony for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as Annie Oakley in the 1999 Broadway revival of Annie Get Your Gun. Among many glowing notices, critic Lloyd Rose of the Washington Post commented: [...] " [...] banishes all thoughts of Ethel Merman about two bars into her first number, 'Doin' What Comes Natur'lly.' Partly this is because Merman's Annie was a hearty, boisterous gal, while Peters plays an adorable, slightly goofy gamine. ... For anyone {{who cares about the}} American musical theater, the chance to see Peters in this role is reason enough to see the show." [...] Playbill went even further: [...] "Arguably the most talented comedienne in the musical theatre today, Peters manages to extract a laugh from <b>most</b> <b>every</b> line she delivers." ...|$|E
500|$|Gestation lasts 15 to 16 months. The {{first three}} to four months are spent with the blastula in {{suspended}} development before it implants itself in the uterus. This strategy of delayed implantation, common among pinnipeds, presumably evolved to optimize both the mating season and the birthing season, determined by ecological conditions that promote newborn survival. Calves are born during the spring migration, from April to June. They weigh [...] at birth and are able to swim. The mothers nurse for over a year before weaning, but the young can spend up to five years with the mothers. Walrus milk contains higher amounts of fats and protein compared to land animals but lower compared to phocid seals. This lower fat content in turn causes a slower growth rate among calves and a longer nursing investment for their mothers. Because ovulation is suppressed until the calf is weaned, females give birth at <b>most</b> <b>every</b> two years, leaving the walrus with the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped.|$|E
500|$|American {{popular music}} has become {{extremely}} popular internationally. Rock, hip hop, jazz, country and other styles have fans across the globe. The combination {{of parts of}} international and American popular music has been attempted between the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. However, the results of synthesis were {{for the most part}} unsuccessful. BBC Radio DJ Andy Kershaw, for example, has noted that country music is popular across virtually the entire world. Indeed, out of [...] "all the contributions made by Americans to world culture ... (American popular music) has been taken (most) to heart by the entire world". Other styles of American popular music have also had a formative effect internationally, including funk, the basis for West African Afrobeat, R, a major source for Jamaican reggae, and rock, which has profoundly influenced <b>most</b> <b>every</b> genre of popular music worldwide.
