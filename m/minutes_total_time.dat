40|$|Background An {{automated}} {{technique for}} recording eating and rumination behaviour was evaluated in ten lactating Brown Swiss cows by comparing {{data obtained from}} a pressure sensor with data obtained via direct observation over a 24 -hour period. The recording device involved a pressure sensor integrated in the noseband of a halter. The analysed variables included number and duration of individual rumination, eating and resting phases, total daily length of these phases and number of cuds chewed per day. Results Eating and rumination phases were readily differentiated based on characteristic pressure profiles. Chewing movements during rumination were regular and generated regular waveforms with uniform amplitudes, whereas eating generated irregular waveforms with variable amplitudes. There was complete or almost complete agreement and {{no significant differences between}} data obtained via direct observation and pressure sensor technique. Both methods yielded an average of 16 daily eating phases with a mean duration of 28. 3 <b>minutes.</b> <b>Total</b> <b>time</b> spent eating was 445. 0 minutes for direct observation and 445. 4 minutes for the pressure sensor technique. Both techniques recorded an average of 13. 3 rumination phases with a mean duration of 30. 3 (direct observation) and of 30. 2 (pressure sensor) <b>minutes.</b> <b>Total</b> <b>time</b> spent ruminating per day, number of cuds per day and chewing cycles per cud were 389. 3 and 388. 3 minutes, 410. 1 and 410. 0 and 60. 0 and 60. 3 for direct observation and pressure sensor technique, respectively. There was {{a significant difference between the}} two methods with respect to mean number of chewing cycles per day (24 ′ 669, direct observation vs. 24 ′ 751, pressure sensor, P[*]<[*] 0. 05, paired t-test). There were strong correlations between the two recording methods with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 98 to 1. 00. Conclusions The results confirmed that measurements of eating and rumination variables obtained via the pressure sensor technique are in excellent agreement with data obtained via direct observation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel micro-device for blood separation and assay. The blood plasma is separated by small capillary channels and mixed with reagents through chaotic advection. Our device is small (3 cm by 3 cm), allows for fast separation and mixing (< 2 <b>minutes</b> <b>total</b> <b>time),</b> works with small quantities of fluid (about 1 drop or 30 µL) reliably separates 3 micron beads (roughly {{the size of}} red blood cells, RBC), and allows for four simultaneous optical {{tests to be performed}} on the blood plasma. The device meets needs for a hand-held point-of-care blood separation and diagnostic device to screen for diseases and assess the health of patients. Many different techniques have been reported for plasma separation from blood cells and cellular components including magnetophoresis [1], electrophoresis [2], microchannel bends [3], and ultrasound standing waves [4, 5]. The most standard technologies for removal of blood components are centrifiguation and membrane filtration [6]. Passive micromixers have also been developed which utilize channel geometry to increase the length over which diffusion occurs and configurations such as distributive mixers [7, 8, 9], a static mixer [10, 11], a T-type mixer [12], and a serpentine microchannel [13] have been demonstrated. Our work {{presents a}} unique integrated device where blood is deposited in a center well (Figure 1). Capillary action draws the blood up four separate arms (Figure 2) where small capillaries with inlets smaller than the RBC diameter suck up plasma into plasma wells. The RBCs move past the capillary channels with some aggregating near the capillary inlets and collect in the RBC wells. Th...|$|E

This study evaluated the effectiveness of computer assisted instruction (CAI) in radiographic anatomy of the equine distal forelimb and also investigated the roles played by amount of tutorial use and achievement level of the user. The participants were 35 (12 male, 23 female) first year veterinary students (labeled "users"). The comparison group were nonusers that were matched with users based on gender and overall achievement in their anatomy class. A database recorded time of tutorial use. Both users and nonusers took a test containing 7 questions relevant to radiographic anatomy. Users gave more correct responses than nonusers on 4 questions. A chi-square analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference on 2 questions ([p]< 0. 5). Users obtained a higher mean intervention content score (IC score) with a smaller standard deviation and fewer low scores than nonusers. A [t] test did not reveal a statistically significant difference ([p] = 0. 056). The effect size was 0. 34. Users who used the tutorial for low ([] 16 minutes), medium (17 - 30 minutes), and high ([] 31 <b>minutes)</b> <b>total</b> <b>time</b> had higher mean IC scores, smaller standard deviations, and fewer low scores than nonusers. The low time group had a small effect size (d = 0. 17), whereas the medium and high time groups had a small to medium effect sizes (d = 0. 39; d = 0. 43). A Pearson correlation coefficient (r = 0. 066) did not show a correlation between time and IC score. Users of all achievement levels had higher mean IC scores, smaller standard deviations, and fewer low scores than nonusers. The effect size was medium to large (d = 0. 61) for low-ranking students, 0. 15 for average-ranking students, and 0. 30 for high-ranking students. Analysis of variance did not yield statistically significant differences in IC scores for different time levels or achievement levels. The power to detect a difference was low due to small subsample sizes. The tutorial is likely to benefit students, especially low-ranking students, learning radiographic anatomy if used for a sufficient amount of time. Use of the tutorial is likely to decrease the incidence of poor performance in radiographic anatomy...|$|E

30|$|The mean <b>total</b> <b>time</b> used by Group A {{was almost}} equal that in Group B; 47.3 versus 47.8 <b>minutes.</b> The <b>total</b> <b>time</b> taken across all tasks is not {{statistically}} significant (P= 0.932 > 0.05). Therefore, we can accept the null hypothesis that “the mean time taken to complete our experimental tasks using a textual security incident report and a textual report with a graphical overview are not significantly different”. Hypothesis H 3 is not supported. One interpretation of these results is that significant time is required to understand security incidents, irrespective of whether they are presented in graphical or textual format.
