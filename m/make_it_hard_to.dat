Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which {{is known for its}} flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.|$|E

The Republican National Committee, worried that the suit would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> recruit good candidates, urged Rove to back off. When Rove refused, the RNC hired Kenneth Starr to write an amicus brief on Thornburgh's behalf. After a trial in Austin, Rove prevailed. Karl Rove & Co. v.

25|$|The fourth Test, {{in front}} of Hutton's home crowd, was Hutton's least {{successful}} of the series. Having been put into bat by Hassett, the first time an Australian captain had fielded first against England since 1909, Hutton was bowled second ball by a Yorker from Lindwall. England never recovered, batting very slowly to score 167 and after the first innings, Australia led by 99 with three days left. Hutton scored only 25 in the second innings but England batted for a long time, assisted by rain, leaving Australia 177 in 115 minutes to win the game. The tourists were winning easily when Hutton asked Bailey to use the negative tactic of leg theory, bowling wide of leg stump to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> score runs, while using a long run-up to waste time. Only twelve overs were bowled in the last 45 minutes, then considered slow, Australia lost a wicket and the tactics resulted in Australia being 30 short of their target when the game ended. Wisden noted that only a defensive policy had prevented England losing. Hutton was criticised for negativity by the Australian press, but Bill Bowes wrote that {{the gravity of the}} situation justified Hutton's tactics.|$|E

The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "In True Detective, performances by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey reel the viewer in, while the style, vision and direction <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> turn away." [...] On Metacritic, season one scored an 87 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating [...] "universal acclaim".|$|E

[...] By the time it arrived, the reactors at Hanford produced plutonium in quantity, and Oppenheimer was confident that there would be enough for a second test.

500|$|The ported {{version of}} the game {{available}} in Sonic Gems Collection was more negatively reviewed. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell called the game [...] "too awkward to play {{for any length of}} time", 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated [...] "The grainy visuals <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> tell where you're going, and the frustrating controls make it difficult to get there," [...] GameSpot's Ryan Davis described [...] "its laughably bad soundtrack" [...] as [...] "the game's only redeeming quality", and GameSpy's Phil Theobald called Sonic R [...] "a concept that works better in theory than in practice"—despite its [...] "fantastic (if not bizarre) soundtrack". In a 2003 retrospective, Game Informer described the game as [...] "decent, but unmemorable", while GamesRadar included Sonic R in a 2014 list of the top 50 Sega Saturn games, calling it [...] "a technical tour de force". GameTrailers ranked it as the second worst Sonic game, behind 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog. Game designer Hirokazu Yasuhara, who helped Traveller's Tales rework the game in response to concerns over the quality of a preview version, has maintained that [...] "the final version of Sonic R is actually quite good... However, I do admit that the base concept of Sonic R, in which a player 'drives' running characters, is not great".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in the United States on July 25, 2008. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carter said that if I Want to Believe proved successful, he would propose a third movie that {{would return to the}} television series' mythology and focus on the alien invasion foretold within the series, due to occur in December 2012. The film grossed $4 million on its opening day in the United States. It opened fourth on the U.S. weekend box office chart, with a gross of $10.2 million. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed $20,982,478 domestically and an additional $47,373,805 internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $68,369,434. Among 2008 domestic releases, it finished in 114th place. The film's stars both claimed that the timing of the movie's release, a week after the highly popular Batman film The Dark Knight, negatively affected its success. The film received mixed to negative reviews. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream film critics, reported [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews, with an average score of 47 based on 33 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 32% of 160 listed film critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.9 out of 10. The website wrote of the critics' consensus stating; [...] "The chemistry between leads David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson do live up to The X-Files televised legacy, but the roving plot and droning routines <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> identify just what we're meant to believe in." ...|$|E

[...] "Starships", the first number, was also the more praised of the two: Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that it [...] "stole the show" [...] for him, and was the best musical number of the night. Flandez called it [...] "an electric and sassy delivery" [...] by Unique, and Strecker asked [...] "is there anything she can't do" [...] before she gave the performance an [...] "A−". Futterman thought it felt [...] "more subdued than the warp-speed of Minaj's hit" [...] though she added that the [...] "stage acrobatics trump everything anyone else does", and Saskin said it [...] "was fun to watch, but the vocals don't add much to the original version". Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] grade and praised the [...] "dazzling" [...] choreography of both numbers. [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] was called [...] "turbo-charged from beginning to end" [...] by Flandez, and both Strecker and Slezak gave the song a [...] "B+" [...] grade; the former's enthusiasm was tempered by the arrangement, which was not very [...] "different from just karaoke of the original", and the dancing on the pinball machines as [...] "a bit much for my taste". Futterman said that Unique [...] "riffs the hell out the song", but added that [...] "the robot dancers of Vocal Adrenaline <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> glean any personality from the performance".
