6000|$|The leech {{gave him}} a draught of <b>medicated</b> <b>wine,</b> mixed with water. He {{rejected}} it, under the dishonourable epithet of [...] "kennel washings," [...] and again uttered the words, [...] "Wine--wine." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1880 the Colombo Ice Company {{acquired}} {{the business and}} goodwill of J. Maitland, who owned a medical hall which sold a variety of <b>medicated</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1927, the Abbey {{lost its}} licence to sell wine. As a result, the Abbot allowed wine merchants to {{distribute}} {{on behalf of}} the Abbey. At the same time, the recipe was changed to be less of a patent medicine and more of a <b>medicated</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The use of fermentation, {{particularly}} for beverages, has existed since the Neolithic {{and has been}} documented dating from 7000-6600 BCE in Jiahu, China, 5000 BCE in India, Ayurveda mentions many <b>Medicated</b> <b>Wines,</b> 6000 BCE in Georgia, 3150 BCE in ancient Egypt, 3000 BCE in Babylon, 2000 BCE in pre-Hispanic Mexico, and 1500 BC in Sudan. Fermented foods have a religious significance in Judaism and Christianity. The Baltic god Rugutis was worshiped as the agent of fermentation.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{medicine}} was of great importance, seeing {{as they could}} not synthetically manufacture anything. Many traces of herbs at ancient Roman army bases have been found, as well as <b>medicated</b> <b>wine.</b> Army doctors had knowledge of the herbs, and perhaps even grew their own in their respective gardens. The Romans were not correct {{with all of the}} herbs uses, but a placebo effect possibly still made some of the herbs useful.|$|E
50|$|On the battlefield, medics and orderlies {{would be}} on hand behind the lines to treat injured {{soldiers}} on the spot. Using {{a wide range of}} sophisticated surgical instruments, medics would promptly remove extraneous bodies such as arrow- and spear-heads, clean and disinfect wounds using clean water and <b>medicated</b> <b>wine</b> or beer and stitch them. Orderlies would then bandage them. Speed in cleaning, closing and bandaging the wound was critical, as, in a world without antibiotics, infection was the gravest danger faced by injured troops, and would often result in a slow, agonising death.|$|E
40|$|Asavarishta is a {{very popular}} dosage form in ayurvedic medicines. It is a unique liquid dosage form that {{contains}} self generated alcohol, often referred as <b>medicated</b> <b>wine.</b> This self generated alcohol is produced by method of fermentation. Asavarishtas are manufactured by industries in batch size of thousand liters. Larger batch sizes of process specific products for high technology are the need of the time. The large scale industrial fermentation must produce high yields of product at least possible expenses and the recovery of product must be more. Thus the research is required to adapt the fermentation to existing types of fermentation equipment and to increase the yield of product. As self generated alcohol content should not exceed 11 % v/v the fermentation process should be at a controlled rate and should be monitored precisely. Many times contamination by microorganisms during process of fermentation takes place if proper care is not taken during fermentation which is hazardous to product. Incubation time required for fermentation depends on temperature of environment...|$|E
40|$|Wu-Chia-Pi <b>medicated</b> <b>wine,</b> {{composed}} nine Chinese medicines {{soaked in}} 35 % alcohol, {{is widely used}} in Asia for its health-promoting functions. However, long-term consumption of alcohol could result in liver dysfunction. In this study, Wu-Chia-Pi solution (WCPS) and extract (WCPE) were prepared by modification of the principals given by the Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy in Taiwan. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the protective effect of WCPS against carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) -induced liver injury and to clarify its active component(s). Antioxidative effects of the test samples were evaluated via MDA inhibition, catalase activity and DPPH-scavenging assays. HPLC was used to analysis the active components. Results showed that WCPS (1 and 5 mL/kg) significantly prevented CCl 4 -induced liver injury without chronic liver toxicity. Referring to the antioxidative activities, WCPE displayed significant MDA inhibitory and DPPH-scavenging activities with IC 50 values of 0. 91 &# 177; 0. 03 and 0. 60 &# 177; 0. 04 mg/mL, respectively. Catalase activity was also enhanced by treatment of WCPE, acteoside and quercetin. Therefore, we suggest that acteoside and quercetin are the major contributors to the antioxidative and hepatoprotective activities of WCPS, and a possible mechanism could be mediated through reduction of oxidative stress...|$|E
