The generalized Laguerre pseudo-spectral approximation {{based on the}} generalized Laguerre operational matrix is investigated to reduce the nonlinear <b>multiterm</b> FDEs and its initial conditions to nonlinear algebraic system, thus greatly simplifying the problem.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{modified}} generalized Laguerre spectral tau and collocation methods for solving linear and nonlinear <b>multiterm</b> fractional differential equations (FDEs) on the half line. A new formula expressing the Caputo fractional derivatives of modified generalized Laguerre polynomials of any degree and for any fractional order {{in terms of}} the modified generalized Laguerre polynomials themselves is derived. An efficient direct solver technique is proposed for solving the linear <b>multiterm</b> FDEs with constant coefficients on the half line using a modified generalized Laguerre tau method. The spatial approximation with its Caputo fractional derivatives is based on modified generalized Laguerre polynomials Li(α,β) (x) with x∈Λ=(0,∞), α>− 1, and β> 0, and i is the polynomial degree. We implement and develop the modified generalized Laguerre collocation method based on the modified generalized Laguerre-Gauss points which is used as collocation nodes for solving nonlinear <b>multiterm</b> FDEs on the half line...|$|E
30|$|In a {{more general}} sense, {{the first step is}} to {{approximate}} the distributed integral with a finite sum based on a simple quadrature rule when solving distributed-order FDEs via numerical methods. Thus the distributed-order FDE is converted into a <b>multiterm</b> FDE [25], and we have to efficiently solve the approximated <b>multiterm</b> FDE. To our knowledge, only a few articles have considered such problem. Liu et al. [26] discussed some computationally effective numerical methods for simulating the <b>multiterm</b> time-fractional wave-diffusion equations and extended such numerical techniques to other kinds of <b>multiterm</b> fractional time-space models with fractional Laplacian operator. Morgado et al. [27] studied a numerical approximation for the time distributed-order FDE concerning the stability and convergence; they [28] also presented an implicit difference scheme for numerical approximation of the distributed-order time fractional reaction–diffusion equation with nonlinear source term. An implicit difference scheme for the time distributed-order and Riesz space FDE on bounded domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions was constructed by Ye et al. [29]. Mashayekhi et al. [30] introduced a new numerical method for solving the distributed-order FDEs, which is based upon hybrid functions approximation. Hu et al. [31] provided an implicit numerical method of a new time distributed-order and two-sided space fractional advection–dispersion equation and proved the uniqueness, stability, and convergence of the method. A numerical method of distributed-order FDEs of a general form was investigated by Katsikadelis [25], where the trapezoidal rule was employed to approximate the distributed integral, and the analog equation method was applied to solve the resultant <b>multiterm</b> FDE. However, the stability and convergence were only shown in the experimental examples, and there was no rigorous theoretical proof.|$|E

We obtain the weak formulation of MT-TS-RFADEs and prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solution by the Lax-Milgram theorem. For <b>multiterm</b> time discretization, we use the Diethelm fractional backward finite difference method based on quadrature. For spatial discretization, we show the details of an FEM for such MT-TS-RFADEs. Then, stability and convergence of such numerical method are proved, and some numerical examples are given to match well with the main conclusions...|$|E

We have found for <b>multiterm</b> power law potentials, under theframework of ET that a family relationship emerges among the parent and the newly generated exactly solvablepotentials (ESPs). The normalizability of bound state solutions of the generated quantum systems is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|A new {{operational}} {{matrix of}} fractional integration of arbitrary order for generalized Laguerre polynomials is derived.

The method {{has the advantage of}} obtaining the solution in terms of the generalized Laguerre parameter. In addition, only a small dimension of generalized Laguerre operational matrix is needed to obtain a satisfactory result. Illustrative examples reveal that the proposed method is very effective and convenient for linear <b>multiterm</b> FDEs on a semi-infinite interval...|$|E

The most commonly used methods for studying the dynamic behavior of a blade with a {{friction damper}} are direct integration methods. Although the harmonic balance method (HBM) is a well-known method for studying nonlinear vibration problems, generally only a one-term approximation has been proposed to study the nonlinear vibration of a frictionally damped blade. In this work, a HMB procedure with a <b>multiterm</b> approximation is proposed.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{an efficient}} series solution {{for a class}} of nonlinear <b>multiterm</b> fractional differential equations of Caputo type. The approach is a generalization to our recent work for single fractional differential equations. We extend {{the idea of the}} Taylor series expansion method to <b>multiterm</b> fractional differential equations, where we overcome the difficulty of computing iterated fractional derivatives, which are difficult to be computed in general. The terms of the series are obtained sequentially using a closed formula, where only integer derivatives have to be computed. Several examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the new approach and comparison with the Adomian decomposition method is performed...|$|E

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{application}} of the Galerkin method for treating the <b>multiterm</b> fractional differential equations (FDEs) subject to initial conditions. A new shifted Legendre-Galerkin basis is constructed which satisfies exactly the homogeneous initial conditions by expanding the unknown variable using a new polynomial basis of functions which is built upon the shifted Legendre polynomials. A new spectral collocation approximation based on the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature nodes of shifted Legendre polynomials is investigated for solving the nonlinear <b>multiterm</b> FDEs. The main advantage of this approximation is that the solution is expanding by a truncated series of Legendre-Galerkin basis functions. Illustrative examples are presented to ensure the high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are discussed...|$|E
