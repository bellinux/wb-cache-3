25|$|Installing {{a hybrid}} OR is a {{challenge}} to standard hospital room sizes, as not only the imaging system requires some additional space, but there are also <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room as in a normal OR. A team of 8 to 20 people including anasthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, technicians, perfusionists, support staff from device companies etc. can work in such an OR. Depending on the imaging system chosen, a room size of 70 square meters including a control room but excluding a technical room and the preparation areas is recommended. Additional preparations of the room necessary are 2-3mm lead shielding and potentially enforcement of the floor or ceiling to hold the additional weight of the imaging system (approximately 650–1800kg).|$|E

25|$|In 1900, Florida {{was largely}} {{agricultural}} and frontier; most Floridians lived within 50 {{miles of the}} Georgia border. The population grew from 529,000 in 1900 to 18.3million in 2009. The population explosion began with the great land boom of the 1920s as Florida went from an undiscovered frontier to a southern land speculator's paradise. People from throughout the Southeast migrated to Florida during this time, creating a larger southern culture in {{the central part of}} the state, and expanding on the existing one in the northern region. Along with this, many developers invested in land in the southern part of the State in areas such as Miami, and Palm Beach attracting <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sothern States. When the Crash came in 1929, prices of houses plunged, but the sunshine remained. Hurt badly by the Great Depression and the land bust, Florida, along with many other States, kept afloat with federal relief money under the Roosevelt Administration.|$|E
25|$|Veblen {{generalized}} {{the conflict}} between businessmen and engineers by saying that human society would always involve conflict between existing norms with vested interests and new norms developed out of an innate human tendency to manipulate and learn about the physical {{world in which we}} exist. He also generalized his model to include his theory of instincts, processes of evolution as absorbed from Sumner, as enhanced by his own reading of evolutionary science, and pragmatic philosophy first learned from Peirce. The instinct of idle curiosity led humans to manipulate nature in new ways and this led to changes in what he called the material means of life. Because, as per the pragmatists, our ideas about the world are a human construct rather than mirrors of reality, changing ways of manipulating nature lead to changing constructs and to changing notions of truth and authority as well as patterns of behavior (institutions). Societies and economies evolve as a consequence, but do so via a process of conflict between vested interests and older forms and the new. Veblen never wrote with any confidence that the new ways were better ways, but he was sure in the last three decades of his life that the American economy could, in the absence of vested interests, have produced more for <b>more</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> years just after World War I he looked to engineers to make the American economy more efficient.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the last}} few years, Abilene, Texas, has {{steadily}} become the retail, residential, business, medical, and overall center of the surrounding Big Country. Commercial development was especially boosted in 2007, with several multimillion dollar projects throughout the entire city. Most of the recent development is concentrated in roughly four areas in Abilene: Southwest Drive, Catclaw Drive, and Buffalo Gap Road near the Winters Freeway to the southwest, as this area becomes a strong commercial sector {{as well as a}} good residential district; Buffalo Gap Road, Beltway South, and US Highway 83/84 near and beyond {{the outskirts of the city}} in the south with several housing developments; Loop 322 area and Oldham Ln to the southeast, also near and past the edge of the city with a mix of several residential subdivisions as well as the start of commercial growth; and State Highway 351/Ambler Avenue near Interstate 20 to the northeast, also a combination of staple retail development, similar to the southwest commercial development, and the beginnings of residential growth with a new apartment complex and growing subdivisions. All this growth has contributed to the suburbanization of the city; however, as Abilene is not a large city itself, this is also helped the urbanization of the city as a whole. <b>More</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city leads to more workers and commuters in a city that has a short commute time throughout the city.|$|E

25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. Those who have the gene {{are far more likely to}} get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E
