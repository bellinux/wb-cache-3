40|$|Government and {{organized}} <b>criminal</b> <b>groups</b> co-exist in uneasy equilibrium. <b>Criminal</b> <b>groups</b> adjust their {{behavior as a}} function of their own goals and resources in relation to inter-group cooperation and conflict, dynamic markets, and public policies; governments adjust their behavior according to shifting perceptions of the benefits offered, threats posed, and strategies adopted by <b>criminal</b> <b>groups.</b> When governments attempt to control or repress their activities, <b>criminal</b> <b>groups</b> employ various tools and instruments that might be grouped into three categories: evasion, corruption, and confrontation. The paper draws on recent cases from Brazil and Mexico with respect to tactical and strategic choices by governments and <b>criminal</b> <b>groups,</b> seeking to address three broad questions. What factors disrupt the state-criminal group equilibrium? Under what circumstances do disruptions produce significant levels of violence (as opposed to evasion or corruption) ? What are the implications for the quality of democracy as <b>criminal</b> <b>groups</b> violently confront the state?Organized crime; Democracy; Violence...|$|R

40|$|The {{institution}} of an organised <b>criminal</b> <b>group</b> {{in conjunction with}} the Penal Code and case law The submitted diploma thesis concerns the {{institution of}} an organised <b>criminal</b> <b>group</b> in terms of effective legal regulation, and suggests legal solutions for the future. To meet the objectives of this thesis, it was necessary to study available legal regulations, case law, specialised literature and documents of international law. At the beginning of this thesis, it was necessary to distinguish the term of an organised <b>criminal</b> <b>group</b> from other two similar terms included in this thesis, namely the term of organised crime and the term of an organised group. This distinction was essential because all of these terms were further used in the thesis. The second chapter is dedicated to historical context of legislation regarding the organised <b>criminal</b> <b>group.</b> It was especially documents of two international organisations, the UN and the EU, which had considerable influence on the legislation in the Czech Republic. One subchapter also deals with the development in the Czech Republic itself.

The reason why Surinamese, Antillean, Moroccan and Ambonese groups are considered to be a part of the Penose is because their <b>criminal</b> <b>groups</b> were formed and based in the Netherlands, whereas the Turkish or Serb gangs are part of a <b>criminal</b> <b>group</b> based in their home country.|$|R
