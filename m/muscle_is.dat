5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. <b>Muscle</b> <b>is</b> formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is tested by evaluating {{the function of}} the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The trapezius <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> tested by asking the patient to shrug their shoulders with and without resistance. The sternocleidomastoid <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> tested by asking the patient to turn their head to the left or right against resistance.|$|E
5|$|Troponin I, cardiac <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the TNNI3 gene.|$|E
30|$|The highest {{concentration}} of Mn in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 1.34  μg/g wet wt. during winter at eastern sector, whereas the lowest {{concentration of}} Mn in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 0.21  μg/g wet wt. during summer at western sector. The highest value of Zn in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 6.23  μg/g wet wt. during summer at western sector, whereas the lowest concentration of Zn in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 3.64  μg/g wet wt. during summer at eastern sector. The highest value of Fe in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 17.66  μg/g wet wt. during winter at middle sector, whereas the lowest value of Fe in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 6.39  μg/g wet wt. during summer western sector.|$|R
50|$|Motor {{pools in}} {{the spinal cord}} are {{clustered}} in distinct columns of motor neurons extending over multiple spinal cord segments; although, there is significant overlap. Motor pools that control proximal <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> generally located medial to the ventral horn, while those that control distal <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> located laterally. Motor pools that control flexor <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> located dorsally to the ventral horn while those that control extensor <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> located ventrally.|$|R
50|$|Heart <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> {{distinct}} from skeletal muscles because the <b>muscle</b> fibers <b>are</b> laterally connected to each other. Furthermore, {{just as with}} smooth <b>muscles,</b> their movement <b>is</b> involuntary. Heart <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> controlled by the sinus node influenced by the autonomic nervous system.|$|R
5|$|Heart: {{cardiomyopathy}} (weakness of {{the heart}} <b>muscle)</b> <b>is</b> a rare but recognized problem in Wilson's disease; it may lead to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat).|$|E
5|$|Neutrophil granulocytes—the most {{abundant}} type of white blood cell—enter the muscle tissue, producing an inflammatory reaction and releasing reactive oxygen species, particularly after crush injury. Crush syndrome may also cause reperfusion injury when {{blood flow to}} decompressed <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> suddenly restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> {{derived from}} mesoderm and {{plays a role}} in the embryological rotation of the gut, by offering a point of fixation for the rotating gut. It is also thought to help digestion by widening the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare abnormality caused by a congenitally-short suspensory muscle.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of muscles - cardiac, skeletal, and smooth. Smooth <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> used to control the flow of {{substances}} within the lumens of hollow organs, and are not consciously controlled. Skeletal and cardiac muscles have striations that are visible under a microscope due to the components within their cells. Only skeletal and smooth <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> part of the musculoskeletal system and only the skeletal muscles can move the body. Cardiac <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> found in the heart and are used only to circulate blood; like the smooth <b>muscles,</b> these <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> not under conscious control. Skeletal <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> attached to bones and arranged in opposing groups around joints. [...] <b>Muscles</b> <b>are</b> innervated, to communicate nervous energy to, by nerves, which conduct electrical currents from {{the central nervous system}} and cause the muscles to contract.|$|R
30|$|The {{highest value}} of Ni in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 0.64  μg/g wet wt. during summer at eastern sector, whereas the lowest {{concentration}} of Ni in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 0.43  μg/g wet wt. during winter at middle sector. The highest value of Cu in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 0.53  μg/g wet wt. during winter at middle sector, whereas the lowest concentration of Cu in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 0.28  μg/g wet wt. during summer at western sector. There {{was a significant}} difference (p[*]=[*] 0.021) for the annual mean of Cu concentration in muscles between the different sectors (eastern, middle, and western). The highest value of Pb in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 0.81  μg/g wet wt. during winter at western sector, whereas the lowest concentration of Pb in fish <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> 0.21  μg/g wet wt. during winter at eastern sector (Table  5).|$|R
50|$|Les <b>Musclés</b> <b>were</b> a French music {{band in the}} 1990s. The <b>Musclés</b> <b>were</b> Framboisier (singer), Rémy (bass guitarist), Éric (guitarist), René (accordionist) and Bernard Minet (drummer).|$|R
5|$|Troponin I, slow {{skeletal}} <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the TNNI1 gene. An isoform switch from ssTnI to cTnI occurs during perinatal heart development. ssTnI is not {{expressed in the}} embryonic hearts of Xenopus and zebrafish, while it is expressed in the somites and skeletal muscles.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris <b>muscle,</b> <b>is</b> reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
5|$|Insect wing <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> a {{strictly}} aerobic tissue. Per unit protein it consumes fuel and oxygen at rates {{taking place in}} a very concentrated and highly organized tissue so that the steady-state rates per unit volume represent an absolute record in biology. The fuel and oxygen rich blood is carried to the muscles through diffusion occurring in large amounts, {{in order to maintain}} the high level of energy used during flight. Many wing muscles are large and may be as large as 10mm in length and 2mm in width. Moreover, in some Diptera the fibres are of giant dimensions. For instance, in the very active Rutilia, the cross-section is 1800µm long and more than 500µm wide. The transport of fuel and oxygen from the surroundings to the sites of consumption and the reverse transport of carbon dioxide therefore represent a challenge to the biologist both in relation to transport in the liquid phase and in the intricate system of air tubes, i.e. in the tracheal system.|$|E
50|$|Pharyngeal <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> {{striated}} <b>muscles</b> of {{the head}} and neck. Unlike skeletal muscles that developmentally come from somites, pharyngeal <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> developmentally formed from the pharyngeal arches.|$|R
50|$|While {{these four}} <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> the primary {{participants}} in mastication, other <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> usually {{if not always}} helping the process, {{such as those of}} the tongue and the cheeks.|$|R
50|$|The Chicago <b>Muscle</b> <b>was</b> a professional, {{minor league}} {{basketball}} {{team in the}} Premier Basketball League. The <b>Muscle</b> <b>was</b> set to begin play for the 2012 season. Based in Chicago, Illinois, the <b>Muscle's</b> home venue <b>was</b> Harper College in Palatine, Illinois.|$|R
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog {{is still in the}} crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E
5|$|The main {{muscular system}} in {{bivalves}} is the posterior and anterior adductor muscles, although the anterior muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central adductor muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E
50|$|The facial <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> a {{group of}} {{striated}} skeletal muscles innervated by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) that, among other things, control facial expression. These <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> also called mimetic muscles.|$|R
40|$|Using {{horseradish}} peroxidase and fluorescent compounds as retrograde tracers, the myotopical arrangement and axon trajectories of the motoneurons innervating the supramandibular and the suprahyoidal <b>muscles</b> <b>were</b> {{studied in the}} rat. Only motoneurons ipsilateral to the injection site were labelled. In the trigeminal motor nucleus, motoneurons of the superficial masseter <b>muscle</b> <b>were</b> found laterally, of the anterior deep masseter muscle centrally, and of the temporalis muscle dorsally and medially. Motoneurons of the anterior and posterior digastric <b>muscle</b> <b>were</b> located in the accessory motor nucleus of the trigeminal and facial nerve respectively. Evidence is provided that jaw-opening <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> innervated from a separate motor complex...|$|R
40|$|Laryngeal, {{intercostal}} and diaphragmatic <b>muscle</b> activities <b>were</b> recorded during progressive hypercapnia and hypoxia in {{dogs with}} chronically implanted electrodes. As ventilation increased during progressive chemoreceptor stimulation, inspiratory {{activity of the}} posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, a laryngeal abductor, and of the cricothyroid <b>muscle</b> <b>were</b> augmented. When expiratory flow rates reached 2 - 3 times resting levels, both of these <b>muscles</b> <b>were</b> also active during expiration and recruitment of the internal intercostal <b>muscles</b> <b>was</b> observed. The thyroarytenoid muscle, a laryngeal adductor, was active only rarely and no consistent activation of this <b>muscle</b> <b>was</b> observed with either hypercapnia or hypoxia. The patterns of muscle activation in response to respiratory stimulation were not different during wakefulness, slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep. The {{results indicate that the}} laryngeal <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> activated during hypercapnia and hypoxia in a manner which reduces both inspiratory and expiratory airflow resistance regardless of sleep-wakefulness state...|$|R
5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. <b>Muscle</b> <b>is</b> arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main adductor <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E
50|$|The {{muscles of}} the upper limb are innervated segmentally {{proximal}} to distal so that the proximal <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> innervated by higher segments (C5-C6) and the distal <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> innervated by lower segments (C8-T1).|$|R
50|$|Cricoarytenoid <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> <b>muscles</b> {{that connect}} the cricoid {{cartilage}} and arytenoid cartilage.|$|R
50|$|The hypaxial <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> {{located on}} the lower side of the body, often below the {{horizontal}} septum in many species (primarily fish and amphibians). In amniotes, the positional distinctions have been lost as the body's muscles have changed through evolution, but in all species, the hypaxial <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> innervated by the ventral ramus (branch) of the spinal nerves, while the epaxial <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> innervated by the dorsal ramus.|$|R
25|$|This <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> {{equivalent}} to the tenderloin.|$|E
25|$|In muscle tissue, 10-100 endomysium-sheathed {{muscle fibers}} are {{organized}} into perimysium-wrapped bundles known as fascicles. Each <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> {{composed of a}} number of fascicles grouped together by a sleeve of connective tissue, known as an epimysium. In a pennate muscle, aponeuroses run along each side of the muscle and attach to the tendon. The fascicles attach to the aponeuroses and form an angle (the pennation angle) to the load axis of the muscle. If all the fascicles are {{on the same side of}} the tendon, the pennate <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> called unipennate (Fig. 1A). Examples of this include certain muscles in the hand. If there are fascicles on both sides of the central tendon, the pennate <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> called bipennate (Fig. 1B). The rectus femoris, a large muscle in the quadriceps, is typical. If the central tendon branches within a pennate muscle, the <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> called multipennate (Fig. 1C), as seen in the deltoid muscle in the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|Skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> {{arranged}} in discrete muscles, {{an example of}} which is the biceps brachii. The tough, fibrous epimysium of skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> both connected to and continuous with the tendons. In turn, the tendons connect to the periosteum layer surrounding the bones, permitting the transfer of force from the muscles to the skeleton. Together, these fibrous layers, along with tendons and ligaments, constitute the deep fascia of the body.|$|E
5000|$|Certain <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} {{confused with}} composite <b>muscles</b> which they <b>are</b> not. Examples are: ...|$|R
30|$|The first patient (patient 7) was {{affected}} by left periacetabular chondrosarcoma. Several muscles, such as the rectus abdominis, sartorius, rectus femoris, tensor fasciae latae, gluteus medius, and gluteus maximus were detached during surgery. The iliac <b>muscle</b> <b>was</b> resected, whereas the psoas <b>muscle</b> <b>was</b> preserved. External rotator and adductor <b>muscles</b> <b>were</b> detached and not reinserted. At the time of gait analysis (75  months postoperatively), a limb length discrepancy of about 2.5  cm was present.|$|R
50|$|Like the sit-up, except {{instead of}} {{bringing}} the whole torso area closer to the knees, only a concentrated but shorter movement of the abdominal <b>muscles</b> <b>is</b> performed. Shoulder blades are lifted off the floor, and abdominal <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> tightened.|$|R
