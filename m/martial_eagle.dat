50|$|The Accipitridae (hereafter accipitrids) {{family is}} by far the most diverse family of diurnal raptors in the world with more than 230 {{currently}} accepted species. As a member of the booted eagle sub-family, Aquilinae, it is one of the roughly 15% extant species of the family to have feathers covering its legs. This may be a useful feature for distinguishing these species from other eagles and raptors, as they are present even in tropical species such as the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle.</b> Under current classifications, booted eagles consist of approximately 38 living species that are distributed in every continent inhabited by the accipitrids, which excludes only the continent of Antarctica. Just under half of the living species of booted eagle are found in Africa. Studies have been conducted on the mitochondrial DNA of most booted eagle species, including the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle,</b> in order to gain insight on how the sub-family is ordered and which species bear relation to one another. DNA testing in the 1980s indicated the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> was a specialized off-shoot of the small-bodied Hieraaetus eagles and one study went so far as to advocate that the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> be included in the genus. However, more modern and comprehensive genetic testing has shown that the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> is extremely distinct from other living booted eagles and diverged from other existing genera several million years ago. Genetically, the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> fell between two other species in monotypical genera, the African long-crested eagle (Lophaetus occipitalis) and the Asian rufous-bellied eagle (Lophotriorchis kienerii), that similarly diverged long ago from other modern species. Given the disparity of this species’ unique morphology and that the two aforementioned most closely related living species are only about as large as the bigger buzzards, the unique heritage of the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> is considered even superficially evident. There are no subspecies of <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> and the species varies little in appearance and genetic diversity across its distribution.|$|E

50|$|The <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> (Polemaetus bellicosus) {{is a large}} eagle {{native to}} sub-Saharan Africa. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Polemaetus. A species of the booted eagle {{sub-family}} (Aquillinae), it has feathering over its tarsus. One of the largest and most powerful species of booted eagle, it is a fairly opportunistic predator that varies it prey selection between mammals, birds and reptiles. Its hunting technique is unique as it is one of few eagle species known to hunt primarily from a high soar, by stooping on its quarry. An inhabitant of wooded belts of otherwise open savanna, this species has shown a precipitous drop in the last few centuries due to a variety of factors. The <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> is one of the most persecuted bird species in the world. Due to its habit of taking livestock and regionally valuable game, local farmers and game wardens frequently seek to eliminate martial eagles, although the effect of eagles on this prey is almost certainly considerably exaggerated. Currently, the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> is classified with the status of Vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN.|$|E

50|$|The main predators of {{this species}} are various birds of prey, {{including}} the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle,</b> bateleur, and the Congo serpent eagle. Other predators may include the honey badger, other snakes, and species of mongoose may also occasionally prey on the Jameson's mamba.|$|E
50|$|The <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> spends an {{exceptional}} {{amount of the}} time in the air, often soaring about hill slopes high enough that binoculars are often needed to perceive them. When not breeding, both mature eagles from a breeding pair may be found roosting on their own in some prominent tree up to several miles from their nesting haunt, probably hunting for several days in one area, until viable prey resources are exhausted, and then moving on to another area. However, martial eagles, especially adult birds, are typically devoted to less disturbed areas, both due to these typically offering more extensive prey selection and their apparent dislike for a considerable human presence. Martial eagles tend to be very solitary and are not known to tolerate others of the own species in the area outside of the pair during the breeding season. In general this species is shier towards humans than other big eagles of Africa, but may be seen passing over populated country at times. The most frequently seen type of <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> away from traditional habitats are presumed nomadic subadults. One individual that was ringed as subadult was recovered 5.5 years later 130 km away from the initial banding site. Another <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> ringed as a nestling was found to have moved 180 km in 11 months.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, the {{bateleur}} {{was placed}} in the near threatened IUCN Red List category due to loss of habitat, pesticides, capture for international trade and nest disturbance. Decline of the species is suspected to have been moderately rapid over the past three generations. Current conservation efforts are unknown. Like the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle,</b> the bateleur is reasonably common in conservation areas and scarce elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> is to {{some degree}} {{adaptable}} to varied habitats but shows an overall preference for open woods and woodland edges, wooded savannah and thornbush habitats. The <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> has been recorded at elevations of up to 3000 m but is not a true mountain dwelling species and resident eagles do not usually exceed an elevation of 1500 m. These eagles also avoid closed-canopy forests and hyper-arid desert. As such it is mostly absent from Guinean and Congolian forests, despite the species’ requirement for large trees for nesting purposes. It is shown that martial eagles can inhabit forests locally in areas where openings occur. For example, in a bird atlas for the country of Kenya, perhaps surprisingly, 88% of martial eagles were found to reside in well-wooded areas and they occurred in areas where annual rainfall exceeded 250 mm. In southern Africa, they have adapted to seemingly more open habitats than elsewhere in their range, such as semi-desert and open savanna with scattered trees, wooded hillocks and, as a recent adaptation, around pylons. In the desert areas of Namibia, they utilize ephemeral rivers that flow occasionally and allow large trees to grow. They usually seem to prefer desolate or protected areas. In the Karoo of South Africa, they consistently avoid areas with moderate to heavy cultivation or with heavier or more consistent winter rainfall. One study on the occurrence of diurnal raptors in protected areas versus outside unprotected areas, found that <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> detection was nearly twice as frequent in protected areas {{during the dry season}} and more than three times as frequent during the wet season. Some assorted diurnal raptors were even relatively rarer outside of protected areas such as hooded vultures (Necrosyrtes monachus).|$|E
50|$|At {{the first}} sign of trouble, {{steenbok}} typically lie low in the vegetation. If a predator or perceived threat comes closer, a steenbok will leap away and follow a zigzag route to try to shake off the pursuer. Escaping steenbok frequently stop to look back, and flight is alternated with prostration during extended pursuit. They are known to take refuge in the burrows of Aardvarks. Known predators include Southern African wildcat, caracal, jackals, leopard, <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> and pythons.|$|E
50|$|The adult's plumage {{consists}} of dark grey-brown coloration on the upperparts, head and upper chest, {{with an occasional}} slightly lighter edging to these feathers. The body underparts are feathered white with sparse but conspicuous blackish-brown spotting. The underwing coverts are dark brown, with the remiges being pale streaked with black, overall imparting the wings of adults a dark look. The underside of the tail has similar barring as the remiges while the upperside is the same uniform brown as the back and upperwing coverts. The eyes of mature <b>martial</b> <b>eagles</b> are rich yellow, while the cere and large feet pale greenish and the talons black. <b>Martial</b> <b>eagles</b> have a short erectile crest, which is typically neither prominent nor flared (unlike that of the crowned eagle) and generally appears as an angular back to a seemingly flat head. This species often perches in a quite upright position, with its long wings completely covering the tail, causing it be described as “standing” rather than “sitting” on a branch when perched. In flight, <b>martial</b> <b>eagles</b> bear long broad wings with relatively narrow rounded tips that can appear pointed at times {{depending on how the}} eagle is holding its wings. It is capable of flexible beats with gliding on flattish wings, or slightly raised in a dihedral. This species often spends much {{a large portion of the}} day on the wing, more so than probably any other African eagles, and often at a great height. Juvenile <b>martial</b> <b>eagles</b> are conspicuously distinct in plumage with a pearly gray colour above with considerable white edging, as well as a speckled grey effect on crown and hind neck. The entire underside is conspicuously white. The wing coverts of juveniles are mottled grey-brown and white, with patterns of bars on primaries and tail that are similar to adult but lighter and greyer. In the 4th or 5th years, a very gradual increase to brownish feather speckling is noted but the back and crown remain a fairly pale grey. At this age, there may be increasing spots on throat and chest which coalesce into a gorget and some spots on abdomen may variably manifest as well. The eyes of juveniles are dark brown. This species reaches adult plumage by its seventh year with the transition to adult plumage happening quite rapidly after many years in a little-changing juvenile plumage.|$|R
50|$|In {{areas where}} the black-backed jackal is {{sympatric}} with the larger side-striped jackal, the former species aggressively drives out the latter from grassland habitats into woodlands. This is unique among carnivores, as it is more common for larger species to displace smaller ones. Black-backed jackal pups are vulnerable to African golden wolves, ratels, and spotted and brown hyenas. Adults have few natural predators, save for leopards, caracals, African wild dogs, and <b>martial</b> <b>eagles.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> is a {{very large}} eagle. In total length, it can range from 78 to 96 cm, with an average of {{approximately}} 85.5 cm. Its total length - in comparison to its wingspan - is restricted by its relatively short tail. Nonetheless, it appears to be the sixth or seventh longest living eagle species. The wingspan of martial eagles can range from 188 to 260 cm. Average wingspans have been claimed of 205 cm and 207.5 cm for the species, however ten measured martial eagles in the wild were found to average 211.9 cm in wingspan. Thus, the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> appears to average fourth in wingspan among living eagles, behind only the Steller's sea-eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus), the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), in roughly that order. For a species that is fairly homogeneous in its genetic make-up, the body mass of martial eagles is surprisingly variable. To some extent, the variation of body masses in the species is contributable to considerable reverse sexual dimorphism as well as varying environmental conditions of various eagle populations. Unsexed martial eagles from various studies have been found to have weighed an average of 3.93 kg in 17 birds, 3.97 kg in 20 birds and 4.23 kg in 20 birds while the average weight of martial eagles shot by game wardens in the early 20th century in South Africa was listed as 4.71 kg. In weight range, the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> broadly overlaps in size with the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and Verreaux's eagle (and is even exceeded by them in maximum known body mass). Based on numerous studies, the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> appear to average mildly heavier than the Verreaux's eagle but (derived from the globally combined body mass of its various races), the mean body masses of golden and martial eagles are identical at approximately 4.17 kg. The renders the golden and martial eagles as tied as the largest African eagles (by body mass but not in total length or wingspan, in which the martial bests the golden), as well as the heaviest two species of booted eagle in the world and as tied as the sixth heaviest eagles in the world, after the three largest species of sea eagle (Steller's being the heaviest extant, the others ranking 4th and 5th), the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi). The longest African eagle (and second longest booted eagle after the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax)) is the crowned eagle by virtue of its relatively longer tail, as its body weight is slightly less than these three heaviest booted eagle species.|$|E
5000|$|A {{total of}} 90 {{indigenous}} mammal {{species have been}} recorded in the Magaliesberg Biosphere Reserve. These include the klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus), sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), leopard (Panthera pardus) and brown hyena (Hyaena brunnea). The bird diversity in the area is exceptional. In total, 46.6% of the bird species recorded in the southern African sub-region {{are found in the}} reserve. These include the Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheras), secretary bird (Sagittarius serpentarius), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), <b>martial</b> <b>eagle</b> (Polemaetus belliccosus) and African grass-owl (Tyto capensis).|$|E
50|$|There are few serious {{identification}} {{challenges for}} the species. The black-chested snake eagle (Circaetus pectoralis) is similar in overall colouring (despite its name it is brown on the chest and the back, being no darker than the adult <b>martial</b> <b>eagle)</b> to martial eagles but is markedly smaller, with a relatively more prominent, rounded head with large eyes, plain, spotless abdomen, bare and whitish legs. In flight, {{the profile of the}} snake eagle is quite different with nearly white (rather than dark brown) flight feathers and much smaller, narrower wings and a relatively larger tail. For juveniles, the main source for potential confusion is the juvenile crowned eagle, which also regularly perches in an erect position. The proportions of crowned eagles are quite distinct from martial eagles as they have much shorter wings and a distinctly longer tail. The juvenile crowned eagle has a whiter head, more scaled back, and spotted thighs and legs lacking in the <b>martial</b> <b>eagle.</b> Beyond their distinct flight profile by wing and tail proportions, crowned eagles have whiter and more obviously banded flight-feathers and tail. Other large immature eagles in Africa tend to be much darker and more heavily marked both above and below than martial eagles.|$|E
50|$|For {{terrestrial}} predators, including {{birds of}} prey, sub-Saharan Africa {{may be the}} most competitive environment in the modern world. Due to great diversity of raptors present, each species have shown adaptive specializations, which may consist of various morphological differences that allow them to capitalize on distinct prey selection, hunting methods, habitat and/or nesting habits. The larger booted eagles that dominate the avian food chain in Africa consists of <b>martial</b> <b>eagles,</b> 4 kg Verreaux's eagles and 3.64 kg crowned eagles, which due to their size and conspicuousness may lend themselves to comparisons. While prey species may overlap in these in southern Africa and some parts of east Africa, where the prey size range of all three eagles averages 1 to 5 kg, these three powerful eagles differ considerably in habitat preferences, nesting habits and hunting methods. The Verreaux's eagle nests in and hunts around rocky, mountainous kopje to be in close proximity to the much favored prey, rock hyraxes, which they mainly use contour-hunting (hugging the uneven ground to surprise the prey) to capture. The crowned eagle dwells mainly in mature forests, building nests in large interior trees, and is primarily a perch-hunter, watching and listening for monkeys and other prey over a long period. While all three are known to locally favor rock hyraxes, the nesting habitat differences where they overlap are sufficient to allow these birds not to effect one another. The average prey mass of Verreaux's eagle was similar to that <b>martial</b> <b>eagles,</b> with a pair of studies showing it ranges from 1.82 to 2.6 kg. The mean prey mass of crowned eagles in southern Africa also appears to be similar to that of <b>martial</b> <b>eagles</b> but in west Africa (i.e. Ivory Coast) it was considerably heavier at 5.67 kg (which may well be the highest mean prey mass for any of the world’s raptors). Elsewhere, mean prey masses for the larger booted eagles appears to be considerably smaller than in the larger African species, i.e. single studies for the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) and wedge-tailed eagles showed means of 0.45 kg and 1.3 kg, respectively, while a large number of extensive dietary studies for the golden eagle show its global mean prey mass is around 1.61 kg.|$|R
50|$|Although {{capable of}} {{fighting}} (males aggressively {{fight each other}} during mating season), the common warthog's primary defense is to flee by means of fast sprinting. The common warthog's main predators are humans, lions, leopards, cheetahs, crocodiles, wild dogs and hyenas. Birds of prey such as Verreaux's <b>eagle</b> owls and <b>martial</b> <b>eagles</b> sometimes prey on piglets. However, if a female common warthog has any piglets, she will defend them very aggressively. On occasion, common warthogs have been observed charging and even wounding large predators. Common warthogs have also been observed allowing banded mongooses and vervet monkeys to groom them to remove ticks.|$|R
50|$|The Karoo National Park is a {{sanctuary}} for herds of springbok, gemsbok (or Oryx), Cape mountain zebra, buffalo, red hartebeest, black rhinoceros, eland, kudu, klipspringer, bat-eared foxes, black-backed jackal, ostriches, and, since fairly recently, lions. It also has {{the greatest number of}} tortoise species of any park in the world - five in total. The endangered riverine rabbit has been successfully resettled here. A large number of Verreaux's eagles have nests on the cliffs of the Escarpment. <b>Martial</b> <b>eagles,</b> booted eagles and the shy Cape eagle-owl are other raptors that {{can be seen in the}} Park. A wide variety of smaller birds occur in abundance, making the Park a birder’s paradise. The park has also been populated with Rau Quagga which are Plains or Burchell's zebras that have been back-bred to resemble the quaggas that roamed the karoo in great profusion until the middle of the 1800s, when they were hunted to extinction. The last quagga died in Amsterdam Zoo on 12 August 1883.|$|R
