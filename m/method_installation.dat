40|$|Drilled {{displacement}} (DD) piles (commonly {{known as}} „screw piles‟ in Europe) are being increasingly used as foundation elements for structures, particularly in projects requiring accelerated construction or involving {{the rehabilitation of}} foundations of existing, overstressed structures. Different types of DD piles are available in practice; each type is classified according {{to the design of}} the drilling tool and associated installation <b>method.</b> <b>Installation</b> of DD piles causes substantial changes {{in the state of the}} soil surrounding the pile. These changes result from the complex loading imposed on the soil by expansion of a cylindrical cavity to make room for the specially designed drilling tool, by torsional and vertical shearing as the drilling tool gradually moves down into the ground, and by the reversed vertical shearing caused by extraction of the drilling tool from the ground. This report consolidates the information available on DD piling technology, reviews and compares the empirical design methods typically used for these piles, and presents a numerical approach to model the shaft resistance of DD piles in sand. The installation of DD piles produces greater radial displacement of soil than that produced by nondisplacement piles (e. g., drilled shafts), particularly in the case of sandy soils which gain additional strength through densification. This radial displacement of soil around the pile shaft contributes to the high capacity obtained for DD piles. Accordingly, our focus has been on analyzing the shaft resistance of DD piles in sand and proposing a design procedure based on the results of the analyses. The analyses were done using the finite element (FE) method and an advanced constitutive model for sand. The constitutive model captures all the key features required for these analyses, and the FE analyses are 1 D analyses of shaft resistance that can handle the large deformations and displacements involved in pile installation. Design equations that can be used to calculate the lateral earth pressure coefficient acting on the pile shaft are proposed...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} program using large model piles in sand {{was conducted}} to study the shaft resistance behavior of piles subject to uplift loads. Model single pipe piles of different diameters (45 to 178 mm) were subjected to static uplift loading to failure. The piles, which had an embedded length of about 1. 7 to 2 m, were installed in a large test pit (3 by 3 by 3 m) by three different methods (driving, jacking, and a reference undisturbed method with negligible lateral displacement) to assess the influence of <b>method</b> of <b>installation</b> on shaft resistance. The tests were performed in two initial densities of a sand (loose and dense). The experimental results were analyzed statistically. The {{results show that the}} initial sand density and the <b>method</b> of pile <b>installation</b> are the most significant factors that affect uplift capacity. <b>Installation</b> <b>methods</b> that cause less disturbance give higher uplift capacity.

40|$|Abstract Peatland {{drainage}} changes catchment {{conditions and}} increases the transport of suspended solids (SS) and nutrients. New knowledge and management methods are needed to reduce SS loading from these areas. This thesis examines sediment delivery and erosion processes {{in a number of}} peatland drainage areas and catchments {{in order to determine the}} effects of drainage on sediment and erosion dynamics and mechanics. Results from studies performed in peat mining, peatland forestry and disturbed headwater catchments in Finland are presented and potential sediment load management methods are discussed for drainage areas and headwater brooks. Particular attention is devoted to erosion of organic peat, sediment transport and methods to reduce the impacts of peatland drainage in boreal headwaters. This thesis consists of six articles. The first and second papers focus on the erosion and sediment transport processes at peat harvesting and peatland forestry drainage networks. The results indicate that in-channel processes are important in drained peatland, since the drainage network often constitutes temporary inter-storm storage for eroding and transporting material. Sediment properties determine the bed sediment erosion sensitivity, as fluffy organic peat sediment consolidates over time. As flashiness and peak runoff control sediment entrainment and transport from drained peatland areas, water quality management should include peak runoff management. The third, fourth and fifth papers studies use and application of peak runoff control (PRC) method to the peat harvesting and peatland forestry conditions for water protection. Results indicate that effective water quality management in drained peatland areas can be achieved using this <b>method.</b> <b>Installation</b> of the PRC structures is a useful and cost-effective way of storing storm runoff waters temporarily in the ditch system and providing a retention time for eroded sediment to settle to the ditch bed and drainage network. The main effect of the PRC is on SS and SS-bound nutrients. The sixth paper is concentrated to test new restoration structure to be used in degraded headwater brooks. The results show that addition of woody restoration structures to the channel is effective and simple sediment management methods in headwater areas. New information provided in this thesis on sediment erosion and transport processes in drained peatland areas can help to improve water quality control in these areas. In-channel processes are important for both peatland uses, since the drainage network often constitutes temporary inter-storm storage for eroding and transporting material. Therefore, controlling these processes is a key to effective water quality management, which can be achieved using the PRC method in drainage areas or by utilisation of natural fluvial processes in natural channels downstream...|$|E
