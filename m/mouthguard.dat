5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s {{to protect themselves from}} head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a <b>mouthguard</b> is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Mouthguards</b> are {{removable}} intra-oral devices that, if used correctly, {{make the}} protection of the teeth and soft tissues such as gums, lips and cheeks from the impact during the sport activity. Objective: To know about the habits and attitudes towards the hygiene and use of <b>mouthguards</b> for athletes and evaluate the ability of a new product in spray form to decontaminate <b>mouthguards.</b> Material and methods: An interview by means of a questionnaire was conducted with 22 men, young adults, rugby players, in order to know their habits and attitudes about the use and cleaning of <b>mouthguards.</b> After this step, microbiological testing was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a test product in the decontamination of <b>mouthguards.</b> Results: The sample consists of young adults, well-educated, but who had little information about cleaning of <b>mouthguards.</b> Only one participant executed the decontamination adequately. By microbiological assessing the test product was effective in decontaminating the samples of <b>mouthguards.</b> Conclusion: The risk of saliva contamination of <b>mouthguards,</b> the hygiene care and storage and the need for disinfection of these devices should be better disseminated among professionals and especially among athletes. The test product was effective in decontaminating salivary <b>mouthguards...</b>|$|R
25|$|This gag has two <b>mouthguards,</b> {{similar to}} those worn by {{football}} and hockey players. One rests on the lower teeth of the wearer while the other is against the top. Again, like sports <b>mouthguards,</b> these <b>mouthguards</b> can be softened in boiling water to fit {{to the mouth of}} the wearer. The <b>mouthguards</b> are attached to a front faceplate, like most plug gags, and straps from the front to the back.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mouthguards</b> {{have become}} a {{standard}} in many sports. In addition to football, the NCAA currently requires <b>mouthguards</b> in ice hockey, field hockey, and lacrosse. The ADA shows that <b>mouthguards</b> are extremely effective in preventing facial injury in contact and non-contact sports. The ADA recommends <b>mouthguards</b> be used in 29 sports: acrobatics, basketball, bicycling, boxing, equestrian, football, gymnastics, handball, ice hockey, inline skating, lacrosse, martial arts, racquetball, rugby football, shot putting, skateboarding, skiing, skydiving, soccer, softball, squash, surfing, volleyball, water polo, weightlifting and wrestling.|$|R
25|$|A <b>mouthguard</b> is {{important}} to protect the teeth and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{appliances}} or splints {{are often}} preferred {{but may not}} be as effective as CPAP. This device is a <b>mouthguard</b> similar to those used in sports to protect the teeth. It is designed to hold the lower jaw slightly down and forward relative to the natural, relaxed position. This position holds the tongue farther away {{from the back of the}} airway and may be enough to relieve apnea or improve breathing.|$|E
25|$|Mixed {{martial arts}} {{promotions}} typically require that male fighters wear shorts {{in addition to}} being barechested, thus precluding the use of gi or fighting kimono to inhibit or assist submission holds. Male fighters are required by most athletic commissions to wear groin protectors underneath their trunks. Female fighters wear short shorts and sports bras or other similarly snug-fitting tops. Both male and female fighters are required to wear a <b>mouthguard.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>mouthguards</b> for preventing sportsrelated traumatic oral injuries {{is well documented}} in those sports that mandate their use. There are three general categories of athletic <b>mouthguards</b> that currently are available. These include stock, mouth-formed and custom fabricated <b>mouthguards</b> made over a dental cast. Most <b>mouthguards</b> {{in each of these}} categories are made from ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) material. Fabrication and design require professional services for impression taking and laboratory processing. Custom-fabricated <b>mouthguards</b> are, therefore, the most retentive. This presentation is designed to describe, in detail, clinical and laboratory procedures that are used to fabricate custom athletic <b>mouthguards</b> and will include the vacuum-forming technique and the heatpressure-lamination technique. Information on a new vacuum- pressure-lamination technique will be described as well as an experimental technique that utilizes photopolymerized urethane diacrylate. Several research topics for future investigation will be identified...|$|R
40|$|As <b>mouthguards</b> provide {{protection}} of the teeth, jaws, adjacent soft tissues and also protect the brain against concussion following impacts to the mandible, the use of <b>mouthguards</b> in contact sports is strongly recommended. It is therefore essential to gauge regularly the use of <b>mouthguards</b> in the various contact sports {{at all levels of}} competition. Of the 30 members of the 1984 Australian Rugby Union Touring Team (the Wallabies), 80 % wore <b>mouthguards</b> and of these, 75 % believed that wearing <b>mouthguards</b> should be made compulsory for Rugby players. A comparison of these and other findings is made with previous studies in Rugby, and also with a similar study of the 1984 Great Britain Rugby League Touring Team...|$|R

Umaga was the first New Zealander to receive the award. The Welsh Rugby Union also presented him with a figurine to honour the display of sportsmanship.|$|E
25|$|Men's field {{lacrosse}} protective equipment {{contains a}} pair of gloves, elbow pads, shoulder pads, helmet, and <b>mouthguard.</b> Pads differ in size and protection from player to player based on position, ability, comfort and preference. For example, many attack players wear larger and more protective elbow pads {{to protect themselves from}} checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less protective pads due to their smaller possibility of being checked. A goalkeeper must also wear a large protective chest pad to cover their stomach and chest and a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet to protect them from shots hitting their windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.|$|E

Game 6 was played on June 16, exactly one year after Golden State won Game 6 of the 2015 NBA Finals, which was also played in Cleveland. Unlike in the 2015 NBA Finals, however, the Warriors failed to clinch the title in Game 6. The Warriors were outscored 11–31 by the Cavaliers in the first quarter, and Cleveland never relinquished their lead as Golden State lost 101–115. This was {{only the second time}} in 105 games this season (regular-season and postseason) that the Warriors lost at least two straight games in a row. The loss evened the series at three games apiece, forcing a Game 7, the first Game 7 in an NBA Finals appearance in Golden State franchise history. During the fourth quarter of Game 6, Stephen Curry, who set the record for most three-pointers in an NBA Finals series during the game (28), fouled out with his sixth personal foul. Curry angrily responded by throwing his <b>mouthguard</b> into the stands and hit a fan, which resulted in a technical foul and the first ejection of his career. It was the first time in 20 years that a player had been ejected from an NBA Finals game. After the game, Curry received a $25,000 fine for his actions, but was not suspended for Game 7. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr also received a $25,000 fine for his criticism of the officiating, which he felt was biased against Curry, in the post-game press conference.|$|E

A sample of 321 university students participating on 555 player occasions was studied in a cross-sectional survey. No statistically significant differences (p greater than 0. 05) were found between wearers and non-wearers of <b>mouthguards</b> with respect to head and neck injuries in general and to oral injuries in particular.

500|$|While {{starting}} for {{an injured}} John David Booty in 2007, Sanchez wore a custom <b>mouthguard</b> that featured {{the colors of}} the Mexican flag in honor of his heritage. It became a prominent issue after a nationally televised game against Notre Dame. The mouthpiece became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of unity—Sanchez accepting his heritage; for critics, the gesture symbolized a radical political statement. Sanchez, who {{was born and raised in}} the United States, received hate mail urging him to return to Mexico. Sanchez responded to the controversy stating, [...] "It’s not a Mexican power thing or anything like that. It’s just a little bit of pride in our heritage. Hopefully, it inspires somebody and it’s all for the best." [...] Overwhelmed by the attention and shying away from politics, Sanchez stopped wearing the mouthpiece, but began participating in other efforts to help the Hispanic community.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle.

The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a <b>mouthguard,</b> and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E

There is now a fair body of knowledge indicating their success with respect to reduction of dental injuries. However, no human study appears to have investigated the ability of <b>mouthguards</b> to attenuate force directed upwards across the jaw to the head (an upper-cut blow).
