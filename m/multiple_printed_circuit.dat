In very old designs, copper wires were the discrete connections between card connector pins, but printed circuit boards soon became the standard practice. The Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and peripherals were housed on individual printed circuit boards, which were plugged into the backplane. The ubiquitous S-100 bus of the 1970s is an example of this type of backplane system.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical And Electronic Engineering) In this dissertation, an {{investigation}} into reducing Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) through design is presented. Root generation mechanisms of Electromagnetic Interference are often neglected during the design process and later treated symptomatically. Mitigation of Electromagnetic Interference at source often reduces cost and physical size of electronics. This dissertation demonstrates the process and results by which schematic balance mitigates EMI. In addition, the introduction of Geometric Balance and physically designing circuits to be Geometrically Symmetrical are presented and tested {{to determine whether the}} design produces mitigating EMI results. <b>Multiple</b> <b>Printed</b> <b>Circuit</b> Boards (PCB’s) were developed and tested against each other to demonstrate schematic balance and other EMI generation mechanisms.

40|$|Prior to the mid 1980 s, the {{dominance}} of through-hole packaging of integrated circuits (ICs) provided easy access to nearly every pin of every chip on a printed circuit board. Providing accessibility and controllability for board testing was {{simply a matter of}} probing the board. With the advent of surface mount packaging, the accessibility for probing printed circuit boards began to diminish. Logic cores being integrated onto chips made them inaccessible as well. One of the solutions to address this problem eventually became standardized and is defined in IEEE STD 1149. 1. On the printed circuit board level, this standard has become widely used. The classic method of probing boards at accessible test points is still widely used as well, and there are often hybrid test solutions that leverage both “bed-of-nails ” testing and the IEEE STD 1149. 1 standard test bus. Decisions for whether or not to use one versus the other are predicated on cost and familiarity with the techniques and architecture. The scope of this paper addresses the application of the IEEE STD 1149. 1 test bus standard for system-level applications, which are considered to be systems with <b>multiple</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> boards in a backplane configuration.

40|$|The {{supercritical}} {{carbon dioxide}} (S-CO₂) cycle is a promising advanced power conversion cycle which couples nicely to many Generation IV nuclear reactors. This work investigates the power conversion system design and proposes several "Third Generation" plant layouts for power ratings ranging between 20 and 1200 MWe for the recompression cycle. A 20 MWe simple cycle layout was also developed. The cycle designs are characterized by a dispersed component layout in which a single shaft turbomachinery train is coupled to parallel arrays of <b>multiple</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> heat exchanger modules. This configuration has arrangement benefits in terms of modularity, inspectability, repairability and replaceability. Compared to the prior second generation dispersed layouts, its lower ductwork pressure drop confers approximately 2 % higher thermal efficiency. Two alternative S-CO₂ cycle designs for medium power applications were developed using an in-house optimization computer code and Solid Edge software. The first design is a recompression cycle derived from the 300 MWe design developed at MIT for Generation IV reactors. The design employs one turbine, two compressors (main and recompression) working in parallel and two recuperators (high and low temperature) and maximizes cycle efficiency while striving for a small plant footprint. The second design is a simple S-CO₂ power cycle, which has only one turbine, one compressor, and one recuperator. The main focus of the simple S-CO₂ design is cycle compactness and simplicity while achieving still attractive efficiency. Extensive sensitivity studies were performed for both the medium power recompression and simple S-CO₂ cycles to reveal areas for performance improvement, or performance degradation. Cycle efficiency is most sensitive to turbine inlet temperature. (cont.) Peak cycle pressure {{is also an important}} parameter affecting cycle efficiency, although to a smaller extent than turbine inlet temperature. Higher pressure gives higher efficiency, but this gradually saturates around 28 MPa. Other sensitivity studies included turbomachinery performance, cooling water temperature, and heat exchanger fouling and plugging The reference parameters chosen are a 650 °C turbine inlet temperature and 20 MPa peak cycle pressure (compressor outlet) because they reach a high thermodynamic efficiency (~/~ 47 - 48 %) while staying within materials limitations. In order to couple the cycle to many of the Generation IV nuclear reactors a second reference case was chosen with a turbine inlet temperature of 550 °C and a peak cycle pressure of 20 MPa. by Jonathan Paul Gibbs.
