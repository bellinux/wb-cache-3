This paper will show that the proposed layout will increase the typing speed and be flexible for thumb. Traditional cell phone keypad is not a scientific keypad from the frequency point of view. Approaches have been explored to speed up the typing process. We found that no manufacturer has considered the frequency of the alphabet. The current architecture does not provide flexibility although the users are accustomed to the currently available <b>multi-tapping</b> keypad. Since the currently available keypad layouts are not best suited for users, this paper will suggest a keypad for cell phone and other cellular device based on the frequency of the alphabet in English language and also with the view of structure of human finger movements to provide a flexible and fast cell phone keypad. It also takes into consideration the key jamming problem that was available in typewriter. At first we identified those keys of cell phone, which are easily reachable and create less pressure on the thumb. Thus the key frequency order is calculated from anatomical point of view.

Experiments were designed using three H. brasiliensis clones (PB 235, RRIM 600 and GT (1)) in the same polyclonal plot at the Chachoengsao Rubber Research Centre (CRRC-DOA) in Thailand. Treatments were carried out on previously untapped trees (growth potential control), trees tapped without stimulation (1 / 2 S d/ 3 6 d/ 7 9 m/ 12, physiological control), and trees tapped with ethephon stimulation (1 / 2 S d/ 3 6 d/ 7 9 m/ 12 ET 2. 5 % 5 /y and 12 /y).

More and more schools are testing them with their pupils {{in the hope of}} bringing pedagogic benefits. With this new type of devices, new interactions become possible. A lot of studies have been done on the manipulation of 3 D objects with 2 D input devices but we are just at the beginning of studies that made a link between needs of pedagogy and possibilities of these new types of interactions. FINGERS © is an application for learning spatial geometry. It’s written for pupils from 9 to 12 years old. Interactions have been designed with teachers. Some interactions are specifics for 3 D geometry (3 DOF translations, rotations, nets, combinations of cubes, etc) and someone are general like designation or multi-selection. A lot of grammars of gesture propose a set of interactions to select an object or a group of objects. <b>Multi-taps</b> or lasso around an area are commonly adopted interactions.

In this work we use the freedom of the planar format to fabricate a single-side-band suppression (SSBS) module combining regular and phase shifted gratings on a single chip. These devices are fabricated by direct UV grating writing (DGW) technology on a silica-on-silicon platform. This method involves focusing two crossed laser beams (diameter ~ 6 μm) into the photosensitive core of a planar sample. UV irradiation (λ= 244 nm) increases the refractive index in this layer. Precise translation of the sample and modulation of the laser intensity both defines the channel waveguide and simultaneously creates the grating structure. This technique provides the unique ability to insert phase shifts and change the modulation strength of the grating at the micron level. The PHT realized using this technique has an optimized apodised planar Bragg grating with a π-phase shift in the grating section [4]. An ideal Hilbert transform spectrum exhibits a constant amplitude response and an abrupt π-phase shift along the wavelength. The experimental data of the current PHT is presented in Figure 1...|$|R

50|$|A blender {{consists}} of a housing, motor, blades, and food container. A fan-cooled electric motor is secured into the housing by way of vibration dampers, and a small output shaft penetrates the upper housing and meshes with the blade assembly. Usually, a small rubber washer provides a seal around the output shaft to prevent liquid from entering the motor. Most blenders today have multiple speeds. As a typical blender has no gearbox, the multiple speeds are often implemented using a universal motor with multiple stator windings and/or <b>multi-tapped</b> stator windings; in a blender with electromechanical controls, the button (or other electrical switching device or position) for each different speed connects a different stator winding/tap or combination thereof. Each different combination of energized windings produces a different torque from the motor, which yields a different equilibrium speed in balance against the drag (resistance to rotation) of the blade assembly {{in contact with the}} material inside the food container. A notable exception from the mid-1960s is the Oster Model 412 Classic VIII (with the single knob) providing the lowest speed (Stir) using the aforementioned winding tap method but furnishing higher speeds (the continuously variable higher speed range is marked Puree to Liquify) by means of a mechanical speed governor that balances the force provided by flyweights against a spring force varied by the control knob when it is switched into the higher speed range. With this arrangement, when not set to the Stir speed, motor speed is constant even with varying load up to the point where power demanded by the load is equal to the motor's power capability at a particular speed. The more modern version of this arrangement is electronic speed control found on some units.|$|R
40|$|Advances in sensor {{technologies}} and integrated electronics are revolutionizing how humans access and receive healthcare. However, many envisioned wearable or implantable {{systems are not}} deployable in practice due to high energy consumption and anatomically-limited size constraints, necessitating large form-factors for external devices, or eventual surgical re-implantation procedures for in-vivo applications. Since communication and energy-management sub-systems often dominate the power budgets of personal biomedical devices, this thesis explores alternative usecases, system architectures, and circuit solutions to reduce their energy burden. For wearable applications, a system-on-chip is designed that both communicates and delivers power over an eTextiles network. The transmitter and receiver front-ends are at least {{an order of magnitude}} more efficient than conventional body-area networks. For implantable applications, two separate systems are proposed that avoid reimplantation requirements. The first system extracts energy from the endocochlear potential, an electrochemical gradient found naturally within the inner-ear of mammals, in order to power a wireless sensor. Since extractable energy levels are limited, novel sensing, communication, and energy management solutions are proposed that leverage duty-cycling to achieve enabling power consumptions that are at least an order of magnitude lower than previous work. Clinical measurements show the first system demonstrated to sustain itself with a mammalian-generated electrochemical potential operating as the only source of energy into the system. The second system leverages the essentially unlimited number of re-charge cycles offered by ultracapacitors. To ease patient usability, a rapid wireless capacitor charging architecture is proposed that employs a <b>multi-tapped</b> secondary inductive coil to provide charging times that are significantly faster than conventional approaches. by Patrick Philip Mercier.

40|$|Since 2004 Imperial College {{has been}} {{developing}} the world’s first application-specific instrumentation aiming at the on-line, in-situ, physiochemical monitoring of adult stem cell cultures. That effort is internationally known as the ‘Intelligent Stem Cell Culture Systems’ (ISCCS) project. The ISCCS platform is formed by the functional integration of biosensors, interfacing electronics and bioreactors. Contrary to the PCB-level ISCCS platform the work presented in this thesis relates to the realization of a miniaturized cell culture monitoring platform. Specifically, this thesis details the synthesis and fabrication of pivotal VLSI circuit blocks suitable {{for the construction of}} a miniaturized microelectronic cell monitoring platform. The thesis is composed of two main parts. The first part details the design and operation of a two-stage current-input currentoutput topology suitable for three-electrode amperometric sensor measurements. The first stage is a CMOS-dual rail-class AB-current conveyor providing a low impedancevirtual ground node for a current input. The second stage is a novel hyperbolic-sinebased externally-linear internally-non-linear current amplification stage. This stage bases its operation upon the compressive sinh− 1 conversion of the interfaced current to an intermediate auxiliary voltage and the subsequent sinh expansion of the same voltage. The proposed novel topology has been simulated for current-gain values ranging from 10 to 1000 using the parameters of the commercially available 0. 8 μm AMS CMOS process. Measured results from a chip fabricated in the same technology are also reported. The proposed interfacing/amplification architecture consumes 0. 88 - 95 μW. The second part describes the design and practical evaluation of a 13. 56 MHz frequency shift keying (FSK) short-range (5 cm) telemetry link suitable for the monitoring of incubated cultures. Prior to the design of the full FSK radio system, a pair of 13. 56 MHz antennae are characterized experimentally. The experimental S-parameter-value determination of the 13. 56 MHz wireless link is incorporated into the Cadence Design Framework allowing a high fidelity simulation of the reported FSK radio. The transmitter of the proposed system is a novel <b>multi-tapped</b> seven-stage ring-oscillator-based VCO whereas the core of the receiver is an appropriately modified phase locked loop (PLL).
