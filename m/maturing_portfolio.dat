40|$|Cross-border {{venture capital}} {{investing}} {{has increased dramatically}} {{over the last two}} decades. Previous research has shown that foreign venture capitalists tend to partner with local venture capitalists as a strategy for offsetting information asymmetries and liabilities of foreignness. This paper examines the choice of co-investors by foreign venture capitalists investing in the Chinese market. We find that foreign investors are more likely to choose Chinese investors in later investment rounds and in more <b>mature</b> <b>portfolio</b> firms. More experienced foreign venture capital firms are less likely to co-invest with Chinese venture capitalists. Also, having a Chinese office made foreign venture capitalists less likely to co-invest. In seed-stage investments, when risks are the greatest, foreign firms are least likely to co-invest with Chinese venture capitalists, while at the later stage, when risks are presumably the lowest is when they are most likely to co-invest. During this period, the propensity to co-invest with Chinese venture capitalists increased significantly in every stage except the seed stage. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a panel {{data set}} {{of more than}} 600 Dutch pension funds (PFs) between 1992 and 2006, we {{investigate}} asset allocation behavior of Dutch PFs across multiple asset classes. We find that domestic investments, also known as home bias, in portfolio choices of Dutch institutional investors have fallen. We also find that {{the introduction of the}} euro, the dot-com crisis (1999 – 2001) and individual PF's characteristics are significant determinants of home bias. Overall, <b>mature</b> PFs’ <b>portfolios</b> are diversified internationally, whereas large PFs seem to prefer to only scale up their foreign, less-risky positions at the expense of domestic fixed-income positions. The effect of the dot-com crisis is more pronounced for domestic bonds, whereas the introduction of the euro was more important for domestic equities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tries to}} {{determine}} {{the magnitude of the}} product cannibalization on generic purchasing decision and the consequent effort towards attitudinal conflict regarding the purchasing decision of consumers. This paper contributes a generic framework for analyzing product cannibalization. Although the factors affecting product cannibalization in <b>mature</b> product <b>portfolios</b> have been well studied, issues regarding the attitudinal conflict of consumers and its impact on consumers purchasing decision have not been addressed in the context of cannibalization. Since it is critical to be able to estimate the impact of a new product on purchasing behavior of consumers, this paper presents a descriptive model to discuss the issues associated with product cannibalization, specifically the impact of new product introduction on an existing product portfolio. The information processing model and different qualitative measures {{that can be used to}} understand the impact of cannibalization on consumer’s purchasing decision are discussed; along with case studies to illustrate the cannibalization effects caused attitudinal conflict to consumers...|$|R

It then uses econometric techniques to study international {{variation in the}} direction of influence, quantitative, and statistical significance of determinants of participation in four categories of assets: stocks (held directly and indirectly), principal residence, private businesses, and real estate other than the primary residence. Effects of the following characteristics are compared across different asset categories and across different countries: education, bequest motives, position in the (non-capital) income and net wealth distribution, self-reported bad health, ability to recall information, and occupational status. The paper also finds significant and asset-specific variation across countries, likely to reflect lack of integration in asset markets. Finally, the paper documents international differences in levels of asset holdings, using the US as the benchmark, and decomposes observed differences into a part due to differences in configuration of characteristics of asset holder pools, and into another due to lack of integration of the respective asset markets...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{issues related}} to initial public offering (IPO) and venture capital activities. The thesis first investigates venture capitalists' exits (Le. through IPO, M&A, Liquidation and LBO routes) from their investee companies for a sample of 5059 investments by UK venture capital firms during the period between 1990 and 2006. The time to exit is modelled non-parametrically using cumulative distribution function and parametrically using a frailty model and cumulative distribution function. The evidence shows that venture capital investors tend to exit their portfolios within 7 years after the investments. The time to exit from portfolio companies are shorter in North America than in Europe {{and the rest of}} the world. This is likely to be the effect of a developed venture capital market in North America more than in Europe {{and the rest of the}} world. I find that experienced venture capital firms as measured by age tend to hold their investments in portfolio companies much longer than inexperienced venture capital providers. In addition, venture capital investors are likely to exit <b>mature</b> <b>portfolios</b> through the M&A route, while young target companies do so through the IPO route. The thesis also evaluates the risk and returns of venture capital syndicated investments between the US and Europe from 1995 to 2006 for a sample of 8780 investments. Of these 6008 investments are exited through IPO route and 2780 are exited via non-IPO method. I find that venture capital returns are higher than market returns. For early stage investments the average returns are 111 percent, while for expansion and later stage investments the returns are 97 and 82. 2 percent respectively. I find evidence that the returns are high during the bubble period and also for some sectors (Le. Information technology, Noncyclical consumer goods and Non-cyclical service). The systematic risk (beta) is higher than the market beta for early stage investments. Third and final, the thesis investigates the survival profiles of companies across the globe floated on the Alternative Investments Market (AIM) from its inception in 1995 to the end of 2004. In addition, it compares the survival rates of venture and non-venture backed companies. For a sample of 918 companies admitted to the market, I find survival rates are broadly comparable to North American IPOs, and conclude that, contrary to allegation by the US stock market regulator, AIM is not a casino. I identify four regulatory levers: (minimum) requirements on public float, company age (or trading record), size (Le., market capitalization) and the role (reputation) of the nominated advisors (Nomad). I find that the chances of survival increase with three regulatory levers (company age, size, and Nomad reputation). I find that IPOs incorporated in the UK have higher survival rates than non-UK incorporated IPOs by approximately 2. 29 years. I also find that consistent with US evidence, initial IPO returns have a positive impact on survival rate. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{portfolio}} by students during their studies {{has the potential to}} enhance the development of generic graduate attributes and to provide them with a springboard into their professional careers. As part of an evaluation of their potential use first year engineering students were required to build {{a portfolio}} as part of a compulsory design unit. The portfolio was developed using an ePortfolio tool, CareerHub Portfolio, at the University of Tasmania (UTas) in 2004. The trial was judged a success with a set of very <b>mature</b> and reflective <b>portfolios</b> being submitted, and the students found both the reflection process required to generate the portfolio and collection of information to be a useful exercise. Based on the trial outcomes the use of portfolios will be expanded in 2006. As part of its ongoing teaching and learning developments the School of Engineering at UTas has increasingly focussed on the need for graduates to develop a set of generic skills during their degree program [1]. These generic graduate attributes are skills that are required in the workplace, and that are generally considered to be attributes of professional people. Th...|$|R
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsVincent Amanor-BoaduMost {{corporations}} seem {{geared to}} buy assets, not sell them. Estimates suggest corporations acquire three businesses {{for every one}} they divest (Mankins 2008). A corporation with a disciplined approach to divestiture seems more likely to sharpen strategic focus and deliver value to shareholders. This thesis defines and explores {{the concept of an}} orphan product as an opportunity for divestiture from a parent company and subsequent acquisition for a startup company. Orphan product is defined by reviewing literature and selecting the following criteria for a given product; the product has a lack of marketing support/focus, the product is not considered core to the parent company, product sales trend over a 5 -year time frame is decreasing, cash flows are uncertain, market growth for the category the product competes in is smaller than the industry average, the product life cycle position is <b>mature,</b> and <b>portfolio</b> synergy is low due to the parent company having other products that deliver similar benefits. A scorecard is developed and used to score orphan characteristics of four products in the animal health industry. Two of the four products analyzed are classified as orphan products and therefore potential candidates for purchase by the startup company. A Strategy Canvas is developed and value curves are assigned per product to show how the startup company can market an acquired product relative to the critical success factors in the animal health industry (Kim and Mauborgne, 2005). A framework of critical questions is posed to each product resulting in recommendations for the startup on critical success factors to eliminate, reduce, raise, or create. For the orphan products, a recommendations include: raise price, increase marketing support, and/or create new factors to differentiate such as to offer additional services or to develop pricing models that are simple and clear. Application of this research can be applied to companies seeking to acquire animal health products that would like to better understand how to improve their chances for success...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} five years, {{advocacy}} and public policy grantmaking has moved away from supporting individual grantees to achieve their particular policy goals toward a more targeted, proactive approach designed to achieve the funder's policy goals. More recently, some funders have begun to explore new ways of designing advocacy and public policy grantmaking to achieve longer-term and more substantial changes in the policy landscape at large. As foundations consider how to approach their advocacy and public policy grantmaking in the future, {{a better understanding of}} this variety of approaches, and pros and cons of each among foundations with a long history of policy work, may provide options for framing and focusing such efforts. Building on research conducted in 2007 by Coffman and Campbell, this brief summarizes advocacy and public policy grantmaking approaches and their implications for grant portfolio composition and management, auxiliary supports and evaluation. "Advocacy and public policy grantmaking" refers to grantmaking in support {{of a wide range of}} advocacy activities that are intend to trigger, block, maintain, support and/or monitor changes in public policy at any level of government. The findings below emerged from an extensive literature review, as well as interviews with staff at 14 foundations and three independent consultants with in-depth policy experience. Interviewees were selected to represent an array of foundation sizes, content areas and structures, all with <b>mature</b> policy <b>portfolios.</b> Foundation staff were asked to describe their foundation's approach to advocacy and public policy grantmaking, including: The foundation's goals for its advocacy and policy grants What the foundation has learned about how best to structure grantmaking and construct a portfolio to achieve its goals What auxiliary supports (e. g., convenings, technical assistance, etc.) the foundation provides that have proven indispensable to its work How the foundation defines the role of its policy staff, and how these staff interact with other staff How the foundation designs reporting and conducts (or would like to conduct) evaluation How the foundation thinks about its role in the larger field of "actors" in the advocacy field and in relation to other funders. The assessment revealed two approaches to advocacy and public policy grantmaking for which foundation practices and processes are fairly well established: a policy target approach to achieve the passage, successful implementation and maintenance of a funder's specific policy goal; and an advocacy niche approach to strengthen the presence or influence of a particular strategic function (i. e., policy analysis and research or grassroots mobilization) within the policymaking process. In addition, the assessment identified an emerging approach to advocacy and public policy grantmaking that has yet to be well defined: a field-building approach to develop the stability and long-term adaptive capacity of a group [...] or field [...] of advocacy organizations. Many funders choose a combination of these approaches, and some prefer to be more strongly positioned within a single approach. Approaches are not mutually exclusive, and may even be mutually supportive; but each approach has unique implications for grantee selection, organizational processes, program officer roles and evaluation. This report frames a series of options for advocacy and public policy grantmaking and explores implications for foundation practices by drawing on the best experiences from the field. It presents a particular focus on what it means for foundations to design their grantmaking to build the capacity and influence of a field of advocates to tackle a wide range of policy challenges over time. As such, this brief can help foundation staff and leadership establish a common language and understand trade-offs among the different advocacy strategy paths...|$|R
