5|$|Jon Snow {{is first}} {{introduced}} in A Game of Thrones (1996), {{as he and}} his five siblings adopt six orphaned direwolf cubs. As Ned Stark's illegitimate son and with Ned's wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt removed {{from the rest of the}} Stark family. He resolves to join the Night's Watch, as his status as a bastard prevents him from holding lands or marrying into a good family. At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon's aura of superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, displays an aptitude for book learning. Jon's independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master-at-arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After learning of his father's execution, Jon resolves to desert the Night's Watch and join his half brother Robb, but the other recruits convince Jon to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. The next night, Jon saves Mormont's life by killing an undead wight. Mormont then orders a Great Ranging beyond the Wall to learn <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new threat.|$|E

25|$|The {{chlorine}} atom, written {{often as}} Cl., behaves very {{differently from the}} chlorine molecule (Cl2). The radical Cl. is long-lived in the upper atmosphere, where it catalyzes the conversion of ozone into O2. Ozone absorbs UV-B radiation, so its depletion allows <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> high energy radiation to reach the Earth's surface. Bromine atoms are even more efficient catalysts; hence brominated CFCs are also regulated.|$|E

25|$|The IAEA August 2012 report {{stated that}} Iran {{had begun to}} use 96kg of its near-20% enriched uranium to {{fabricate}} fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, which {{makes it more difficult}} to further enrich that uranium to weapons grade, since it would first need to be converted back to uranium hexafluoride gas.

25|$|As {{indicated}} by its name, this spider is not aggressive and usually bites only when pressed against human skin, {{such as when}} putting on an article of clothing. Like all sicariid spiders, the venom of the Chilean recluse contains the dermonecrotic agent, Sphingomyelinase D, which is otherwise found only in a few pathogenic bacteria. According to one study, the venom of the Chilean recluse along with the six-eyed sand spider, contains {{an order of magnitude}} <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> substance than that of other sicariid spiders such as the brown recluse. For a comparison of the toxicity of several kinds of spider bites, see the list of spiders having medically significant venom.|$|E

500|$|... "Kitty Kat" [...] was {{conceived}} partly at the Sony Music Studios, in New York City and the Record Plant Studios, in Los Angeles. It sees songwriting duties by Knowles, Pharrell Williams, Makeba Riddick {{as well as}} Shawn Carter, and utilizes production from The Neptunes, compromising of Williams and Chad Hugo. The latter also produced the song [...] "Green Light" [...] (2006). Jason Goldstein mixed [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] with assistance from Steve Tolle. Concerning the song, Knowles told MTV: [...] " [...] is [...] very sexy , talking {{about a man who}} is out with friends all night and you're left at home. And you are like, 'No <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> It's time to go.'" [...] The song appeared online through the website of Rap-Up magazine on August 23, 2006, prior to the release of B'Day.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for each day's filming, she had the Trill spots applied by makeup artist Mary Kay Morse, with Michael Westmore working on her detailing instead. This was a change from when Farrell had portrayed Jadzia, as in that case, Westmore had applied the spots himself each day. She made her first appearance in the season seven opener, [...] "Image in the Sand", for which she was required for only half a day, as she was in only one scene. [...] "I came in and I had one line — that's it, I hadn't even moved to L.A. yet and I hadn't found a place to live." [...] She began {{to understand what was}} required of her from her second episode onwards. She later explained that [...] "I never really got too freaked in the beginning. I thought <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> as the biggest job I've ever had, than going into the whole Star Trek phenomenon. I just wanted to do a good job." ...|$|E

500|$|Nimoy {{was hired}} for three episodes, {{beginning}} with the season finale. Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci described Nimoy's character as [...] "a mix of Howard Hughes and Bill Gates", while Nimoy referred to Bell as a [...] "master of the universe" [...] who is [...] "brilliant, wealthy and very powerful". Nimoy's part of the final scene of the episode with Olivia was very brief. Nimoy described the scene as [...] "interesting, entertaining" [...] and [...] "that you'll want to see <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> relationship and what it's all about". Actress Anna Torv described the final scene as calm yet threatening, [...] "That's what's kind of cool about working on Fringe, is everything seems kind of calm and lovely, but there's always something going on underneath". While shooting, Nimoy commented that the character [...] "was a unique experience," [...] as he had not acted outside of the Spock character {{for a number of}} years. Nimoy has stated in multiple interviews that his Fringe role will be the last project in his acting career.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl {{evolves into}} a {{desensitized}} character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté {{to the world}} around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Further reviews {{tended to}} be negative. IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 6.0/10, {{explaining}} [...] "It's starting {{to feel as if}} Walter's loony logic is starting to influence the actual writing of Fringe." [...] Fickett criticized Walter's science and [...] "silly ranting", Olivia's stepfather storyline, and believed certain lines of dialogue to be [...] "dangerously close to self-parody." [...] Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the episode's science, and explained [...] "I really don't want any <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> I'm tired of this formulaic series. I'm tired of Anna Torv's earnest, sad expressions—can we get this woman to laugh once or twice? Joshua Jackson and Kirk Acevedo are good supports and foils for Olivia, but there's no there there when it comes to Agent Dunham." [...] Patrick Kevin Day from the Los Angeles Times liked the opening sequence, but was distracted from fully enjoying the episode because he thought the science was [...] "wonky." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with a B, explaining he liked Chris Eigeman's presence and the efforts at further developing the characters, but questioned the Pattern storyline, despite admitting that he does not require rational scientific explanations in science fiction. Tim Grierson of New York Magazine disliked the focus on Olivia, calling it [...] "a long hour of television." [...] Referring to Olivia's [...] "feminist" [...] speech to Broyles, Grierson continued, [...] "It's sort of cute how Fringe occasionally pretends that it's more than just a freak show. But if they're going to focus on a character, it should be Walter — though we shudder to think how his flatulence will factor into the plot." ...|$|E
