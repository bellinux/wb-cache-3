50|$|In 2009, however, Ward {{noticed that}} the lowest levels of total column ozone since {{measurements}} began in 1927 occurred in 1992 and 1993 following the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo—the largest volcanic eruption since 1912. He subsequently found that similar depletion of ozone follows most volcanic eruptions, even small ones. From these observations, he argued that sulfate in ice cores is an important measure of the rate of volcanic activity, but that warming appears to result from ozone depletion by volcanic emissions of chlorine and bromine, which allows more ultraviolet-B radiation to reach Earth's surface, cooling the stratosphere and warming Earth. All eruptions deplete ozone, causing warming, but explosive eruptions, unlike effusive eruptions, also form stratospheric aerosols, which reflect and scatter sunlight, causing net cooling. He also argued that chlorine from <b>man-made</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> gases (CFCs) apparently caused the global warming observed from 1970 to 1998 by depleting the ozone layer, and that reduction of CFC emissions mandated by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer led to the Global Warming Hiatus from 1998 to 2013, during which no statistically significant warming occurred. Warming began again in August 2014 when Bárðarbunga volcano in Central Iceland erupted 85 square kilometers of basaltic lava in six months—the largest effusive volcanic eruption since 1783. As with most effusive volcanic eruptions, this one did not form cooling aerosols in the stratosphere.|$|E
40|$|Observations of {{the nearly}} inert, <b>man-made</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbon</b> CFC- 115 {{obtained}} during January 1989 are used to infer the age of air in the lower stratosphere. These observations together with estimated release rates suggest {{an average age of}} high-latitude air at pressure altitudes near 17 - 21 km of about 3 to 5 yr. This information is used together with direct measurements of HCFC- 22, HCFC- 142 b, CH 3 Br, H- 1301, H- 1211, and H- 2402 to examine the fractional dissociation of these species within the Arctic polar lower stratosphere compared to that of CFC- 11 and hence to estimate their local ozone depletion potentials in this region. It is shown that these HCFCs are much less efficiently dissociated within the stratosphere than CFC- 11, lowering their ozone depletion potentials to only about 30 - 40 percent of their chlorine loading potentials. In contrast, the observations of CH 3 Br and the Halons considered confirm that they are rapidly dissociated within the stratosphere, with important implications for their ozone depletion potentials...|$|E
40|$|After the {{discovery}} of the ozone hole in the Antarctica 1), several studies have been conducted in order to study the chemical/physical mechanisms of ozone depletion 2). As a result, it was revealed that stratospheric ozone depletion is the result of catalytic chemistry involving <b>man-made</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons,</b> which is most evident in each austral spring in Antarctica...|$|R
5000|$|ATMOS observations. The Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy {{experiment}} (ATMOS) is {{an infrared}} spectrometer (a Fourier transform interferometer) {{that is designed}} to study the chemical composition of the atmosphere. In this section {{you will be able to}} read both general and detailed information as to why and how the instrument works. The ATMOS instrument has flown four times on the Space Shuttle since 1985. The predecessor to ATMOS, flown on aircraft and high-altitude balloon platforms, was born in the early 1970s out of concern for the effects of Super Sonic Transport exhaust products on the ozone layer. The experiment was redesigned for the Space Shuttle when the potential for ozone destruction by <b>man-made</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> was discovered and the need for global measurements became crucial.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results from}} the U. S. National Ozone Expedition (NOZE) to Antarctica are reviewed. The NOZE {{ozonesonde}} measurements showed significant vertical structure in the hole, with 80 percent depletion {{in some of the}} 1 km layers but only 20 percent in adjacent layers. The depletion was confined to the 12 - 20 km region, beginning first at higher altitude and progressing downward. This is strong evidence against the theory that the ozone hole is due to solar activity producing odd nitrogen at high altitudes which is transported downwards, leading to enhanced odd-nitrogen catalytic cycles that destroy ozone. Nitrous oxide data show unusually low concentrations within the polar vortex, which is evidence against the theory that the hole is caused by a purely dynamical mechanism in which rising air motions within the polar vortex lead to reduced column densities of ozone. It is tentatively concluded that a chemical mechanism involving <b>man-made</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> is the likely cause of ozone depletion in the hole...|$|R
40|$|Mixing {{ratios of}} 3. 44 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) and 1. 23 ppbv for HCl and HF above 50 km, surrogates for total {{chlorine}} and fluorine, have been {{measured by the}} Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment on a March 1992 flight of the Space Shuttle. Compared to the measured values obtained on a 1985 flight, these correspond to a 37 % and 62 % increase for HCl and HF, respectively. The derived trend in HCl (approx. 0. 13 ppbv per year) is in good agreement with the model-predicted increase in chlorine loading of 0. 13 ppbv per year, and with the measured trends in HCl total column abundance from reported ground-based observations. The main source of this change {{can be attributed to}} the release of <b>man-made</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> (CFC's) and hydro-chloro-fluoro-carbons (HCFC's). This new value for HCl represents an upper limit to the inorganic chlorine concentration in the stratosphere available for participation in photochemical processes which destroy ozone...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} O 3 (Ozone) remains a current topic of {{research}} today, as people from scientists to political policy makers concern {{themselves with the}} issues of ozone depletion. A considerable amount of {{attention has been paid}} particularly to atmospheric ozone destruction catalyzed by the production of <b>man-made</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides. The most effective means of observing stratospheric ozone changes is through the use of space based spectroscopy. Spectral analysis of backscattered ultraviolet light yields information about O 3 abundances in the atmosphere. O 3 is the molecule responsible for a majority of ultraviolet light reflection in the Earth's atmosphere. Although extensive O 3 spectral analysis has been done on current and past orbital missions, a full characterization of ozone spectroscopy is not complete. Baseline laboratory tests of ozone are necessary to the complete understanding of ozone processes in the atmosphere but are difficult to execute and are therefore ongoing. In this discussion the spectroscopy of stratospheric ozone in the ultraviolet spectral range will be discussed {{within the context of the}} purpose of the Citizen Explorer 1 mission. It will be supported by a summary of past and present orbital observation missions, present laboratory experimentation, and fundamental understanding of spectroscopy and the O 3 molecule...|$|R
50|$|As {{with carbon}} dioxide and methane, there are some natural sources of tropospheric chlorine, such as sea spray. Chlorine from ocean spray is soluble and thus is washed by {{rainfall}} before it reaches the stratosphere. It is stratospheric chlorine that affects ozone depletion. Only methyl chloride, {{which is one of}} the halocarbons, has a mainly natural source, and it is responsible for about 20% of the chlorine in the stratosphere; the remaining 80% comes from <b>man-made</b> sources. <b>Chlorofluorocarbons,</b> in contrast, are insoluble and long-lived, allowing them to reach the stratosphere. In the lower atmosphere, there is much more chlorine from CFCs and related haloalkanes than there is in hydrogen chloride from salt spray, and in the stratosphere halocarbons are dominant.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Stratospheric ozone {{depletion}} through catalytic chemistry involving <b>man-made</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> {{is an area}} of focus in the study of geophysics and one of the global environmental issues of the twentieth century. This review presents a brief history of the science of {{ozone depletion}} and describes a conceptual framework to explain the key processes involved, with a focus on chemistry. Observations that may be considered as evidence (fingerprints) of ozone depletion due to chlorofluorocarbons are explored, and the related gas phase and surface chemistry is described. Observations of ozone and of chlorine-related trace gases near 40 km provide evidence that gas phase chemistry has indeed currently depleted about 10 % of the stratospheric ozone there as predicted, and the vertical and horizontal struc-tures of this depletion are fingerprints for that process. More striking changes are observed each austral spring in Antarctica, where about half of the total ozone column is depleted each September, forming the Antarctic ozone hole. Measurements of large amounts of C 10, a key ozone destruction catalyst, are among the finger-prints showing that human releases of chlorofluorocarbons are the primary cause of this change. Enhanced ozone depletion in the Antarctic and Arctic regions is linked to heterogeneous chlorine chemistry that occurs on the surfaces of polar stratospheric clouds at cold temperatures. Observations also show that some of the same heterogeneous chemistry occurs on the surfaces of particles present at midlatitudes as well, and the abundances of these particles are enhanced following explosive volcanic eruptions. The partitioning of chlorine between active forms that destroy ozone and inert reservoirs that sequester it is a central part of the framework for our understanding of the 40 -km ozone decline, the Antarctic ozone hole, the recent Arctic ozone losses in particularly cold years, and the observation of record midlatitude ozone depletion after the major eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the early 1990 s. As human use of chlorofluorocarbons continues to decrease, these changes throughout the ozone layer are expected to gradually reverse during the twenty-first century. 1...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{industrial}} revolution of the last 250 years, trace gases have {{had a significant impact}} on the climate. Of particular relevance to this work are species which facilitate the destruction of stratospheric ozone. In this thesis, I focus on four of these species. Understanding the release, reaction and transport pathways of the <b>man-made</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> (CFCs) could help us to mitigate their destructive effect. Previous studies have found that both source and sink processes significantly alter the isotopic composition of trace gases (e. g. N 2 O and CFC- 12). Measuring these changes can be used to better constrain the interaction of these gases with the atmosphere. Atmospheric histories of δ(37 Cl) and δ(13 C) in CFC- 11, CFC- 12 and CFC- 113 are presented, covering the last 20 – 60 years. Air samples came from Greenland (NEEM) and Antarctic (Fletcher Promontory) polar firn, with additional samples taken from an archive of Southern Hemispheric background air (Cape Grim, Tasmania). This study extends the novel approach to measuring trace gas isotope ratios in small air volumes (200 – 600 ml), using a single-collector gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system. Carbonyl sulphide (COS) is the principal source of sulphur in the stratosphere, where it breaks down into sulphate aerosol which catalyses the destruction of ozone. Air was extracted from Greenland (NEEM) and Antarctic (DE 08, DML (BAS) and DSS) ice core samples and analysed for COS and a range of other trace gas mole fractions. The COS measurements were affected by a previously unknown post-extraction growth effect, leading to higher than expected values. This study also presents new COS measurements in firn air from NEEM and the Southern Hemisphere (EDML, Antarctica). The observed increase and subsequent decrease largely reflects changes in anthropogenic emissions during the 20 th century. These measurements also indicate that regional and site-specific effects have a significant influence on the recorded atmospheric history of COS...|$|R

The MkIV Interferometer is a Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectrometer, {{designed}} and built at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1984, to remotely sense {{the composition of the}} Earth's atmosphere by the technique of solar absorption spectrometry. This was born out of concern that <b>man-made</b> pollutants (e.g. <b>chlorofluorocarbons,</b> aircraft exhaust) might perturb the ozone layer. Since 1984, the MkIV Interferometer has participated in 3 NASA DC-8 polar aircraft campaigns, and has successfully completed 15 balloon flights. In addition, the MkIV Interferometer made over 900 days of ground-based observations from many different locations, including McMurdo, Antarctica in 1986.|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of <b>man-made</b> <b>chlorofluorocarbons</b> (CFCs) in subsurface water masses {{is directly related}} to their formation rate, and the water mass formation rate can be calculated from its CFC inventory. CFC- 11 inventories between 65 °N and 10 °S in the Atlantic Ocean have been calculated for Eighteen Degree Water (EDW) and the components of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) from data collected primarily between 1996 and 1998 as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). CFC- 11 inventories for individual water masses are 5. 4 million moles for EDW, 10. 5 million moles for Upper Labrador Sea Water (ULSW) (4. 6 million moles south of 42 °N), 23. 4 million moles for Classical Labrador Sea Water (CLSW), 10. 4 million moles for Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW), and 8. 3 million moles for Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW). The estimated error for these inventories is about ± 10 %. The sum of the NADW components (ULSW, CLSW, ISOW, DSOW) is 53. 2 million moles which is about half of the total CFC- 11 inventory, 103. 8 million moles, in the North Atlantic Ocean. Maps of water column inventories illustrate the formation mechanisms and spreading pathways within these water masses. The inventories directly reflect the input of newly formed water in the North Atlantic over the time scale of the CFC transient, about 3 decades. The interior regions of the North Atlantic contain most (75 – 80 %) of the CFC- 11 inventory in NADW indicating strong recirculation and mixing of newly formed NADW from the DWBC into the interior with a time scale of 2 – 3 decades. Average water mass formation rates between 1970 and 1997 are: 3. 3 Sv for EDW, 3. 5 Sv for ULSW (2. 0 Sv from the central Labrador Sea and 1. 5 Sv from the southern Labrador Sea), 8. 2 Sv for CLSW, 5. 7 Sv for ISOW, and 2. 2 Sv for DSOW. Estimated errors are ± 20 % for CLSW and ± 16 % for the other water masses. The total for NADW, which forms the deep limb of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, is 19. 6 Sv. An extensive test of the effects of temporal variability on the average formation rate calculated from the CFC inventory indicates that the error introduced by the assumption of a constant water mass formation rate is no greater than 15 % for CLSW and 10 % for the other water masses. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of ozone {{in the atmosphere}} has become increasingly important {{over the past two}} decades. Significant increases of ozone concentrations in the lower atmosphere, or troposphere, and decreases in the upper atmosphere, or stratosphere, have been attributed to man-made causes. High ozone concentrations in the troposphere pose a health hazard to plants and animals and can add to global warming. On the other hand, ozone in the stratosphere serves as a protective barrier against strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. <b>Man-made</b> CFC's (<b>chlorofluorocarbons)</b> act as a catalyst with a free oxygen atom and an ozone molecule to produce two oxygen molecules therefore depleting the protective layer of ozone in the stratosphere. The beneficial and harmful effects of ozone require the study of ozone creation and destruction processes in the atmosphere. Therefore, to provide an accurate model of these processes, an ozone lidar system must be able to be used frequently with as large a measurement range as possible. Various methods can be used to measure atmospheric ozone concentrations. These include different airborne and balloon measurements, solar occulation satellite techniques, and the use of lasers in lidar (high detection and ranging,) systems to probe the atmosphere. Typical devices such as weather balloons can only measure within the direct vicinity of the instrument and are therefore used infrequently. Satellites use solar occulation techniques that yield low horizontal and vertical resolution column densities of ozone...|$|R
40|$|The {{stratospheric ozone}} layer protects life on Earth from {{the harmful effects of}} solar ultravioiet radiation. The ozone layer is {{currently}} in a fragile state because of depletion caused by <b>man-made</b> chemicals, especially <b>chlorofluorocarbons.</b> The state of the ozone layer is being monitored and evaluated by scientific experts around the world, in order to help policy makers assess the impacts of international protocols that control the production and release of ozone depleting chemicals. Scientists use a variety ozone measurements and models in order to form a comprehensive picture about {{the current state of the}} ozone layer, and to predict the future behavior (expected to be a recovery, as the abundance of the depleting chemicals decreases). Among the data sets used, those from satellite-borne instruments have the advantage of providing a wealth of information about the ozone distribution over most of the globe. Several instruments onboard American and international satellites make measurements of the properties of the atmosphere, from which atmospheric ozone amounts are estimated; long-term measurement programs enable monitoring of trends in ozone. However, the characteristics of satellite instruments change in time. For example, the instrument lenses through which measurements are made may deteriorate over time, or the satellite orbit may drift so that measurements over each location are made later and later in the day. These changes may increase the errors in the retrieved ozone amounts, and degrade the quality of estimated ozone amounts and of their variability. Our work focuses on combining the satellite ozone data with global models that capture atmospheric motion and ozone chemistry, using advanced statistical techniques: this is known as data assimilation. Our method provides a three-dimensional global ozone distribution that is consistent with both the satellite measurements and with our understanding of processes (described in the models) that control ozone distribution. Through the monitoring of statistical properties of the agreement between the data and the model, this approach also enables us to detect changes in the quality of ozone data retrieved from satellite-borne instrument measurements. This paper demonstrates that calculations of the changes in satellite data quality, and the impact these changes on the estimates of the global ozone distribution, can assist in maintaining the uniform quality of the satellite ozone data throughout the lifetime of these instruments, thus contributing to our understanding of long-term ozone change...|$|R
