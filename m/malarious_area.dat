50|$|The malarial season came too. The Bekaa {{valley is}} a highly <b>malarious</b> <b>area,</b> and from 4 April every {{possible}} weapon was turned against its bearer, the too friendly anopheles mosquito. Anti-malaria squads could be seen prowling the area spraying stagnant water with insecticide. Complicated personal precautions appeared in routine orders—mosquito nets to be tucked in round blankets at dusk, sleeping quarters sprayed every morning, face nets and gloves for sentries, repellent cream smeared on exposed skin. You even saw inspecting officers running their fingers along a man's cheek {{to see if he}} had greased himself properly. Later in April, when summer clothes were issued, the unlovely Bombay bloomers at last came into their own, being unhitched and let down below the knee at dusk to dissuade the ‘mossies’. In 18 Battalion, as in every other unit, the men were apt to look on all these precautions with a tolerant contempt, and observe them when convenient. But {{this was not the case}} with typhus, which was reported in the Bekaa valley in March. This most unpleasant disease commanded more respect among the Kiwis, who were quite ready to co-operate by obeying ‘out of bounds’ restrictions where typhus was concerned.|$|E

40|$|DESIGN: Malarial anaemia is a {{major problem}} in many {{developing}} countries and often occurs more frequently in first pregnancies, as primigravidae are more susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum malaria and are at excess risk of malarial anaemia. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To analyse the excess risk of anaemia in primigravidae as a potential indicator of malaria control and exposure in pregnant women living in sub-Saharan Africa. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for anaemia in first compared with later pregnancies are calculated for 27 studies from malarious and 7 studies from nonmalarious areas. SETTING: Surveys of pregnancy anaemia reported for highly <b>malarious</b> and nonmalarious <b>areas.</b> RESULTS: In <b>malarious</b> <b>areas,</b> the weighted odds ratio for excess anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] < 11 g/dl) in primigravidae compared with multigravidae for all studies was 1. 34 (95 % CI 1. 14 - 1. 58). At an Hb cutoff below 8 g/dl, the weighted odds ratio was 1. 79 (95 % CI 1. 52 - 2. 10). In nonmalarious areas, there was no increased risk of anaemia in primigravidae with Hb below 11 g/dl (OR 0. 80; 95 % CI 0. 63 - 1. 90) or below 8 g/dl (OR 0. 82, 95 % CI 0. 51 - 1. 28). CONCLUSIONS: In view of the consistency of results across highly <b>malarious</b> <b>areas</b> compared with nonmalarious areas, maternal anaemia {{has the potential to be}} used for surveillance of malaria control in pregnancy. Based on the analysis, an anaemia nomogram is developed for use as a surveillance indicator in <b>malarious</b> <b>areas</b> in sub-Saharan Afric...|$|R

The data also show that clinical resistance to malaria in this part of the world includes resistance to Plasmodium falciparum gametocytemia and that this is not the passive byproduct of a reduction in asexual parasites. This indicates that the introduction of native people into a populated <b>malarious</b> <b>area</b> will increase the percent of gametocyte carriers and may, thereby, increase the entomologic inoculation rate...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} sera on the cytoadherence in vitro of Plasmodium falciparum-infected {{erythrocytes}} to melanoma cells was examined. Sera from 19 healthy individuals living in endemic <b>malarious</b> <b>areas</b> in Thailand and 24 patients with P. falciparum malaria were tested against four local P. falciparum isolates. Out of 57 sera examined, 12 (21 %) showed significant inhibition (greater than 50 %) of cytoadherence {{for at least}} one isolate. Anti-malarial IgG antibody titres were determined for all 57 sera and although 11 of the 12 inhibitory sera had relatively high titres, 36 out of 47 sera with similarly high titres showed no significant inhibitory activity. Convalescent sera were no more effective than corresponding acute sera in inhibiting the cytoadherence of erythrocytes infected with any of the four heterologous isolates examined. Sera which significantly inhibited cytoadherence were also capable of reversing cytoadherence, and pooled plasma, from healthy individuals living in <b>malarious</b> <b>areas,</b> was effective in significantly reversing the in vitro cytoadherence of all the five parasite isolates examined.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{the first two years of}} {{implementation}} of a large scale trial of insecticide-treated curtains in Burkina Faso are summarised in this presentation. The trial was conducted in a highly <b>malarious</b> <b>area</b> and involved a population of slightly less than 100, 000, distributed in 158 villages over an area of almost 1000 km 2. A remarkable impact on entomological parameters (Anopheles density, sporozoite rate, entomological inoculation rate) was accompanied by a relatively modest reduction of parasitological indices (prevalence and density of Plasmodium falciparum). All-cause mortality in children 0. 5 to 5 year old showed over two years a 15 % decline. The authors believe that the wide surface of the protected zone and the almost total coverage achieved in the intervention villages were the major determinants of the observed reduction of transmission.

40|$|Abstract. We {{measured}} the seasonal abundance and bloodfeeding behavior of species A and C of the mosquito Anopheles minimus Theobald 1901 in an endemic <b>malarious</b> <b>area</b> of western Thailand.

Methods: Wild live An. stephensi samples were collected from different <b>malarious</b> <b>areas</b> in southern Iran. The biological forms were identified based on number of egg-ridges. Molecular characterization of biological forms was verified by analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I and II (mtDNA-COI/COII). The Plasmodium infection was examined in the wild female specimens by species-specific nested–PCR method. Results: Results showed that all three biological forms including mysorensis, intermediate and type {{are present in the}} study areas. Molecular investigations revealed no genetic variation between mtDNA COI/COII sequences of the biological forms and no Plasmodium parasites was detected in the collected mosquito samples. Conclusions: Presence of three biological forms with identical sequences showed that the known biological forms belong to a single taxon and the various vectorial capacities reported for these forms are more likely corresponded to other epidemiological factors than to the morphotype of the populations. Lack of malaria parasite infection in An. stephensi, the most important vector of malaria, may be partly due to the success and achievement of ongoing active malaria control program in the region...|$|R
40|$|Background: Plasmodium vivax malaria {{accounts}} for approximately 88 % of malaria cases in Iran. There is limited in&shy;formation on genetic diversity of P. vivax {{in the country}} and a need to develop and apply an effective vaccine against the dis&shy;ease is necessary. Among many potential candidates, MSP - 3 &beta; gene is promising target. This study was designed and car&shy;ried out to determine the variation of this gene as genetic marker in population of <b>malarious</b> <b>areas</b> of Iran. Methods: Blood sample of 85 P. vivax isolates from four southern and east-southern provinces of the country assessed for poly&shy;morphism of PvMSP- 3 &beta; gene by PCR/RFLP method. Results:&nbsp; Based on the size of PCR product of the gene, 7 genetically different types of parasite has been distinguished. Two alleles were simultaneously visible in 19 % of the cases. Results from PCR/RFLP analysis of PvMSP- 3 &beta; gene showed at least 15 allelic groups. Multiple infections have been found in 2. 4 % of the cases. Conclusion: PvMSP- 3 &beta; gene was highly diverse in P. vivax isolates of <b>malarious</b> <b>areas</b> of Iran, and can be a suitable marker for population genetic studies of P. vivax.
