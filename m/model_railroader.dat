2500|$|Stewart is a {{model railway}} enthusiast. His 23 × 124 foot (≈7 × 37m) HO scale layout in his Los Angeles home is {{modelled}} after the New York Central and the Pennsylvania Railroads during the 1940s. Called the Three Rivers City, the layout was featured in the cover story of the December 2007, December 2010, February 2014, and June 2017 issues of <b>Model</b> <b>Railroader</b> magazine. In the 2007 article, Stewart said that it meant more to {{him to be in}} a model railroad magazine than a music magazine. On his Los Angeles railroad, Rod used code 70 flextrack and a DCC (Digital Command Control) system made by Digitrax. The layout has a mainline run of 900 feet. He has a smaller second layout at his UK home, based on Britain's East Coast Main Line. In a sidebar to the 2014 <b>Model</b> <b>Railroader</b> article, Stewart admitted (in an anecdote about his having unwittingly mixed red scenery texturing material into a [...] "turf" [...] mix he used around the bases of buildings) that he is colour-blind.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, a {{landmark}} N scale project layout, the Clinchfield, {{was built in}} 1978 by the late Gordon Odegard and featured {{in a series of}} articles for <b>Model</b> <b>Railroader</b> magazine. [...] The article series was also reprinted in the book Modelling the Clinchfield in N Scale by Kalmbach Publishing. [...] The Clinchfield layout measured [...] and was noteworthy for a number of reasons: 1) it was highly portable because of its modular construction, 2) it showed the potential of high scenery to track ratios possible in 1:160, 3) it used a unique aluminum frame and (at the time revolutionary) styrofoam construction to cut down on weight and 4) it was highly prototypical for the era. [...] The Clinchfield layout is one of the most famous American N scale layouts ever constructed and was awarded as the grand prize in a 1984 sweepstakes. [...] The layout was also displayed at a number of train shows and has traded ownership several times by private collectors. The prototype Clinchfield Railroad was an operating and holding company for the Carolina, Clinchfield and Ohio Railway. The layout has been refurbished, outfitted for DCC, and was shown at the 2008 N Scale Collectors National Convention in Louisville, KY.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the largest}} N scale layouts {{in the world is}} located at the San Diego Model Railroad Museum. Pacific Desert Lines [...] is a [...] layout {{featuring}} hand-laid code 40 rail. Each piece of rail is [...] (forty thousandths) high and is manually affixed to the roadbed by solder to copper-clad ties placed every 5th tie. About [...] (scale miles, actually [...] ) of mainline track are on this massive layout, as well as over 500 hand-made turnouts. Many models of local San Diego structures can be identified on the layout, including an intricate scale model of San Diego's Santa Fe Depot, the Western Metal Supply Building, the Carrizo Gorge's Goat Canyon Trestle, Palomar Observatory, the American Agar building, and the Carlsbad, California flower fields and power plant. The model of the Santa Fe depot was constructed using the actual building's blueprints and has been featured on the cover of <b>Model</b> <b>Railroader</b> magazine. The Spanish revival architecture is reproduced using epoxy castings of scale model adobe roof tiles. The Western Metal Supply Building (now part of the left field foul line in the San Diego Padres' Petco Park) was constructed using historic photographs and contains brick castings, brass-etched fire escapes, and computer-generated window panes. The detail on the Goat Canyon Trestle includes the prototype's railings, catwalks, and fire suppression system. The power plant contains fibre-optic strobe lights in its chimney. Many buildings have detailed interiors, right down to the napkin dispenser and placemats on the tables at the corner cafe. Some surfers appear in the water off the coast. The layout can be operated by manual or computer control. Trains can run completely unattended or a single operator can control the layout with the click of a mouse.|$|E
