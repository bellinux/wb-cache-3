5|$|The Winkler County nurse {{whistleblower}} {{case was}} a series of legal proceedings in West Texas that centered on the retaliation upon two nurses who submitted an anonymous state <b>medical</b> <b>board</b> complaint against a physician in 2009. The case attracted national attention for its implications on whistleblowing by nurses. After witnessing what they believed to be unsafe medical care, nurses Anne Mitchell and Vicki Galle submitted an anonymous complaint against Dr. Rolando Arafiles to the Texas <b>Medical</b> <b>Board</b> (TMB).|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, Cuba Court was {{the home}} of Denis Bowes Daly, who was a {{prominent}} member of the local ascendancy. Prior to his death in 1821 he had leased Cuba Court to the Army <b>Medical</b> <b>Board</b> on a 61-year lease. The building was little used as a hospital and the <b>Medical</b> <b>Board</b> was quite happy to give it up to the Commissioners of Education for the purpose of the Royal School, which had eventually been established {{as a result of the}} Royal Charter of 1621.|$|E

50|$|Today in the U.S. and its territories, {{there are}} seventy (70) state <b>medical</b> <b>boards</b> --- some state <b>medical</b> <b>boards</b> are {{composed}} of an M.D. board and a D.O. board while others are combined as one, called a “composite board.” Of the 70 state boards, the vast majority do not differentiate between {{any of the three}} nationally recognized multi-specialty boards of certification (ABMS, ABPS, AOABOS). In other words, the majority of the state <b>medical</b> <b>boards</b> are silent (or neutral) as to which board a given physician is certified by.|$|R

5|$|Mitchell and Galle were {{terminated}} from WCMH in June 2009. A {{few days}} later, both nurses were arrested. They {{were charged with}} misuse of official information, a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta {{rather than as a}} good faith reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law exempts <b>medical</b> <b>board</b> reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{spent a year}} in Europe {{with his}} wife and took {{post-graduate}} education in Edinburgh and London. In 1894, along with 5 other physicians, he sent a letter to Vital-Justin Grandin to support the building of a general hospital by the Grey Nuns, which was opened on December 15 of the next year. He served on the <b>medical</b> <b>board,</b> until his resignation in 1899 over a disagreement regarding patient admission. He was appointed Justice of Peace of Edmonton in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Vasey slowly recovered. In October 1944, Blamey {{set up a}} Post-War Army Planning Committee {{headed by}} Vasey {{to report on the}} future of the Royal Military College and the {{training}} and education of Staff Corps officers. Vasey called for a greatly expanded regular army of 20,000 men. His report recommended that the course at Duntroon be deepened professionally and academically to the level of an undergraduate university degree. The report's recommendations were not accepted or welcomed by the government but pointed the way to the future, in which the Army would become increasingly professional. In February 1945, Frank Forde pressed for Vasey to be given another active command. Blamey, who still had doubts about Vasey's physical fitness despite Vasey being given an A by an Army <b>medical</b> <b>board,</b> reluctantly appointed him to command the 6th Division, then in action in the Aitape-Wewak campaign.|$|E

5|$|When {{he learned}} of the complaint, Arafiles spoke with the sheriff of Winkler County, who was his friend {{and one of his}} patients. Arafiles alleged that the nurses' reports to the <b>medical</b> <b>board</b> {{constituted}} harassment. The sheriff investigated and obtained the TMB complaint, which provided enough information about Mitchell and Galle to make them identifiable. Galle and Mitchell were terminated from the hospital and faced criminal charges of misuse of official information. Galle's charges were dropped before trial and Mitchell was acquitted by a jury. In the aftermath of Mitchell's trial, Arafiles, several county officials and a hospital administrator all faced jail time for their roles in the retaliation against the nurses.|$|E
5|$|After the {{breakout}} of the First World War, Morton travelled to Labrador {{to work in}} the Mission Hospitals there, {{before being}} made a special commissioner of the Red Cross to take supplies from Paris to the Macedonian Front and work at the field hospitals in Macedonia. Following the success of her male family members, Morton was the first women to become the Attending Surgeon at the Vanderbilt Clinic of Columbia University's Physicians and Surgeons in 1916. After returning to New York Morton, alongside Mary M. Crawford, led the American Women's Hospitals Service from 1917 after it was founded by the Medical Women's National Association with the aim of establishing American hospitals in Europe. After her request to send one thousand medical women who had volunteered for foreign service was opposed by the General <b>Medical</b> <b>Board</b> in Washington, she raised over $300,000 in 10 days through a national fundraising drive to send them. At the recommendation of William C. Gorgas, Morton was made chairman of the committee of women physicians on the United States Council of National Defense, where she represented over 7000 female doctors.|$|E
5|$|In April 1894, a Scottish {{physician}} Sir Ronald Ross visited Sir Patrick Manson at {{his house}} on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit {{was the start of}} four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius. The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a <b>medical</b> <b>board</b> headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1914, Toshack overcame many {{obstacles}} to reach international level cricket. He was orphaned as an infant, and his early cricket career was hindered because of financial difficulties {{caused by the}} Great Depression. The Second World War prevented Toshack from competing at first-class level until he was into his thirties. In 1945–46, the first season of cricket {{after the end of}} the War, Toshack made his debut at first-class level and after only seven matches in the Sheffield Shield he was selected for Australia's tour of New Zealand. In Wellington, he opened the bowling in a match that was retrospectively classed as an official Test match. Toshack became a regular member of the Australian team, playing in all of its Tests until the 1947–48 series against India. He took his career-best match bowling figures of 11 wickets for 31 runs (11/31) in the First Test but began to suffer recurring knee injuries, and a <b>medical</b> <b>board</b> had to approve his selection for the 1948 England tour. Toshack played in the first four Tests before being injured. After a long convalescence, he attempted a comeback during Australia's 1949–50 season, but further injury forced him to retire. He was a parsimonious bowler, who was popular with crowds for his sense of humour.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{reported}} to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge {{and two days}} later attended No. 2 Central <b>Medical</b> <b>Board</b> on 13 August. He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August. He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF. At Queen Mary's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm. MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm {{that would allow him}} to fly a Hurricane. They designed a limb that allowed him to operate the throttle while taking the control column and firing button with his right hand. They spent hours studying the cockpit layout. The medical staff produced an arm with four spring-loaded pins, like fingers, which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit. They secured his left arm to the levers of the throttle quadrant: throttle, propeller pitch control, supercharger and mixture control. The landing gear controls were located on the right side. The artificial arm had to interact with the control column while the gear was being retracted or lowered. His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible, though not without incident. On 7 September 1941 he force-landed in darkness during a searchlight co-operation exercise. On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low-cloud. Nevertheless, he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October.|$|E
