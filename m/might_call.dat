25|$|On {{the morning}} of February 24, 1986, Ruetten left the couple's {{condominium}} on Balboa Boulevard in Van Nuys for work before his wife. She was scheduled to give a motivational speech at work that day, a managerial tactic she did not feel was effective. To avoid it, she told Ruetten she <b>might</b> <b>call</b> in sick, using a back injury she had incurred while doing aerobics the day before as an excuse.|$|E
25|$|Ignatius {{wrote the}} Jesuit Constitutions, adopted in 1553, which created a {{centralised}} organization and stressed acceptance of any mission {{to which the}} Pope <b>might</b> <b>call</b> them. His main principle became the unofficial Jesuit motto: Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam ("For the greater glory of God"). This phrase is designed to reflect the idea that any work that is not evil can be meritorious for the spiritual life if it is performed with this intention, even things normally considered of little importance.|$|E
50|$|A {{time series}} {{database}} (TSDB) is a software {{system that is}} optimized for handling time series data, arrays of numbers indexed by time (a datetime or a datetime range). In some fields these time series are called profiles, curves, or traces. A time series of stock prices <b>might</b> be <b>called</b> a price curve. A time series of energy consumption <b>might</b> be <b>called</b> a load profile. A log of temperature values over time <b>might</b> be <b>called</b> a temperature trace.|$|R

However Amir and Asif announced they were {{to go ahead with}} their trials as planned because they wanted a decision to be reached quickly so that they could be selected for the World Cup squad.|$|E
25|$|Before containerization, {{goods were}} usually handled {{manually}} as break bulk cargo. Typically, goods would be loaded onto a vehicle {{from the factory}} and taken to a port warehouse {{where they would be}} offloaded and stored awaiting the next vessel. When the vessel arrived, they would be moved {{to the side of the}} ship along with other cargo to be lowered or carried into the hold and packed by dock workers. The ship <b>might</b> <b>call</b> at several other ports before off-loading a given consignment of cargo. Each port visit would delay the delivery of other cargo. Delivered cargo might then have been offloaded into another warehouse before being picked up and delivered to its destination. Multiple handling and delays made transport costly, time consuming and unreliable.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{decades have}} revived his secular cantatas and what one <b>might</b> <b>call</b> 'secular oratorios' or 'concert operas'. Of the former, Ode for St. Cecilia's Day (1739) (set to texts by John Dryden) and Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to {{classical}} mythology for subjects, producing such works as Acis and Galatea (1719), Hercules (1745) and Semele (1744). These works {{have a close}} kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes performed onstage by small chamber ensembles. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, {{in addition to his}} renown as instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera's great musical dramatists.|$|E

25|$|If {{someone were}} {{to behave as}} if they {{understood}} a language which no-one else can make sense of, we <b>might</b> <b>call</b> this {{an example of a}} private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a private language in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language in fact understood by one person, but a language that in principle can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it.|$|E
25|$|Practitioners {{traditionally}} {{believe that}} daily life depends on proper alignment {{and knowledge of}} one's ori. Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters, it is taken to mean {{a portion of the}} soul that determines personal destiny and success. Ashe is the life-force that runs through all things, living and inanimate. Ashe is the power to make things happen. It is an affirmation that is used in greetings and prayers, as well as a concept of spiritual growth. Orisha devotees strive to obtain Ashe through iwa-pele or gentle and good character, and in turn they experience alignment with the ori, what others <b>might</b> <b>call</b> inner peace and satisfaction with life. Ashe is divine energy that comes from Olodumare, the creator deity and is manifested through Olorun, who rules the heavens and is associated with the sun. Without the sun, no life could exist, just as life cannot exist without some degree of ashe. Ashe is sometimes associated with Eshu, the messenger Orisha. For practitioners, ashe represents a link to the eternal presence of the supreme deity, the Orishas, and the ancestors.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of Matt Dennis's Everything Happens To Me (June Christy, vocal) {{was not done}} under Kenton's aegis but with Christy's later to be husband Bob Cooper as the leader just after the second AFM recording ban. This {{is added to the}} CD and shows the continuity of Graettinger's writing and recorded works for Capitol; the chart had originally been done for the full Kenton instrumentation but was never recorded. The small 11 piece group (to include violin and cello) provides some real insight to the inner workings of Graettinger's writing. The aesture nature of his arrangement and use of pantonality (one <b>might</b> <b>call</b> it atonality in spots) makes one wonder how June Christy is able to pick off the 9th of the F minor chord {{at the top of the}} tune; there is basically no clue given by Graettinger as to what pitch is coming for the singer (the glue that holds this together is the Bb pedal point at the bottom). Interestingly, after first stating the entire tune there is a tutti ensemble section that gives way to the 'last 'A' of the form'. Also, his harmonic transitions between sections are key in their departure from the tune compared to the established harmony while June Christy sings.|$|E

25|$|Each bill {{goes through}} several stages in each house {{including}} consideration {{by a committee}} and advice from the Government Accountability Office. Most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month. Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must {{be open to the}} public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting. A committee <b>might</b> <b>call</b> for public hearings on important bills. Each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill. Then, a bill may go to what's called a mark-up session where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions. Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is tabled then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called clean bill with a new number. Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.|$|E

Brandle helped organize Branleygran Company, a construction bond underwriter, which Hague channeled construction projects towards. During the mid-1920s redevelopment of Journal Square, Brandle's Labor National Bank, founded in June 1926, acquired a new 15-story headquarters, the Labor Bank Building. Essentially Brandle controlled any construction projects in northern New Jersey, and any strikes he <b>might</b> <b>call</b> would be backed by Hague's police.|$|E

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} there are three key {{cognitive}} abilities a robot must have in order to effectively interact with humans.
