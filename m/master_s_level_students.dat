40|$|We {{would like}} to thank Professor Honeycutt (Honeycutt 1998) for his {{thoughtful}} comments on our article (Narus and Anderson 1998). As he implies, we wrote this article to begin a debate as to the scope and future of business marketing education at the master’s level rather than as the final word on its current state-of-practice. In this reply, we add several reflections on business marketing that we have gleaned from discussions with our colleagues as well as respond to a few issues that Professor Honeycutt raises. Most importantly, we use our limited space to strongly urge those in the discipline to actively pro-mote business marketing to master’s <b>level</b> <b>students</b> and educators alike. First and foremost, we {{would like to}} point out that graduate-student employment trends demand that business schools place greater em-phasis on business marketing.

To solve this problem, the current medical laws on midwifery education system in Korea should be revised; nurse-midwifery specialist programs must be established in educational institutes with nursing programs. To support this argument, the midwifery education programs of America, Europe, Australia, and Japan have been discussed, and a nurse-midwifery specialist curriculum at the <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>level,</b> based on the nurse-practitioner system of Korea, has been suggested.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{describe}} the innovativeness and the rate of adoption of change among chief nursing officers (CNOs) of acute care hospitals, and explore the difference in the innovativeness of CNOs of Magnet hospitals vs. non-Magnet hospitals. Background There is little evidence to guide the description of innovativeness for nurse leaders, crucial to the implementation of evidence-based practice standards. Method CNOs of acute care hospitals of New York State participated in a mailed survey which incorporated the Scale for the Measurement of Innovativeness. The response rate was 41 % (106 / 261). Results The majority of the sample was prepared at the <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>level</b> with 5 - 10 years of experience in the CNO role. A significant relationship was found between the innovativeness scale scores and the innovativeness diversity index. The CNOs who completed more leadership courses had implemented significantly more types of innovations and had higher innovativeness scale scores. Conclusion Graduate level education, years ofCNOexperience and leadership course completion were identified as significantly influencing innovativeness of CNOs. Implications for nursing management The characteristics of innovativeness for nurse leaders presented in the present study may assist organizations, CNOs and the Magnet recognition programme to describe innovativeness that supports organizations to continuously improve the quality of patient care.

40|$|Why do some master 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>level</b> <b>students</b> feel {{confident}} in completing their programs {{and some do}} not? Why do some feel connected to their department and some do not? Why do some feel legitimate as graduate students and some do not? This research proposes {{that there may be}} differences in how master 2 ̆ 7 s students understand the graduate student role based on whether they went directly from high-school through their bachelor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> to their <b>master</b> 2 ̆ 7 s, or if they took time off between their bachelor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> and <b>master</b> 2 ̆ 7 s program. This thesis used in-depth interviews with twelve second-year master 2 ̆ 7 s students at Portland State University to explore these questions: six with students who had a linear trajectory through higher education and six with students who had a break after completing their bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s and before returning for their master 2 ̆ 7 s (broken trajectory students). Students from both groups began their programs with questions about their ability to perform at a master 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>level.</b> Broken trajectory <b>students</b> {{were more likely to have}} thought through their chances of success and entered their programs 2 ̆ 7 knowing 2 ̆ 7 that they would successfully co plete the programs even when they questioned their academic abilities. Students from both groups overall felt a progressive increase in feelings of connection to their departments. The linear trajectory students entered their programs with some established feelings of connection with other graduate students. The broken trajectory students did not have these established connections, but desired connection with other serious students. Overall, students from both groups experienced increased feelings of legitimacy as graduate students, but the criteria by which they judged their legitimacy differed between groups. Linear trajectory students used academic ability as a primary measure of legitimacy, where broken trajectory students used having a clear understanding of why they were in graduate school as the standard to determine whether they 2 ̆ 2 belonged in college. 2 ̆ 2 The two groups also differed in the source of their student role standard: broken trajectory students used professors as their role reference group, whereas the linear trajectory students used peers and undergraduate students.

TITLE: Assessing Multicultural Counseling Competencies, of Internship Students Enrolled in CORE and CACREP Accredited Programs. MAJOR PROFESSORS: Dr 2 ̆ 7 s. Stacia Robertson 2 ̆ 6 Carl Flowers This study was {{an investigation of}} multicultural competencies, ethnic identity, and cultural beliefs of master 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>level</b> <b>students</b> on internship enrolled in CORE and CACREP accredited counseling programs. Due {{to changes in the}} demographical landscape of the United States, providing adequate counseling services to individuals from diverse backgrounds has become more challenging than ever before. Therefore, it is imperative that counseling programs prepare students to adequately serve these populations. Past literature has highlighted the importance of being a culturally competent counselor as a sign of professional growth. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine students on internship in their respected counseling programs. In order to accomplish this, counseling students on internship across the United States were surveyed during the Spring 2009 semester. The instruments used for the purpose of this study were the Multicultural Awareness Knowledge and Skills Survey, the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure, and the Cultural Beliefs Towards Disability Scale. A total of 148 participants were involved in the study. Results showed there were no significant differences in the total score of the students on the Multicultural Awareness, Knowledge and Skills Survey. A significant difference was found regarding the sub-scale awareness. Regarding the demographic variables in the study, two variables, Ethnic-Black and Ethnic-Hispanic were found to contribute statistical significance to the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure and the Cultural Beliefs Towards Disability Scale. Lastly, a significant correlation was established between multicultural competencies, ethnic identity, and cultural beliefs...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{case study}} explores {{ways in which}} English as a Second Language (ESOL) preservice teachers’ conceptions of literacy are initially developed and how these understandings impact their emerging identities as ESOL teachers. Diaz-Rico (2008) posits that teaching of English Learners (ELs) {{is one of the}} fastest-growing professions which increases the need to prepare preservice teachers to serve the growing immigrant population. Similar to other teacher education programs, pre service teachers in ESOL focused programs often experience tensions as they embark on student teaching. There appears to be limited research-studies of ESOL preservice teachers· perceptions of their preparation and efficacy in teaching literacy to ELs in the U. S. Trier (2006) underscores that preservice teachers· understanding of literacy will be the most crucial aspect of their learning. The research questions informing this study are: (1) How are ESOL pre-service teachers· beliefs and understandings of literacy development in language teaching shaped and revised as a result of participation in an ESOL teacher certification program? and (2) How do ESOL preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 identities shift as they experience course work and practicum? The theoretical lenses guiding this study are Vygotsky’s (1986) sociocultural perspective, situated learning theory (Lave 2 ̆ 6 Wenger, 1991), identity theory (Danielewicz, 2001), and Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s (1982) efficacy theory. Three preservice teachers in a <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>level</b> teacher certification program at a local university in the southeastern region of the U. S. participated in the study. Data sources include interviews, observations, reflections, and lesson plans. Constant comparison method (Srauss 2 ̆ 6 Corbin, 1990) was used to analyze the data. Findings indicate that these pre service teachers adopted a multifaceted view of literacy that included both critical and socio-cultural perspectives. The importance of meaning-making, family, and culture in literacy instruction was reinforced for these teachers. Additionally, preservice teachers continuously theorize as they navigate teacher education. They are not only concerned about knowing what to teach, but how to effectively teach students. A significant implication from the study is that teacher educators need to consider the individuality of preservice teachers and provide differentiated instruction within their teacher education programs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – It is {{not very}} often that an {{institution}} gets the opportunity to design an engineering curriculum from scratch; an opportunity that also comes with many challenges, as well as rewards. Apart from how to present which material in the most innovative, efficient and pedagogical way, {{there is also the}} ubiquitously delicate issue of how to balance teaching and research – a significant challenge considering that this new program is housed at a primarily undergraduate institution with no Ph. D. component. We have therefore formed a number of focus areas based on the faculty interest, one of which is machine learning and pattern recognition. We have developed a number of courses, all of which are offered to senior undergraduates as well as M. <b>S.</b> <b>level</b> graduate <b>students.</b> Lacking a Ph. D. program, we also had to find creative ways of integrating research activities into the undergraduate and M. <b>S.</b> <b>level</b> curricula, which we have done so through the “Engineering Clinic. ” The hallmark of Rowan’s engineering program, the engineering clinic is an 8 -semester sequence, where vertically and horizontally integrated students work on externally funded semester-long projects for credit. In this paper, we describe our unique approach to integrating teaching and research activities under the engineering clinic umbrella, and how this approach allows us to offer research experiences even to under classmen. We also describe the specific opportunities and difficulties this approach brings, and we describe recently awarded grants on incremental learning and data fusion as examples of how we maximize these opportunities and how we address the difficulties.

This study investigated 18 undeclared, sophomore <b>level</b> college <b>students</b> (intervention group) at a four-year institution who enrolled in a course that was designed to educate them about their choices of major. This group was then compared to a control group of 22 undeclared, sophomore <b>level</b> college <b>students</b> (comparison group) at the same institution. The intervention group experienced an eight-week course for credit and a grade while the comparison group did not. The instrument used to determine the level of anxiety was the Career Thoughts Inventory (CTI). Results from the study were analyzed using a paired-samples t-test, analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Pearson correlation. The data revealed significant reduction in levels of anxiety for the intervention group while the data from the comparison group showed no significant changes from pretest to posttest. In addition, the intervention group reduced their anxiety at a greater rate than that of the comparison group. Although there is little literature regarding anxiety level as it pertains to declaring majors, the results of this study were consistent with the literature in that undeclared, sophomore <b>level</b> <b>students</b> reported feeling anxious about making a choice of major. ^ These findings suggest the need for more study about the anxiety <b>level</b> in <b>students</b> regarding their choice of college major in that anxiety level may influence a student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>level</b> of satisfaction about their choice of major.
