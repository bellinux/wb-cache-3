5|$|Once the 1999 season started, {{a moment}} of peace {{occurred}} between the fans. Yankees <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer. While the managers were exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which he tipped his cap. Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Yankee <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre,</b> manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter. Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him (they also embraced each other at this time). Later in the game, {{when he came to}} bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance. Nine years later, in a similar fashion, Red Sox manager Terry Francona managed the American League team at the All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, in the stadium's final season.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} season as a {{full-time}} MLB umpire, West umpired the game in which Willie McCovey hit his 500th career home run. In the same year, he was at first base when Pete Rose tied the NL record for most consecutive games with a hit, {{and he was the}} home plate umpire when Rose broke it the following day. In 1981, West worked first base for Nolan Ryanâ€™s fifth career no-hitter. On October 13, 1981, West was 28 when he became the youngest NL umpire to call an LCS. In 1983, West was suspended for three days and fined US$500 after a shoving incident with Atlanta Braves <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre.</b> The manager became angry {{at the end of a}} game and followed West into the walkway outside the umpires dressing room. West then shoved Torre. On appeal, NL President Chub Feeney reduced West's fine to $300. Torre also received a fine stemming from the incident.|$|E
5|$|Impressed by Rivera's pitching, Yankees {{management}} {{chose not}} to re-sign Wetteland in the offseason, opting instead to replace him as closer with Rivera. In April 1997, MLB retired the uniform number 42 league-wide to honor Jackie Robinson for breaking the baseball color line, although Rivera was among a dozen players allowed to continue wearing the number per a grandfather clause. Rivera's transition from setup man to closer in 1997 was not seamless; he blew three of his first six save opportunities and indicated that he was initially uncomfortable in the role. With reassurance from <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre,</b> Rivera settled into the ninth-inning role, and he earned his first All-Star selection with 27saves and a 1.96ERA at the midseason break. In the 1997 All-Star Game, he pitched a perfect ninth inning to collect his first save in an All-Star Game. That summer, he added a cut fastball to his pitching repertoire after accidentally discovering how to throw the pitch. Rivera finished the regular season with 43saves in 52opportunities with a 1.88ERA. His first year as closer ended with a blown save in Game 4 of the 1997 AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians; with the Yankees four outs from advancing to {{the next round of}} the postseason, Rivera allowed a game-tying home run to Sandy Alomar Jr. The Yankees eventually lost that game and the next, eliminating them from the postseason.|$|E
5|$|With his {{contract}} set to expire after the 2007 season, Rivera sought an extension with the Yankees during spring training. Team management refused to negotiate near {{the start of}} the season, prompting him to respond that he would consider free agency {{at the end of the}} year. In April, Rivera blew his first two save opportunities, compiled two losses, and surrendered nine earned runs in innings pitched. Concerned sportswriters attributed his struggles to infrequent use, as the Yankees presented him with few situations to enter a game. Rivera saved 30 of his next 32opportunities and posted a 2.26ERA over the final five months of the season. In addition, he passed John Franco for third place on the all-time saves list with his 425th career save. Still, Rivera finished 2007 with closer career worsts in earned runs (25), hits (68), and ERA (3.15), and his 30saves in 34opportunities were his second-lowest total since 1997. After the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs in the opening round, Rivera stated his intentions to test the free agent market. He initially indicated that his decision of where to sign would be influenced by whether long-time <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> was re-signed. Although Torre did not return, Rivera remained with the Yankees by agreeing to a three-year, $45million contract, making him the highest-paid reliever in baseball history.|$|E
50|$|Guidry joined Yankee's <b>Manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre's</b> {{coaching}} staff as pitching {{coach in the}} 2006 season, replacing Mel Stottlemyre. Under Guidry's tenure, the Yankees' pitching staff enjoyed mixed results. The pitching staff's ERA decreased from 4.52 in 2005 to 4.41 in 2006 under his first year of coaching, though in 2007, the team ERA increased to 4.49 (or 17th overall in the Major leagues).|$|R
50|$|Honeycutt and Mariano Duncan {{were the}} only holdovers from Grady Little's 2007 {{coaching}} staff to return on new Dodgers' <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre's</b> 2008 coaching staff. Honeycutt also remained as pitching coach when Don Mattingly replaced Torre after the 2010 season. When Mattingly left the team after the 2015 season, Honeycutt was the only coach {{to remain on the}} staff for new manager Dave Roberts.|$|R

25|$|Former <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre,</b> who at {{the time}} was {{managing}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers, published a book called The Yankee Years about his time in New York that criticized Steinbrenner, Cashman, and Rodriguez, among others.|$|E
25|$|After the Dodgers won the National League West, Maddux {{was moved}} to the bullpen after <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> decided to go with a three-man rotation.

50|$|Frazier {{managed the}} Mets to an 86-76 record in 1976, {{good for a}} third-place finish. The club {{got off to a}} 15-30 in 1977, however, and Frazier was {{replaced}} as Mets <b>manager</b> by <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre,</b> who was an active player on the Mets roster at the time.|$|R
5000|$|He {{began the}} season at second, but shifted to short when Foli injured his knee {{at the end}} of April, and {{returned}} there periodically throughout the remainder of the season. All told, he logged 430 innings at short, committing just seven errors for a [...]968 fielding percentage. At second, he logged the leagues second best fielding percentage (behind the Montreal Expos' Dave Cash) at [...]986. With the bat, Flynn produced a modest [...]237 batting average with no home runs and 36 RBIs in the eighth spot of <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre's</b> batting order, however, he tied Lenny Randle and Joel Youngblood for the team lead with eight triples.|$|R
5000|$|A family {{emergency}} (his mother Linda {{was hurt}} {{in a car}} crash) caused Phillips to miss much of his 2007 spring training with the Yankees. In the end, he only played in 15 games, saw 26 at bats, and had a [...]192 average. Due to his inability {{to make up for}} lost time and Josh Phelps's (Phillips opponent for a roster spot on the Yankees) outstanding performance (spring training stats include 3 home runs, 14 hits, a [...]667 slugging percentage, and [...]389 batting average), Phillips was passed over for a roster spot on the 2007 team. When informed of <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre's</b> decision to go with Phelps over Phillips, Phillips reportedly thanked Torre for the opportunity and asked if Phelps had been informed of the decision yet so he could congratulate him.|$|R
25|$|Clemens {{was forced}} to leave Game 3 of the 2007 ALDS in the third inning after {{aggravating}} a hamstring injury. He struck out Victor Martinez of the Cleveland Indians with his final pitch, and was replaced by right-hander Phil Hughes. Yankees <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> removed Clemens from the roster due to his injury, and replaced him with left-hander Ron Villone.|$|E
25|$|Canseco {{began the}} 2000 {{season with the}} Devil Rays, hitting only 9 home runs in 61 games, and, by August, was claimed off waivers by the New York Yankees, which caught many, {{including}} Yankees <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> off guard, as the Yankees had four other players who fulfilled a similar role to Canseco. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman made the claim to prevent the Athletics, Red Sox and Blue Jays, who were in a close race with the Yankees, from acquiring Canseco.|$|E
25|$|On October 9, 2006, {{after the}} sudden exit of the Yankees from the divisional series, Francesa and Russo took many grievances with so called Yankee dissenters, feeling most {{strongly}} about alleged {{comments made by}} Yankee starter Cory Lidle. Lidle was lambasted on air about comments that were seemingly directed towards Yankees <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre.</b> Lidle called into the station, and a 13-minute heated discussion ensued where Francesa and Russo challenged Lidle's credibility over these unofficial statements made to the media.|$|E
50|$|After the 2007 season, Mattingly was {{a finalist}} for the Yankees' <b>manager</b> position, after <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> {{declined}} a one-year contract extension, along with Joe Girardi and Tony PeÃ±a. The Yankees offered the managerial position to Girardi, who accepted.|$|R
5000|$|A problem arose at this point, as Padilla and Garcia {{were the}} last {{available}} pitchers on each team. After a scoreless top of the eleventh inning, AL and NL <b>managers</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> and Bob Brenly met by the first base dugout with Commissioner Bud Selig to discuss the situation, and it was controversially ruled that if the NL did not score {{in the bottom of}} the eleventh, the game would be declared a tie1. After the decision was announced over the stadium's PA system, fans loudly booed and jeered, with beer bottles being thrown onto the field, and chants of [...] "Let them play!", [...] "Refund!", [...] "Bud must go!" [...] and [...] "Ripoff!" [...] were heard. Garcia retired the side in the eleventh, and the game ended in a 7-7 tie, to further booing and bottle throwing. No MVP award was given.|$|R
2500|$|Due to the {{unsuccessful}} {{nature of}} the Yankees postseasons from 2004 to 2007, along with Rodriguez's sub-.200 batting average in the postseasons of 2005 and 2006, Rodriguez drew criticism in the New York area, both from writers, such as the New York Post Joel Sherman, and players, such as then-teammate, Jason Giambi. Prior to 2009, Rodriguez had received the nickname [...] "The Cooler" [...] among some players because of the perceived tendency for teams to turn cold when he joins them and hot when he leaves. According to Yankee <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre's</b> 2009 book, The Yankee Years, Rodriguez earned the nickname [...] "A-Fraud" [...] from teammates and particularly from clubhouse attendants who were said to resent his demands. [...] "It was [...] in front of him", Torre later said of the nickname. [...] "A lot of that stuff {{that went on in}} the clubhouse was more tongue-in-cheek, fun type stuff", he explained.|$|R
25|$|Until 2003, {{reserves}} and pitchers were {{chosen by the}} manager. Player voting was re-introduced in 2003 after the managers were criticized for picking players from their own team over more deserving players from other teams. This was particularly evident in 2002, when National League manager Bob Brenly selected his own catcher, Damian Miller, over the more deserving Paul Lo Duca; while American League <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> selected his own third baseman, Robin Ventura, over the Oakland Athletics' Gold Glove and Silver Slugger-winning third baseman Eric Chavez.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on June 25 to conclude interleague {{play with a}} series against the New York Yankees. This {{was the first time}} <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> faced his former team from the opposing dugout. The Dodgers dropped the opener 2â€“1 as Alex Rodriguez hit a home run and a double and scored both runs. The Dodgers took the middle game of the series 9â€“4 thanks to four RBIs from James Loney. In the series finale, the Dodgers built a 6â€“2 lead thanks to another impressive start by Clayton Kershaw but closer Jonathan Broxton lost the lead in the ninth and Robinson CanÃ³ hit a two-run blast in the tenth to give the Yankees an 8â€“6 comeback victory.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home to finish {{the season with a}} three-game series against the Diamondbacks. John Ely was shaky in the opener, as the Dodgers lost 7â€“5. The loss assured the Dodgers of their first losing record since 2005. In the following game, Chad Billingsley took a no-hitter into the sixth and picked up his first win since September 3 in the Dodgers 3â€“2 victory. The Dodgers ended their season with a 3â€“1 victory in the finale. Matt Kemp became the first Dodger to homer in five straight games since Shawn Green in 2001. Hong-Chih Kuo pitched a scoreless ninth for the save, also breaking Ã‰ric GagnÃ©'s single-season Dodger ERA record in the process. The game was the final appearance for backup catcher Brad Ausmus and <b>Manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre,</b> both retiring after the game.|$|E
500|$|The Yankees {{defeated}} the Red Sox at Fenway Park and completed a five-game {{sweep of the}} Red Sox in the first five-game series between the teams in 33 years, evoking memories of 1978's [...] "Boston Massacre". The Yankees outscored the Red Sox 49â€“26 and pushed their division lead from [...] games {{all the way to}} [...] games over the second place Sox. Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy dubbed it the [...] "Son of Massacre." [...] The second game of the series, which the Yankees won 14â€“11, took four hours and 45 minutes to complete, making it the longest nine-inning game in Major League Baseball history. Months after the Yankees loss to the Tigers in the 2006 ALDS and <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre's</b> controversial decision to drop a struggling Alex Rodriguez to 8th in the lineup, Rodriguez in an interview with Sports Illustrated, claimed that he had preferred to go to the Red Sox before being traded to the Yankees. The incident would be one of contention between Torre and Rodriguez as noted in Torre's book, The Yankee Years.|$|R
5|$|The New York Mets are a Major League Baseball (MLB) {{franchise}} {{based in}} New York City, New York in the bourough of Queens. They {{play in the}} National League East division. In {{the history of the}} Mets there has been 20managers. The duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Of those <b>managers,</b> only <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> who was a player-manager (a manager who also plays for the team); Yogi Berra did however play four games while he was a coach in 1965.|$|R
5|$|Several {{managers}} {{have won the}} award in a season when they led their team to 100 or more wins. Lou Piniella won 116 games with the Seattle Mariners in 2001, the most by a winning <b>manager,</b> and <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> won 114 with the New York Yankees in 1998. Sparky Anderson and Tony La Russa finished with identical 104â€“58 records in 1984 and 1988, respectively. Three National League managers, including Dusty Baker, Whitey Herzog, and Larry Dierker, have exceeded the century mark as well. Baker's San Francisco Giants won 103 games in 1993; Dierker's 1998 Houston Astros won 102 and Herzog led the Cardinals to 101 wins in the award's third season.|$|R
25|$|In 2005, the Mets signed Manager Willie Randolph, {{who coached}} with the Yankees {{for over a}} decade. Randolph played {{much of his career}} with the Yankees and also played for the Mets before {{retiring}} as a player. Because of his history with the Yankees championship teams of the 70s (as a player) and the 90s (as a coach), he holds a very cordial relationship with Yankee fans despite his tenure with the Mets organization, as noted by a Subway (a pun on the restaurant's name and the Subway Series) commercial featuring him and former Yankees <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre,</b> who had managed the Yankees during their most recent dynastic run. Torre had also been associated with the Mets as they were the last team he ever played for and the first team he ever managed. On August 2, 2008, less than two months after his abrupt and controversial dismissal as Mets manager, Randolph was greeted with a standing ovation by the Yankee Stadium crowd when he appeared in a Yankees uniform for the Old-Timers' Game.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to their}} homestand against the Colorado Rockies, Dodger <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> {{announced}} {{his intention to}} retire {{at the end of}} the season and that Don Mattingly would take over as the Manager for the 2011 season. The Dodgers followed the news with a 7â€“5 loss to the Rockies. Relief pitcher Octavio Dotel switched dugouts prior to the second game as the Dodgers traded him to the Rockies for a player to be named later. The Dodgers then proceeded to be blown out 12â€“2 as Troy Tulowitzki slugged two homers and Melvin Mora hit a grand slam, while John Ely was roughed up in the loss. The Dodgers fell behind 6â€“1 in the series finale, but came back to send the game into extra innings, finally winning the game 7â€“6 on a walk-off hit by A. J. Ellis in the 11th inning. The Dodgers two-year stay as National League Western Division champions came to an end on September 21 when they were officially eliminated from post-season contention when the Giants beat the Cubs. The Dodgers then proceeded to be shut out by the Padres 6â€“0, the first career shutout for Padres starter Clayton Richard and the 17th time the Dodgers had been shut out in 2010, the most in the league and their highest total since 1989. In the next game, Ted Lilly struck out eight in seven innings, but the Dodgers managed just three hits in a 3â€“1 defeat. The Dodgers avoided being swept at home due to Hiroki Kuroda's eight-inning, one-run performance in the Dodgers' 3â€“1 win over the Padres.|$|E
25|$|James McDonald {{made his}} first {{start of the season}} in the opener of the Dodgers three-game home stand with the Giants. McDonald {{struggled}} in the game, allowing nine hits and four runs in five innings as the Dodgers lost 5â€“2. In the second game of the series, Clayton Kershaw pitched well into the seventh inning before he and the manager were ejected after he hit a batter to start the seventh. The game took an odd turn when the Giants, down by one run, loaded the bases against closer Jonathan Broxton in the ninth. Acting manager Don Mattingly inadvertently made an illegal second trip to the mound and Broxton had to be removed. George Sherrill gave up what would be the winning run as the Dodgers lost their sixth straight, 7â€“5. In the aftermath of the game, Kershaw was suspended for five games and <b>manager</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> and bench coach Bob Schaefer were each suspended for one game. Under acting manager Mattingley, the Dodgers finally ended their losing streak on July 21. Chad Billingsley pitched a complete game, five hit, shutout in the Dodgers 2â€“0 victory. The New York Mets visited Dodger Stadium for a four-game series next. In the opener, Hiroki Kuroda pitched eight scoreless innings as the Dodgers picked up their second straight 2â€“0 victory. Matt Kemp drove in both runs with a homer and a double. In the following game, Padilla pitched seven solid innings but the bullpen struggled, allowing four runs in the eighth inning in the Dodgers 6â€“1 loss. James Loney hit his first career walk-off home run in the 13th inning to give the Dodgers a 3â€“2 victory in the third game of the series. In the series finale, Russell Martin's RBI double {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inning as the only score of the game as the Dodgers won 1â€“0. Clayton Kershaw pitched eight scoreless innings and rookie Kenley Jansen, who made his Major League debut just the night before, picked up his first career save.|$|E
5000|$|The fictional Steinbrenner talked nonstop, {{regardless}} of whether anyone was listening, and sometimes referred to himself as [...] "Big Stein". The team owner was known for eccentric decisions, such as cotton jerseys, threatening to move the team to New Jersey [...] "just to upset people", scalping his owner's box tickets, wearing Lou Gehrig's uniform pants (and panicking about [...] "that nerve disease" [...] being contagious), trading several players to Frank Costanza's dismay, and canceling a meeting because he wanted George Costanza to get him an eggplant calzone. In [...] "The Wink", the Steinbrenner character mentions {{all of the people}} he fired, saying Billy Martin four times, and mentions then-current manager Buck Showalter, but then quickly swears Costanza to silence. Though intended as a joke, the comment proved prophetic: A few weeks after the episode aired, Steinbrenner replaced Showalter as <b>manager</b> with <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre.</b>|$|R
