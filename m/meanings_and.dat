5|$|Stress in Mongolian is nonphonemic (does not {{distinguish}} different <b>meanings)</b> <b>and</b> thus {{is considered to}} depend entirely on syllable structure. But scholarly opinions on stress placement diverge sharply. Most native linguists, regardless of which dialect they speak, claim that stress falls on the first syllable. Between 1941 and 1975, several Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy syllable gets the stress. Yet other positions were taken in works published between 1835 and 1915.|$|E

The reliefs of noblemen, and noble women, kings, or divine beings such as apsaras, taras and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in tribhanga pose, the three-bend pose on neck, hips, and knee, with one leg resting and one upholding the body weight. This position is considered as the most graceful pose, such as the figure of Surasundari holding a lotus.|$|E
5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, <b>meanings,</b> <b>and</b> a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E

5|$|During the Eastern Han, I Ching {{interpretation}} {{divided into}} two schools, originating {{in a dispute over}} minor differences between different editions of the received text. The first school, known as New Text criticism, was more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams. Their commentaries provided the basis of the School of Images and Numbers. The other school, Old Text criticism, was more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused on the moral content of the text, providing the basis for the School of <b>Meanings</b> <b>and</b> Principles. The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into their work, as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the Taixuanjing. Most of this early commentary, such as the image and number work of Jing Fang, Yu Fan and Xun Shuang, is no longer extant. Only short fragments survive, from a Tang dynasty text called Zhou yi jijie.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other uses}} of the term conatus, apart from the primary ones {{mentioned}} above, have been formulated by various philosophers over the centuries. There are also some important related terms and concepts which have, more or less, similar <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> usages. Giambattista Vico (1668–1744) defined conatus as the essence of human society, and also, in a more traditional, hylozoistic sense, as the generating power of movement which pervades all of nature. Nearly a century after the beginnings of modern science, Vico, inspired by Neoplatonism, explicitly rejected the principle of inertia {{and the laws of}} motion of the new physics. For him, nature was composed neither of atoms, as in the dominant view, nor of extension, as in Descartes, but of metaphysical points animated by a conatus principle provoked by God.|$|E
5|$|Submarine {{films have}} their own {{particular}} <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the propellors of enemy destroyers and torpedoes. Classic films in the genre include The Enemy Below (1957) and Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run Silent, Run Deep is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.|$|E

As the player progresses through the game, the words increase in difficulty.

The player is then placed into a level reflective of the score they received on the test. A player who scores highly {{will be able to}} skip many of the initial levels and more basic concepts.

40|$|<b>Meaning</b> <b>and</b> {{purpose in}} life are {{important}} aspects of the life experience of individuals. These aspects of life have often been studied using psychological and quantitative approaches addressing <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose across the life span. However, there is a dearth of studies of <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose in care home (nursing) life. This care sector has an important contribution to make nationally and internationally to the lives of older people who require long-term care. This study addresses the gap in the body of knowledge by exploring how to enhance <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose in the lives of care home (nursing) residents. This study of <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose in the lives of care home (nursing) residents was undertaken using an appreciative inquiry methodology. Two U. K. care homes (nursing) were the settings for the study; 20 residents and 25 members of staff were included in the sample of the study. The residents who participated in the study had moved into the care homes because of their physical disabilities. None of the residents who participated in the study had appreciable cognitive incapacity. Data were collected using life story interviews, structured interviews and focus groups. Data were constructed during the four stages of appreciative inquiry: Discovery, Dream, Design and Destiny. The data were analysed using the Framework Analysis approach. The findings of the study provide clear definitions of <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose in care home (nursing) life. The knowledge generated addresses the required focus on the creation of opportunities for residents to flourish and optimise their potential in order to enhance <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose in their lives. The ways in which care home staff can support residents enhance <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose in their care home experience through the physical setting, valuing of residents’ identities, the dynamics of relationships, the focus of activities and the component of care are articulated. This study presents the benefits of appreciative inquiry dialogue as a way of enhancing <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose in the lives of care home residents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Meaning</b> <b>and</b> {{purpose in}} life are {{fundamental}} to human beings.

More deeply understanding how older long-term care residents perceive <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> {{purpose in life}} is critical for {{improving the quality of}} care and the residents’ quality of life. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore crucial aspects promoting nursing home residents’ experience of <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose in everyday life. Method An exploratory hermeneutical design with qualitative interviews for collecting data. Results Four key experiences were found to promote <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose in life: 1) physical and mental well-being, 2) belonging and recognition, 3) personally treasured activities and 4) spiritual closeness and connectedness. Conclusion In supporting <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose in life of nursing home residents, the residents’ everyday well-being should be a central focus of care and facilitate personally treasured activities. Focused attention should also be given to the meaning-making power of experiencing belonging, recognition and spiritual connectedness...|$|R
