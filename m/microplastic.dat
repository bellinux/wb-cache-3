5000|$|Plastic {{pollution}} {{in the form of}} small particles (diameter less than 5 mm) — termed ‘microplastic’ — has been observed {{in many parts of the}} world ocean. They are known to interact with biota on the individual level, e.g. through ingestion, but their population-level impacts are largely unknown. One potential mechanism for microplastic-induced alteration of pelagic ecosystems is through the introduction of hard-substrate habitat to ecosystems where it is naturally rare. Here, we show that <b>microplastic</b> concentrations in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past four decades, and that this increase has released the pelagic insect [...] Halobates sericeus from substrate limitation for oviposition. High concentrations of <b>microplastic</b> in the NPSG resulted in a positive correlation between H. sericeus and <b>microplastic,</b> and an overall increase in H. sericeus egg densities. Predation on H. sericeus eggs and recent hatchlings may facilitate the transfer of energy between pelagic- and substrate-associated assemblages. The dynamics of hard-substrate-associated organisms may be important to understanding the ecological impacts of oceanic <b>microplastic</b> pollution.The Goldstein et al. study compared changes in small plastic abundance between 1972-1987 and 1999-2010 by using historical samples from the Scripps Pelagic Invertebrate Collection and data from SEAPLEX, a NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer cruise in 2010, information from the Algalita Marine Research Foundation as well as various published papers.|$|E
30|$|Given that (1) {{concentrations}} of pollutants on <b>microplastics</b> can be several {{orders of magnitude}} {{higher than in the}} surrounding water and (2) <b>microplastics</b> are ingested by a wide variety of organisms, it has been postulated that <b>microplastics</b> may lead to an increased uptake of pollutants by aquatic organisms (see e.g. [25]). Such an uptake requires desorption of the contaminants in the organisms. Addition of the digestive surfactant sodium taurocholate was shown to enhance desorption of phenanthrene from PE, PP and PVC <b>microplastics</b> [182]. Similar results were obtained by Bakir et al. [184] for various organic pollutants sorbed to PE and PVC <b>microplastics.</b> Several studies have demonstrated that contaminants, which had been sorbed to <b>microplastics,</b> are transferred to organisms ingesting these <b>microplastics.</b> For instance, nonylphenol and phenanthrene that had been sorbed to PVC <b>microplastics</b> were detected in the tissue of A. marina exposed for 10  days to these <b>microplastics</b> [185].|$|R
40|$|The {{ingestion}} of <b>microplastics</b> {{has been shown}} for {{a great variety of}} marine organisms. However, benthic marine mesoherbivores such as the common periwinkle Littorina littorea have been largely disregarded in studies about the effects of <b>microplastics</b> on the marine biota, probably because the pathway for <b>microplastics</b> to this functional group of organisms was not obvious. In laboratory experiments we showed that the seaweed Fucus vesiculosus retains suspended <b>microplastics</b> on its surface. The numbers of <b>microplastics</b> that adhered to the algae correlated with the concentrations of suspended particles in the water. In choice feeding assays L. littorea did not distinguish between algae with adherent <b>microplastics</b> and clean algae without <b>microplastics,</b> indicating that the snails do not recognize solid nonfood particles in the submillimeter size range as deleterious. In periwinkles that were feeding on contaminated algae, <b>microplastics</b> were found in the stomach and in the gut. However, no <b>microplastics</b> were found in the midgut gland, which is the principle digestive organ of gastropods. <b>Microplastics</b> in the fecal pellets of the periwinkles indicate that the particles do not accumulate rapidly inside the animals but are mostly released with the feces. Our results provide the first evidence that seaweeds may represent an efficient pathway for <b>microplastics</b> from the water to marine benthic herbivores...|$|R
5000|$|Estimates of {{emissions}} of <b>microplastics</b> {{to the environment}} in Denmark are between [...] per year. Secondary <b>microplastics</b> (e.g. from car and truck tyres or footwear) {{are more important than}} primary <b>microplastics</b> by two orders of magnitude. The formation of <b>microplastics</b> from the degradation of larger plastics in the environment is not accounted for in the study.|$|R
5000|$|Researchers {{have now}} found <b>microplastic</b> and {{synthetic}} fibers frozen into ice cores, abundant {{on the sea}} floor, and on every beach worldwide. Along the way it passes through the bodies of billions of organisms.|$|E
5000|$|The first International Research Workshop on the Occurrence, Effects and Fate of <b>Microplastic</b> Marine Debris at the University of Washington Tacoma {{campus in}} Tacoma, Washington, USA, from September 9-11, 2008, agreed that {{microplastics}} may pose {{problems in the}} marine environment, based on the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|These are {{particles}} of plastics that are purposefully manufactured to be microscopic. They are usually used in facial cleansers and cosmetics, or in air blasting technology. In some cases, {{their use in}} medicine as vectors for drugs was reported. <b>Microplastic</b> [...] "scrubbers", used in exfoliating hand cleansers and facial scrubs, have replaced traditionally used natural ingredients, including ground almonds, oatmeal and pumice. Primary microplastics have also been produced for use in air blasting technology. This process involves blasting acrylic, melamine or polyester <b>microplastic</b> scrubbers at machinery, engines and boat hulls to remove rust and paint. As these scrubbers are used repeatedly until they diminish in size and their cutting power is lost, they often become contaminated with heavy metals such as cadmium, chromium, and lead.|$|E
30|$|As {{outlined}} above, {{there is}} {{clear evidence that}} hydrophobic contaminants are enriched on <b>microplastics</b> and transferred to organisms ingesting these <b>microplastics.</b> However, it has been questioned, if the transport of sorbed pollutants by <b>microplastics</b> is a relevant factor contributing to accumulation and adverse effects in the environment, i.e. if <b>microplastics</b> transport pollutants in sufficiently high concentrations to biota [99, 187]. In this context, {{the contribution of the}} uptake via <b>microplastics</b> to the total uptake of a pollutant (including uptake via integument, gills and food) has to be considered. Since <b>microplastics</b> are in most cases excreted by the organisms that have ingested them, desorption rates of the pollutants from the <b>microplastics</b> in the intestinal tract are important. Modelling approaches have been used to assess the relative contribution of <b>microplastics</b> as vectors to the overall uptake of hydrophobic organic pollutants by A. marina [187, 188] and piscivorous fish [104].|$|R
30|$|OW values between 5.5 and 6.5. As {{outlined}} above, this {{reduction is}} due to the high affinity of the <b>microplastics</b> to the pollutants, which prevents transfer of the pollutants to the fish. Gouin et al. [104] concluded that <b>microplastics</b> have a limited relevance as vector for the transfer of hydrophobic pollutants to fish. A number of uncertainties were identified, which include the effects of fouling on sorption of pollutants to <b>microplastics,</b> gut retention times of <b>microplastics</b> and uptake rates of <b>microplastics</b> into the tissue of an organism.|$|R
30|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} uptake of <b>microplastics</b> by freshwater organisms in the field. In a preliminary study, Sanchez et al. [167] examined wild gudgeons (Gobio gobio), caught in French streams. The digestive tract of the fish was analysed visually for <b>microplastics.</b> Based on first results, 12  % of the gudgeons had <b>microplastics</b> in their intestine. The abundance of <b>microplastics</b> increased with the anthropogenic impact on the rivers. While no <b>microplastics</b> were found in the intestine of fish captured at three sites characterised by a low anthropogenic influence, the highest percentage of fish with <b>microplastics</b> in their intestine (approx. 20 – 30  %) was recorded at two sites in urban areas.|$|R
50|$|The UNEP {{report on}} {{microplastics}} in cosmetics was released. The study, entitled Plastic in Cosmetics: Are We Polluting the Environment Through our Personal Care: Plastic ingredients {{that contribute to}} marine <b>microplastic</b> litter is a compilation of currently available knowledge on the linkages between cosmetics and plastic pollution in the oceans.|$|E
50|$|Poynter is also {{an active}} {{participant}} of The 5 Gyres Institute and their mission to eradicate the pollution of plastic in the ocean. He supports the banning of <b>microplastic</b> materials across Europe, citing the serious detrimental impact of these substances on the marine environment as the reason of his disapproval.|$|E
50|$|Plastic {{particle}} {{water pollution}} is marine debris consisting of plastic particles, including nurdles, pre-production <b>microplastic</b> resin pellets typically under 5 mm in diameter found {{outside of the}} typical plastic manufacturing stream and an intermediate good used to produce plastic final products; microbeads from cosmetics; and the breakdown products of plastic litter. Plastic particle water pollution has also {{been referred to as}} mermaids' tears.|$|E
30|$|The {{lower size}} limit of <b>microplastics</b> sampled in the {{environment}} is obviously determined by the sampling and processing methods. <b>Microplastics</b> larger than 300  µm were sampled in most cases from seawater and <b>microplastics</b> larger than 500  µm from sediment [11]. When density separation with a subsequent filtration step is used, smaller particles can be retrieved from sediment. The smallest <b>microplastics</b> sampled from sediment had a diameter of 1  µm. With current state-of-the-art techniques it is most likely not possible to representatively sample and unequivocally identify <b>microplastics</b> with a size below 1 – 2  µm [11, 26].|$|R
40|$|Careless use {{of plastic}} {{products}} leads to massive litter accumulations in natural environments. Due {{to the river}} runoff and gradual degradation of larger plastic pieces into micro-sized particles, <b>microplastics</b> enter to the marine environment. Recently it was demonstrated, that subtidal marine isopods Idotea emarginata, readily ingested and excreted <b>microplastics,</b> without clogging the digestive system. In the present study, we focused on physiological effects of food quality and <b>microplastics,</b> by applying different feeding treatments. Digestive enzymes and protein content in the midgut gland and gut were investigated. Feeding rates differed significantly between natural and artificial diets, but have not changed when <b>microplastics</b> were added to diets. Enzyme activities showed high scatter and inconsistent results. Esterase activity was enhanced in the midgut gland and suppressed in the gut tissue, by <b>microplastics</b> in the agarose. <b>Microplastics</b> further suppressed lipase activity in the midgut of fresh algae fed isopods. Exopeptidase activity was suppressed and endopeptidase enhanced in the midgut gland, due to <b>microplastics</b> in agarose. <b>Microplastics</b> increased protein content of the gut tissue. Our results indicate, that <b>microplastics</b> may differently affect digestive processes of marine isopods. Further {{research is needed to}} verify whether these alterations affect nutrient assimilation and nutritional health of the isopods...|$|R
30|$|A {{wide variety}} of aquatic organisms {{have been shown to}} ingest <b>microplastics.</b> In most cases, {{particles}} were only detected in the intestinal tract and excreted rapidly. Translocation from the intestinal tract to the circulatory system or surrounding tissues was observed in some species for very small <b>microplastics.</b> In field studies, <b>microplastics</b> were ingested, but the ingested quantities were low. <b>Microplastics</b> are transferred in the food chain. Yet so far, there are no data demonstrating their bioaccumulation or biomagnification.|$|R
50|$|One study {{suggested}} that environmentally relevant levels of polyethylene microbeads had {{no impact on}} larva. Some wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the U.S. and Europe can remove microbeads with an efficiency of greater than 98 percent, others may not. As such, other sources of <b>microplastic</b> pollution (e.g. microfibers/fibers and car tires) {{are more likely to}} be associated with environmental hazards.|$|E
5000|$|Marcus Eriksen et al. (2014) {{have found}} 92% of plastic {{pieces in the}} ocean is smaller than <b>microplastic</b> and cannot be caught by The Ocean Cleanup's system. However, in the same study it shows the plastic mass is mainly found in the two larger size classes (86%) [...] Catching the larger debris before they break down into {{microplastics}} is the The Ocean Cleanup's goal.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacture}} of plastic products uses granules and small resin pellets as their raw material. In the United States, production increased from 2.9 million pellets in 1960 to 21.7 million pellets in 1987. Through accidental spillage during land or sea transport, inappropriate use as packing materials, and direct outflow from processing plants, these raw materials can enter aquatic ecosystems. In {{an assessment of}} Swedish waters using an 80 µm mesh, KIMO Sweden found typical <b>microplastic</b> concentrations of 150-2,400 microplastics per m3; in a harbor adjacent to a plastic production facility, the concentration was 102,000 per m3.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microplastics</b> {{often become}} {{embedded}} in animals' tissue through ingestion or respiration. Various annelid species, such as deposit-feeding lugworms (Arenicola marina), {{have been shown}} to have <b>microplastics</b> embedded in their gastrointestinal tracts. Many crustaceans, like the shore crab Carcinus maenas have been seen to integrate <b>microplastics</b> into both their respiratory and digestive tracts.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact that}} <b>microplastics</b> have on baleen whales is a {{question}} that remains largely unexplored. This study examined the interaction between free-ranging fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and <b>microplastics</b> by comparing populations living in two semi-enclosed basins, the Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California, Mexico). The results indicate that a considerable abundance of <b>microplastics</b> and plastic additives exists in the neustonic samples from Pelagos Sanctuary of the Mediterranean Sea, and that pelagic areas containing high densities of <b>microplastics</b> overlap with whale feeding grounds, suggesting that whales are exposed to <b>microplastics</b> during foraging; this was confirmed by the observation of a temporal increase in toxicological stress in whales. Given the abundance of <b>microplastics</b> in the Mediterranean environment, along with the high concentrations of Persistent Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) chemicals, plastic additives and biomarker responses detected in the biopsies of Mediterranean whales as compared to those in whales inhabiting the Sea of Cortez, we believe that exposure to <b>microplastics</b> because of direct ingestion and consumption of contaminated prey poses a major threat to the health of fin whales in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|R
30|$|Consequently, {{quantitative}} {{information on the}} contribution of different sources to the overall amount of macro- and, especially <b>microplastics</b> in the environment is generally lacking [8, 104, 105]. There are, e.g. no reliable estimates {{of the percentage of}} plastic packaging material reaching the marine environment [25]. Given the large amount of macroplastics entering the environment, it is generally assumed that most <b>microplastics</b> in the environment are secondary <b>microplastics,</b> i.e. a result of weathering of larger plastic debris [11, 25]. However, fragmentation rates of macroplastics are largely unknown [57, 59, 99]. As a result, no {{quantitative information}} is available on the relative contribution of primary and secondary <b>microplastics</b> to the overall amount of <b>microplastics</b> in the environment [50].|$|R
50|$|Plastic {{that has}} made its way into marine {{habitats}} {{has been found to}} host various microorganisms. The hydrophobic nature of plastic surfaces stimulates rapid formation of biofilms, which support a wide range of metabolic activities, and drive succession of other micro- and macro-organisms. A recent study identified more than 1,000 species of bacteria and algae attached to <b>microplastic</b> debris, including members of the genus Vibrio, a genus which includes the bacteria that cause cholera and other gastrointestinal ailments. Some of these bacteria glow and it is hypothesized that this attracts fish that eat the organisms colonizing the plastic, which then feed from the stomachs of the fish.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, it was {{estimated}} that there was approximately 165 million tons of plastic pollution in the world's oceans. One type of plastic that is of concern in terms of ocean plastic pollution is nurdles. Nurdles are manufactured plastic pellets (a type of <b>microplastic)</b> used in the creation of plastic products and are often shipped via cargo ship. Many billions of nurdles are spilled into oceans each year, and {{it has been estimated that}} globally, around 10% of beach litter consists of nurdles. Plastics in oceans typically degrade within a year, but not entirely. In the process, toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A and polystyrene can leach into waters from some plastics. Polystyrene pieces and nurdles are the most common types of plastic pollution in oceans, and combined with plastic bags and food containers make up the majority of oceanic debris.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, for {{producing}} MSGE, the mechanical {{action on the}} solid can be of any type including tension, compression, torsion, shearing, rubbing, fretting, rolling, indentation, etc.In previous studies carried out by various groups {{it was found that}} MSGE is associated mainly with plastic deformation, fracture, wear and other irreversible modifications of a solid. Under elastic deformation MSGE is almost negligible and only was observed just below elastic limit due to possible <b>microplastic</b> deformation. In accordance to the main sources, the emitted gases usually contain hydrogen (source type IIa), argon (for coatings obtained using PVD in Ar plasma - source type IIb), methane (source type III), water (source type I and/or III), carbon mono- and dioxide (source type I/III). The knowledge on the mechanisms of MSGE is still vague. On the basis of the experimental findings it was speculated that the following processes can be related with MSGE: ...|$|E
50|$|It {{was found}} that {{zooplankton}} ingest <b>microplastics</b> beads (1.7-30.6 μm) and excrete fecal matter contaminated with <b>microplastics.</b> Along with ingestion, the <b>microplastics</b> stick to the appendages and exoskeleton of the zooplankton. Zooplankton, among other marine organisms, consume <b>microplastics</b> because they emit similar infochemicals, notably dimethyl sulfide, as phytoplankton and other organic materials. Plastics such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and polypropylene (PP) produce dimethyl sulfide odors. These types of plastics are commonly found in plastic bags, bleach, food storage containers, and bottle caps.|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{considerable}} {{public attention}} {{has focused on}} <b>microplastics</b> particles from personal care products, which was mainly triggered by reports in news media. Therefore, a specific focus {{is placed on the}} contribution of <b>microplastics</b> from personal care products (defined and regulated as cosmetic products in the EU [13]) to the overall pollution of the environment with <b>microplastics.</b>|$|R
50|$|One study {{estimated}} {{that there are more}} than 5 trillion plastic pieces (defined into the four classes of small <b>microplastics,</b> large <b>microplastics,</b> meso- and macroplastics) afloat at sea.|$|R
50|$|Charybdis longicollis {{is found}} {{commonly}} at all depths between 8m and 200m over muddy or fine sandy substrates. It is a benthophagic species which prefers {{to feed on}} slow moving or stationary prey such as molluscs, crustacean and fish, the ingestion of <b>microplastic</b> beads has also been noted. Off the coast of Israel C. longicollis is very abundant and can make up to 70% of the total biomass in suitable habitat. However, in 1992 the Rhizocephalan parasitic barnacle Heterosaccus dollfusi {{was found to be}} infectoing a few crabs collected off Israel and within three years the infection had spread to Turkey. In 1995 77% of the crabs collected in Haifa Bay were infected. This rapid increase and high infection rate is attributed to the extremely high population density of the host and the year round reproduction of the parasite. Despite very high rates of infection the population has not declined as expected and {{it has been suggested that}} the depletion of rays in these waters may have led to a severe reduction in predation pressure on the crabs which combined with the high fecundity shown by the pool of uninfected crabs enables the high populations to be maintained.|$|E
5000|$|With {{increasing}} {{knowledge of}} the detrimental effects of microplastics on the environment, many groups are now advocating for the removal and ban of microplastics from various products. One {{of the most prominent}} campaigns is the [...] "Beat the Microbead" [...] movement, which focuses on removing plastics from personal care products. The Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation are running a Microplastics Project that is working to pass a national ban on microbeads in household items and cosmetics. Even UNESCO has sponsored research and global assessment programs due to the trans-boundary issue that <b>microplastic</b> pollution constitutes. These environmental groups will seemingly keep pressuring companies to remove plastics from their products in order to maintain healthy ecosystems. Statewide action has also been taken to mitigate the negative environmental effects of microplastics as Illinois was the first U.S. state to ban cosmetics containing microplastics. New Jersey Congressman Frank Pallone proposed the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2014, which calls for a nationwide ban on the creation and sale of products that contain microbeads by 2018. The Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015 was enacted after being signed by the President on December 28, 2015. It is effective from July 1, 2017 with respect to manufacturing, and July 1, 2018 with respect to introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce.|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{dynamics of}} <b>microplastic</b> (3 ̆c 5 mm) are well documented in marine ecosystems, but the sources, abundance, and ecological role of <b>microplastic</b> in rivers are unknown {{and likely to}} be substantial. <b>Microplastic</b> fibers (e. g., synthetic fabrics) and pellets (e. g., abrasives in personal care products) are abundant in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and {{can serve as a}} point source of <b>microplastic</b> in rivers. The buoyancy, hydrophobic surface, and long transport distance of <b>microplastic</b> make it a novel substrate for the selection and dispersal of unique microbial assemblages. We measured <b>microplastic</b> concentration and bacterial assemblage composition on <b>microplastic</b> and natural surfaces upstream and downstream of WWTP effluent sites at nine rivers in Illinois, United States. <b>Microplastic</b> concentration was higher downstream of WWTP effluent outfall sites in all but two rivers. Pellets, fibers, and fragments were the dominant <b>microplastic</b> types, and polymers were identified as polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene. Mean <b>microplastic</b> flux was 1, 338, 757 pieces per day, although the flux was highly variable among nine sites (min = 15, 520 per day, max = 4, 721, 709 per day). High-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes showed bacterial assemblage composition was significantly different among <b>microplastic,</b> seston, and water column substrates. <b>Microplastic</b> bacterial assemblages had lower taxon richness, diversity, and evenness than those on other substrates, and <b>microplastic</b> selected for taxa that may degrade plastic polymers (e. g., Pseudomonas) and those representing common human intestinal pathogens (e. g., Arcobacter). Effluent from WWTPs in rivers is {{an important component of the}} global plastic “life cycle,” and <b>microplastic</b> serves as a novel substrate that selects and transports distinct bacterial assemblages in urban rivers. Rates of <b>microplastic</b> deposition, consumption by stream biota, and the metabolic capacity of <b>microplastic</b> biofilms in rivers are unknown and merit further research...|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{of these}} include dust from {{car and truck}} tyres, {{synthetic}} textiles, ropes, paint and waste treatment. These sources of <b>microplastics</b> are quite recently recognized and are somewhere between primary and secondary <b>microplastics.</b> A Norwegian Environment Agency review report about <b>microplastics</b> published in early 2015 states it would be beneficial to classify these sources as primary, as long as <b>microplastics</b> from these sources are added from human society at the [...] "start of the pipe", and their emissions are inherently a result of human material and product use and not secondary defragmentation in nature.|$|R
40|$|Plastic litter is an {{environmental}} problem of great concern. Despite {{the magnitude of}} the plastic pollution in our water bodies, only limited scientific understanding is available about the risk to the environment, particularly for <b>microplastics.</b> The apparent magnitude of the problem calls for quickly developing sound scientific guidance on the ecological risks of <b>microplastics.</b> The authors suggest that future research into <b>microplastics</b> risks should be guided by lessons learned from the more advanced and better understood areas of (eco) toxicology of engineered nanoparticles and mixture toxicity. Relevant examples of advances in these two[*]fields are provided to help accelerate the scientific learning curve within the relatively unexplored area of <b>microplastics</b> risk assessment. Finally, the authors advocate an expansion of the “vector effect” hypothesis with regard to <b>microplastics</b> risk to help focus research of <b>microplastics</b> environmental risk at different levels of biological and environmental organization.

40|$|Floating plastic debris {{tends to}} {{fragment}} into smaller pieces, termed <b>microplastics,</b> which {{may increase the}} likelihood of ingestion of plastics by marine organisms entering the food web. This study analyses the amount and spatial distribution of <b>microplastics</b> and zooplankton in an area near Asinara National Park (NW Sardinia) and overlapping the Pelagos Sanctuary (Mediterranean Sea).
