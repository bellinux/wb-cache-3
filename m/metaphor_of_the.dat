5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> libido was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{story is}} inspired by Maxim Gorky's sentimental novel Mother, which is considered the first socialist realist novel, and a story that Han was familiar with. Myers traces the story's foundation back to anti-Christian stories in rural colonial Korea {{as well as in}} fascist Japan. The <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villain as a beast, too, is more readily associated with wartime Japanese propaganda than socialist realism. It had, however, featured in the works of early Soviet writers as whose work Han knew, as well as in textual genres not bound by the official socialist realist dogma, such as journalism.|$|E
5|$|According to {{professor}} Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's Mother India is a metonymic {{representation of a}} Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that Mother India could {{also be seen as}} a <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the Mother India figure is an icon in several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity {{at the end of the}} film by playing the role of Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century, René Descartes' {{mechanical}} philosophy encouraged the use of the <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe as a machine, a concept that would come to characterise the scientific revolution. Between 1650 and 1800, some naturalists, such as Benoît de Maillet, produced theories that maintained that the universe, the Earth, and life, had developed mechanically, without divine guidance. In contrast, most contemporary theories of evolution, such of those of Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Gottfried Herder, regarded evolution as a fundamentally spiritual process. In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species, a description that anticipated in general terms the concept of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Smith, {{a philosopher}} who forged the new {{discipline}} of economics, is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, showing {{his concern for}} the practical matters of economic activity, a gown draped over his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia. Smith's economic ideas are also encoded into the statue: the plough behind him represents the agrarian economics he supplanted, the beehive before, {{is a symbol of}} the industry he predicted would come. His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invisible hand. The life-and-a-half size statue of Smith, is cast in bronze from a plaster model by the sculptor and was unveiled in 2008. It was funded by private subscriptions organised by the Adam Smith Institute.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to investigate, through metaphor analysis, <b>the</b> complex nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work {{undertaken}} by waiters and pursers on-board cruise ships. This is an under-researched field and empirical research has produced some interesting perceptions that these groups of workers have of themselves, of others, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world in which they work and live. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted over the telephone from a sample <b>of</b> international participants. <b>The</b> data were analysed using a metaphor analysis. Findings – There were three clusters of metaphorical illustration found: <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship, <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment, and <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> their occupation. <b>The</b> <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment were split into two sub-clusters. One explored how participants understood the ship's space or work setting, and the second identified the strategies used as participants negotiated their way through their working and social lives. The stories collected from the workers have produced a very different but realistic perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working lives <b>of</b> waiters and pursers. Research limitations/implications – Metaphors can only offer a partial view of a social phenomenon, rather than an all-encompassing view, which are furthermore specific to the research setting. Notably, for half of all participants English was not their first language, and consequently this may have had an impact upon their use <b>of</b> <b>metaphors.</b> Practical implications – This research highlights the socio-employment relationship and complexities of working on cruise ships. In particular, it recognises behavioural learning practices and organisational bureaucratic utilities, which the industry relies upon for managing employees. Originality/value – This study contributes new knowledge in an under-researched context exploring <b>the</b> sociological lives <b>of</b> hospitality cruise ship workers. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>metaphor</b> analysis has provided an interesting and useful route to extend understanding of cruise ship work...|$|R

25|$|Hosea is {{believed}} to be the first prophet to use marriage as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covenant between God and Israel, and he influenced latter prophets such as Jeremiah.

25|$|One {{interpretation}} of the (Khajuraho) temples {{is that they were}} built to celebrate the mythic marriage of Shiva and his consort. At Maha-shivratri in Khajuraho, they celebrate the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. (...)

25|$|Founder Karel Van Wijnendaele was keen on bad weather. He {{wanted the}} Tour of Flanders to be {{a symbol of}} Flemish culture and a <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. As a journalist, he romanticized the race's protagonists {{in the image of}} the Flemish people of the time: hard-working, {{struggling}} men in a constant battle with the elements. His rhetoric, combined with often harsh conditions, contributed to the image of the Tour of Flanders as a character race where only the most headstrong and physically robust could win.|$|E
25|$|Luna in her biga {{drawn by}} horses or oxen was {{an element of}} Mithraic iconography, usually {{in the context of}} the tauroctony. In the mithraeum of S.

40|$|By the 1730 s, theater audiences had {{tired of}} stage-managed {{spectacles}} {{and were more}} interested in participating, through sentimental response, in the theatrical experience. Messrs.

25|$|Thus, {{ascending}} by justly tuned fifths {{fails to}} close the circle by an excess of approximately 23.46 cents, roughly {{a quarter of a}} semitone, an interval known as the Pythagorean comma. In Pythagorean tuning, this problem is solved by markedly shortening the width of one of the twelve fifths, which makes it severely dissonant. This anomalous fifth is called wolf fifth as a humorous <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unpleasant sound of the note (like a wolf trying to howl an off-pitch note). The quarter-comma meantone tuning system uses eleven fifths slightly narrower than the equally tempered fifth, and requires a much wider and even more dissonant wolf fifth {{to close the}} circle. More complex tuning systems based on just intonation, such as 5-limit tuning, use at most eight justly tuned fifths and at least three non-just fifths (some slightly narrower, and some slightly wider than the just fifth) to close the circle. Other tuning systems use up to 53tones (the original 12tones and 42more between them) in order to close the circle of fifths.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, M. E. Lamb {{suggested}} that the play may have borrowed {{an aspect of the}} ancient myth of Theseus: the Athenian's entry into the Labyrinth of the Minotaur. The woods of the play serve as a metaphorical labyrinth, and for Elizabethans the woods were often an allegory of sexual sin. The lovers in the woods conquer irrational passion and find their way back. Bottom with his animal head becomes a comical version of the Minotaur. Bottom also becomes Ariadne's thread which guides the lovers. In having the new Minotaur rescue rather than threaten the lovers, the classical myth is comically inverted. Theseus himself is the bridegroom of the play who has left the labyrinth and promiscuity behind, having conquered his passion. The artisans may stand in for the master craftsman of the myth, and builder of the Labyrinth, Daedalus. Even Theseus' best known speech in the play, which connects the poet with the lunatic and the lover may be another <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lover. It is a challenge for the poet to confront the irrationality he shares with lovers and lunatics, accepting the risks of entering the labyrinth.|$|E
500|$|The novel carries {{strongly}} anti-colonial and anti-militaristic overtones, driven {{partly by}} Le Guin's negative {{reaction to the}} Vietnam War.

40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> {{our study}} is to {{identify}} several conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body expressed in <b>the</b> contexts <b>of</b> psychopathology and literature. We propose a specific categorization of literary sentences drawing on Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; 1999) and Context-Limited Simulation Theory (Ritchie 2003; 200; 2008). Based on corpus data, we show that in psychiatric manuals the physical body is always reasoned in metaphoric terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BODY-CONTAINER category, thus {{with a high degree}} of non-specific attributes. In psychoanalysis manuals, the body is represented by “sexual-sensual sentences” or by abstract “notions”. Italian poetry offers an additional representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body with special focus on the organs and other body parts like “heart, ” hand(s) ”, “face”, but also “blood”, “chest”, “arm(s), ” “eye(s) ”,“breast(s) ”, “head, ” “flesh, ” “skin”. Key-words: literary construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body; conceptual <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body; context-limited simulation theory; linguistic <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body; psychosomatics; representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body; literary sentences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body.
