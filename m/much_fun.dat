5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Wave Race 64 was {{released}} in China for the iQue Player console. A 1-hour demo of the game was also included with the console. On August 6, 2007, the game {{was released}} on the Wii's Virtual Console. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, the Virtual Console release does not feature Kawasaki banners due to expired licensing deals. These were replaced by Wii and Nintendo DS advertisements. However, when the game was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016, the Kawasaki banners were restored. The Virtual Console versions of the game were generally very well received, with reviewers considering the game {{to be just as}} <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as it was on the Nintendo 64.|$|E

5|$|In {{selecting}} the on-disc songs, FreeStyleGames recognized that engaging guitar tracks are not strictly limited to rock music, and included other genres into the mix. According to designer Jim Norris, their selection process began with identifying songs {{that would be}} expected by players {{to be on a}} Guitar Hero title, and then determining which of those songs which they could license. Once they had obtained the license, FreeStyleGames would mark up the song for the note highways and determined how <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> these songs would be to play. Finally, they balanced the song selection in the game to give players a combination of songs they know and those they may not recognize but would be enjoyable.|$|E
5|$|Marge and Lisa {{discover}} Bart's {{deception and}} inform the passengers {{that the virus}} is a hoax. As punishment, the furious passengers maroon the Simpsons in Antarctica and head home. While hiking toward a research station for help, they notice a group of penguins; Lisa is fascinated by {{the chance to see}} them up close, but Bart thinks that their lives are boring and says that the ice slide they are riding down is just one isolated moment of fun. Lisa tells him that capturing and enjoying the best moments in life can make it fun, and Bart realizes she is right after Homer pushes him down the ice slide, with the whole family joining in. The final scene is a flash-forward to an elderly Bart in a retirement home, commenting on how <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> his life has been.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E

25|$|Following the Virginia Tech shootings, {{the game}} was banned {{outright}} at some colleges. Other college administrations banned Nerf blasters instead to discourage the game, but students were still allowed to use balled up socks or marshmallows, which students have admitted are not as <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> Many campuses who responded negatively following the shootings have since repealed the Nerf bans, though others remain in place.|$|E

25|$|I {{think we}} were all pretty naive about what we, what we were achieving—we were having too <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to get kind of caught up.

And that was around about the time where we started our own label, just to, um, release, maybe, release a few, some bands of friends of ours, in bands.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a big thing {{for me at the}} time. The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E

25|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner had formed the punk rock group the Dropouts {{in the early}} 2000s merely {{as a way of}} having fun {{performing}} at shows, but after all his bandmates left for New York City to perform as the successful rock band the Stills full-time, he had an epiphany that he could take his own music more seriously, achieve that kind of success, and still have as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as he hoped. This, coupled with his first exposure to Tricky Woo (which he enjoyed for their resemblance to Black Sabbath and Deep Purple), led him to re-establish the Dropouts with a different musical style - hard rock - and a more earnest pursuit of success.|$|E
25|$|Bad Religion slowly {{reformed}} in 1986 {{out of the}} Back to the Known line-up when Graffin called Bentley {{and asked}} him to return. Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he had so <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back. This lineup recorded the band's third album, Suffer, which was released in 1988. Although the album did not chart on the Billboard 200, it received some positive reviews, and was voted Best Album of the Year by publications such as Trust, Maximum Rocknroll and Flipside.|$|E
