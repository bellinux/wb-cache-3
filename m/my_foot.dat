25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E

And then I put <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> on to her to keep her still. This didn't work so I stabbed her in the throat. I aimed and stabbed at the hard thing in her neck. I pushed the knife {{all the way in}} but she still wouldn't keep still so I worked out where her heart would be and I stabbed her {{on the left side of}} the chest.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E

25|$|When Mark Coleman got {{injured and}} had {{to drop out of}} his matchup against Tito Ortiz, Griffin {{accepted}} a rematch against Ortiz at UFC 106. Griffin also wore white and black fight shorts instead of his trademark tan shorts for the fight. Griffin {{went on to win the}} gory battle by split decision, showing superior striking skills and a stronger ground game than in their previous fight. After the fight Griffin said, “Tito was a great fight for me to come back, we’ll have to do a third that’s 1-1 man.” With a split decision in both of their fights, Griffin seemed more than willing to get a rubber match put together with Ortiz to settle the score once and for all. “You could tell he was a guy getting ready for Mark Coleman, no offense, and he’s a guy coming off back surgery. We’ll do it again, I won’t break <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> he’ll be in better shape,” commented Griffin.|$|E
25|$|In a cafe, Ferrando and Guglielmo (two officers) express {{certainty}} that their fiancées (Dorabella and Fiordiligi, respectively) will be eternally faithful. Don Alfonso expresses skepticism and claims {{that there is}} no such thing as a faithful woman. He lays a wager with the two officers, claiming he can prove in a day's time that those two, like all women, are fickle. The wager is accepted: the two officers will pretend to have been called off to war; soon thereafter they will return in disguise and each attempt to seduce the other's lover. The scene shifts to the two women, who are praising their men (duet: Ah guarda sorella—"Ah look sister"). Alfonso arrives to announce the bad news: the officers have been called off to war. Ferrando and Guglielmo arrive, brokenhearted, and bid farewell (quintet: Sento, o Dio, che questo piede è restio—"I feel, oh God, that <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> is reluctant"). As the boat with the men sails off to sea, Alfonso and the sisters wish them safe travel (trio: Soave sia il vento—"May the wind be gentle"). Alfonso, left alone, gloatingly predicts that the women (like all women) will prove unfaithful (arioso: Oh, poverini, per femmina giocare cento zecchini?—"Oh, poor little ones, to wager 100 sequins on a woman").|$|E

Cagney played Martin [...] "Moe the Gimp" [...] Snyder, a lame Jewish-American gangster from Chicago, a part Spencer Tracy had turned down. Cagney {{described}} the script as [...] "that extremely rare thing, the perfect script". When {{the film was}} released, Snyder reportedly asked how Cagney had so accurately copied his limp, but Cagney himself insisted he had not, having based it on personal observation of other people when they limped: [...] "What I did was very simple. I just slapped <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> down as I turned it out while walking. That's all".|$|E
500|$|One of Paul's main storylines {{culminated in}} him having his leg amputated after an accident.

One time I did change my leg, as in I swapped it over and limped on the other one to see if anyone noticed."

After arriving at Port Vale in June 2011, Vale manager Micky Adams stated, [...] "Ryan is a creative central midfielder and will bring plenty of quality on the ball, but he is also a very hard-working individual". Neil Duncanson, the Glenn Hoddle Academy's commercial director said: [...] "Ryan is very strong, powerful and suited to the front of a diamond in central midfield. He's a creative player who can take an excellent dead ball". Burge has said of himself that [...] "I'm a midfield player who likes to put <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> in, as well as to get on the ball and create things.

Soon after his father's death, Harbord and other senior Whigs visited Coke and asked him to stand for Norfolk in his father's stead. Coke was not enthusiastic, not seeing himself as a politician and hoping to enjoy his new estates and wealth, but after his visitors pointed out a Tory might otherwise replace him [...] "my blood chilled all over me from my head to <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> and I came forward". On 12 April he issued a manifesto to the Norfolk electorate, soon returning to campaign, and after being unanimously nominated on 27 April he was elected in May.|$|E

As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, [...] "The craziness was this: {{they were not the}} regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner...when you're doing what we do with them—that makes a world of difference". During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he [...] "rocketed one of them bottles off <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided Patriot missile, right towards the disco ball high above the crowd...The bottle nailed the disco ball, and... came falling down... on top of some English kid's head....

500|$|Frazier {{began his}} fourth season {{representing}} Penn State with 17 points, 8 assists, and 5 rebounds {{in an exhibition}} game against Philadelphia on November 3, 2012. He sat out {{for much of the}} second half, giving his duties to D. J. Newbill. After the game, Frazier said that the team [...] "just played Penn State basketball." [...] On November 9, 2012, the first regular season for Frazier as a senior, he logged his 19th career 20-point game against Saint Francis (PA). On November 18, Frazier left six minutes into a game against Akron due to a ruptured left Achilles tendon. It was announced that he had a recovery period of about 12 months and would be out for the season. The injury was described as a [...] "devastating blow" [...] to the program by ESPN.com writer Eamonn Brennan. Chambers addressed the situation, saying, [...] "I have no doubt he will meet this challenge and will again be one of the top players in the nation," [...] in accordance to his potential fifth year of NCAA eligibility. Frazier redshirted the season shortly after it was announced by the school that he would undergo surgery. He said, [...] "I will never forget that game, that injury, never forget that camera. I'm sitting there on the sideline with the (television) camera just zooming in on <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> I'll never forget the look on my sister's face, my mom and dad's face." [...] During his rehabilitation, Frazier began using the elliptical machine, doing work in the swimming pool, and taking part in weight training. He was guided by Penn State's athletic trainer, Jon Salazer, throughout the process. Frazier's sister Krystal had torn her right Achilles tendon when playing college basketball nearly seven years prior, and had gone through a similar rehabilitation before resuming her playing career.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the Browns, the Braves were contenders {{all the way}} to the end of the 1948 season. In a {{game against}} the Philadelphia Phillies on 3 September, and with the Braves tied for the NL lead, Heath hit a two-run home run and the Braves went on to win the game, 3–1, and stayed in first place for the {{remainder}} of the regular season. With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on 29 September but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he slid, his foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. [...] "I began to slide about five feet from the plate. Funny thing, I generally get my spikes up off the ground, but this time I didn't. I looked at <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> which was twisted all the way around, and honestly I thought it would come right off", Heath said the next day from a local hospital. After playing in the majors for parts of 12 years, he would be forced to miss the World Series as it was later diagnosed he fractured his ankle. He called the broken ankle [...] "the biggest disappointment of my life." [...] A widely published newspaper photograph of the play showed Heath sliding toward the plate, mouth open in shock, with his leg bent mid-ankle with the lower ankle rotated ninety degrees to the upper ankle. He was quoted asking himself [...] "Why did I slide?" [...] when he was carried off the field on a stretcher and later put in an ambulance. In 1964, Heath said: ...|$|E
