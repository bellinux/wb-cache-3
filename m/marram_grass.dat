5|$|Grasses and sedges {{are common}} {{everywhere}} except dune systems (where <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> may be locally abundant) and stony mountain tops and plateaux. The {{total number of}} species is large, 84 have been recorded on the verges of a single road in West Lothian.|$|E
5|$|Webs are {{typically}} established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation {{such as the}} native Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) or the introduced <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> (Ammophila arenaria). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such as empty tin cans or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so {{on the underside of}} a plant overhanging open sand. It has been found that these patches of open sand are necessary for katipo to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic plants like kikuyu or buffalo grass, create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipo therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pingao plants as this plants growth pattern leaves patches of sand between each plant. The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these gaps and into the web. <b>Marram</b> <b>grass</b> has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pingao in many areas. Because <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this makes it difficult for the katipo to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where <b>marram</b> <b>grass,</b> sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. <b>Marram</b> <b>grass</b> is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E
50|$|In 1932 {{planting}} of <b>marram</b> <b>grasses</b> began in earnest, with lupins and eventually pine seedlings following. In Woodhill there were 4 camps of 20-30 men per camp working all year around, with supplies being {{brought in from}} neighbouring farms and plants supplied from a Nursery also {{in what was then}} a barren wasteland of sand dunes. The real pioneer was A.A.Restall, the highly successful Forest Manager at Woodhill, who introduced machinery and processes that lifted the amount of planting to levels that turned the tide of sand encroachment at Woodhill. Restall's created best practice for other sand reclamation projects around New Zealand, and around the world.|$|R
5|$|The Sable Island {{horses are}} a feral horse {{population}} that is entirely unmanaged: they {{are not subject to}} any kind of interference. Observational research, which is considered noninvasive to the herd, has been conducted by various entities over several decades. The population in recent years (2009 and onward) has varied between 400 and 550 animals. Due to the lack of predators, older horses often die of starvation after their teeth are worn down by a lifetime of exposure to sand and <b>marram,</b> a tough <b>grass.</b> A lack of nutritional food on the island limits the horses' size, and the offspring of those removed from the island and raised on better diets are significantly larger.|$|R
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where <b>marram</b> <b>grass,</b> sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found. The narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest.|$|E

Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat.|$|E
25|$|The {{sand dunes}} are {{initially}} stabilised by <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> and sea couch grass, enabling colonisation by sea poa grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass, which {{also help to}} bind the sand.

Ferns, milkweed, Queen Anne's lace, and chicory {{grow in the}} open fields and along roadsides. Forest plants include wild leeks, morel mushrooms, and trilliums. <b>Marram</b> <b>grass</b> grows on beaches. Several mosses cover the land.|$|E
25|$|Pest {{plants and}} weeds are a {{significant}} threat on the peninsula, impacting wildlife and habitat as well as threatened plant species and vegetation communities. African Boxthorn (Lycium ferocissimum), Gorse (Ulex europaeus), Kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) and Melaleuca species have been given priority for management as they threaten seabird habitat and provide shelter for feral cats and foxes. Introduced species such as <b>Marram</b> <b>Grass</b> (Ammophila arenaria) and Sea Wheat-grass (Thinopyrum junceiforme) have become well-established in many areas affecting dune development and morphology.|$|E
25|$|Amrum's {{vegetation}} {{is determined}} by the sea and by the different types of landscapes on the island, most of which are low in nutrients. In parts of the dune belt and on the Kniepsand <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> or sea wormwood grow, as well as numerous other sand-loving plants like sheep's bit which will bloom in sheltered areas between the dunes. Also some stunted pines, bent by the sea wind, and Salix repens, the creeping willow can be found there. Until the 1970s, the rare sea holly could still be seen in the dunes.|$|E
25|$|The Braunton Burrows {{core area}} {{consists}} of fixed and mobile sand dune systems with geomorphological and successional processes. There are also variable-flooded slacks, grassland and scrub further inland supporting {{a wide variety}} of flowering and lower plants, birds, and insects. It includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. It is characterised by <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> (Ammophila arenaria), round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush (Juncus acutus), and willow (Salix) species. On the strandline there is rock sea lavender (Limonium binervosum). The fore and mid dunes are generally sandy yellow dunes, colonised and stabilised by <b>marram</b> <b>grass.</b> Other notable species include sea stock (Matthiola sinuate), sea stork's-bill (Erodium maritimum), sea clover (Trifolium aquamosum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias), and white horehound (Marrubium vulgare). Further inland, the stable grey dunes are stabilised by other species such as dune fescue (Vulpia membranacea). The dune slacks, the valleys between the dunes, may flood after heavy rain and are wet and marshy during the winter. They support round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush, round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia ssp. maritima), early gentian (Gentianella anglica), and many orchid species. Listed as endangered on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's Vascular Plant Red Data List for Great Britain, the water germander (Teucrium scordium), a perennial plant that lives in the slacks, has just one other population in the UK.|$|E

60|$|So down we went {{upon the}} burrows, among the sands, which hid from us every object but their own chaotic curves and mounds. Above, a hundred skylarks made the air ring with carollings; strange and gaudy plants flecked the waste round us; and insects without number whirred over our heads, or hung poised with their wings {{outspread}} on the tall stalks of <b>marram</b> <b>grass.</b> All {{at once a}} cloud hid the sun, and a summer whirlwind, presage of the thunderstorm, swept past us, carrying up with it a column of dry sand, and rattling the dry bents over our heads.|$|E
60|$|The village, Lelant, {{is on the}} Hayle estuary, {{and to see the}} Atlantic one has but to {{walk past}} the grey old church {{at the end of the}} street, where the ground rises, to find oneself in a {{wilderness}} of towans, as the sand-hills are there called, clothed in their rough, grey-green <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> and spreading on either hand round the bay of St. Ives. A beautiful sight, for the sea on a sunny day is of that marvellous blue colour seen only in Cornwall; far out on a rock on the right hand stands the shining white Godrevy lighthouse, and on the left, on the opposite side of the bay, the little ancient fishing-town of St. Ives.|$|E
60|$|As to its beauty, {{those who}} know it {{in a state of}} nature, in its haunts on the sea coast, will agree that {{it is one of the}} handsomest of our large wild birds. It cannot now be said that it is common, except in a few favoured localities. On the south coast it is all but extinct as a {{breeding}} species, and on the east side of England it is becoming increasingly rare, even in spots so well suited to it as Holy Island, and the coast at Bamborough Castle, with its great sand-hills. These same hills that look on the sea, and are greener than ivy with the everlasting green of the rough <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> that covers them, would be a very paradise to the sheldrake, but for man--vile man!--who watches him through a spy-glass in the breeding season to rob him of his eggs. The persecuted bird has grown exceedingly shy and cautious, but go he must to his burrow in the dunes, and the patient watcher sees him at a great distance on account of his conspicuous white plumage, and marks the spot, then takes his spade to dig down to the hidden eggs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marram</b> <b>grass</b> {{plants on}} coastal sand dunes {{all over the}} world. It more like growing on the active sand area and {{windward}} side of foredune. It should be planted on well-drained soils with different kinds of mineral compositions. The best soil condition for <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> is the soil pH range from 4.5-9.0, soil temperature from 10-40 degrees Celsius. <b>Marram</b> <b>grass</b> {{can be found on}} a high alkaline which pH around 9.1 and also found on acid lands which pH less than 4.5.

50|$|The {{ability of}} <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> to grow on and bind sand {{makes it a}} useful plant in the {{stabilization}} of coastal dunes and artificial defences on sandy coasts. The usefulness was recognized in the late 18th century. On the North Sea coast of Jutland,Denmark, <b>marram</b> <b>grass</b> was traditionally much used for fuel, thatch, cattle fodder (after frost) etc. The use led to sand drift and loss of arable land. Hence, legislation promoting dune stabilization came into force in 1779 and 1792, successively leading {{to a system of}} state-supported dune planters overlooked by dune bailifs. <b>Marram</b> <b>grass</b> was - and still is - propagated by root and shoot cuttings dug up locally and planted into the naked sand in periods of relatively calm and moist weather.|$|E
