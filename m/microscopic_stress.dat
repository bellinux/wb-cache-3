The incompatibility strains, which develop along the boundaries of randomly oriented anisotropic grains, are shown to influence the local stress fields at crack tips significantly. The limited number of calculations indicate that the anisotropic arrangement of grains with local incompatibility strains causes in average about 20 % higher J-integral values at the crack tips than expected from the calculation in isotropic case. More important consequence of incompatibility strains seems to be large variability of mode II contribution of J-integral. This implies that anisotropy could have extremely important impact on the direction of crack propagation. Further analysis is needed to quantify those effects more accurately. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to explain the origin of fatigue observed in salt rock subject to cyclic loading. We used a self-consistent homogenization scheme to upscale the viscoplastic and damage behavior of halite polycrystals from mono-crystal viscous glide and breakage mechanisms. We modeled mono-crystals as spherical inclusions embedded in an infinite homogeneous matrix, and we assumed purely elastic inclusion/matrix interactions. We introduced a failure criterion at the mono-crystal scale in order to predict grain breakage and the subsequent damage effects on salt rock elastic moduli. We wrote an algorithm that allows computing macroscopic and <b>microscopic</b> <b>stresses</b> and strains during creep and cyclic axial loading. Although some simplifying assumptions were made in our micro- macro approach, the model provided micro-mechanical interpretations to important aspects of salt rock viscoplastic and fatigue behavior, which had not been explained so far, such as strain hardening, creep recovery, as well as damage and accelerated creep due to grain breakage. Moreover, incremental viscoplastic strains decreased over the cycles, which is {{in agreement with the}} phenomenon of "shakedown" observed in elasto-plastic media.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the starting composition on the mechanical properties of sintered porcelain tile was evaluated based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics. Tile compositions were prepared according to a simplex-centroid mixture design set out in part I of this research. Results were analyzed based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics.

This methodology {{made it possible to}} evaluate the mechanisms which are more relevant for strengthening and the role of each component of the system. It was observed that the phase composition affects markedly the mechanical strength of porcelain tile mainly by changes in fracture energy. Young's modulus and flaw size have also a notable but less important influence. Wide variations in flaw size can cause a more severe impact on the mechanical strength. In turn, the fracture energy is equally affected by the state of <b>microscopic</b> residual <b>stress</b> and the deflection in crack propagation.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the macroscopic and microscopic mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials under {{the conditions of}} cyclic loading, a Voronoi polycrystalline aggregation model was employed to study the statistical distribution of stress and strain, and macroscopic cyclic plasticity, for a copper polycrystalline material. The algorithm for solving the visco-plastic constitutive relations that describing the slipping plasticity for single crystal grain of the polycrystalline material applied in the present paper was suggested by Zhang et al. (2004 a, 2004 b), in which the Cauchy stress tensor is taken as the basic variable to be solved by Newton-Raphson iterations. On the basis of calculation of single crystal constitutive equations, the simulation for a FCC copper polycrystal were carried out under the cyclic loading of symmetrical tensile and compression. According to the results, the distribution of <b>microscopic</b> <b>stress,</b> strain and effective plastic strain, and coefficient of variation (the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) were analyzed, which shows the heterogeneities of <b>microscopic</b> <b>stress</b> and strain in the Voronoi polycrystal tessellation caused by the randomness of the grain crystals in the polycrystal aggregate. Meanwhile, the curve of mean stress and strain for the Voronoi polycrystalline tessellation were also calculated, the results can reasonably describe the Bauschinger effect and cyclic hardening characteristic of polycrystalline materials. It is necessary to point out that, in the present paper, the cyclic characteristic of polycrystalline material is not set prior. The cyclic plasticity of the Voronoi tessellation is completely obtained from the results modeled by the tessellation associated with the known mechanical behavior of a single crystal, under the cyclic load condition. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We have {{recently}} developed a geometric {{formulation of the}} stress field for an interacting quantum system within the local density approximation (LDA) of density functional theory (DFT). We obtain a stress field which is invariant with respect to choice of energy density. In this paper, we explicitly demonstrate this uniqueness by deriving the stress field for different energy densities. We also explain why particular energy densities give expressions for the stress field that are more tractable than others, thereby lending themselves more easily to first-principles calculations. Understanding a material’s energetic response to strain is fundamentally coupled to understanding the physics of {{a broad range of}} phenomena, from surface reconstructions to piezoelectricity. For example, it has been demonstrated that knowledge of the spatial distribution of <b>microscopic</b> <b>stress</b> via first-principles calculations can help explain the onset of macroscopic polarization in a material [1]. Therefore {{it is important to understand}} the nature of stress at the microscopic level. Formally, the electronic contribution to the <b>microscopic</b> <b>stress</b> must be included via quantum mechanics. There have been numerous methods developed for computing the quantum stress. (See Ref. [2] and references contained within.) The stress field, σαβ(x), is a rank-two tensor field usually taken to be symmetric (torque-free). The divergence of σαβ(x) must equal the force field F α (x) of the system: F α = ∇βσ αβ. (1) (Note that the Einstein summation convention for repeated indices is used throughout the paper.) It is well-known that Eq. 1 does not uniquely define the stress field (regardless of whether a system is quantum-mechanical or classical) since one can add any tensor whose divergence is zero to σαβ(x) and still recover the same force field [3]. The volume-averaged or total stress Tαβ has been related to the energetic response of the system to uniform strain and to the integral over the stress field: T αβ = ∂...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a stress–strain interpolation method {{to model the}} macroscopic anisotropic elasto-plastic behavior of polycrystalline materials. Accurate analytical descriptions of yield loci derived from crystallographic texture [Int. J. Plasticity 19 (2003) 647; J. Phys. IV France 105 (2003) 39] are an interesting alternative to finite element models, where the macroscopic stress is provided by an averaging of <b>microscopic</b> <b>stresses</b> computed {{on a set of}} representative crystallites [Acta Metal 22 (1985) 923; Int. J. Plasticity 5 (1989) 67]. The parameters of the analytical functions modeling the yield locus are identified by comparison with a high number of stress tensors computed, for instance, by the well-known Taylor model [J. Inst. Metal 62 (1938) 307]. This identification method depends on the crystallographic texture and should be applied each time that the plastic strain has induced a significant texture evolution. The stress–strain interpolation method accurately describes the anisotropic material behavior in a narrow stress direction defined by only five stress points. The cost of texture updating is then greatly reduced compared to a full analytical function of the yield locus. After the mathematical description of the stress–strain interpolation method, its validity is demonstrated on two non-radial strain paths. The simulations of a deep drawing experiment allow comparing model predictions and measurements. Accuracy and CPU time of the interpolation stress–strain method are judged against two other models, respectively based on a complete analytical yield locus and on the averaging of crystallite stresses.
