5|$|Accounts by 19th-century historians {{suggest that}} Day grew {{impatient}} with the girls when they became bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent significant time nursing them through a bout of smallpox. These accounts may have been exaggerated as both girls had been inoculated against smallpox, and their strict upbringing <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> would not have rebelled excessively.|$|E
5|$|Anderlecht {{finished}} the 1978–79 Belgian First Division in second place, four points behind champions Beveren. Thus, they would {{compete in the}} 1979–80 UEFA Cup. Liverpool {{finished the}} 1978–79 Football League in first place, eight points clear of second-placed Nottingham Forest. Their domestic championship triumph <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> would compete in the European Cup the following season.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} automatically {{into the}} Champions League group stage because of England's country coefficient. They were drawn in Group B, along with AIK, Barcelona and Fiorentina. Each club played six matches, with Arsenal registering two victories, two draws and two defeats. This <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> finished in third place, one point behind second place holders Fiorentina, and hence entered {{the third round}} stage of the UEFA Cup.|$|E

60|$|The look <b>meant</b> that <b>they</b> {{would go}} through Dick's pockets and rob him. The men were {{thorough}} rascals and if the youth had anything worth taking <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> to have it.|$|R
5|$|As champions, Liverpool faced CSKA Moscow (winners of the 2005 UEFA Cup Final) in the 2005 UEFA Super Cup, held on 26 August. Liverpool won {{the match}} 3–1 after extra time. Liverpool's victory in Istanbul also <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> {{qualified}} for the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship. Liverpool beat Deportivo Saprissa 3–0 in the semi-final, and played Copa Libertadores champions São Paulo in the final, losing 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Fellow First Division side Swindon Town {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the semi-finals. Swindon won the first leg at their home ground, the County Ground 2–1. Bolton recovered in the second leg to win 3–1, which <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> progressed to the final courtesy of a 4–3 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, {{the first}} Spanish {{football}} league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season {{until the last}} match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> finished runners-up to Barcelona.

5|$|Leicester {{lost two}} games during the pool stage, but amassed {{sufficient}} points to finish {{as the top}} side in the pool and to be seeded fourth, which <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> were given {{the last of the}} home draws against the fifth-seeded side, Bath. Leicester beat Bath 20–15 to reach the semi-final.|$|E
5|$|Life peerages {{were also}} offered {{to members of}} the royal family with new {{hereditary}} peerages, but declined (as it would have <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> would hold seats in the House of Lords): Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Prince Charles, Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The Dukes of Gloucester and Kent had both inherited their titles from their fathers, the first dukes.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool played Wolverhampton Wanderers a {{week before}} the final in their last match of the 1964–65 Football League First Division. Shankly rested most of the first-choice players, but Liverpool still won the match 3–1, with goals from Geoff Strong, John Sealey and Alf Arrowsmith, the victory <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> {{finished}} the season in seventh place. Leeds went into their final match of the league season with a chance of winning the championship. However, they drew their match with Birmingham City 3–3, which <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> were level on points with Manchester United, who had a match remaining. As United had a superior goal average only a defeat of 17–0 or greater would result in Leeds being champions. United lost 2–1 to Aston Villa in their final match and won the title by a goal average of 0.686.|$|E

60|$|Four {{of the men}} {{left behind}} gaped after him without any {{apparent}} glimmering of his meaning. Syme alone had even a glimmering, and {{such as it was}} it froze him to the bone. If the last words of the President <b>meant</b> anything, <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> that he had not after all passed unsuspected. <b>They</b> <b>meant</b> that while Sunday could not denounce him like Gogol, he still could not trust him like the others.|$|R

5|$|Liverpool's {{victory was}} their third UEFA Cup success, this put them level with Internazionale and Juventus as the teams {{with the most}} success in the competition.

5|$|Southampton was Manchester United's {{opponent}} in the sixth round. After two minutes at St Mary's United took the lead; a shot by Roy Keane near the penalty area hit Southampton's Peter Crouch and deflected into the goal.

5|$|The 2012–13 {{season was}} the 91st season of {{competitive}} association football and 76th {{season in the}} Football League played by York City Football Club, a professional football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England.

The season ran from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013.|$|E
60|$|There was {{one thing}} to be said for the trout on this side: <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> business. <b>They</b> did not rise shyly, like the others, but went for the fly if it came at all near them, and then, down they rushed, and bolted into the lily-roots.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Wulf, [...] "at {{the least}} {{we have seen}} the last of her crew of women-thieves. Had <b>they</b> <b>meant</b> more mischief, <b>they</b> would have shown {{themselves}} again ere now." ...|$|R

5|$|A second-place {{finish in}} the 2001–02 FA Premier League {{entitled}} Liverpool {{to participate in the}} Champions League for a second successive season, but they only finished third in their group and were eliminated from the competition. The third-place finish <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> entered the 2002–03 UEFA Cup. Liverpool beat Dutch team Vitesse Arnhem and Auxerre to set up an all-British tie with Scottish team Celtic. A 1–1 draw in the first leg meant Liverpool would progress to the semi-finals if they did not concede a goal in the second leg at Anfield. However, Celtic scored before half-time and again in the second half to win 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal Football Club {{was founded}} in 1886 as a munition workers' team from Woolwich, then in Kent, now {{southeast}} London. They turned professional in 1891 and joined The Football League two years later. They were promoted to the First Division in 1904 but financial problems <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> were liquidated and reformed. They were bought out by Sir Henry Norris that year and to improve the club's financial standing, he moved the team to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, north London in 1913. After the First World War he arranged for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in controversial circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the 1989 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1988–89 Football League First Division. The team played Liverpool at Anfield in {{the final game of}} the season and needed to win by two clear goals to be crowned champions. Alan Smith scored for Arsenal early in the second half to make it 1–0, and Michael Thomas's goal with seconds left of the match ensured the team won the league title. Liverpool, days before the league encounter with Arsenal, defeated Everton to win the 1989 FA Cup Final which <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> obtained the other Charity Shield place.|$|E
5|$|Borussia {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup courtesy of a third-place finish in the 1971–72 Fußball-Bundesliga. The opposition {{in the first round}} were Scottish side Aberdeen.

Danish side Hvidovre were the opposition in the second round. A 3–0 victory in West Germany was followed by a 3–1 victory in Denmark to secure a 6–1 aggregate victory for Borussia.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best possible use of their forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army <b>meant</b> <b>they</b> could not remain in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E
