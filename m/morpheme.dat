5000|$|Sub-morphemes are {{metamorphosis}} {{of actual}} <b>morphemes.</b> Sub-morphemes are also called complementary <b>morphemes</b> or meta-morphemes.

50|$|A typical Onondaga verb {{consists}} of several <b>morphemes</b> (components). The following chart outlines {{the order of}} the <b>morphemes.</b> Obligatory <b>morphemes</b> appear in boldface, and optional <b>morphemes</b> are in standard font. Note that some of the “optional” <b>morphemes</b> are obligatory with certain verb roots. The obligatory <b>morphemes,</b> however, must appear on each and every single verb.|$|R
5000|$|Bound <b>morphemes</b> appear only as {{parts of}} words, always in {{conjunction}} with a root and sometimes with other bound <b>morphemes.</b> For example, un- appears only accompanied by other <b>morphemes</b> to form a word. Most bound <b>morphemes</b> in English are affixes, particularly prefixes and suffixes. Examples of suffixes are -tion, -ation, -ible, -ing, etc. Bound <b>morphemes</b> that are not affixes are called cranberry <b>morphemes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>morpheme</b> that is glossed as aspect in {{the above}} example, {{referred}} to in the literature as the -ma suffix, denotes aspectual unmarkedness. Its absence signifies perfective aspect, and it may be further suffixed with -yan, producing -ma-yan, to denote continuous or imperfective aspect.|$|E
5|$|In {{the table}} above, genitive pronouns all end with -gin, which is {{separated}} orthographically by a hyphen that normally divides morphemes. The -gin form {{here is not}} a separate <b>morpheme</b> and cannot be lexically segmented; {{there is no such}} word as nganing that would be formed by removing -gin from nganing-gin 'my/mine'. The fact that the genitive forms have regular endings across the entire pronoun paradigm may have been a historical accident.|$|E
5|$|Verbalisation {{involves}} re-analysing {{the entire}} coverb - including its suffix -ma, which serves merely {{to indicate that}} it is unmarked for aspect - as a verb root, and then to apply the usual obligatory verbal inflection affixes for person, number and tense. As there is no discrete <b>morpheme</b> {{that serves as a}} 'verbaliser', the process is one of conversion.|$|E
50|$|The {{possible}} verbal final <b>morphemes</b> (class D) {{are shown}} below. Unlike the class C <b>morphemes,</b> {{only one of}} these final-position <b>morphemes</b> can occur in any single word. Therefore, the ordering of <b>morphemes</b> in this table does not indicate anything about a linear relationship among the <b>morphemes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Even though <b>morphemes</b> {{combine to}} create a word in Odia, the <b>morphemes</b> are not always {{independent}} words. Some single <b>morphemes</b> are words while other words are composed {{of two or more}} <b>morphemes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite these advances, {{movable type}} {{printing}} never gained {{the amount of}} widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written <b>morpheme</b> characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.|$|E
5|$|Modern Mongolian is an agglutinative, almost {{exclusively}} suffixing language, {{the only exception}} being reduplication. Most of the suffixes consist of a single <b>morpheme.</b> There are many derivational morphemes. For example, the word bajguullagynh consists of the root baj- 'to be', an epenthetic -g-, the causative -uul- (hence 'to found'), the derivative suffix -laga that forms nouns created by the action (like -ation in 'organisation') and the complex suffix –ynh denoting something that belongs to the modified word (-yn would be genitive).|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of <b>morpheme</b> representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E

30|$|Figures  5, 6 and 7 {{indicate}} that the three <b>morphemes</b> have preferences for co-occurring with certain types of motion <b>morphemes.</b> Specifically, 上 shang ‘ascend’ and 下 xia ‘descend’ prefer to occur with nonscalar change motion <b>morphemes,</b> whereas 退 tui ‘recede’ prefers closed scale motion <b>morphemes.</b> Due to space limitation, I do not discuss the possible reasons for the divergences between 退 tui ‘recede’ and 上/下 shang/xia ‘ascend/descend’ in this paper. Nonetheless, the figures show that {{the order of the}} three <b>morphemes</b> and <b>morphemes</b> from other scalar types are consistent with the hierarchy.|$|R
50|$|A related {{concept is}} the {{isolating}} language, {{which is about}} a low number of any type of <b>morphemes</b> per word, taking into account derivational <b>morphemes</b> as well. A purely isolating language would be analytic by necessity, lacking inflectional <b>morphemes</b> by definition. However, the reverse is not necessarily true: a language can have derivational <b>morphemes</b> while lacking inflectional <b>morphemes.</b> For example, Mandarin Chinese has many compound words, giving it a moderately high ratio of <b>morphemes</b> per word, yet, since it has almost no inflectional affixes at all to convey grammatical relationships, it is a very analytic language.|$|R
5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single <b>morpheme,</b> requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Croc: Legend of the Gobbos was first teased {{on the back}} of the Sega Saturn version of the game’s manual. Initially advertised for a Christmas 1998 release,Croc 2 was {{released}} in June of 1999 for the Sony PlayStation, and later for Microsoft Windows and the Game Boy Color. A Sega Saturn release was also advertised but never released, and a Sega Dreamcast port of the game was ultimately cancelled. The game follows Croc as he once again ventures to defeat Baron Dante, who has captured an old inventor Gobbo, while simultaneously searching for his long-lost parents. The game makes numerous gameplay changes from the first game, including the addition of a health counter, more mission-based levels, and an open HUB area for navigating levels. A 2D side-scrolling port of the game for the Game Boy Color, simply titled Croc, was released in June 2000. Three mobile phone games based on the game, developed by <b>Morpheme,</b> were released through the mid-2000s, titled Croc Mobile: Jungle Rumble, Croc Mobile Pinball, and Croc Mobile: Volcanic Panic!.|$|E

40|$|Freestanding {{and bound}} <b>morphemes</b> differ in many (psycho) {{linguistic}} aspects. Some theorists {{have claimed that}} the representation and retrieval of freestanding and bound <b>morphemes</b> {{in the course of}} language production are governed by similar processing mechanisms. Alternatively, it has been proposed that both types of <b>morphemes</b> may be selected for production in different ways. In this article, the authors first review the available experimental evidence related to this topic and then present new experimental data pointing to the notion that freestanding and bound <b>morphemes</b> are retrieved following distinct processing principles: freestanding <b>morphemes</b> are subject to competition, bound <b>morphemes</b> not...|$|R
50|$|Some words {{might seem}} to be {{composed}} of multiple <b>morphemes,</b> but in fact they are not. This is why one has to consider form and meaning when identifying <b>morphemes.</b> For example, the word relate {{might seem to}} be composed of two <b>morphemes,</b> re- (prefix) and the word late, but this is not correct. These <b>morphemes</b> have no relationship with the definitions relevant to the word like “feel sympathy”, “narrate”, or “being connected by blood or marriage”. Furthermore, the length of the words does not determine if it has multiple <b>morphemes</b> or not. To demonstrate, the word Madagascar is long and it might seem to have <b>morphemes</b> like mad, gas, and car, but it does not. Conversely, small words can have multiple <b>morphemes</b> (e.g. dogs).|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of lexical <b>morphemes</b> consist {{of two or}} three syllables. Lexical <b>morphemes</b> consisting of four syllables or a single syllable are uncommon whereas <b>morphemes</b> consisting of more than four syllables have never occurred.|$|R
25|$|If the <b>morpheme</b> {{following}} the first stress lacks lexical stress, the stress {{remains on the}} first <b>morpheme.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{the first}} {{stressed}} <b>morpheme</b> is stressed anywhere {{except for the}} final mora of a stem-final vowel, the subsequent <b>morpheme</b> is unstressed.|$|E
25|$|These can in turn {{be either}} {{regressive}} or non-regressive. In regressive alterations, the first vowel {{of the second}} <b>morpheme</b> changes the last vowel of the first <b>morpheme.</b> Regressive assimilations are only conditioned by phonological factors while substitutions take into account semantic information.|$|E
50|$|The free <b>morphemes</b> carry a fixed meaning {{while the}} bound <b>morphemes</b> exhibit large scale {{variations}} in meanings. The variable and changing {{meanings of the}} bound <b>morphemes</b> impart diversity to word meanings and enrich the language.|$|R
3000|$|... dMMMCs {{with more}} than three motion <b>morphemes</b> are rarely found. There are cases in which {{multiple}} <b>morphemes</b> appear together, as the five <b>morphemes</b> in i. However, these <b>morphemes</b> are actually from two independent MMMCs, 跳出來 tiao-chu-lai jump-exit-come ‘jump out’ and 走進…旅店 zou-jin … lüdian walk-enter…hotel ‘walk into… a hotel’, because a pause or conjunction can be inserted in between them.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} examination of locative <b>morphemes</b> called AxPart <b>morphemes</b> {{as found in}} word-formation. Free AxPart <b>morphemes</b> that constitute lexical PPs in syntax actively participate in word-formation. Certain bound locative <b>morphemes,</b> on the other hand, produce words that are semantically paraphrased by lexical PPs. English and Japanese complex words of these types simultaneously show dependence and independence between morphology and syntax...|$|R
