Enhanced operating regimes motivate the study of CNT-based aligned nanofiber carbon matrix nanocomposites (CNT A-CMNCs). However, in order to tailor the material {{properties of}} CNT A-CMNCs, porosity control of the carbon matrix is required. Such control is usually achieved via multiple liquid precursor infusions and pyrolyzations. Here we report a model that allows the quantitative prediction of the CNT A-CMNC density and <b>matrix</b> <b>porosity</b> {{as a function of}} number of processing steps. The experimental results indicate that the <b>matrix</b> <b>porosity</b> of A-CMNCs comprised of ∼ 1 % aligned CNTs decreased from ∼ 61 % to ∼ 55 % after a second polymer infusion and pyrolyzation. The model predicts that diminishing returns for porosity reduction will occur after 4 processing steps (<b>matrix</b> <b>porosity</b> of ∼ 51 %), and that > 10 processing steps are required for <b>matrix</b> <b>porosity</b> < 50 %. Using this model, prediction of the processing necessary for the fabrication of liquid precursor derived A-CMNC architectures, with possible application to other nanowire/nanofiber systems, is enabled for a variety of high value applications.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effect of hyper-alkaline (NaOH/KOH) {{leachate}} on the mineralogy and porosity of a generic quartzo-feldspathic host rock for intermediate- and low-level nuclear waste disposal following permeation of the cementitious repository barrier by groundwater. The analysis is made with reference to expected fluid compositions that may develop by contact of groundwater with the cementitious barrier to form a chemically disturbed zone (CDZ) in the adjacent host rock, as informed by relevant natural analogue sites. Theoretical analysis and numerical modelling is used to {{explore the influence of}} different host rock mineral assemblages on changes in pore fluid chemistry, multiple mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions and <b>matrix</b> <b>porosity</b> within the CDZ under these conditions. The numerical modelling accounts for kinetic and surface area effects on the mineral transformation and porosity development for periods of up to 10, 000 years travel time from the repository and ambient temperature of 20 ∘C. The analysis shows that dissolution of quartz, feldspar and muscovite in the host rock, by the hyper-alkaline waste leachate, will create relatively high concentrations of dissolved Si and Al in the pore fluid, which migrates as chemical fronts within the CDZ. Precipitation of secondary mineral phases is predicted to occur under these conditions. The increase in <b>matrix</b> <b>porosity</b> that arises from dissolution of primary aluminosilicate minerals is compensated by a reduction in porosity due to precipitation of the secondary phases, but with a net overall increase in <b>matrix</b> <b>porosity.</b> These coupled physical and geochemical processes are most important for contaminant transport in the near-field zone of the CDZ and are eventually buffered by the host rock within 70  m of the repository for the 10, 000 year travel time scenario.

This {{is the first}} comprehensive, large-scale study, {{of the influence of}} an offshore reef system on wave climate and wave transmission. The focus was on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, utilizing a 16 -yr record of wave height from seven satellite altimeters. Within the GBR matrix, the wave climate is not strongly dependent on reef matrix submergence. This suggests that after initial wave breaking at the seaward edge of the reef matrix, wave energy that penetrates the matrix has little depth modulation. There is no clear evidence to suggest that as reef <b>matrix</b> <b>porosity</b> (ratio of spaces between individual reefs to reef area) decreases, wave attenuation increases. This is because individual reefs cast a wave shadow much larger than the reef itself; thus, a matrix of isolated reefs is remarkably effective at attenuating wave energy. This weak dependence of transmitted wave energy on depth of reef submergence, and reef <b>matrix</b> <b>porosity,</b> is also evident in the lee of the GBR matrix.

40|$|Determining {{fracture}} characteristics at {{the laboratory}} scale {{is a major}} challenge. It is known that fracture characteristics are scale dependent; as such, the minimum sample size should be deduced in order to scale to reservoir dimensions. The main factor affecting mechanical and hydrological characteristics of natural fractures is aperture distribution, which {{is a function of}} scale and confining pressure, rather than roughness of one fracture surface. Scale and pressure dependencies of artificial and natural fractures were investigated in this study using an X-Ray CT Scanner. Fractal dimension, D, and amplitude parameter, A, of fracture aperture approaches a constant value with increased sampling area, similar to the behavior of fracture roughness. In addition, both parameters differ under different confining pressures for a reference sampling area. Mechanical properties of fracture-fracture deformation behavior and fracture normal stiffness were obtained from CT scan data as well. <b>Matrix</b> <b>porosity</b> is relatively easy to measure and estimate compared to fracture porosity. On the other hand, fracture porosity is highly heterogeneous and very difficult to measure and estimate. When <b>matrix</b> <b>porosity</b> of naturally fractured reservoirs (NFR) is negligible, {{it is very important to}} know fracture porosity to evaluate reservoir performance. Since fracture porosity is highly uncertain, fractal discrete fractal network (FDFN) generation codes were developed to estimate fracture porosity. To reflect scale dependent characteristics of fracture networks, fractal theories are adopted. FDFN modeling technique enables the systematic use of data obtained from image log and core analysis for estimating fracture porosity. As a result, each fracture has its own fracture aperture distribution, so that generated FDFN are similar to actual fracture systems.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{fractures}} affect the permeability and porosity of the reservoir directly (Stober and Bucher 2014), while the matrix is acting {{more or less}} as a storage. Thus, fractures are preferable pathways for fluids when critical stresses are observed and dilatancy or shear displacement take place (Barton et al. 1995). The permeameter measurements (4.0  *  10 − 17 m 2 and 3.0  *  10 − 17 m 2, respectively) are in good accordance with the relatively small values derived by core samples of the Buntsandstein (Stober and Bucher 2014). As described before, the permeability {{is a combination of}} matrix and fractures. Stober and Bucher (2014) reported an averaged formation permeability of 5  *  10 − 15 m 2. Analogs of the eastern border of the URG show comparable <b>matrix</b> <b>porosities</b> between 3 and 8 % (Bauer et al. 2017). On the other hand, alteration, like remineralization and precipitation of new minerals along fractures, can decrease the fracture permeability (Stober and Bucher 2014; Schmidt et al. 2017). Therefore, the chances of successful upscaling results from analog studies to reservoir conditions are higher for formations with less complex internal structures like sedimentary basins, where porous media flow is the dominant process for transporting energy.|$|R
