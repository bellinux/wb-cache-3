40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{advantages of}} diatomaceous earth (DE), its use for direct <b>mixing</b> with <b>grains</b> to control stored-product insects remains limited {{because of some}} very serious obstacles and disadvantages.

40|$|Studying on {{the effect}} of beta phase on the growth of recrystallized grain in 65 / 35 brass sheets, {{following}} results were obtaind. b When the 65 / 35 brass sheet with the residual beta was annealed, the grain growth rate of alpha phase was larger in comparison with the sample of the only alpha phase. But it seemed that the grain growth of alpha phase was suppressed to laminated beta. The residual beta particle was dissolved in alpha phase by annealing for a long time. As a result the <b>mixed</b> <b>grains</b> were formed around the beta phase. The fine <b>grains</b> within <b>mixed</b> <b>grains</b> were absorbed into the coarse grains. And it is observable that the recrystallized grain size was larger on the sample with the beta after the beta phase had dissolved into the alpha phase. Moreover the grain growth was made more easily on the thin sheet. 結晶粒成長過程の現象はすでに多くの研究者により明らかにされている。しかし，その結果は必ずしも一致せず，説明不十分な面も多いことが認めらている。彼等の多くは結晶粒成長に対する初期の成長力は結晶粒界の界面エネルギーの差に左右されるものと指摘している。また，P.
