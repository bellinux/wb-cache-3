As the ship heads to the rendezvous, they save two Ferengi from a failing ship. Despite security being assigned, the Ferengi enter the cargo bay and deactivate the stasis field on Briam's cargo, revealing a young Kriosian woman named Kamala (Famke Janssen). With the Ferengi secured, it is revealed that she is an empathic <b>metamorph</b> who can sense what males around her desire and react appropriately. She was being brought as an arranged marriage to the Valtian representative.

5|$|Meat ants {{are among}} the very few native species of Australia that are not harmed by the toxins of the cane toad, an {{invasive}} species. Most of the time, foraging workers target <b>metamorph</b> toads. Observations show that workers would forage around ponds and seize any toadlet. This normally starts with a single worker making contact with an individual and tracing its movements, followed by three or four workers capturing it. All the participating ants would grab a limb and sever the legs, returning the prey item back to their nest. Most of the time these tactics do not work. For example, most toadlets are able to escape the ants by displaying aversion-like behaviour; an individual may escape by struggling erratically or forcing the ants to release their grip by returning to the water. This aversion behaviour leads to most toadlets remaining in the water or staying on objects such as water lilies, pieces of bark that the ants cannot access, or moving around on moist substrates. It is unknown if meat ant predation on the toadlets affected the population, but based on the population density of the toadlets within the studied site and the foraging time and efficiency, approximately 2,700 toadlets could be removed per day. As the toadlet population density is extremely high, the impact of meat ant predation is minor. However, the survivability of the toadlets may be affected if the ants prevent the toadlets from foraging into many areas of moist substrate.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Metamorphs</b> {{model is}} a robust {{segmentation}} method which integrates both shape and appearance in a unified space. The standard <b>Metamorphs</b> model does not encode temporal information. Thus it is not effective in segmenting time series data, such as a cardiac cycle from MRI. Furthermore, it needs manual interaction to initialize the model, which is time consuming for temporal data. In this paper, we proposed a model to seamlessly couple both spatial and temporal information together in the <b>Metamorphs</b> method. It is also able to automatically initialize the model instead of manual initialization. We model energy terms as probability maps, then different energy terms can be easily fused by multiplying them together. Temporal Spectral Residual (TSR) is employed to rapidly generate a probability map in temporal data. Compared to traditional <b>Metamorphs,</b> the computational overhead of our model is very light due to {{the efficiency of the}} TSR method and the ease of coupling different energy functions by using probability maps.

40|$|Tetrapod limbs are {{serially}} homologous {{structures that}} represent a particularly interesting model {{for studies on}} morphological integration, i. e. the tendency of developmental systems to produce correlated variation. In newts, limbs develop at an early larval stage and grow continuously, including after the habitat transition from water to land following metamorphosis. However, aquatic and terrestrial environments impose different constraints and locomotor modes that could affect patterns of morphological integration and evolvability. We hypothesize {{that this would be}} the case for alternative heterochronic morphs in newts, i. e. aquatic paedomorphs that keep gills at the adult stage and adult <b>metamorphs</b> that are able to disperse on land. To this end, we analysed patterns and strengths of correlations between homologous skeletal elements of the fore- and hindlimbs as well as among skeletal elements within limbs in both phenotypes in the alpine newt, Ichthyosaura alpestris. Our results showed that <b>metamorphs</b> and paedomorphs had similar, general patterns of limb integration. Partial correlations between homologous limb elements and within limb elements were higher in paedomorphs when compared to <b>metamorphs.</b> Decrease in partial correlation between homologous limb elements in <b>metamorphs</b> is accompanied with a higher evolvability of the terrestrial morph. All these results indicate that environmental demands shaped the patterns of morphological integration of alpine newt limbs and that the observed diversity in correlation structure could be related to a qualitative difference in the modes of locomotion between the morphs.

40|$|Agriculture is {{considered}} an important factor for the decline of amphibians recorded in the last decades. Intensive agriculture requires the application of great amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, consequently many aquatic habitats have been altered. The over-enrichment of waters with nutrients from agriculture causes growth of algae and cyanobacteria and the shift of the community composition toward the dominance of tolerant taxa. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the diet of tadpoles and the size of larvae and <b>metamorphs</b> of the native species Rhinella arenarum in agroecosystems of central Argentina. Four sampling sites with different degree of human disturbance were selected, three temporary ponds from agroecosystems (A 1, A 2, A 3), and a pond in a semi-modified landscape, not affected by agriculture or cattle. The sites were visited once a week from October 2013 to January 2014. Tadpoles and <b>metamorphs</b> were captured, anesthetize and preserved. Morphometric parameters were measured on tadpoles and <b>metamorphs</b> and for 20 tadpoles the complete intestine was removed and their contents analyzed. Phosphate values were higher in agroecosystem ponds. Body size and mass of tadpoles and <b>metamorphs</b> were different between sites, being smaller in agricultural ponds. Diet analysis revealed that all larvae mainly consumed microalgae. Larval diets allowed differentiating the sites, larvae from A 1 and A 3 sites showed a diet with a similar composition and structure (with a predominance of Nitzschia palea), meanwhile larvae from A 2 and SM showed different diets. In SM, the larvae mainly consumed Trachelomonas sp. Analysis of structural variables revealed a higher algal abundance in the diet of larvae from A 3, a lower richness in SM and that there were no differences between sites in diversity and evenness of diets. Our hypothesis was support in part, given that resistant algae taxa were found in agroecosystem ponds and tadpoles and <b>metamorphs</b> were smaller, but larval diets showed higher abundance and richness. The analysis of the diet of aquatic stages of R. arenarum allowed us to know the trophic availability and environmental quality of temporary ponds from agroecosystems.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Polymorphisms are {{suspected}} to reduce competition among conspecifics in heterogeneous environments by allowing differential resource use. However, the adaptive significance of alternative morphs has been poorly documented. The {{aim of this}} study was to test this hypothesis by comparing diets of syntopic heterochronic morphs (paedomorphs and <b>metamorphs)</b> in the Alpine newt, Triturus alpestris in three European alpine lakes. Feeding performance was also tested in the laboratory. The two morphs differ in the functional morphology of their feeding apparatus. Only paedomorphs are able to expel water behind the mouth during prey suction through gill slits. We observed a substantial trophic differentiation between morphs consistently in all lakes. Paedomorphs primarily preyed on plankton whereas <b>metamorphs</b> foraged on terrestrial invertebrates that fell to the water surface. Laboratory observations were consistent with field patterns. In paedomorphs, prey capture success rate was better than in <b>metamorphs</b> when foraging on aquatic crustaceans, but was less successful when foraging on terrestrial invertebrates caught at the water surface. By reducing competition, resource partitioning contributes to the coexistence of the alternative morphs in lakes devoid of vertebrate competitors and predators.
