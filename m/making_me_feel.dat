Utada's vocal range spans between the notes G3 to G5, specifically between the chorus lyrics; [...] "When you walk away / You don't hear me say / Please oh baby don't go / Simple and clean {{is the way that}} you're <b>making</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> tonight / It's hard to let it go".|$|E
500|$|Despite Booth's views {{being more}} genteel {{than that of}} most of his teammates, there was minimal {{friction}} or disconnect. Early in his state career, Booth declined to join a Melbourne Cup gambling sweep organised by captain Keith Miller. However, Miller included Booth in the event by assigning him {{to look after the}} money. Booth said [...] "That was typical of Keith. That he was able to turn something that might have been a problem into something positive, giving me a responsibility, <b>making</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> part of the team." [...] He added [...] "The boys just accepted me for what I was. If they didn't share the strength of my convictions, they were quite happy for me to hold them." [...] Simpson said that Booth never attempted to impose his worldview on his teammates and never gave any inkling that he disapproved of their behaviour.|$|E
500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and <b>making</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 12, 2015, a Facebook post by {{the student}} {{government}} president Payton Head described bigotry and anti-gay sentiment around the college campus, which gained widespread attention. He claimed that in an incident off campus, unidentified people {{in the back of}} a passing pickup truck directed racial slurs at him. [...] "For those of you who wonder why I'm always talking about the importance of inclusion and respect, it's because I've experienced moments like this multiple times at THIS university, <b>making</b> <b>me</b> not <b>feel</b> included here." [...] Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin called the incident [...] "totally unacceptable" [...] on September 17.|$|R

500|$|Strip Me {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 60, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews", based on 4 reviews. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave Strip Me a C rating and wrote that it [...] "plays like one long, increasingly desperate pep talk. The only breather? 'Unexpected Hero,' a lovely late-Beatles-style ballad." [...] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted the album for [...] "retaining [...] same blend of well-manicured R and European sophistication" [...] of Bedingfield's debut album and commented that she [...] "plays it exceptionally safe, {{to the extent}} that she even tones down the self-empowerment of her first two records, preferring pristine blue-eyed soul and adult contemporary ballads, all tailored for an aspirational upscale lifestyle". Slant magazine's Jonathon Keefe found it [...] "single-minded in its uplifting, inspirational tone", writing in conclusion that [...] "Bedingfield uses her powerful voice to oversing most of her material, <b>making</b> Strip <b>Me</b> <b>feel</b> like even more of a sermon. It may not be the year's worst pop album, but it might just be the most exhausting and heavy-handed." ...|$|R
500|$|Leon Hurley, {{writing for}} GamesRadar, {{was of the}} opinion that, while the [...] "gore and guts" [...] were {{sparingly}} effective, {{a number of his}} most favorite moments had to do with investigating the [...] "beautifully designed" [...] Baker house. As for the VR, it was dubbed as a terrifying experience [...] "where the mildewy atmosphere gets into your soul". Giant Bombs Dan Ryckert referred to Resident Evil 7 as the reinvigoration of earlier components in the series {{while at the same time}} yielding a fresh outlook with a yet-unrivaled story. The main antagonists bore substantial weight to Ryckert's cause for worry, and gave way to thrills when prompted to flee them. He viewed the first-person perspective as [...] "bold", and attributed to the PlayStation VR, an earnest addition to the [...] "scare factor". Chloi Rad of IGN endorsed the pervading tone of eeriness in the game, owed entirely to the plantation, which she thought was [...] "one of the creepiest single settings since the Spencer Mansion". Also, she observed that the game world gave off a robust sense of place with unwavering exploration. To her, the Baker family were the most compelling of the characters because of the consequent emotional strain felt in their presence. Andy Kelly at PC Gamer began his review, writing, [...] "It's a return to the atmospheric, slow-burning horror of the original". He disagreed with Ryckert's assessment that the first-person was a bold reinvention, instead praising it for being [...] "classic Resident Evil through and through". Kelly saw the regular state of vulnerability he was faced within the game as one of its greatest strengths, giving credit to the visuals and audio for adding to the [...] "rumbling sense of dread". He considered flashbacks via VHS tapes to be one of his favorite features. Polygons Philip Kollar applauded Resident Evil 7s return to form, declaring that [...] "no Resident Evil game since the first has done as good a job as RE7 at <b>making</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> scared and helpless".|$|E

You look terrible today.' It never seemed to get any better, and I felt worse and worse," [...] she writes. Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with my cheek pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As I lay there, God touched my heart. He revealed to me that all my destructive efforts to shrink my body were not <b>making</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Arthur {{became one}} of EastEnders best loved characters, and his {{reputation}} as an eternal loser endeared him to viewers. In 1995 audiences were shocked and horrified when Arthur was framed for the embezzlement of the Flowering Wilderness Campaign funds and wrongfully imprisoned. There was a public outcry and a nationwide Free Arthur Fowler campaign was launched. 'Arthur Fowler Is Innocent' T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the UK singles chart promoting the campaign. [...] Eventually the truth came out and Arthur was released. However, a gash to the head he had sustained in prison led to a brain haemorrhage and Arthur died suddenly in 1996 shortly after his release. Off-screen Bill Treacher had asked to be written out of the series after eleven years playing Arthur, saying: [...] "By the time I finished, even {{the sound of the}} theme music was <b>making</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> ill. I felt depressed." [...] Although it was his decision to leave the soap, Treacher was shocked that the show’s bosses chose to kill Arthur off. He has said: [...] "I certainly didn’t ask them to kill him. Oh no, because you never know, you might need to come back and earn a few grand." [...] Treacher also stated in a 2003 interview that he was forced to resign from the show in the end due to the negative effect it was having on his health.|$|E
