Plasma arc cutting (PAC) is a widely used process for the cutting of different types of metals in several operating conditions. PAC is considered a challenging technology compared to its main competitors: oxy-fuel and laser cutting. Today, because of advances in equipment design and improvement in cut quality, previously unheard of applications, such as <b>multiple</b> <b>torch</b> <b>cutting</b> of mild steel, are becoming common place. The aim of the work is the optimization of PAC of mild steel thin plates, both in terms of cut quality and performances of the consumables, to achieve cut quality standards and productivity levels usually obtainable through laser cutting processes. The temperature of the plasma arc melts the metal and pierces through the work piece while the high velocity gas flow removes the molten material {{from the bottom of the}} cut. PAC of mild steel thin plates of 10 mm through a KALI- 100 Plasma Arc Cutting Machine is operating in the range 25 - 120 A. The air is used as plasma gas as well as secondary gas...|$|E

50|$|The {{cofferdam}} is {{also used}} on occasion in the shipbuilding and ship repair industry, {{when it is not}} practical to put a ship in drydock for repair or alteration. An example of such an application is certain ship lengthening operations. In some cases a ship is actually cut in two while still in the water, and a new section of ship is floated in to lengthen the ship. <b>Torch</b> <b>cutting</b> of the hull is done inside a cofferdam attached directly to the hull of the ship; the cofferdam is then detached before the hull sections are floated apart. The cofferdam is later replaced while the hull sections are welded together again. As expensive as this may be to accomplish, use of a drydock may be even more expensive. See also caisson.|$|R

In order to support the development of technical solutions and new regulatory norms, there is an urgent need for quantitative data explaining the impacts of {{ship recycling}} practices on health and safety. Therefore, this study investigated hazardous noise exposure in ship recycling yards by identifying the sources of noise, quantifying their potential impacts on workers and making recommendations for improvement. A noise exposure investigation in an operational ship recycling yard was conducted, which comprised a general noise survey, a personal noise exposure measurement for workers and comparison of the results with the exposure limits and action values defined by the European Union's Physical Agents (Noise) Directive (EC 2003 b). The results of this study show that ship recycling workers are at risk of experiencing occupational noise induced hearing loss as a result of being exposed to hazardous noise levels for prolonged periods of time. This study explains that those working with <b>torch</b> <b>cutting</b> equipment, in particular, are most at risk.

40|$|Abstract—Cutting {{of metal}} {{structures}} {{is a regular}} need in decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of contaminated Department of Energy facilities. Plasma <b>torch</b> <b>cutting</b> is efficient, {{but there are many}} cases and situations where it is not appropriate. Sometimes the fire hazard cannot be tolerated; sometimes it is more of a contaminant dispersal issue. Circular saws, band saws, and reciprocating saws are often the necessary tool of choice. Sawing is a complex action that is difficult to execute with remote manipulation without extensive task-specific fixturing of the tool to minimize blade chatter and binding. Extensive fixturing leads to the requirement for multiple tools for each minor variation of the task. This drives up the cost of remote tooling for a given D&D large-scale task, generates clutter and tool storage issues, impacts tool reliability due to complexity, and increases the required spare parts. This paper presents an investigation of the saw tool chatter issues, ways to detect chatter for the control system, and compensation methods that lead to a new approach to tooling use with remote manipulation–smart tooling. I. BACKGROUND It is typically difficult to saw with servomanipulators without extensive fixturing. The saw blade must remain orthogonal to the work piece cut in at least two axes, and the feed rate must be appropriate for the material and th...|$|R
50|$|For cutting {{irregular}} openings or non-uniform ends on dimensional (non-plate) elements, a <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> {{is typically}} used. Oxy-fuel torches {{are the most}} common technology and range from simple hand-held torches to automated CNC coping machines that move the torch head around the structural element in accordance with cutting instructions programmed into the machine.|$|R
50|$|After {{the members}} to be {{demolished}} are removed by crane {{they must be}} fragmented into pieces small enough to decontaminate. It is expected that the primary contamination of most demolished elements will be loose surface contamination (mostly dust) and can largely be removed. Decontamination will take place using vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters, grit blasting (for steel elements), and scarifying (for concrete elements). Once decontaminated to the maximum extent practical, pieces will be further fragmented for eventual disposal. Fragmentation tools include plasma arc <b>cutting</b> <b>torches,</b> diamond circular <b>cutting</b> wheels, and diamond wire cutting. The tools selected for the demolition process were selected upon {{the basis of a}} number of factors, including minimization of individual and collective radiation exposure, the amount of secondary waste generated, the feasibility of remote operation, the cutting efficiency, fire safety, capital cost and operating costs.|$|R

40|$|Many {{manufacturers}} who cut metal use {{plasma arc}} cutting {{as part of}} their manufacturing process. Plasma cutters use electricity and pressurized gas to produce a temperature of up to 50, 000 ºF at the cutting tip. These plasma cutters can rapidly cut through metals as much as 12 inches thick. The use of computer numerical controlled (CNC) plasma cutters allow manufacturers to rapidly cut even very intricate and detailed flat parts. This process is a tremendous improvement over traditional <b>torch</b> <b>cutting,</b> saw cutting, or other machining processes for producing near net shapes. It is faster and less expensive than most of the alternative processes available. There are several processing and quality factors that must be addressed when using a plasma cutter. The most common problem with plasma cutting is the formation of dross (resolidified metal) on the cut edge. The formation of dross on plasma-cut parts creates several problems in the manufacturing process. By carefully controlling the operating parameters, the formation of dross on the work piece can be minimized, which greatly increases the quality of the part and the efficiency of the production process. Efficient operation of a CNC plasma cutter to minimize the formation of dross requires controlling several variables in the process. These variables include: material type and thickness, arc current (amperage), cutting speed, cutting-gas pressure, cutting tip size, and the gap between the cutting tip and the work piece. Experience with plasma arc cutting and research on the subject reveals that the variables that most affect the formation of dross are arc current, cutting speed, material thickness, and nozzle size. A study involving these four variables will be performed to determine the optimum setup for the CNC plasma cutter to minimize the formation of dross. Michael E.

50|$|Ndocciata is {{an ancient}} Christmas festival celebrated in Molise, {{southern}} Italy, specifically {{in the city of}} Agnone. On the evening of December 24 the “Ndocciata” of Agnone is a parade of a great number of “‘ndocce” (torches), structures with a typical fanwise shape, made of silver fir pinewood pallets. They may be only one torch or, more often, with <b>multiple</b> <b>torches</b> up to twenty fires. Four metres high, “‘ndocce” are transported by different carriers dressed in traditional costumes. The big bell of St. Anthony’s Church is rung, and groups from the cities’ districts (Capammonde and Capabballe, Colle Sente, Guastra, Onofrio, San Quirico) consisting of hundreds of carriers of all ages, light their ndocce (torches) to set off along the main streets which thus becomes what locals call a “river of fire.” There is a choral participation and bagpipers along the roads of the village, and groups compete in order to have the biggest and the most beautiful “‘ndocce”. The procession ends with a bonfire called “Bonfire of Brotherhood” at Plebiscite Square where a Nativity scene is displayed.|$|R
