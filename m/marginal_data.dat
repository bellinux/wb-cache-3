A cumulative model (McCullagh, 1980) is applied where {{the main effects}} and covariate effects are allowed to vary with time. The longitudinal interaction among the variables is modeled by cumulative log odds ratios.

Previous work ([3]) {{has shown}} that the kernel nonparametric regression methods extant in the literature for such correlated data have the discouraging property that they generally do not improve upon methods that ignore the correlation structure entirely. The latter methods are called working independence methods. We construct a twostage kernel-based estimator that asymptotically uniformly improves upon the working independence estimator. A small simulation study is given in support of the asymptotics...|$|R

It is found that a suitable model is that <b>marginal</b> <b>data</b> are Normal Inverse Gaussian distributed and copula is a better dependence measure than the usual linear correlation together with Gaussian marginals. ...|$|E

A marginal model with cumulative logit link (McCullagh 1980) {{is applied to}} cope for the ordinal scale and the main and covariate effects in the model are allowed to vary with time. Local fitting is pursued and asymptotic properties of the estimates are discussed. A data example demonstrates the exploratory flavor of the smooth model. In a second step, the longitudinal dependence of the observations is considered. Cumulative log odds ratios are fitted locally which provides insight how the dependence of the ordinal observations changes with time.

Such a condition requires that some parameter blocks can be analytically integrated out from the conditional posterior densities. Our estimators are applicable to densely parameterized time series models such as VARs or DFMs. An empirical application to six-variate VAR models shows that the bias of a fully computational estimator is sufficiently large to distort the implied model rankings. One estimator is fast enough to make multiple computations of MDDs in densely parameterized models feasible.
