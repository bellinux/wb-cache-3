5000|$|On 23 April 1984, Kittiwake {{collided}} with the attack submarine [...] at Norfolk, Virginia, while Bergall was moored to the pier astern of her. Kittiwake was getting underway {{for the first time}} since she had undergone maintenance, during which her <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> was re-wired improperly, causing it and the screw it drove to rotate in the opposite direction from that ordered by personnel on Kittiwakes bridge. This was unknown to Kittiwakes bridge personnel, who found that Kittiwake started to move astern when they were expecting her to move forward. Noting the backward motion, they ordered an increase in the <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> speed in order to correct it and get Kittiwake moving forward, but unwittingly caused Kittiwake to move further astern and at a higher speed. Still not realizing that Kittiwakes <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> was operating in reverse of what they expected, Kittiwakes bridge personnel then ordered another increase in Kittiwakes forward speed, which only served to increase her speed astern. This continued until Kittiwakes stern backed into Bergalls sonar dome.|$|R

40|$|The {{spinning}} rocket simulator (SRS) is {{an ongoing}} project at Oral Roberts University. The goal of the SRS is to gather crucial data concerning a spinning rocket under thrust {{for the purpose of}} analysis and correction of the coning motion experienced by this type of spacecraft maneuver. The computer animation simulates a virtual, scale model of the component of the SRS that represents the spacecraft itself. This component is known as the (VSM), or virtual spacecraft model. During actual physical simulation, this component of the SRS will experience a coning. The goal of the animation is to cone the VSM within that range to accurately represent the motion of the actual simulator. The drive system of the SRS is the apparatus that turns the actual simulator. It consists of a <b>drive</b> <b>motor,</b> motor mount and chain to power the simulator into motion.
