In {{order to}} directly quantify {{the rate of}} change of the subband temporal envelopes and possible cross-frequency interactions, modulation frequency bins are further grouped into four bands empirically designed to coincide with the range of the first four conventional frequency bands (i.e., delta-beta). This choice was driven by the fact that, by definition of the Hilbert transform, the envelope signal can only contain frequencies (i.e., modulation frequencies) up to the maximum frequency of its originating signal (i.e., following the so-called Bedrosian’s theorem [46, 47]). As such, gamma-level modulation frequencies would only be present in the gamma frequency band. Hence, to reduce data dimensionality, the so-called gamma <b>modulation</b> <b>band</b> is not considered here.|$|E

The limited modulation transfer function can be combined with the converted phase modulation transfer function. Investigation of optical filter with optimal slope is a crucial challenge in this approach.

30|$|Substantial {{previous}} research has investigated the possibility to combat additive noise by fusing the outputs {{of a number of}} parallel recognizers, each operating on a separate frequency band (cf., [32] for a comprehensive review). The general idea underlying this approach is that additive noise will only affect some frequency bands so that other bands should suffer less. The same idea has also been proposed for different modulation bands [33]. In this paper we also explore the possibility that additive noise does not affect all modulation bands to the same extent. Therefore, we will compare recognition accuracies obtained when estimating state likelihoods using a single set of exemplars represented by 135 -D feature vectors and the fusion of the state likelihoods estimated from the 135 -D system and nine sets of exemplars (one for each <b>modulation</b> <b>band)</b> represented as 15 -D feature vectors (for the 15 gammatone filters). The optimal weights for the nine sets of estimates will be obtained using a genetic algorithm with a small set of held-out training utterances. Also, combining state posterior probability estimates from ten decoders might help to make the resulting probability vectors less sparse.|$|E

40|$|Reverberation time (RT) is an {{important}} parameter for room acoustics characterization, intelligibility and quality assessment of reverberant speech, and for dereverberation. Commonly, RT is estimated from the room impulse response (RIR). In practice, however, RIRs are often unavailable or continuously changing. As such, blind estimation of RT based only on the recorded reverberant signals is of great interest. To date, blind RT estimation has focused on reverberant speech signals. Here, we propose to blindly estimate RT from non-speech signals, such as solo instrument recordings and music ensembles. To estimate the RT of non-speech signals, we propose a blind estimator based on an auditory-inspired modulation spectrum signal representation, which measures the modulation frequency of temporal envelopes computed from a 23 -channel gammatone filterbank. We show that the higher <b>modulation</b> frequency <b>bands</b> are more sensitive to reverberation than the <b>modulation</b> <b>bands</b> below 20 Hz. When tested on a database of non-speech sounds under 23 different reverberation conditions with reverberation time (T 40) ranging from 0. 18 to 15. 62 s, a blind estimator based on the ratio of high-to-low modulation frequencies outperformed two state-of-the-art methods and achieved correlations with EDT as high as 0. 92 for solo instruments and 0. 87 for ensembles...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a low-power speech detector chip. It will be used between an electret microphone and a microcontroller and will generate a digital wake-up signal for the microcontroller when the audio signal is sufficiently “speechlike” to initiate higher-level processing of the amplified audio signal. The rest of the time, the microcontroller will sleep and consume nearly negligible power. The system is implemented using mostly low-power analog continuous-time subthreshold circuits. The speech detection method is based on a model simplified from Büchler. It detects speech by measuring the total modulation spectrum power in the 2 – 16 Hz phoneme <b>modulation</b> <b>band.</b> It uses Baker and Sarpeshkar’s low-power high-PSRR microphone preamplifier to amplify the microphone signal in the 100 Hz to 2 kHz speech band.

30|$|In Sys 1, Sys 2, and Sys 3, we {{capitalize}} {{on the assumption that}} the sparse classification procedure can harness the differences between speech and noise in the modulation spectra without being given any specific information. In [32] it was shown that it is beneficial to ‘help’ a speech recognition system in handling additive noise by fusing the results of independent recognition operations on non-overlapping parts of the spectrum. The success of the multi-band approach is founded in the finding that additive noise does not affect all parts of the spectrum equally severely. Recognition on sub-bands can profit from superior results in sub-bands that are only marginally affected by the noise. Using modulation spectrum features, we aim to exploit the different temporal characteristics of speech and noise, which are expected to have different effects in different modulation bands. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to investigate whether combining the output of nine independent recognizers, each operating on a different modulation frequency band, will improve recognition accuracy. In each modulation frequency band, we have the output of all 15 gammatone filters; therefore, each <b>modulation</b> <b>band</b> ‘hears’ the full 4 -kHz spectrum. The experiment was conducted using the part of test set A that is corrupted by subway noise.|$|E

Therefore, we conducted speech recognition experiments using the MWT which covers the modulation frequency between 1 and 12 Hz by choosing the center frequencies of 2. 5, 5. 0, and 7. 5 Hz.

30|$|Although the {{modulation}} spectrum features capture short- and medium-time spectral dynamics, {{the information is}} encoded {{in a manner that}} might not be optimal for automatic pattern recognition purposes. Therefore, we decided to also create a feature set that encodes the temporal dynamics more explicitly. To that end we concatenated 29 frames (at a rate of one frame per 2.5 ms), corresponding to 29 × 2.5 = 72.5 ms; to keep the number of features within reasonable limits, we performed dimensionality reduction by means of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), with the 179 state labels as categories. The reference category was the state label of the middle frame of a 29 -frame sequence. The LDA transformation matrix was learned using the exemplar dictionary (cf., section 2). The dimension of the feature vectors was reduced the 135, the same number as with single-frame features. To be able to investigate the effect of the LDA transform, we also applied an LDA transform to the original single-frame features. Here, the dimension of the transformed feature vector was limited to 135 (nine <b>modulation</b> <b>bands</b> in 15 gammatone filters).|$|R

30|$|The {{experiments}} with the MLP classifiers for obtaining state posterior probabilities from the modulation spectrum features {{confirm that the}} modulation spectrum features capture {{most of the information}} that is relevant for speech decoding. Still, the WERs obtained with the MLPs were always inferior to the results obtained with stacks of nine conventional PLP features that include Δ and Δ Δ features, especially in the cleanest SNR conditions. Although the modulation spectrum features are performing quite well in noisy conditions, in cleaner conditions their performance is worse than the classical PLP features. Adding Δ s and Δ Δ s, computed as linear regressions over 90 ms windows, to the modulation spectrum features does not improve performance nearly as much as adding speed and acceleration to MFCC or PLP features. This suggests that our modulation spectrum features are suboptimal with respect to describing the medium-term dynamics of the speech signal. The time windows associated with the modulation frequency filters with the lowest centre frequencies is larger than 500 ms. As a consequence, time derivatives computed over a window of 90 ms for these slowly varying filter outputs is not likely to carry much additional information. We suspect that the features in the lowest <b>modulation</b> <b>bands</b> play too heavy a role. If we want to optimally exploit the redundancy in the different modulation frequency channels when part of them gets obscured by noise, information about relevant speech events (such as word or syllable onsets and offsets) should ideally be represented equally well by their temporal dynamics in all channels.|$|R
