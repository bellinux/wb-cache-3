40|$|Membrane {{reactors}} offer {{a promising}} configuration for enzymatic delignification processes (lignin <b>modification,</b> <b>removal</b> and utilization). However, membrane fouling reduces {{the efficiency of}} filtration and of the entire bioprocess. The flux and retention characteristics of protein-ligninsulfonate model mixtures were investigated. A 5 -kDa tubular ceramic membrane achieved a sufficient and constant ligninsulphonate retention of 80 â 90 %. The retention of phenolic monomers (e. g. guaiacol) increased with the ligninsulphonate concentration. Mass transfer-controlled regions were observed in which permeate fluxes could be predicted by the limiting flux model. Finally, the underlying fouling mechanisms were evaluated, revealing a predominance of complete pore blocking and cake filtration...|$|E
40|$|Ribosomes {{are highly}} conserved {{ribonucleoprotein}} nanomachines that translate {{information in the}} genome to create the proteome in all cells. In yeast these complex particles contain four RNAs (3 ̆e 5400 nucleotides) and 79 different proteins. During the past 25 years, studies in yeast have {{led the way to}} understanding how these molecules are assembled into ribosomes in vivo. Assembly begins with transcription of ribosomal RNA in the nucleolus, where the RNA then undergoes complex pathways of folding, coupled with nucleotide <b>modification,</b> <b>removal</b> of spacer sequences, and binding to ribosomal proteins. More than 200 assembly factors and 76 small nucleolar RNAs transiently associate with assembling ribosomes, to enable their accurate and efficient construction. Following export of preribosomes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, they undergo final stages of maturation before entering the pool of functioning ribosomes. Elaborate mechanisms exist to monitor the formation of correct structural and functional neighborhoods within ribosomes and to destroy preribosomes that fail to assemble properly. Studies of yeast ribosome biogenesis provide useful models for ribosomopathies, diseases in humans that result from failure to properly assemble ribosomes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractN-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) {{modification}} on serine or threonine residues of cytoplasmic {{and nuclear}} proteins {{has become a}} more recognized intracellular covalent <b>modification.</b> <b>Removal</b> of this modification is carried out by N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase). Since little information exists on monoglycosylation and O-GlcNAcase activity in mitogenic systems, we investigated O-GlcNAcase activity in primary breast tumors compared to matched normal adjacent breast tissue and examined enzymatic activity {{in relationship to the}} level of protein monoglycosylation. Using a variation of the acidic hexosaminidase activity assay, we demonstrated an increase in both O-GlcNAcase and lysosomal hexosaminidase activity in breast tumor tissue compared to matched adjacent tissue. Although no clear correlation with tumor grade or type was apparent among the samples examined (12 matched pairs), the increase in O-GlcNAcase and lysosomal hexosaminidase activity in tumor tissue was consistently elevated and statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Protein monoglycosylation was evaluated using immunoblotting, affinity blotting, and radioactive labeling. While the variety of modified proteins was greater in tumor tissue compared to adjacent tissue, the total amount of O-GlcNAc monoglycosylation was significantly decreased in the tumor tissue especially on proteins in the molecular mass range of 45 – 65 kDa. O-GlcNAcase may be involved in the selective removal of O-GlcNAc on certain proteins in breast tumor tissue...|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} epigenetics is gaining {{popularity}} and speed, {{due in part}} to its capability to answer lingering questions about the root cause of certain diseases. Epigenetics plays a crucial role in regulation of the cell and cell survival, particularly by cytosine methylation. It remains controversial if DNMT’s which facilitate methylation are present in mammalian mitochondria and what the functional significance they may have on modification of mitochondrial DNA. CRISPR-Cas 9 technology enabled genome editing to remove the MTS (mitochondrial targeting sequence) from DNMT 1 of HCT 116 cells, purposefully minimizing effects on nuclear cytosine methylation, while exclusively impacting mitochondrial <b>modification.</b> <b>Removal</b> of the DNMT 1 MTS did not completely prevent the localization of this enzyme to the mitochondria according to immunoblot analysis. As well, deletion of the MTS in DNMT 1 revealed only a small decline in transcription; not until removal of DNMT 3 B did we see a two-fold decrease in transcription from mitochondrial protein coding genes. No significant decline in transcription occurred when a DNMT 3 B knockout also lost the MTS of DNMT 1; this study is evidencing that DNMT 3 B is possibly the more significant methyltransferase in the mitochondria. Our aim from this study and future research is to clearly characterize which enzymes in the mitochondria are controlling cytosine modifications and to understand the mechanistic complexities that accompany cause and consequence of epigenetic modifications...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim {{of the project was}} {{to gain a better understanding}} of the factors that affect adhesion of fluoropolymers. This was achieved by employing various analytical techniques to the treated and untreated polymers. The effects of novel pretreatments, and established treatments, on Polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE, Poly (vinyl fluoride), PVF, and poly (vinylidene fluoride) PVdF, were characterised using: adhesion tests, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), including derivatisation reactions, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), contact angles and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) For untreated PVF and PTFE it was found that a certain degree of adhesion improvement was achievable without any chemical modification of the surfaces. This was observed when the substrates were repeatedly bonded. It is proposed that weakly cohesive material was present in the polymers and these acted as weak boundary layers when bonded. Removal of weak boundary layers alone was found to be insufficient to obtain high adhesion with PTFE. Surface functionality, increased wettabiIity and favourable topography all contributed to the high bond strengths observed with 'Tetra-Etch' treated PTFE. 'Tetra-Etch' treatment is used commercially on PTFE but prior to this programme was unreported on PVF and PVdF. The treatment was effective at promoting adhesion for PVF though at a· much slower rate than for PTFE. Additional mechanisms to that for PTFE (Le. electron transfer) are proposed for the action of 'Tetra-Etch' on PVF. These are dehydrohalogenation through electron transfer and an elimination reaction. The same mechanisms are proposed for PV dF. Flame and Iow pressure plasma treatments·,w 7 re carried out on PVF and PTFE. Flame was found to be ineffective for PTFE but with PVF chemical modification (oxidation) occurred at the carbon/hydrogen sites. No defluorination was observed; this was in contrast to the mechanism of oxidation via plasmas on PVF, where defluorination, oxidation, ablation, and crosslinking may have all contributed to the high bond strength obtained. Certain plasma treatments were effective at improving the adhesion of PTFE but were slower and caused less <b>modification.</b> <b>Removal</b> of weak boundary layers was proposed as the major factor since oxidation was often slight. Reaction with solutions of potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) were effective as adhesion pretreatments for PVF and PVdF but not for PTFE. For PVF and PVdF rates of reaction and chemical modification varied with time, temperature, molarity of solution and the nature of the solution i. e. aqueous or alcoholic. The greatest improvement in rate and effectiveness of the treatment for adhesion improvement was on the addition of a phase transfer catalyst to the aqueous solution. It was found for PVF that substantial surface oxidation could be achieved without improving the adhesion. It was suggested that oxidation occurred at sites present in a weakly cohesive layer. Mechanisms of the reactions were considered in terms of neucloephilic substitution and elimination; for PVF and PV dF both are likely. The mechanism of the phase transfer catalyst was investigated and found to be complex. It was found not to be simply a wetting agent but had inherent reactivity on its own. A combination of mechanisms was proposed...|$|E
