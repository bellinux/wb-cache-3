25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> this was easier said than done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Madonna {{performed}} the song on The MDNA Tour {{as part of}} the third segment of the show. She {{performed the}} song while her dancers moved mirrors around her, as she removed articles of clothing. At her concert in Istanbul on June 7, 2012, Madonna briefly exposed her right breast to the audience, before covering it up again. This prompted criticism about her age, with Sophie Wilkinson from Heat World asking, [...] "at 54, is she too old to be getting a boob out?" [...] The striptease {{towards the end of the}} song continued in other cities where the tour visited, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> the singer had messages written across her back talking about social issues.

In April 2015, Madonna performed [...] "Human Nature" [...] along with her 2005 song [...] "Hung Up" [...] as a medley at the Coachella Festival during Drake's act, sporting thigh-high boots and a tank top that read [...] "Big as Madonna".

500|$|Like some of Madonna's {{previous}} music videos, such as [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer", religious imagery plays a {{big role}} in the music video. In the book Madonna's Drowned Worlds the use of Catholic imagery in the video is discussed. Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández points out that unlike Madonna's previous music videos, much of the religious imagery is associated with the torero, not Madonna, {{due to the fact that}} religious images are a strong part of the bullfighting ritual. It has also been argued that in the video Madonna [...] "subverts the gender structure and masculine subjectivity implicit in traditional bullfighting." [...] This is achieved through the [...] "feminization of the matador and the emphasis on Madonna's character" [...] and also through Madonna's [...] "dominant gaze" [...] as she watches the matador perform." [...] Roger Beebe, one of the authors of Medium Cool: Music Videos from Soundies to Cellphones, noted that the video was an example of [...] "how music, image, and lyrics of a song possesses their own temporality". He explained that the [...] "graceful" [...] nature of the song was contrast to the repetitive scenes in the video, which he felt indicated that the protagonist has long been engaging in the activities, including the [...] "demoralizing sex scenes". In Madonna as Postmodern Myth, author Georges-Claude Guilbert felt the video [...] "defied feminists of the Marilyn Frye and Adrienne Rich variety, who see in the video a disgusting example of passé female submissiveness." [...] Madonna responded to this criticism by stating [...] "I don't believe that any organization should dictate to me what I can and cannot do artistically." [...] Guilbert also noted the usage of religious iconography in the video, especially dubious representation of the Virgin. He explained that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> Madonna and the torero make love through the television screen, implying that [...] "one of their purity had to be maintained always".|$|E
2500|$|According to {{historian}} Vasile Pârvan, the Dacian war flag, {{representing a}} wolf with a serpent's body, depicted the balaur. The balaur is not {{identical to the}} other creature [...] of Romanian myth., the zmeu. The biggest {{difference is that the}} zmeu, even if it has some lizard features, nevertheless is a human-like figure, while the balaur is the true form of the dragon. It is to be noted that usually, in all Romanian myths, legends and fairy tales, the balaur always has three, five, seven, nine or twelve heads. The balaur sometimes is a malefic figure, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> is a neutral figure, guarding various places, objects or knowledge. Also, in various myths and lore, there will be a series of dragons that have to be defeated in order to obtain the precious objects or entrance to the guarded places, usually three dragons, with scales of iron, silver and respectively gold, or silver, gold and respectively diamond, each stronger than the previous one, the number of their heads increasing with the difficulty.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{synthesis}} phase (S phase) {{in the cell}} cycle, the centrosome starts to duplicate. Just {{at the beginning of}} mitosis, both centrioles in each centrosome reach their maximal length, centrosomes recruit additional material and their nucleation capacity for microtubules increases. As mitosis progresses, both centrosomes separate to establish the mitotic spindle. In this way, the spindle in a mitotic cell has two poles emanating microtubules. Microtubules are long proteic filaments with asymmetric extremes, a [...] "minus"(-) end [...] relatively stable next to the centrosome, and a [...] "plus"(+) end [...] enduring alternate phases of growing-shrinking, exploring the center of the cell. During this searching process, a microtubule may encounter and capture a chromosome through the kinetochore. Microtubules that find and attach a kinetochore become stabilized, whereas those microtubules remaining free are rapidly depolymerized. As chromosomes have two kinetochores associated back-to-back (one on each sister chromatid), when one of them becomes attached to the microtubules generated by one of the cellular poles, the kinetochore on the sister chromatid becomes exposed to the opposed pole; for this reason, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> the second kinetochore becomes attached to the microtubules emanating from the opposing pole, {{in such a way that}} chromosomes are now bi-oriented, one fundamental configuration (also termed amphitelic) to ensure the correct segregation of both chromatids when the cell will divide.|$|E
2500|$|Rococo and Neoclassicism are terms used to {{describe}} the visual and plastic arts and architecture in Europe from the late seventeenth to the late eighteenth centuries. In France, the death of Louis XIV in 1715 lead to a period of freedom commonly called the Régence. Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722, the young king Louis XV and the government led by the duke of Orléans residing in Paris. There a new style emerged in the decorative arts, known as rocaille : the asymmetry and dynamism of the baroque was kept but renewed in a style that is less rhetoric and with less pompous effects, a deeper research of artificiality and use of motifs inspired by nature. This manner used to decorate rooms and furniture also existed in painting. Rocaillle painting turned toward lighters subjects, like the [...] "fêtes galantes", theater settings, pleasant mythological narratives and the female nude. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> the moralising sides of myths or history paintings are omitted and the accent is put on the decorative and pleasant aspect of the scenes depicted. Paintings from the period show an emphasis more on color than drawing, with apparent brush strokes and very colorful scenes. Important painters from this period include Antoine Watteau, considered the inventor of the fête galante, Nicolas Lancret and François Boucher.|$|E
2500|$|The {{battles between}} Kodavas and Tippu Sultan {{is one of}} the most bitter rivalries in South India. There were {{repeated}} attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father Hyder Ali before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, [...] "If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realized conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners.|$|E
