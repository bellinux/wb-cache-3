5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
5|$|In Greek historiography, Herodotus (484–425 BC) {{had written}} brief {{descriptions}} of ancient Ethiopians, {{who were also}} mentioned in the New Testament. Although the Byzantine Empire maintained regular relations with Ethiopia during the Early Middle Ages, the Early Muslim conquests of the 7th century severed the connection between Ethiopia {{and the rest of}} Christendom. Records of these contacts encouraged medieval Europeans to discover if Ethiopia was still Christian or had converted to Islam, an idea bolstered by the presence of Ethiopian pilgrims in the Holy Land and Jerusalem during the Crusades. During the High Middle Ages, the Mongol conquests of Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227) led Europeans to speculate about the existence of a priestly, legendary warrior king named Prester John, who was thought to inhabit distant lands in Asia associated with Nestorian Christians and <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> defeat rival Islamic powers. The travel literature of Marco Polo and Odoric of Pordenone regarding their separate journeys to Yuan-dynasty China during the 13th and 14th centuries, respectively, and fruitless searches in southern India, helped to dispel the notion that Prester John's kingdom existed in Asia. An Ethiopian diplomatic mission sent to Christian Europe by Ethiopian emperor Wedem Arad (r. 1299–1314) in 1306 allowed the chance for the priest and cartographer Giovanni da Carignano (1250–1329) to question the embassy as they stayed in Genoa, after which he published a work describing the geographic location of their kingdom and the nature of their Christian faith.|$|E

25|$|Wolfe is reticent {{about his}} youth, but {{apparently}} he was athletic, fit, and adventurous. Before World War I, he spied for the Austrian government's Evidenzbureau, {{but had a}} change of heart when the war began. He then joined the Serbian-Montenegrin army and fought against the Austrians and Germans. That means that he was likely to have been involved in the harrowing 1915 withdrawal of the defeated Serbian army, when thousands of soldiers died from disease, starvation, and sheer exhaustion — which <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> explain the comfort-loving habits that are such a conspicuous part of his character. After a time in Europe and North Africa, he came to the United States.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of Monday 23 March Seely {{had a meeting with}} Gough, with Paget, French and Spencer Ewart in attendance. Seely, who – by Gough’s account – {{attempted}} unsuccessfully to browbeat him by staring at him, accepted French’s suggestion that a written document from the Army Council <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> convince Gough’s officers. Seely took over a draft document to a Cabinet meeting for approval. Seely had to leave the meeting for an audience with the King, and in his absence the Cabinet agreed a text, stating that the Army Council were satisfied that the incident had been a misunderstanding, and that it was “the duty of all soldiers to obey lawful commands”.|$|E
500|$|Drawing on Adam of Bremen's {{assertion}} that Orkney was not conquered {{until the time}} of Harald Hardrada, who ruled Norway from 1043–66, Woolf (2007) speculates that Sigurd {{may have been the}} first Earl of Orkney. He also offers the hypothesis that the earldom was a created by the Danish king Harald Bluetooth, circa 980 rather than in the time of Harald Fairhair one hundred years earlier. He concludes that [...] "If there were no earls in Orkney before Sigurð's time it <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> explain the islands' low profile in the annals since these, for the most part, record only the deaths of great men." [...] However, the absence of comment on this subject by Irish sources prior to Sigurd's death there is hardly surprising. Irish sources of the period were not well informed about and [...] "not much concerned" [...] with Orkney. Smyth (1984) is more sympathetic to the claims of the sagas and argues that Torf-Einarr [...] "may be regarded as the first historical earl of Orkney".|$|E

2500|$|Green and McCreery’s {{identification}} of a class of what they called ‘reassuring apparitions’ {{is of particular interest}} in this regard, as it suggests that the experiencing of hallucinations may even have an adaptive effect in certain subjects, making them better able to cope with adverse life events. [...] This would fit with the model of schizotypy as essentially a normal dimension of personality, and <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> explain why the proneness to anomalous perceptual experiences has apparently not been ‘weeded out’ by the process of natural selection.|$|E

Although {{it was observed that}} it could be considered a humiliation for the military, it was also suggested that the threat of Islamist terrorism <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> bring the junta out of isolation.

2500|$|However, while {{adopting}} such {{an approach}} in his own analysis, Silver reasoned that there was additional information available in polls from [...] "similar" [...] states that <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> fill the gaps in information about the trends in a given state. Accordingly, he adapted an approach that he had previously used in his baseball forecasting: using nearest neighbor analysis he first identified [...] "most similar states" [...] and then factored into his electoral projections for a given state the polling information from [...] "similar states". He carried this approach one step further by also factoring national polling trends into the estimates for a given state. Thus, his projections were not simply based on the polling trends in a given state.|$|E
2500|$|When {{methylene}} blue is [...] "polychromed" [...] (oxidized in solution or [...] "ripened" [...] by fungal metabolism, as originally {{noted in the}} thesis of Dr. D. L. Romanowsky in 1890s), it gets serially demethylated and forms all the tri-, di-, mono- and non-methyl intermediates, which are Azure B, Azure A, Azure C, and thionine, respectively. This {{is the basis of}} the basophilic part of the spectrum of Romanowski-Giemsa effect. If only synthetic Azure B and Eosin Y is used, it may serve as a standardized Giemsa stain; but, without {{methylene blue}}, the normal neutrophilic granules tend to overstain and look like toxic granules. On the other hand, if methylene blue is used it <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> give the normal look of neutrophil granules and may also enhance the staining of nucleoli and polychromatophilic RBCs (reticulocytes).|$|E
2500|$|On 23 September 1966, Heidegger {{was interviewed}} by Rudolf Augstein and Georg Wolff for Der Spiegel magazine, in which he agreed to discuss his {{political}} past provided that the interview be published posthumously. (It was published five days after his death, on 31 May 1976.) In the interview, Heidegger defended his entanglement with National Socialism in two ways: first, he argued {{that there was no}} alternative, saying {{that he was trying to}} save the university (and science in general) from being politicized and thus had to compromise with the Nazi administration. Second, he admitted that he saw an [...] "awakening" [...] (Aufbruch) which <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> find a [...] "new national and social approach," [...] but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the Night of the Long Knives.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, {{proponents of}} nuclear power argue that [...] nuclear power has killed by far the fewest number of people per {{terawatt}} hour of any type of power generation, {{and it has a}} very small effect on the environment with effectively zero emissions of any kind. And this even taking into account the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents, in which few people were killed directly and few excess cancers will be caused by releases of radioactivity to the environment. Some proponents acknowledge that most people will not accept this sort of statistical argument nor will they believe reassuring statements from industry or government. [...] Indeed, the industry itself has created fear {{of nuclear power}} by pointing out that radioactivity can be dangerous. [...] Improved communication by industry <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> overcome current fears regarding nuclear power, {{but it will be a}} difficult task to change current perceptions in the general population.|$|E
2500|$|But {{with regard}} to the {{proposition}} that [...] "Improved communication by industry <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> overcome current fears regarding nuclear power", [...] M.V. Ramana says that the basic problem is that there is [...] "distrust of the social institutions that manage nuclear energy", and a 2001 survey by the European Commission found that [...] "only 10.1 percent of Europeans trusted the nuclear industry". This public distrust is periodically reinforced by safety violations by nuclear companies, or through ineffectiveness or corruption on the part of nuclear regulatory authorities. Once lost, says Ramana, trust is extremely difficult to regain. Faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has [...] "tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the publication of [...] numerous [...] "fact sheets" [...] that discuss issues of public concern. Ramana says that none of these strategies have been very successful.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{laboratory}} rat strains {{that have}} been created by controlled breeding for many generations show a higher tendency towards compulsive behaviors than other strains. [...] Lewis rats show more compulsive lever pressing behavior than Sprague Dawley or Wistar rats and are less responsive to the anti-compulsive drug paroxetine. [...] In this study, rats were taught to press a lever to receive food in an operant conditioning task. [...] Once food was no longer provided when they pressed the lever, rats were expected to stop pressing it. [...] Lewis rats pressed the lever more often {{than the other two}} types, even though they had presumably learned that they would not receive food, and continued to press it more often even after treatment with the drug. [...] An analysis of the genetic differences between the three rat strains <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> identify genes that might be responsible for the compulsive behavior.|$|E

2500|$|Critics of the theory's {{extension}} to computer networks also note greater theoretical {{problems with the}} applicability of a real property theory to intellectual property. In order to explain why real property theories might extend to the Internet, proponents equate [...] "cyberspace" [...] with real land, arguing that owners of computer servers {{should have the same}} right of inviolability as owners of land receive to promote greater efficiency in transactions. However, even if some aspects of cyberspace resemble real space, detractors contend that cyberspace is not like real land at all because [...] "the 'placeness' of cyberspace is a matter of ongoing social construction." [...] Furthermore, even if granting property rights <b>might</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> avoid problems of inefficiency and under-cultivation in the context of real property, critics note that nothing suggests that the same principles would also be effective in the context of computer networks—especially because the problem of under-cultivation does not tend to occur online.|$|E
2500|$|The Hagerstown and Frederick Railway {{that started}} in 1896 in {{northern}} Maryland was built to provide transit service to resorts and the streetcar company built and operated two amusement parks to entice more people to ride their streetcars.

[...] The Lake Compounce amusement park, which started in 1846, had by 1895 established trolley service to its rural Connecticut location.

Gough insisted on adding a further paragraph clarifying that the Army would not be used to enforce Home Rule [...] "on Ulster'", to which French added in writing [...] "This is how I read it.
