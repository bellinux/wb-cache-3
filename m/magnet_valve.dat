Stationary magnetic disk mounted just upstream of poppet, also containing <b>magnet.</b> <b>Valve</b> body nonmagnetic. Forward pressure or flow would push poppet away from stationary magnetic disk so fluid flows easily around poppet. Stop in valve body prevents poppet from being swept away. When flow stopped or started to reverse, magnetic attraction draws poppet back to disk. Poppet then engages floating O-ring, thereby closing valve and preventing reverse flow. Floating O-ring facilitates sealing at low loads...|$|E

40|$|A {{variable}} valve timing (VVT) can improve fuel efficiency, reduce CO 2 emission and increase torque output. To achieve VVT in internal combustion engine, new devices such as mechanical, hydraulic, motor-driven and electromagnetic actuator have been developed in past years to replace the conventional camshaft valve train system used currently. Among these, the electromagnetic actuator using solenoids is the most advance system to provide the most flexibility to valve timing, but it has critical drawback of high power consumption.

2500|$|Return to Ravenholm, {{sometimes}} referred to as Half-Life 2: Episode Four, was under development by Arkane Studios before its cancellation. The episode would have featured the Half-Life location Ravenholm, a town infested with zombies and headcrabs. As it was set before the end of Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Valve felt it was constrained creatively. Another abandoned episode was under development by Junction Point Studios, a studio led by Warren Spector. Spector said that the episode would have shown how Ravenholm became the town seen in Half-Life 2, allowing them to feature more of the character of Father Grigori; images of this setting in their game appeared in early 2017. The game included a [...] "magnet gun", which fired projectiles that would magnetize the metal surface they contract, drawing objects and enemies towards it, and would have been used both for combat and puzzles. Junction Point worked on it for a year, producing enough content to demonstrate one section of the game, and a vertical slice that demonstrated the mechanics of the <b>magnet</b> gun. <b>Valve</b> became uninterested in the project, and Spector dropped it in favour of Disney's Epic Mickey.|$|R

40|$|A fully {{integrated}} Machine Protection System (MPS) {{is critical to}} efficient commissioning and safe operation of all high-current accelerators. The MPS needs to monitor the status of all devices that could enter the beam path, the beam loss monitors (BLMs), magnet settings, beam dump status, etc. This information is then presented to the electron source controller, which must limit the beam power or shut down the beam completely. The MPS for the energy recovery linac (ERL) at the Jefferson Lab Free Electron Laser [1] generates eight different power limits, or beam modes, which are passed to the drive laser pulse controller (DLPC) (photocathode source controller). These range from no beam to nearly 2 megawatts of electron beam power. Automatic masking {{is used for the}} BLMs during low-power modes when one might be using beam viewers.

The system, marketed by Öhlins under the brand name CES (Continuously controlled Electronic Suspension), enables a wide working range and ability {{to adapt to the}} current road conditions. By controlling  the valve in different ways there are also possibilities to decide on a specfic damper characteristic such as sport or comfort. The CES valve is working as a pilot controlled pressure regulator and is continuously controlled with help of an electro <b>magnet.</b> The CES <b>valve</b> is mounted in a uniflow damper which in turn guarantees the flow through the valve to go in only one direction independently ofdamper stroke direction. The rst part of the thesis investigates the damping characteristics in the latest model of the CES valve (i. e the CES 8700).

Questions that are answered are: How is damping dened, what creates damping in the valve, how large is the damping, what parameters aect the damping.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inadvertent {{adjustments}} and malfunctions of programmable valves {{have been}} reported in cases in which patients have encountered powerful electromagnetic fields such as those involved in magnetic resonance imaging, but the potential effects of magnetic toys on programmable valves are not well known. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The magnetic properties of nine toy magnets were examined. To calculate the effect of a single magnet over a distance, the magnetic flux density was directly measured using a calibrated Hall probe at seven different positions between 0 and 120 mm from the magnet. Strata II small (Medtronic Inc.), Codman Hakim (Codman & Shurtleff), and Polaris (Sophysa) programmable valves were then tested {{to determine the effects of}} the toy <b>magnets</b> on each <b>valve</b> type. RESULTS: The maximal flux density of different magnetic toys differed between 17 and 540 mT, inversely proportional to the distance between toy and measurement instrument. Alterations to Strata and Codman valve settings could be effected with all the magnetic toys. The distances that still led to an alteration of the valve settings differed from 10 to 50 mm (Strata), compared with 5 to 30 mm (Codman). Valve settings of Polaris could not be altered by any toy at any distance due to its architecture with two magnets adjusted in opposite directions. CONCLUSION: This is the first report describing changes in the pressure setting of some adjustable valves caused by magnetic toys in close contact. Parents, surgeons, neurologists, pediatric oncologists, and paramedics should be informed about the potential dangers of magnetic toys to prevent unwanted changes to pressure settings...|$|R
40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} thermodynamic operating parameter {{goals for the}} steady state operation of the control dewar/solenoid system. Specifically, how the control dewar pressure control valve, PV- 3062 -H and the <b>magnet</b> flow control <b>valve</b> EVMF are operated to give the lowest possible temperature fluid at the solenoid magnet. The goals are: (1) For PV- 3062 -H - The process variable is the helium reservoir pressure, minimize the reservoir pressure, provide only enough pressure plus a little margin to ensure leads flow; and (2) For EVMF - The process variable is firstly a manual setpoint of flowrate as read by the flow venturi, FE 3253 -H, and secondly the reservoir liquid level, minimize the pressure drop thru the solenoid cooling tubes, provide at least enough flow to maintain reservoir level and stable operation of the magnet. The thermodynamic states for the fluid thru the system are shown on the Pressure versus Temperature graph. Lines of constant enthalpy are also shown. State A is shown as two phase liquid entering the inlet of the subcooler. The subcooler subcools the fluid to State B. State B to State C {{is caused by the}} pressure drop across EVMF. State C to D is the estimated pressure drop from the outlet of EVMF thru the solenoid cooling tubes and back up to the helium reservoir inlet. To give the coolest fluid in the cooling tubes, the two phase fluid in the reservoir should be at the lowest pressure (and thus temperature). This lowest pressure is limited by the required pressure for leads flow and if this does not dominate, the low pressure side pressure drop thru the refrigerator and suction pressure set point. My guess is the lead flow requirement will dominate. I suggest putting the PV- 3062 -H set point such that the lead flow control valves operate at about 80 % open. The second parameter that will give the coolest fluid in the cooling tubes is a minimized pressure drop thru the cooling tubes. This can be accomplished by providing a minimized flowrate, sufficient only to ensure that the reservoir level is full and some liquid fraction leaves the helium outlet tubing. D-Zero Engineering note, EN- 338, 'LHe Flow Regime/Pressure Drop for DO Solenoid at Steady State Conditions' shows that even though the gas fraction increases at lower flowrates, the pressure drop decreases. This goal is ideal, and assumes good cooling at the magnet. Real effects such hot spots or quench experience in the magnet may necessitate a higher flowrate. The current design flow rate from Toshiba is somewhere around 2. 5 gls which is very low. Experience with the accuracy of the venturi flowmeter, coil characteristics etc. and some conservativeness will help determine the optimum flowrate. I would venture a guess {{that it would be a}} minimum of 5 g/s. The philosophy that I have been taking with transfer line and valve sizing is such that our refrigerator system will have the ability to supply up to at least 20 g/s if required and necessary. Preferably we will be around 5 g/s...|$|R
