A survey study was undertaken amongst 16 prestigious aerospace organizations in Bangalore, which is the sampling boundary. Out of the 650 questionnaires distributed, a total number of 612 were received back and finally 583 selected which were found suitable for the study. The analysis is based on the responses for the questionnaire received from the aerospace scientists and engineers belonging to the selected aerospace organizations. The responses from the participants towards the frequency of use of aerospace engineering e-journals were graded on a scale of 4 to 0, a <b>score</b> <b>of</b> 4 indicating „Daily‟ access. The major findings in this paper are: (a) The summary <b>of</b> total <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> obtained with regard to usage of aerospace engineering e-journals represents the following pattern: The highest <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> 1. 25 (CV= 110. 44) is obtained for the journal „Aerospace Science and Technology‟. This is followed by a <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> 1. 20 (CV= 111. 16) which is represented for „Progress in Aerospace Sciences‟. The third highest <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> 1. 12 (CCV= 114. 14) is reflected for „Journal of Aerospace Engineering‟. This is followed by a <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> 1. 08 (CV= 121. 57) which is represented for „IEEE Transactions on Electronics and Aerospace Systems‟. „Web of Science‟ follows up with the next highest <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> 1. 01 (CV= 132. 41). „Online Journals: Aerospace‟ gets the next highest <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> 0. 95 (CV= 129. 23). This is followed by the „Journal of Turbo and Jet Engines‟ which gets the next highest <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> 0. 90 (CV= 137. 69). „The Journal of Failure Analysis and Prevention (ASM International) ‟ comes up with the next highest <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> 0. 78 (CV= 151. 37).

Methods: Twenty seven male 7 to 9 year old students with learning disability and 27 age and sex matched normal conrols were selected with unprobable simple sampling. 27 In order to evaluate auditory selective and divided attention, Farsi versions of speech in noise and dichotic digit test were used respectively.
