5|$|EF-84E: Two F-84Es were {{converted}} into test prototypes, to test various methods of air-to-air refueling. EF-84E 49-2091 {{was used as}} a probe-and-drogue test aircraft. The probe was <b>mid-span</b> on the port wing. Production aircraft with probes (removable) had the probe fitted to the auxiliary wing tanks. EF-84E 49-2115 {{was used as a}} FICON test aircraft with a B-36 host. EF-84E 49-1225 and EF-84E 51-634 were test aircraft for the ZELMAL (Zero-length launch, Mat landing) experiments version for point defense, used the booster rocket from MGM-1 Matador cruise missile.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to <b>mid-span</b> for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at <b>mid-span</b> of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>mid-span</b> of the Mid-Hudson Bridge, US 44 and NY 55 {{cross into}} Dutchess County {{and enter the}} city of Poughkeepsie.|$|E
25|$|NY440 {{begins at}} the New York–New Jersey state line, <b>mid-span</b> on the Outerbridge Crossing over the Arthur Kill in the Richmond Valley {{neighborhood}} of Staten Island. The four-lane bridge crosses east through Richmond Valley and over Arthur Kill Road.|$|E
25|$|The wings were braced to the {{fuselage}} with a parallel pair of struts {{from the lower}} longerons to the spars at about <b>mid-span</b> assisted by N-form, cross-braced jury struts at right angles. Four very short struts from the upper fuselage longerons to the wing centre section formed a low cabane.|$|E
25|$|Engineers in {{the nineteenth}} century {{understood}} that a bridge that was continuous across multiple supports would distribute the loads among them. This would result in lower stresses in the girder or truss and meant that longer spans could be built. Several nineteenth century engineers patented continuous bridges with hinge points <b>mid-span.</b> The use of a hinge in the multi-span system presented the advantages of a statically determinate system and of a bridge that could handle differential settlement of the foundations. Engineers could more easily calculate the forces and stresses with a hinge in the girder.|$|E
25|$|The {{wing of the}} E-30 was {{straight}} edged and of constant chord, with rounded wing tips and a large, rounded cut-out in the trailing edge above the fuselage to improve visibility from the rear cockpit. It was fabric covered over a wooden structure, with Spanish pine box spars and ribs. Its centre section contained an integral fuel tank and was mounted on the fuselage with three duraluminum cabane struts on each side to the fuselage top and sides. Each wing was braced {{with a pair of}} lift struts from the fuselage bottom to about <b>mid-span.</b> The wings could be easily folded.|$|E
25|$|As {{scheduled}} {{during the}} opening ceremony, the participating athletes, teamed with their respective national delegations, began to cross the bridge and enter the stadium in alphabetical order. The second nation to cross the bridge, following the Austrian team, consisted of the 373 members of the Australian delegation. As the Australian athletes, in parallel rows of six, crossed the river, the bridge's support beams at roughly <b>mid-span</b> snapped, plunging around 100 of the Australians eight metres into the river below. Several of the fallen were forcibly submerged in the 1.6-metre deep river {{by the weight of}} falling athletes above them.|$|E
25|$|The wings had {{constant}} chord with roughly elliptical tips, with roots joining the upper longerons. On each side, {{a pair of}} streamlined struts from {{the front and rear}} wing spars at <b>mid-span</b> transmitted lift loads {{to the end of the}} stub wing. There was another, slighter pair of struts from each engine mounting vertically to the wing. The wing structure was mostly metal, with some wooden components, then fabric covered. Each wing carried a pair of ailerons with trim tabs to reduce control loads. The fuselage was built around the usual four metal longerons and covered with an aluminium skin. Pilot and co-pilot sat side by side with dual control in an enclosed cabin just ahead of the leading edge, with fuselage windows on either side for lateral and downward vision. Access to the large passenger cabin, 4.60 m long, was via a radio compartment. The cabin seated ten passengers, five down each side with their own window. At the back were baggage spaces and toilet facilities. Passengers entered by a port-side door and luggage loaded through a door on the other side.|$|E
500|$|The initial F-108 {{configuration}} {{featured a}} very large [...] "cranked" [...] delta wing. There were fixed ventral stabilizers on the wings, mounted at <b>mid-span,</b> and a tall all-moving vertical tailfin, supplemented by two ventral stabilizers that extended when the landing gear retracted. Although some earlier versions of the design had separate tailplanes or forward canards, both were abandoned in the final design. The large fuselage and wing had two and five fuel tanks, respectively, giving an estimated combat radius of some [...] Top speed was estimated at , about Mach3, at [...] The aircraft was powered by two General Electric J93 turbojet engines, also used in North American's XB-70 Valkyrie bomber, in the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|... 1914 - Four wooden [...] (approximately 6' long × 4' deep) were {{attached}} to the iron fence supports for people to seek refuge upon when trains passed. [...] The platforms were staggered every 154' and cantilevered over the deck arches (<b>mid-span)</b> 5W, 9E, 13W and 17E. [...] The jump-outs were installed {{after the death of}} Canton Junction section foreman, Wilbert H. Jerauld who was on the viaduct when two trains converged and was unable to escape.|$|E
2500|$|The single-seat triplane had unswept {{rectangular}} wings, {{each with}} a full span of only 4m (13ft1in). [...] These were mounted without stagger, each wing braced to the one below by two pairs of vertical, parallel interplane struts, one pair out beyond <b>mid-span</b> and the other from the fuselage sides. [...] The central wing {{was attached to the}} upper fuselage and the other two held well clear of it by the struts. There were ailerons on each wing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{undercarriage}} {{structure was}} also {{central to the}} wing bracing. [...] The Caproni 95's long wing was not a cantilever but braced {{by a pair of}} parallel struts from the wing spars just beyond <b>mid-span</b> to the wheel frames. These struts had further, short jury struts from near their tops at 90° to the spars. [...] There was also a pair of struts from the lower fuselage to the wing, joining the vertical undercarriage legs under the engines.|$|E
2500|$|The delta-shaped {{horizontal}} stabilizer was set {{low on the}} tail and was shaped much like the wing, with 5% thickness. The rudder was tiny, as were the mass-balanced elevators. The tandem [...] "velosipednoye" [...] (bicycle) undercarriage legs, {{similar to those of}} the Yak-50, retracted aft, although the forward wheel remained exposed when retracted. Small outrigger struts retracted aft into underwing fairings set at <b>mid-span.</b> On the ground the Yak-1000 had a pronounced nose-high attitude, and the single nosewheel was steerable.|$|E
2500|$|The bridge's west {{abutment}} is in Virginia, a {{small portion}} is in Washington, D.C., and the remaining majority of it is within Maryland (because that section of the Potomac River is within Maryland's borders). About [...] of the western <b>mid-span</b> portion of the bridge crosses {{the tip of the}} southernmost corner of the District of Columbia. Therefore, the bridge is the only bridge in the United States that crosses the borders of three jurisdictions. The section in Washington, D.C. is also the shortest segment of Interstate Highway between state lines.|$|E
2500|$|The Annebula uses a {{completely}} new single-spar [...] wing with Prue-type trailing edge dive brakes. The airfoil is a NACA laminar flow type of varying section over the span, starting at the wing root as a NACA 64(3)-618, becoming a NACA 64(3)-615 by <b>mid-span</b> and then a NACA 4412 at the tip. The wing is constructed from plywood and fiberglass and {{is responsible for the}} Annebula's performance increase from the Cherokee II's 23:1 glide ratio to 31.5:1. The Annebula also has more span, wing loading and a higher aspect ratio than the Cherokee II.|$|E
2500|$|As Timmermann's {{men were}} {{approaching}} <b>mid-span</b> at 1540 hours, the eastern {{portion of the}} bridge was blown up by order of German Major Hans Scheller. But the bridge somehow remained standing. The bridge had lifted up a bit and then dropped safely back in place. [...] Timmermann and his men picked themselves up continuing to cut wires and dump explosives while the other half continued their attack. American engineer troops arrived and immediately were ordered to take over removing the demolition charges from the bridge. After being replaced by the engineers, the rest of Timmermann's men were following {{the first half of}} the company eastward across the Rhine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the SM.80 {{was flat}} sided, {{with a single}} stepped, double planked underside, copper riveted for corrosion resistance. It became slender aft. The side-by-side cockpit was set slightly into the wing leading edge and a baggage space or third seat {{was placed in the}} trailing edge. On the water, lateral stability was provided by fixed, flat bottomed floats mounted on the wing at <b>mid-span</b> on pairs of parallel struts. [...] The wheeled undercarriage of the amphibian attracted contemporary notice for its neatness: the mainwheel legs were enclosed in fairings, rotated through about 180° rearwards then upwards along the fuselage sides, positioning the retracted wheels in the wing roots.|$|E
2500|$|In {{plan the}} wing of the D.VI was more {{complicated}} than most, with the chord narrowest in the centre section, increasing outwards then decreasing somewhat towards the wing tips from about <b>mid-span.</b> Most of the curvature was on the trailing edge, assisting the pilot's vision from his cockpit there. [...] The wing thickness also varied along the span, thinnest in the centre then increasing and decreasing again. The wing carried overhung, balanced ailerons and was braced {{with a pair of}} slightly converging, outward leaning struts to the thickest part of the wing from the lower fuselage. [...] Its centre section was supported by a pair of short, vertical N-form cabane struts from the upper fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The high {{wings of}} the 440 had exactly the same span of those of the 28 and the same plan away from the centre section, of {{constant}} chord with roughly elliptical tips. They were constructed from a mixture of wood and metal, based on two rectangular spars and fabric covered. [...] Double ailerons covered most of the straight part of the trailing edge. [...] There were a pair of very wide chord lift struts under each wing, linking the lower fuselage longeron to the two wing spars near <b>mid-span.</b> [...] The centre section was supported by four faired spars from points on the lift struts about 30% outboard, together with a steel cabane.|$|E
2500|$|The BS.17's wings were, {{like those}} of the BS.16, {{rectangular}} in plan apart from clipped aileron tips. Mounted without dihedral, the two separate wings were built around a pair of spars, one close to the leading edge with plywood covering forward from it around the edge forming a torsion-resistant D-box. Behind it the wing was fabric covered. Centrally, the wings were supported over the fuselage on the same cross braced trapezoidal structure used originally on the BS.16 and later on several other Bonomi gliders. [...] The wings were braced with an asymmetric, faired wooden V strut on each side, attached to the lower fuselage and running to the wing spars at about <b>mid-span.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Four {{parallel}} tail booms ran aft, {{two from}} the <b>mid-span</b> of the upper wing and the others from the lower wing. These four members carried the tail. The tailplane, mounted on the upper booms and bearing a full-width elevator, had a span of 18ft 10in (5.74m), no less than 78% of the wingspan. A pair of fin and rudders joined {{the upper and lower}} booms, a height of about 7ft 6in (2.3m). The [...] "reversed" [...] undercarriage of the Scout was abandoned and the mainwheels were mounted on a single axle supported by two pairs of struts to the nacelle. Though photographs show the gunport, the gun itself was probably never fitted.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of {{the typical}} {{tricycle}} landing gear, the U-2 uses a bicycle configuration with a forward set of main wheels located just behind the cockpit, and a rear set of main wheels located behind the engine. The rear wheels are coupled to the rudder to provide steering during taxiing. To maintain balance while taxiing and take-off, two auxiliary wheels called [...] "pogos" [...] are attached under the wings. These fit into sockets underneath each wing at about <b>mid-span,</b> and fall off at takeoff. To protect the wings during landing, each wingtip has a titanium skid. After the U-2 comes to a halt, the ground crew re-installs the pogos in one wing at a time, then the aircraft taxis to parking.|$|E
2500|$|The A4/M7 {{motorway}} route {{follows a}} [...] radius horizontal curve and a [...] radius vertical convex curve {{at the site}} of the bridge, intersecting the watercourse at an angle of 75degrees. The bridge consists of dual structures, one for each of the motorway carriageways, executed as composite, continuous structures. Each of the structures comprises two [...] × [...] box steel girders made composite with deck slab of variable depth ( [...] at <b>mid-span),</b> concreted in situ. Since the river is up to [...] wide and only [...] deep on average, a five span structure was selected for construction of the bridge: [...] + 3 × [...] + [...] The bridge is [...] overall and each of the two parallel structures is [...] wide, spaced [...] apart.|$|E
2500|$|The Gabardini {{monoplane}} {{was designed}} with a steel tube structure, which was unusual. [...] Its shoulder mounted monoplane wings were built around two tubular steel spars, with wooden ribs and canvas covering. In plan view the low aspect ratio wings were barely straight, tapered to generously rounded tips. [...] Roll control was by wing warping, with conventional control column input. [...] The wings were wire-braced to the fuselage from above {{as well as}} from below. [...] The three upper wires on each side, one from the front spar and two from the rear at about <b>mid-span,</b> ran {{to the top of a}} three-legged pylon over the cockpit. [...] The lower wires were attached to the frame that also carried the landing wheels and skids.|$|E
2500|$|The Trnovo Bridge is {{the most}} {{prominent}} object of Plečnik's renovation of {{the banks of the}} Gradaščica. It is located {{in the front of the}} Trnovo Church to the south of the city center. It connects the neighborhoods of Krakovo and Trnovo, the oldest Ljubljana suburbs, known for their market gardens and cultural events. It was built between 1929 and 1932. It is distinguished by its width and two rows of birches that it bears, because it was meant to serve as a public space in front of the church. Each corner of the bridge is capped with a small pyramid, a signature motif of Plečnik's, whereas the <b>mid-span</b> features a pair of Art-Deco male sculptures. There is also a statue of Saint John the Baptist on the bridge, the patron of the Trnovo Church. It was designed by [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Jacobs plans {{show the}} Hols der Teufel had a simple, {{constant}} chord wing {{much like that}} of the Zögling though of greater span, built around two spars and fabric covered except at the leading edge which was plywood skinned. [...] Its broad, constant chord ailerons were longer than those of the Zögling and its round cornered, tapered tips were less angular. [...] As before, the wing was supported by the forward members of its girder fuselage; a vertical strut near the leading edge and an inverted V-strut behind. [...] As the wing was strut rather than wire braced there was no longer a need to extend these struts above the wing into a pylon. [...] The two faired, parallel lift struts on each side ran from the lower forward fuselage to the wing at about <b>mid-span.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The MS.341 was {{a typical}} Morane-Saulnier parasol wing monoplane, though it was {{intended}} to bring this tradition into line with 1930s practice. [...] Of mixed wood and metal construction, it was designed for club and training rôles. [...] The wing, with 18° of sweep but with no dihedral, was mounted centrally to the upper fuselage by N-shaped cabane struts and braced with V-form lift struts from <b>mid-span</b> to the lower fuselage longeron. [...] The fuselage was flat sided with a curved decking and tandem open cockpits, the forward one under the wing leading edge where there was a cut-out for better visibility. The MS.341 had a fin with a straight leading edge and a tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage, braced to the fin. [...] The rudder extended {{to the bottom of the}} fuselage, moving between the two separate elevators. [...] Both control surfaces were horn balanced ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was a low-wing monoplane of mainly wooden construction. The wire-braced wings were {{of an unusual}} elliptical layout, with the maximum chord and thickness at <b>mid-span</b> on each side, tapering in towards the root. The two box-spars and the spruce ribs were of [...] spruce, covered with thin mahogany sheet overlaid with silk. The rear of the elliptical section fuselage was also wooden, being a monocoque construction with two layers of mahogany veneer applied over a frame of spruce formers and stringers. The forward section was built from steel tubing, covered with duralumin panels. The exposed cylinders were covered by streamlined helmets to minimise drag while admitting enough air to cool the engine, the helmet of the uppermost cylinder being continued back as a fairing which incorporated the windscreen and pilot's headrest. The twin floats, made of duralumin, were each carried {{on a pair of}} streamline section raked struts, braced by wires.|$|E
2500|$|Testing {{on the new}} bridge {{design was}} begun in November 1943 and {{continued}} through 1945. The studies included 200 different configurations, to wind forces hitting the span at up to plus-or-minus 45-degrees perpendicular to the deck. Then, testing was performed on a design using open strips of wind grating placed in the roadway, which added even greater stability against torsional movement. A design with bottom lateral bracing on the stiffening truss was also tested to test the resistance against lateral movement. Then, a design was tested with motion damping devices located on the deck at three locations: one at each tower (one {{at each end of}} the main span, and one on each side span at the tower), and a set of damping devices at <b>mid-span</b> on each main cable. [...] Each of these steps in the design and testing phase were performed to reduce as much lateral and torsional movement as possible.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the cooling}} {{problems}} and some issues concerning the undercarriage had been resolved, the same aircraft flew as the Pa.61B Arbalète but {{proved to be}} underpowered with the Hirth engine. As a result, a new machine, the Pa.61F Arbalète II, was built, powered by a [...] Lycoming O-360 air-cooled flat-four engine with side air intakes on the semi-monocoque, circular cross-section fuselage. The Arbalète II's cockpit was {{large enough to hold}} three. The <b>mid-span</b> fins were different, slightly straight tapered, mounted on the trailing edge and extending below it. [...] Below the rudders they carried airbrakes. The slight sweep on the centre wing section trailing edge has led to a description of the wing plan as [...] "crescent" [...] rather than delta. A [...] narrow continuation of {{the leading edge of the}} wing to the nose formed strakes on each side. There were control surfaces on the trailing edges both within and beyond the fins. The Arbalète II's main undercarriage legs were moved inboard, mounted on the wing but close to the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The tube-frame design, earlier {{introduced}} by Fazlur Khan, {{was a new}} approach that allowed more open floor plans than the traditional design that distributed columns throughout the interior to support building loads. The World Trade Center towers used high-strength, load-bearing perimeter steel columns called Vierendeel trusses that were spaced closely {{together to form a}} strong, rigid wall structure, supporting virtually all lateral loads such as wind loads, and sharing the gravity load with the core columns. The perimeter structure containing 59 columns per side was constructed with extensive use of prefabricated modular pieces, each consisting of three columns, three stories tall, connected by [...] plates. The spandrel plates were welded to the columns to create the modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. Adjacent modules were bolted together with the splices occurring at <b>mid-span</b> of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them to work together in resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so that the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
2500|$|With its {{parasol wing}} {{high above the}} hull, the three engines which were mounted in the upper surface were well clear of spray. [...] Two of the three 500hp (373kW) Farman 12 Wd W-12 {{water-cooled}} inline engines were mounted {{as close to the}} centre line as propeller clearance would allow, in tractor configuration; the third was mounted on the centre line as a pusher. [...] This arrangement minimised the asymmetric forces resulting from the loss of any one engine. [...] Each drove a four-bladed propeller. [...] The wing itself was rectangular in plan, square tipped and with a low aspect ratio of about 5.8. [...] It was a steel structure, fabric covered. [...] The ailerons filled most of the trailing edge and carried compensators. The major structural connections between wing and hull were via the sponsons; one pair of [...] wide streamlined struts leaned outwards from the sponson tips to <b>mid-span</b> on each side, and another pair went almost vertically upwards from the same point. [...] Struts direct from wing to fuselage strengthened the centre section, supported the engines and transferred their loads.|$|E
2500|$|The {{general design}} {{followed}} that of Wibault's family of single- and two-seat fighters, the Wib 3, Wib 7, Wib 8 and Wib 9 but in external detail was {{closest to the}} Wib 8. It was an all-metal aircraft, the structure mostly Duralumin and covered with narrow aluminium strips applied longitudinally. [...] The parasol wing was straight edged and of constant chord, braced to the lower fuselage {{with a pair of}} parallel struts on each side which met the wing at about <b>mid-span.</b> The Wib 12 had a new pair of jury struts from the main wing struts to the wing underside for strengthening. There were cabane struts over the fuselage and a trailing edge cut-out in the wing over the pilot's cockpit to enhance his visibility. A pair of synchronised [...] Vickers machine guns fixed to the fuselage fired forwards through the propeller arc; in addition the rear cockpit was fitted with a pair of Lewis guns of the same calibre on a Scarff ring. [...] A braced tailplane was mounted towards the top of the fuselage, together with an angular fin and rudder.|$|E
2500|$|The major {{differences}} between the two were in the fuselages. The Zögling had a very simple open frame girder fuselage, the Prüfling a more conventional hexagonal cross section, wood framed structure, ply covered forward from under the wing and fabric covered aft. The wing was supported over the fuselage with a pair of parallel lift struts on each side, bracing it at almost <b>mid-span</b> at the spars to the lower fuselage longerons. The open cockpit was below the wing centre section which was supported by two pairs of cabane struts to the upper fuselage longerons. The forward pair, placed {{just in front of the}} cockpit were single, upright struts but the rear ones, just behind, were each an inverted V-pair. [...] At the centre there was a noticeable gap between the wings, bridged by a short chord wooden link. [...] The horizontal tail was positioned on the upper longerons. with a triangular fin carrying an upright, straight edged balanced rudder which was slightly angled below the heel and extended down to the keel. The Prüfling landed on a rubber sprung skid below the whole forward, ply skinned fuselage, assisted by a very small tailskid.|$|E
