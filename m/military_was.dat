5|$|In 1942 the Australian <b>military</b> <b>was</b> {{reinforced}} by units recalled from the Middle East and {{an expansion of}} the CMF and RAAF. United States Military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea. The Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943. From 1944 the Australian <b>military</b> <b>was</b> mainly relegated to subsidiary roles, but continued to conduct large-scale operations {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The <b>military</b> <b>was</b> {{organized}} along similar {{lines to}} the British and American {{armed forces of the}} time, in which a small standing army could quickly augment its strength during emergencies from a reserve militia force (in Brazil, the National Guard). Brazil's first line of defense relied upon a large and powerful navy to protect against foreign attack. As a matter of policy, the <b>military</b> <b>was</b> to be completely obedient to civilian governmental control and to remain at arm's length from involvement in political decisions.|$|E
5|$|Aldo Rico {{escaped from}} prison in January 1988 and started a new mutiny in a distant {{regiment}} in the northeast. This time, both the military support for the mutiny and the public outcry against it were minimal. The army attacked him, and Rico surrendered after a brief combat. Colonel Mohamed Alí Seineldín launched a new mutiny in late 1988. As in 1987, the mutineers were defeated and jailed, but the <b>military</b> <b>was</b> reluctant to open fire against them. Alfonsín's goal of reconciling the military with the civil population failed, as the latter rejected the military's complaints, and the <b>military</b> <b>was</b> focused on internal issues. The Movimiento Todos por la Patria, a small guerrilla army led by Enrique Gorriarán Merlo, staged {{the attack on the}} Regiment of La Tablada in 1989. The army killed many of their members, and quickly defeated the uprising.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} that selective pressure, controlled by Washington, combined with diplomatic overtures, would prevail and compel Hanoi to end its aggression.

5|$|Meanwhile, in 1942 the Australian <b>military</b> <b>was</b> {{reinforced}} by units recalled from the Middle East and {{an expansion of}} the Militia and RAAF. United States military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea, and in April 1942 command of Australian and US forces in the South West Pacific was consolidated under an American commander, General Douglas MacArthur. After halting the Japanese the Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943. From 1944 the Australian <b>military</b> <b>was</b> mainly relegated to subsidiary roles in holding or mopping-up operations, but continued to conduct large-scale operations {{until the end of the}} war with a larger proportion of its forces deployed in the final months of the conflict than at any other time.|$|E

5|$|Reception was positive, with reviewers {{praising the}} {{additional}} tracks and vehicles providing replay value, but some criticised the graphics of some versions. The Mega Drive update was also well received, but some reviewers criticised it {{for being too}} similar to the original. Due to the game's success, a spin-off, Micro Machines <b>Military</b> <b>was</b> produced and released in 1996, and a sequel, Micro Machines V3, in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges wore heavy armor, such as Sugarloaf helms, {{and scale}} armor (made of iron, bronze, horn or horse hoof). They used long two-handed lances called Contus, which they wielded from horses, whom they barded. Their <b>military</b> <b>was</b> {{exclusively}} {{made up of}} cavalry.

5|$|The Mongols sought {{alliances with}} other nations and {{societies}} to ensure the flow of trade through the empire. The Mongol army was also used to reshape and streamline the flow of trade through the continent by destroying cities on the less-important or more inaccessible routes.

50|$|Who Killed the Canadian <b>Military?</b> <b>is</b> a 2004 non-fiction book by Jack Granatstein (published J.L. Granatstein), a Canadian {{historian}} and military veteran. It examines and critiques the dilapidated {{state of the}} Canadian military. It also argues that a well-funded and well-trained <b>military</b> <b>is</b> necessary, given our present international climate, and that increased <b>military</b> spending <b>is</b> necessary for Canada to survive as a nation. The book received mainly positive reviews from both the Canadian Military Journal and H-Net.|$|R

5|$|The ancient Egyptian <b>military</b> <b>was</b> {{responsible}} for defending Egypt against foreign invasion, and for maintaining Egypt's domination {{in the ancient}} Near East. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The <b>military</b> <b>was</b> {{responsible for}} maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of Buhen {{on the way to}} Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the Levant. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer Kush and parts of the Levant.|$|E

5|$|The rapid Allied {{defeat in}} the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the Japanese would invade the Australian mainland. While {{elements}} of the Imperial Japanese Navy proposed this in early 1942, it was judged to be impossible by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. This fact was not known by the Allies at the time, and the Australian <b>military</b> <b>was</b> greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion. Large numbers of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early 1942, and the Australian <b>military</b> <b>was</b> placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March.|$|E
