The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in 2002 that over 50,000 medicinal plants are used across the world.

40|$|<b>Medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> {{have been}} used world-wide for {{thousands}} of years and are widely recognized as having high healing but minor toxic side effects. The scarcity and increasing demand for <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> and their products have promoted the development of artificial cultivation of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants.</b> Currently, one of the prominent issues in medicinal cultivation systems is the unstable quality of the products. Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) affects secondary metabolism and the production of active ingredients of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> and thus influence the quality of herbal medicines. In this review, we have assembled, analyzed, and summarized the effects of AM symbioses on secondary metabolites of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants.</b> We conclude that symbiosis of AM is conducive to favorable characteristics of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants,</b> by improving the production and accumulation of important active ingredients of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> such as terpenes, phenols, and alkaloids, optimizing the composition of different active ingredients in <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> and ultimately improving the quality of herbal materials. We are convinced that the AM symbiosis will benefit the cultivation of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> and improve the total yield and quality of herbal materials.

The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence.

The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E

5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E
5|$|In modern medicine, {{around a}} quarter of the drugs {{prescribed}} to patients are derived from medicinal plants, and they are rigorously tested. In other systems of medicine, medicinal plants may constitute the majority of what are often informal attempted treatments, not tested scientifically. <b>Medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> use ranges from the mainstream, where some of the drugs used are derived from plants, to traditional medicine where plants form the bulk of the substances administered. The World Health Organization estimates, without reliable data, that some 80 percent of the world's population depends mainly on traditional medicine (including but not limited to plants); perhaps some two billion people are largely reliant on medicinal plants. The use of plant-based materials including herbal remedies and so-called nutraceuticals, foods with supposed health benefits, is increasing quickly in developed countries. This brings attendant risks of toxicity and other effects on human health, despite the safe image of herbal remedies. Herbal medicines have been in use since long before modern medicine existed; there was and often still is little or no knowledge of the pharmacological basis of their actions, if any, or of their safety. The World Health Organization formulated a policy on traditional medicine in 1991, and since then has published guidelines for them, with a series of monographs on widely used herbal medicines.|$|E
5|$|The {{tangible}} and intangible {{cultural heritage}} of Antananarivo is extensive and highly significant to regional and national populations. The city has numerous monuments, historic buildings, sites of significance and traditions related to the customs {{and history of the}} central highlands people. The city skyline is dominated by the Rova of Antananarivo, which was destroyed in a 1995 fire but are undergoing reconstruction. The nearby Andafiavaratra Palace was the home of 19th century Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony and currently contains a museum featuring historic artifacts of the Kingdom of Imerina, including items saved from the fire at the Rova. Downhill from the palaces is Andohalo square, where Merina kings and queens delivered speeches to the public. Tsimbazaza Zoo displays many of the island's unique animal species and a complete skeleton of the now-extinct elephant bird. Other historic buildings include the Ambatondrafandrana tribunal where Ranavalona I dispensed judgement, the second residence of Rainilaiarivony with its indigenous <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> garden, the recently renovated Soarano railroad station, four late 19th century memorial churches built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs, the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo, and the early 20th century pavilions of the Analakely market.

40|$|Background Although, <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> {{have been}} {{important}} for women’s health historically, the knowledge about such use during pregnancy in developing countries is limited. This is the first quantitative, ethnobotanical study on Malian women’s use of and attitudes towards the use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> during pregnancy. The aim {{of the study was}} to describe Malian women’s use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> during pregnancy according to indications and to evaluate the potentially safety of such use. The overall aim was to preserve valuable information about <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> for women’s reproductive health for the future. Methods Data was collected through structured interviews of 209 pregnant women or mothers in three health care centers in Mali. The women were interviewed about their uses of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> during pregnancy and their attitudes to such use. Nine specific <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> commonly used in Mali and treatment of eleven common ailments in pregnancy were specifically queried about. Results In total, 79. 9  % had used <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> during pregnancy. Only 17 women (8. 5  %) had received a recommendation from a traditional practitioner (TP). The most commonly used <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> were Lippia chevalieri (55. 5  %), Combretum micranthum (39. 7  %), Parkia biglobosa (12. 0  %) and Vepris heterophylla (8. 1  %). The most common reasons for use were for well-being (37. 7  %), symptoms of malaria (37. 1  %) and ”increased salt-elimination” (to reduce edema) (19. 2  %). For treatment of symptoms of malaria and urinary tract infections during pregnancy, the women’s choices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> agreed with those previously reported from interviews with TPs. Almost 30  % believed that <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> had no adverse effects for the mother. Conclusion This study showed an extensive use and knowledge of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> during pregnancy in three regions in Mali. However, exclusive use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> as treatment of malaria and urinary tract infections during pregnancy may pose a health risk for the mother and her unborn child.
