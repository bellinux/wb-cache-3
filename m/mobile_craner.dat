30|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> {{overturn}} due {{to excessive}} lifting, heavy wind, or when appropriate ground contact pressure is not secured. Such accidents {{can be prevented}} by reviewing the force conveyed from the outrigger to the ground upon lifting, {{as well as the}} soil bearing force. The stability review of <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> overturn is classified into the following stages: reviewing lifting conditions, <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> selection and reviewing ground contact stability. However, a precise review of ground contact stability requires expertise and is extremely time-consuming. Thus, this study develops automatic design algorithms for securing the ground stability of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> for easy and quick stability reviews.|$|R
30|$|Many crane {{accidents}} occur globally, {{including the}} overturn of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> in Phuket, Thailand and England (The Vertikal Press [2014]). As {{the use of}} cranes increases in South Korea, the number of overturn accidents is gradually increasing, and accidents related to <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> account for approximately 61.4 % of all crane accidents (Kim and Lee [2007]). Overturn of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> occurs due to excessive lifting, heavy wind, or when appropriate ground contact pressure is not secured. Such accidents can be minimized by reviewing the force that is conveyed from the outrigger to the ground upon lifting and the soil bearing force. The stability review of <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> overturn is classified into the following stages: reviewing lifting conditions, <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> selection, and reviewing ground contact stability. For safe operation, stage-by-stage reviews are needed.|$|R
40|$|The <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> {{simulator}} is {{a project}} sponsored by Employment and Vocational Training Administration, Council of Labor Affair, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, to build a safe device for training and licensing. This paper presents the principle and mechanism to build a high-fidelity interactive visual simulator on a cluster of PCs. The implemented <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> simulator uses the peer-to-peer architecture with the push and pull mechanism to achieve the parallelism among distributed tasks. A distributive simulation socket, called Communication Backbone(CB), is adopted to integrate the functional tasks of the <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> simulator in a PC clustering environment. With CB, tasks of the simulated <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> are executed as standalone applications and seamlessly {{communicate with each other}} through CB. Finally, the system response rate of the implemented <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> simulator achieves 16 times per second which is larger than human acceptable perception rate as suggested by the human factors studies...|$|R
30|$|The {{algorithms}} {{proposed in}} this study conduct simulations for all possible candidate cases, save the results in a database, review practical alternatives, and select the solution that minimizes cost. This is because stability {{is more important than}} economic feasibility when operating <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b> Developed processes are useful for analyzing correlations of <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> performance, ground contact and soil bearing force reinforcement designs and so forth, and for systematically selecting optimal <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b> Other studies should be conducted on stability review models of double lifting (where 2 <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> are used). Furthermore, stability review models of components such as the sling and lug required for lifting must be developed to prevent the fall of lifting objects.|$|R
30|$|Studies {{related to}} crane {{selection}} and stability review {{have been conducted}} using {{a wide range of}} methods. Reddy and Koshy developed a lifting route plan program considering the working radius and lifting capacity of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> (Reddy and Koshy [2002]). Al-Hussein et al. implemented an optimal crane selection algorithm using Visual Basic in consideration of the lifting capacity of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> (Al-Hussein et al. [2001]). However, the studies mentioned above did not consider ground conditions, including the soil bearing force. Tantisevi and Burcu ([2007]) analyzed and controlled the work space and visual/spatial movement of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> to minimize friction with other works and delays (Tantisevi and Burcu [2007]). This is useful in an effective arrangement and operation of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes,</b> but it is far from a detailed stability review. Tamate et al. analyzed outrigger loads that cause overturn of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b> They also conducted an experiment on overturn of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> as the load is delivered to the outrigger and analyzed the result; however, they did not propose the selection of stability-secured <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> and plate design algorithms like this study (Tamate et al. [2005]). Shapira et al. considered the characteristics of building projects and conducted a study in selecting whether a <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> or a tower crane is most suitable. Also, the items to consider in choosing the detailed model (building, site, safety, air, weather, etc.) were analyzed to identify the importance of each item (Shapira and Schexnayder [1999]). However, there was no stability review or selection procedure in relation to the items considered. Alkass and Osama developed a simulation program to select cranes by using tools like database management, spreadsheet application programs, graphics, and simulation (Al-Hussein et al. [1997]). Similarly, Struková and Ištvánik developed a program to select the optimal location of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> considering the lifting location, weight and building shape (Struková and Ištvánik [2011]). However, there was not enough detailed review on stability of the soil bearing force and the program was aimed at selecting cranes in consideration of lifting conditions such as the weight, height, and building shape.|$|R
30|$|Furusaka and Gray {{used the}} {{objective}} function that minimizes rental, installation, and disconnection costs to select an optimal crane, proposing {{a model that}} combines various tower cranes (Furusaka and Gray [1984]). However, their proposal was not a stability review of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b> Gray and Little suggested a process of selecting <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> and tower cranes that suit designs at the initial design phase (Gray and Little [1985]). However, there was no method of reviewing {{the stability of the}} selected cranes or of using the available crane information in the market. Ali et al. studied collision avoidance upon the double lifting of a <b>mobile</b> <b>crane,</b> and Perez et al. developed an algorithm for planning collision-free paths among polyhedral obstacles (Lozano-Pérez and Wesley [1979]). Other studies include those conducted by Maczynski and Wojciech, who developed a 3 D optimization algorithm of a rotating part to secure rigidity of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> (Maczynski and Wojciech [2003]), and Lin and Haas ([1996]), who developed a double lifting simulation program (Lin and Haas [1996]). These studies did not consider the ground contact stability of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b> Lastly, Ho et al. studied a method of reviewing the ground contact stability of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes,</b> but only main items were explained and a formula was proposed (lacking detailed review items and procedure), and no automatic model was proposed ([Ho, Seo and Kim 2007]). Thus, this study proposes detailed review items and procedure regarding ground contact stability to secure the stability of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes,</b> and develops an automatic model.|$|R

30|$|There are {{two factors}} that prevent {{engineers}} or technicians from setting detailed mobile plans. First, {{it is difficult}} and extremely time-consuming to consider the ground contact stability applied to <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b> Second, {{there is not enough}} of a systematic technique for analyzing a lot of data for stability review of candidates. There have been previous studies that investigated the selection of optimal cranes, taking into account the lifting capacity of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> and transporting routes (Reddy and Koshy [2002]; Al-Hussein et al. [2001]; Tantisevi and Burcu [2007]). However, those previous studies did not include detailed stability reviews such as the soil bearing force and ground reinforcement. Therefore, this study intends to move beyond the limits of previous studies and develop automatic design algorithms for securing the ground contact stability of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b> The algorithms proposed in this study focus on the ground stability review process of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b>|$|R

30|$|Stability {{should be}} pre-reviewed, {{and it is}} {{reasonable}} to select <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> among the candidate cranes that have completed reviews in consideration of cost or other factors. However, engineers or technicians do not set lifting plans that suit the construction conditions for stability analyses when implementing construction projects; instead, equipment is operated based on the information provided by an equipment supplier. Operation relying on such limited information and experience is the fundamental cause of crane disasters ([Ho, Han and Kim 2007]). In addition, since such an approach makes precise reviews of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> and working conditions impossible, it is difficult to select the optimal <b>mobile</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{complicated}} {{process of}} selecting cranes for construction projects {{can be divided}} roughly into two main phases: (1) a general decision {{on the type of}} <b>crane,</b> <b>mobile</b> or tower; and (2) selection of the particular model according to the required size and technical specification. Several determinants of this second phase of the selection process in a typical <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> culture were investigated through on-site interviews with representatives of major construction companies. Factors affecting <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> selection were identified, classified, and rated according to their degree of influence. The involvement in equipment planning and crane selection was characterized with regard to project stages and planning parties. The findings were analysed with a view to the changing participation level of each party throughout project life. The conclusions of the study portray a picture that is different from the common assumptions about <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> selection, with respect to both influencing factors and the process itself. The study underlines the weight of non-project-specific factors, and shows that equipment planning is not merely a one-time technical exercise executed by a planner, but rather a process carried out throughout project life by a joint effort of several parties.

40|$|Planning <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> {{operations}} and modeling workspace requirements of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> {{prior to their}} actual operations could minimize hazardous conditions and delays associated with spatial conflicts on construction sites. To model the workspace requirements and identify spatial conflicts related to crane operations, project engineers need to model and reason about spatio-temporal behaviors of cranes and coordinate them within a dynamic construction environment across time. Current tools for visualizing equipment motion in three dimensions (3 D) and across time and for identifying spatial conflicts during operations have limitations associated with their reliance on users in identifying equipment locations and to model equipment motions experientially and manually. This paper presents a visualization tool that assists project engineers in planning operations of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> accurately and efficiently. This tool builds on discrete-event simulation by automatically creating a visualization of crane {{operations and}} generating workspace requirements that geometrically represent spaces occupied by <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> during their operations. Based on the workspaces generated, it detects spatial conflicts between cranes and surrounding components {{expected to be in}} place during the time of operation and can help in determining appropriate locations for cranes to perform multiple operations with minimal relocation and without spatial conflicts...|$|R
