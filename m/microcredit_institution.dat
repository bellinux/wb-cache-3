5000|$|The {{origins of}} {{microcredit}} {{in its current}} practical incarnation {{can be linked to}} several organizations founded in Bangladesh, especially the Grameen Bank. The Grameen Bank, which is generally considered the first modern <b>microcredit</b> <b>institution,</b> was founded in 1983 by Muhammad Yunus. Yunus began the project in a small town called Jobra, using his own money to deliver small loans at low-interest rates to the rural poor. Grameen Bank was followed by organizations such as BRAC in 1972 and ASA in 1978. [...] Microcredit reached Latin America with the establishment of PRODEM in Bolivia in 1986; a bank that later transformed into the for-profit BancoSol. Microcredit quickly became a popular tool for economic development, with hundreds of institutions emerging throughout the third world. Though the Grameen Bank was formed initially as a non-profit organization dependent upon government subsidies, it later became a corporate entity and was renamed Grameen II in 2002. [...] Muhammad Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work providing microcredit services to the poor.|$|E

Hasina also ordered a fresh investigation into the activities and financial transactions of Yunus {{in his later years}} as managing director of Grameen, but people see the move as nothing more than an attempt to destroy his image. The prime minister also alleged that Yunus had received his earnings without the necessary permission from the government, including his Nobel Peace Prize earnings and the royalties from his books.On 4 October 2013, Bangladesh's cabinet has approved the draft of a new law that will give the country's central bank closer control over Grameen Bank, raising the stakes in a long-running dispute with the pioneering microlender.

It was passed by parliament on 7 November 2013, and replaced the Grameen Bank Ordinance, the law that underpinned the creation of Grameen Bank as a specialised <b>microcredit</b> <b>institution</b> in 1983.

40|$|Micro-enterprises in {{developing}} countries that receive a microcredit loan from a <b>microcredit</b> <b>institution</b> are not receiving additional non-financial services that maximize the potential for micro-enterprise sustainability and growth. Too many micro-enterprises that receive credit fail to generate significant additional employment. Microcredit institutions need policy changes to correct this problem. The uptake of growth-oriented policies needs to be widespread among microcredit institutions to ensure that clients sustain and grow their micro-enterprises. Micro-enterprises that flourish create jobs, which contribute to economic growth. To identify good practices for micro-enterprise sustainability and growth, I examine the literature and review case studies of microcredit programmes in both high-income and developing countries. These case studies are analyzed for their strengths and weaknesses. As to the latter, recommendations for improvement include offering three different training options, each bundled with a loan product: introductory training for micro-enterprise starters; comprehensive assistance for micro-enterprise expansion; and a strategic mentoring programme...|$|E

Notably studied on Graman Bank of Bangladesh as one and foremost <b>microcredit</b> <b>institution</b> that have created an impact of effectiveness of its microcredit among women in Bangladesh. Twyeafur and Hafiz (2012) conducted a study measuring beneficiaries’ attitudes towards the microcredit program among beneficiaries for more than three years. The objective is to explore beneficiaries’ attitudes towards their welfare under the microcredit program. Borrowers were asked questions about incomes, training, economic status, repayments, business skills, technical skills, social awareness and children’s education. The study indicated that a vast majority of borrowers expressed positive attitudes towards the microcredit program indicating that beneficiaries could improve their socioeconomic status through prolonged involvement, amount of loan borrowed and training provided by the program. Ullah Mazumder and Wencong (2013) conducted a study in Bangladesh and giving an overview about access to microcredit for rural poor and its impact on their poverty situation among 360 microcredit recipients. The findings reveal that positive impact was found on income, assets endowment, standard of living and poverty reduction. Utilization of credit appears to be major factor for credit recipients raising income. Kazi Tanvir et al. (2007) accessed whether the participants were benefited or not as result of intervention of the microcredit project among 330 recipients in Bangladesh under the agriculture diversification and intensification project. The result showed that year of schooling, training provided by the program, mobility of borrowers, and household size were significantly related with borrowers’ betterment as dependent variable.|$|E

[...] (A solidarity circle is a group of borrowers that provide mutual encouragement, information, and assistance in times of need, though loans remain the responsibility of individuals.)Indeed, Muhammad Yunus propagated the notion that every person has the potential to become an entrepreneur. The use of group-lending was motivated by economics of scale, as the costs associated with monitoring loans and enforcing repayment are significantly lower when credit is distributed to groups rather than individuals.

Similarly, the task of <b>microcredit</b> <b>institutions</b> in Bosnia and Herzegovina that provide financial stability to its most impoverished members is very much complicated. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore competitive advantages that microcredit industry in Bosnia and Herzegovina has by using Porter's diamond model. The demonstration of the Diamond Model is used to explain the competitive advantage that the microcredit industry has in Bosnia and Herzegovina. To analyze the competitive advantages, secondary data were used from various institutional and governmental resources. The findings reflect that the meaningful objectives were set out by <b>microcredit</b> <b>institutions</b> in the country including objectively verifiable indicators of achievements. Among peers in Kosovo and in other Balkan regions (Albania, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia), as well as peers similar in size and market outreach from Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA), the Bosnian <b>microcredit</b> <b>institutions</b> are some of the most highly leveraged. There is a clear upward trend in the median indicator for portfolio at risk between 2006 and 2008. The inflationary pressures that started at the end of 2007 in BH as well as the repercussions of the global 2008 / 2009 financial crisis have affected the repayment capacity of clients. From a policy perspective, the results suggest that in order to improve efficiency in the microcredit sector, and in the financial sector as a whole, a unified banking agency for the country must be established. Despite being hopeful for future, this doesn't seem likely to happen until the Bosnian Constitution is amended sometime in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{last five}} years have seen a huge {{increase}} in the general public 2 ̆ 7 s interest in microfinance, which provides financial services such as loans, insurance, and savings instruments to people living in poverty. At the same time, the popularity of social networking through the internet has exploded. These two worlds intersect {{in the form of}} websites that permit a U. S. individual to use PayPal or a credit card to loan small amounts of money to poor people around the world. By far the most successful of these microcredit websites was also the first such website: Kiva Microfunds, or Kiva. Although loans through Kiva are truly loans (that is, the lenders expect repayment), Kiva loans pay the individual lender no interest. The right to use money {{for a period of time}} has, of course, a real financial value, as the tax code recognizes in many places. But under current law, even though Kiva is a tax-exempt organization, lenders through Kiva receive no tax benefit for the interest they forego when they loan money interest-free through Kiva. This Article argues that the law should be changed to allow taxpayers who lend money through a microfinance organization that qualifies as tax-exempt and who receive no interest or below-market interest on those loans the option of taking a charitable deduction for that foregone interest. The Article also proposes a novel and simple method for implementing this tax benefit. The practical benefits of the deduction could be significant. Permitting a deduction for interest foregone on loans to Kiva and similar microcredit organizations will help these organizations thrive and thus, as the Nobel Committee stated about another <b>microcredit</b> <b>institution,</b> play a role as an 2 ̆ 2 important liberating force 2 ̆ 2 and a 2 ̆ 2 major part 2 ̆ 2 of eliminating poverty as we know it...|$|E
40|$|University of Minneota Ph. D. dissertation. February 2013. Major: Agricultural and Applied Economics. Advisor: Glenn Pederson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 68 pages. There is an {{increased interest in}} knowing whether the provision of nonfinancial, technical services along with microcredit has {{a positive impact on}} the performance of borrowers. The combination of these services may help poor households improve their economic performance. Yet, evidence proving this proposition is scarce and results are mixed. This lack of formal evaluation is often a consequence of these services being part of integrated approaches, making the assessment of their impact difficult to disentangle from the sole impact of microcredit. This dissertation provides evidence of joint productivity impact from microcredit and technical assistance received during 1997 - 1999 by rural household clients of a major <b>microcredit</b> <b>institution</b> in El Salvador. We find that the use of credit has positive effects on farm productivity. It is estimated that for every 1, 000 colones of additional credit received there is a 9 percent increase in the value of farm output. These results are at {{the high end of the}} range of productivity impact reported in previous studies. When technical assistance is introduced along with credit there is also a positive impact in household productivity. In addition, we find that the pattern of consumption of these two services matters. Households with repeated loans experience smaller changes in productivity than households that borrow for the first time. It is unclear why these patterns of consumption impact productivity in different ways. However, we find that credit and technical assistance contribute to productivity through different paths: increased technical efficiency, technology adoption, and economies of scale. The role of credit and technical assistance in contributing to these productivity elements is assessed through the analysis of the households' production possibility frontier. Technical efficiency improved during these years, mainly from the effect of technical assistance. In addition, we conclude that adoption of new technologies was promoted by both credit and technical assistance. There is also evidence that these households experience increasing returns to scale. Technical assistance may have contributed to the generation of these economies of scale by increasing farmers' skills. Credit may have helped farmers to expand their input use and take advantage of the economies of scale...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} of a series of planned reports on {{microcredit}} in China. In this paper we offer our view of what is preventing microcredit from developing in China and offer a list of recommendations for Chinese policy makers that wish to promote this sector. Our preliminary analysis suggests that microcredit is not developing fast in China due to a set of regulations that need to be amended, the tight economic viability of a microcredit companies, the lack of access to both domestic and international capital markets as a source of funding, and lack of true microcredit service offered by Village Banks. Our main belief is that while the various initiatives of several NGOs operating on a non-profit basis in China are laudable and successful, even within the limited scope in which they operate, a true development of microcredit in China that can make a real impact on the vast number of mid-low income residents can only occur if a double-bottom-line approach is implemented. That is both serving the social mission of helping poor people and establishing financially viable lending entities. Therefore, we propose the creation of a new more flexible type of institution, regulated by a new body, independent from the China Banking Regulatory Commission. The new <b>microcredit</b> <b>institution</b> will be allowed to receive customer deposits, will not have strict minimum capital requirement, can operate across a whole province, is tax-exempt and can accept investment from both domestic and international investors. In exchange for these relaxed rules, such a new microfinance concern (that we will call ‘Microfinance Company Plus Deposit’, or MCC+D), will have to commit to serve the low-income population, and have maximum loan size capped, so that true micro-loan products are offered. This report is aimed at Chinese policy makers, in Central and Local Governments, People’s Bank of China, China Banking Regulatory Commission, as well as existing and potential practitioners and investors who wish to gain an initial assessment of the industry. The first section of the report briefly introduces some key relevant facts; in section two, we highlight current problems and, at the end, we offer some policy recommendations. Our conclusions are the results of field visits to the Association of Rural Development of Yilong county, in Sichuan province, plus several meetings and exchange of views with many organisations, including, UNDP, PlanetFinance, Chinese Academy of Social Science, HSBC, Grameen, GTZ, Graduate School of People’s Bank of China, staff and students at Zhejiang University and London Metropolitan University...|$|E

40|$|Apresento aqui uma abordagem etnogrÃfica, de tipo interpretativo, que tem como objeto de anÃlise uma experiÃncia de economia solidÃria protagonizada pela AssociaÃÃo dos Moradores do Conjunto Palmeiras â ASMOCONP, bairro situado na periferia sul da cidade de Fortaleza â CE. O trabalho desenvolvido pela ASMOCONP tem como suporte o Banco Palmas, instituiÃÃo de microcrÃdito fundada em 1998 para fomentar no territÃrio local a formaÃÃo de uma rede solidÃria composta por produtores, prestadores de serviÃos e consumidores. Um dos sÃmbolos mais expressivos desta experiÃncia Ã uma moeda social denominada Palmas, que foi concebida para {{circular}} somente no bairro. O argumento principal desta tese configura-se no sentido de afirmar que a economia solidÃria Ã um projeto cultural e polÃtico que se encontra em processo de construÃÃo. Nesta perspectiva, o caso do sistema ASMOCONP/Banco Palmas Ã estudado como experiÃncia especÃfica em que essa construÃÃo materializa-se nos planos simbÃlico e prÃtico. HÃ, no cotidiano do espaÃo local, a mobilizaÃÃo de esforÃos para que se fortaleÃa e se amplie o ethos do pertencimento comunitÃrio, da solidariedade e reciprocidade como valores fundamentais na conduÃÃo de prÃticas econÃmicas alternativas ao ethos do capitalismo. Atividades pedagÃgicas, eventos e solenidades rituais sÃo tambÃm mobilizados com o propÃsito de assegurar legitimidade social Ãs aÃÃes realizadas e projetar a visibilidade da experiÃncia local no espaÃo mais amplo da sociedade civil. Assim, por um lado o sistema ASMOCONP/Banco Palmas atrai diversos parceiros e investimentos para os projetos que sÃo operacionalizados no Conjunto Palmeiras. Por outro lado, articula-se a redes temÃticas e de movimentos sociais, ocupando uma esfera pÃblica plural, onde elementos conceituais e prÃticos sÃo intercambiados em torno de interesses comuns. A participaÃÃo nessas redes revela que a experiÃncia local insere-se tambÃm numa dimensÃo global, em que a economia solidÃria, dentre outros temas afins, substancia-se como movimento cultural e polÃtico capaz de apontar caminhos possÃveis para a construÃÃo de uma globalizaÃÃo contra-hegemÃnica, focada na justiÃa social, econÃmica e ambiental, no empoderamento comunitÃrio e na democracia participativaI present here an ethnographic approach, of interpretative type, {{which has}} as object of analysis {{an experience of}} supportive economy {{carried out by the}} Association of the Residents of Conjunto Palmeiras - ASMOCONP, neighborhood on the southern edge of Fortaleza city - CE. The work developed by ASMOCONP is supported by Palmas Bank, a <b>microcredit</b> <b>institution</b> founded in 1998 in order to promote in the local area the formation of a supportive network consisting of manufacturers, service providers and consumers. One of the most expressive symbols of this experience is a social currency called Palmas, which was designed to operate only in the neighborhood. The main argument oh this thesis is to say that the social economy is a cultural and political project that is under construction. Accordingly, the case of ASMOCONP / Palmas Bank system is studied as a specific experience in which that construction materializes itself on the symbolic and practical plans. There is, in the daily life, in the local area, a mobilization of efforts to strengthen and to broaden the ethos of community belonging, solidarity and reciprocity as fundamental values in the conduction of alternative economic practices to the ethos of capitalism. Educational activities, events, ceremonies and rituals are also mobilized for the purpose of ensuring social legitimacy to the actions carried out and design the visibility of local experience in a broader space of civil society. Thus, on one hand the system ASMOCONP / Palmas Bank attracts several partners and investments for projects that are worked in the Conjunto Palmeiras. On the other hand, it matches itself to thematic networks and social movements, occupying a pluralistic public sphere, where conceptual and practical elements are exchanged according to common interests. The participation in these networks reveals that the local experience is also a global dimension, where the economy, among other related topics, substance itself as a cultural and political movement capable of pointing out possible paths {{for the construction of a}} non-hegemonic globalization, focused on social, economic an environmental justice, community empowerment and in a participatory democrac...|$|E
