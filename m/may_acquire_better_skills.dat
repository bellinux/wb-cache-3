40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{examined}} eye movements in reading, little is known which factors differentiate slow and fast readers. Recently, Rayner et al. (2010) reported that fast readers had a larger effective visual field than did slow readers by using the gaze-contingent window method. The fast readers they selected, however, <b>may</b> have <b>acquired</b> <b>better</b> attentional <b>skills</b> inherently or through long experience, and this visual superiority would improve reading performance. To clarify this issue, we investigated eye movements in reading while practicing speed reading. Participants (approx. 600 letters per minute in Japanese) exercised speed reading programs {{for half an hour}} per day for about 30 days. Reading performance of Japanese editorial articles was recorded every five days of training by the gaze-contingent window method. Our results showed that the size of the effective visual field did not increase {{in the same manner as}} reading speed (up to 1000 lpm). Instead, we found that saccadic length became longer and less varied. Fixation duration and the number of regressions were also reduced. These findings suggest that efficiency of comprehension at a single gaze may be the important factor for reading speed...|$|R

In contrast, during the 1990s, Denmark liberalised its job market, Sweden moved to more decentralised contracts, whereas Finnish trade unions blocked many reforms. Many professions have legally recognized industry-wide contracts that lay down common terms of employment including seniority levels, holiday entitlements, and salary levels, usually {{as part of a}} Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement. Those who favor less centralized labor market policies consider these agreements bureaucratic, inflexible, and along with tax rates, a key contributor to unemployment and distorted prices.

40|$|Marriage is a {{relation}} {{between man and}} woman to have legitimate sex and legitimate children but above these goals it is to give mutual support and contribute to mutual success. In India the impact of marriage on women can be more visible than that of men because Indian woman has to leave her parents home and move into her husband’s home after marriage.

40|$|Background: Observing {{movement}} {{quality is}} of particular importance within physiotherapy since movement quality reflects various health aspects. The ability to observe, describe, score and analyze movement quality is a skill, which requires experience and learning. Purpose: The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to explore whether students of the international, post-graduate study programme in physiotherapy, Basic Body Awareness Methodology (BBAM), improved their ability to observe, describe and score movement quality after a year of studies, using the evaluation tool Body Awareness Rating Scale – Movement Quality and Experience (BARS-MQE). Methods: Cross-sectional and longitudinal designs were used. 30 first-year students in BBAM evaluated movement quality in a video-recorded client, using BARS-MQE at the beginning (fall 2015) and after one year (fall 2016) of the BBAM study programme. A reference group of four skilled physiotherapists defined a “gold standard” of movement quality score. The curriculum of BBAM, based on conceptual, experiential and self-regulative knowledge, promoted the movement awareness learning process, and constituted the intervention in the study. Results: The investigation found less variability and more concordance in observational scores after a study period of one year. The students also scored more similar to the reference group at the second evaluation, supporting validity of their BARS-MQE scores. Conclusion: The BBAM students <b>acquired</b> <b>better</b> <b>skills</b> as a group in evaluating movement quality, in accordance with criteria of BARS-MQE, after a one year learning process...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects on}} self {{management}} of asthma of a specially prepared book and audiocassette tape with similar contents {{were observed in}} a controlled study of 177 patients with asthma in general practice. After a run in period of six months patients were randomly given the book, the tape, both the book and tape, or neither. Patients' knowledge {{of the use of}} drugs, perceptions of their disability, skill in using an inhaler, consumption of drugs, consultations with their general practitioners, morbidity (from patients' entries on diary cards), and use of the educational material were measured. Knowledge about the use of drugs was significantly increased in the groups who received the material after three months and persisted after 12 months. Patients who had been given the tape or the book and tape increased their scores of knowledge of drugs more than patients given the book alone. Patients in all groups given the material considered that their disability was reduced. There were no other significant changes. Patients given both the book and the tape preferred the book. Patients with asthma can obtain useful information from such material. The paradoxical result whereby patients learnt more from the tape but preferred the book suggests that a distinction can be made between information that patients need, which <b>may</b> be <b>acquired</b> <b>better</b> from an audiocassette, and information that they want, which <b>may</b> be <b>acquired</b> <b>better</b> from a book...|$|R
40|$|Although {{breastfeeding}} is {{the normative}} standards for infant nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge {{in the general}} population of newborns are still suboptimal. Besides many other psychological, social, economical, cultural factors, breastfeeding success is also significantly influenced by maternity practices that have the potential to foster or otherwise to hinder breastfeeding physiology during postpartum hospital stay. On their part, health professionals need to improve their knowledge on lactation, to <b>acquire</b> <b>better</b> <b>skills</b> to manage breastfeeding problems and to commit themselves to prepare evidence based clinical protocols that support breastfeeding and the use of human milk. At the Institute for Maternal and Child Health in Trieste (Italy), we have developed two surveillance protocols related to situations that commonly challenge health professionals to give their qualified advice to the breastfeeding dyad. Particularly, we have documented the feasibility of a protocol on the management of skin to skin contact between mother and his/her newborn infant. This protocol is applied in the delivery room {{in the context of the}} prevention of sudden unexpected postnatal collapse. The second protocol refers to the management of early neonatal weight loss. Finally, we believe that combining an effective promotion of breastfeeding with good clinical practice is appropriated and safe and we recognize that both the competence and the attitude of staff have an essential role in the success of the initiation of breastfeeding.   Proceedings of the 10 th International Workshop on Neonatology · Cagliari (Italy) · October 22 nd - 25 th, 2014  ·  The last ten years, the next ten years in Neonatology Guest Editors: Vassilios Fanos, Michele Mussap, Gavino Faa, Apostolos Papageorgiou </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{conducted}} an experiment {{to test the}} hypothesis that self-explanation can be supported more effectively by means of natural language dialog than by means of menu selection of explanations. The study was carried out in a school in the Pittsburgh area and involved 78 students, 42 of whom satisfied all requirements. There was some evidence that students whose self-explanations were supported by dialog <b>acquired</b> <b>better</b> problem-solving <b>skills</b> than students who selected explanations from a menu. The evidence however was not sufficient to decisively confirm the hypothesis. Lessons learned include: it is more difficult for students to produce accurate free-form explanations than we expected and it may be better to delay strict requirements on explanation quality for students early in learning. It might be valuable to increase explanation strictness gradually. Also, knowledgebased natural language understanding capabilities push on hardware capabilities and have potentially negative consequences for software useability.

The data are based on structured interviews with 149 children (67 girls (45 %) and 82 boys (55 %) from 6 to 17 years) who were attending three weeks of intensive rehabilitation at Beitostølen Healthsports Centre in Norway. The Children’s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment and Preferences for Activities of Children scales were administered {{at the start of}} their rehabilitation stays. The study reveals a quite high level of participation in physical activity and a high degree of enjoyment in participating, but the children want to be even more active than they already are. They have clear preferences for activities, and these activities are to a large extent consistent with what they actually do during their Leisure time. The children are most frequently active with family members,but they would prefer to be more active with peers.

Objective To better define the necessary knowledge to practice psychodermatology. Results 1) The first level is dermatology psychology: there is a psychotherapeutical implicit effect of the dermatological consultation with a goal that is not psychological change. This effect can be improved by <b>acquiring</b> <b>better</b> communication <b>skills</b> and information. The second level needs a possibility to change the emotional individual process and the relational context in a continuum between counselling and psychotherapy. To practice this level a complete psychotherapeutic education with some specificity is needed. This {{can be reached by}} a dermatologist also being a psychotherapist or by a team consisting of both dermatologist-psychotherapist. 2) The psychodermatological patient is characterized by alexithymia. He/she needs to be understood through the body language he/she presents. This kind of patient is coming from families where the theme of loss seems to dominate the histories and be associated with deep emotional experiences of separation anxiety. These characteristics must be known together with the different psychodermatological disorders and the mind-body interaction to handle these patients. 3) Taking all of this complexity into account, the psychodermatologist or the psychodermatological team should be able to integrate the different points and adapt attitudes to the patient's difficulty during the whole therapeutic process. 4) The evaluation of the problem should be done using psychological tools here described.

40|$|Background and Objective: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is the fourth}} {{leading cause of death}} worldwide. It overloads the healthcare system and increase healthcare expenditure. As a patient′s awareness enables him/her to <b>acquire</b> <b>better</b> self-management <b>skills,</b> it helps to reduce the severity and frequency of exacerbations, prevents hospitalizations, and improves health-related quality of life. The current study aims to assess the awareness amongst COPD patients about the disease itself and pulmonary rehabilitation. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in order to evaluate awareness through "a COPD awareness questionnaire". This was developed and validated for its content. A total of 21 questions were included in this questionnaire. These questions were divided into two domains that included {{pulmonary disease}} (1 - 12) and pulmonary rehabilitation (13 - 21). Results: Three hundred patients were recruited of which 282 were included in the study. The subject group consisted of 177 males and 105 females. The mean age of the subjects was 63. 54 ± 10. 656. Awareness in the "disease domain" was 47. 84 % and "pulmonary rehabilitation domain" was 25. 14 %. Awareness about the causes of COPD was 34. 8 %, of common symptoms was 83. 0 %, and of activities of daily living that could increase breathlessness was found to be 73. 8 %. The need to consult a physiotherapist was reported by only 26. 2 %. 81. 2 % of the subjects believed that breathing exercise could cause breathlessness; whereas, only 19. 5 % were aware of secretion removal techniques. Conclusion: The findings of the study suggest an imminent need to educate the public about the disease and the scope of pulmonary rehabilitation and its role in the management of COPD. The education of patients in this regard needs to be incorporated into standard health care practice in order to improve their self-management skills and their quality of life...|$|R

To increase productivity and alleviate poverty in rural areas, farmers {{need to have}} training to improve knowledge, attitudes and <b>skills</b> on <b>better</b> farming practices. Attending modular training might lead farmers to produce market oriented commodities. Such trainings are offered in the Farmers’ Training Centers, which are being functional at Peasant Association level throughout Ethiopia. The objectives {{of the study were}} to analyze whether modular training addresses the knowledge gap of the farmers and enable them to use the acquired knowledge; institutional linkages and positive deviances of FTCs in performance and their contributions. A total of 120 respondents were selected. Interview schedules, focused group discussions, key informant interviews, personal observations and case studies were conducted for quantitative and qualitative data collection. RAAKS tools, SWOT analysis, Likert scale and teacher-made-test tools were also employed. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistical tools like, percentage, frequencies, chi-square and t-test. The result of the study revealed that, in the study area, Fogera, 7 PAs had delivered modular trainings. Even though, the training time and season was sufficient and convenient, less participation of females and being more theoretical and lecture type of methodology of the training were the major deficiencies. But trained farmers <b>acquired</b> <b>better</b> knowledge, <b>skill,</b> and attitude significantly than untrained farmers. Actors have been identified with different intensity of linkages. Many development actors assessed as strong, medium, weak and no linkage among and between them. The study indicated that, it requires enhancing the linkage of actors and their roles involved in training system. There are actors missed to support and integrate FTCs such as, Fogera Wet-land project, GTZ, CARE, private investors, research centers and ORDA. Positive deviances of FTCs were assessed, and found that there were no as such significant deviations documented at FTC level. Case studies and key informants revealed that, there are individual smallholder farmers who could perform and emerge better than the others as positive deviants and raised their level of living that could be scaled-up.

40|$|Scooter and moped {{sales have}} {{increased}} {{at a faster}} rate than motorcycle sales over the last decade in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States. This may be particularly evident in jurisdictions where moped riding is permitted for car license holders and a motorcycle license is not required, such as in Queensland, Australia. Having historically comprised only a small proportion of powered two-wheelers (PTWs) outside of Europe and Asia, the safety of scooters and mopeds has received relatively little focused research attention. However, the recent trends in sales and crash involvement have stimulated greater interest in these PTW types. The current paper examines differences and similarities between scooters (over 50 cc), mopeds (up to 50 cc) and motorcycles in crash involvement and crash characteristics through analyses of crash and registration data from Queensland, Australia. The main findings include that moped and scooter riders are similar in terms of usage patterns, but the evidence suggests superior skills, greater experience and safer behaviour among scooter riders than moped riders. The requirement in Queensland for scooter riders but not moped riders to hold a motorcycle license, usually obtained through competency-based training and assessment, may help to explain some of this difference. Findings also suggest that scooter riders are safer than motorcycle riders in some respects, despite both being subject to the same licensing requirements which encourage participation in rider training. Safer attitudes and motivations rather than superior skills and knowledge may therefore underlie the differences between scooter and motorcycle riders. In summary, riders of larger scooters exhibit a combination of skills and behavior suggestive of safer riding than both their moped and motorcycle riding counterparts. It is reasonable to expect that mopeds and scooters will remain popular and that their usage may increase further, along with that of motorcycles. This research therefore has important practical implications regarding pathways to improved PTW safety. Future policy and planning should consider options for encouraging moped riders to <b>acquire</b> <b>better</b> riding <b>skills</b> and greater safety awareness, as apparent among scooter riders, including rider training, education and licensing. As is noted in recent literature and reflected in some contemporary rider training programs, motorcycle safety may be improved by addressing rider attitudes more comprehensively in addition to developing skills and knowledge...|$|R
40|$|In today's {{competitive}} global market, managing employees {{is becoming}} more challenging and complex. There is a great demand for an effective managerial style as employees' expectations towards work are more diversified than before, It requires managers to <b>acquire</b> <b>better</b> knowledge and <b>skills</b> in understanding employees behavior at work. As employees are the key players in an organization, they {{play a vital role}} in determining the success and the survival of the organization. Employees can accept or reject any rule, procedure and regulation in the organization. Managers should understand that when employees come to work, they are not only contributing their knowledge, skills and abilities but also their emotions, creativity and personalities. So, in appraising their performance all the above factors should be taken into consideration because they affect employees' overall performance. Furthermore, the workers who come to work do not only aim for recognition and rewards but also for status, social acceptance, and power. Thus, every employee from all hierarchies will put great concern and interest on performance appraisal issues as they influence his/her future career development in the organization. Employees have realized that the outcomes of performance appraisal affect their rewards, determine their future career and give an impact on social relationships among them. Besides, the performance appraisal acts as one of the determinant factors in work motivation, commitment and loyalty. To ensure the success of performance appraisal, a new approach in evaluating employees that is totally different from evaluating other factors of production is needed.

Consequently, ornaments may be associated with reproductive effort of both males and females. Females mated to males with larger melanin ornaments <b>may</b> <b>acquire</b> access to <b>better</b> territories or benefit from increased paternal care. Here we investigated whether the melanin-based breast-band of male and female Bar-throated Apalis Apalis thoracica is a signal of information about its bearer and is associated with male and female reproductive effort. Breast-band size was a highly variable morphometric trait in both sexes, but only in males was it associated with body mass. We then assessed whether male and female breast-band size predicted maternal and paternal investment. Egg mass increased with male breast-band size, but decreased with female breast-band size. Whether females adjust maternal hormone allocation in response to their partner's ornamentation remains a contentious issue. We found that yolk testosterone and androstenedione concentrations were not predicted by male ornamentation or body mass. Finally, males with larger breast-bands provided their mates with more food, allowing those females to spend more time incubating. Reproductive effort of both parents is therefore predicted by their own and their mate's ornamentation in Bar-throated Apalis, and thus breast-band size potentially acts as a signal of reproductive performance in both sexes. These results highlight the need for more comprehensive analyses of a relationship between melanin-based ornaments and fitness, incorporating multiple behavioural variables associated with reproductive effort...|$|R

40|$|Writing {{well and}} {{effectively}} helps our students achieve three important objectives. Firstly, it reinforces the grammatical structures, idioms and vocabulary. Second, writing provides opportunities {{for our students}} to be more adventurous with the language, to go beyond what they have learnt and to take risks {{with the effects of}} writing, And, finally, the importance of writing lies in the ability to develop language skills in terms of fluency, accuracy and appropriateness, in the communication of meanings and massages. This paper attempts to investigate a comparative study on the undergraduates' writing performance and the problems that hinder student' perception of good writings skills. As English Language is used in all the subjects taught in their degree performance, these students should acquired and also achieve some kind of satisfactory level of writing proficiency. Lectures expect them to use and write daily tasks, assignments and answer examination questions using English proficiency and effectively. In this study, the students from the Diploma Programme <b>acquired</b> <b>better</b> writings <b>skills</b> than the Matriculation students. The Diploma students performed better in all the five writing components like content, vocabulary, organization, language use and mechanics. This was because the Diploma students had more exposure in English as all the subjects were taught in English language. Therefore, the Marticulation students were slightly less proficient in their writing performance with the Diploma students. Nevertheless, the component like mechanics in writing did not contribute greatly to their writing proficiency and both groups of students scored almost the same percentage. The most significant component in writing yhat hindered their writing proficiency was language use. Both the Diploma and Matriculation students scored very low percentage in this component. Firstly, because ESL students faced more problems than the first language students as they have to acquire or consciously learn the grammar, syntatic structure, vocabulary, rhetorical structure and idioms of a new language. Secondly, composing and writing is already a difficult task for them and the acquisition of grammar and other language structures make it even more difficult. Finally, students who do not read and write well in their first language need to work harder on the new creative activity of forming ideas and thoughts in English for the readers to understand. Therefore, it is recommended that writing lectures to provide our students ample time and opportunities for them to write and form ideas clearly. Next. choosing topics for students to write with care can also nurture the development of composing abilities. It can be concluded that lectures should focus on helping students to become aware of how and why they write, and on encouraging them to write freely, fluently and well...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the {{effectiveness}} of a mobile phone based SMS game as a learning intervention for the Peer Educators of the Males having Sex with Males (MSM) groups in Kolkata, India. MSM groups are marginalised and are at higher risk of HIV/AIDS, falling under the core groups for the National AIDS Control and Prevention programmes in India. Peer to peer education for behaviour change in HIV/AIDS prevention projects is a bottom up approach to reach out to this marginalised population for HIV prevention. Training is in place for MSM peer educators but research shows gaps in their support and learning needs. This project developed a mobile game based learning tool to address the peer educators’ learning and support needs. Using a participatory research approach a multiplayer SMS based simulation game was developed, deployed and evaluated, using an existing game engine called ‘Day of the Figurines’. In an effort to enhance experience sharing and peer learning the real life experiences of the peer educators were captured and incorporated through a participatory and iterative process as scenarios of the game. A SMS game on mobile phones was chosen to be in keeping with the marginalised, secretive nature of the MSM identity of the peer educators as well as be in keeping with the mobile nature of their work. The SMS game was piloted in Nottingham and Kolkata and the final intervention was deployed and evaluated in Kolkata with a group of sixteen peer educators from MANAS Bangla, a network of community based MSM organisations in Kolkata, India. Evaluation of the game showed it to be useable, relevant to peer education, interesting and entertaining but in some cases slow, uninteresting and confusing. The game play was affected by technical faults but players still exchanged SMS messages with the game and communicated between players using the ‘chat’ feature of the game. Playing the game enabled players to <b>acquire</b> <b>better</b> communication <b>skills</b> and increased confidence, it gave them a feeling of self-efficacy and influenced their work practices. The intervention was instrumental in increasing the peer educators’ critical consciousness, it created a space to address the practical barriers faced by the peer educators by providing dialogic methods for developing knowledge, encouraging and facilitating collaboration, developing communication skills and increasing access to learning opportunities.
