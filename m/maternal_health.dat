5|$|In 2000, the United Nations created Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 {{to improve}} <b>{{maternal}}</b> <b>health.</b> Target 5A sought to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters from 1990 to 2015, using two indicators, 5.1 the MMR and 5.2 {{the proportion of}} deliveries attended by skilled health personnel (physician, nurse or midwife). Early reports indicated MDG 5 had made the least progress of all MDGs. By the target date of 2015 the MMR had only declined by 45%, from 380 to 210, most of which occurred after 2000. However this improvement occurred across all regions, but the highest MMRs were still in Africa and Asia, although South Asia witnessed the largest fall, from 530 to 190 (64%). The smallest decline {{was seen in the}} developed countries, from 26 to 16 (37%). In terms of assisted births, this proportion had risen globally from 59 to 71%. Although the numbers were similar for both developed and developing regions, there were wide variations in the latter from 52% in South Asia to 100% in East Asia. The risks of dying in pregnancy in developing countries remains fourteen times higher than in developed countries, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the MMR is highest, the risk is 175 times higher. In setting the MDG targets, skilled assisted birth was considered a key strategy, but also an indicator of access to care and closely reflect mortality rates. There are also marked differences within regions with a 31% lower rate in rural areas of developing countries (56 vs. 87%), yet there is no difference in East Asia but a 52% difference in Central Africa (32 vs. 84%). With the completion of the MDG campaign in 2015, new targets are being set for 2030 under the Sustainable Development Goals campaign. <b>Maternal</b> <b>health</b> is placed under Goal 3, Health, with the target being to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70. Amongst tools being developed to meet these targets is the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, many United Nations {{agencies}} such as the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNICEF maintain specific programs on women's health, or maternal, sexual and reproductive health. In addition the United Nations global goals address many issues related to women's health, both directly and indirectly. These include the 2000 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and their successor, the Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, following the report on progress towards the MDGs (The Millennium Development Goals Report 2015). For instance the eight MDG goals, eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing child mortality rates, improving <b>maternal</b> <b>health,</b> combating HIV/AIDS malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability, and developing a global partnership for development, all impact on women's health, as do all seventeen SDG goals, in addition to the specific SDG5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. Maternal mortality in western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, maternal mortality in the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported {{in the rest of the}} world, with the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, <b>maternal</b> <b>health</b> is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E

25|$|Countries {{and local}} governments have taken {{political}} steps in reducing maternal deaths. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute studied <b>maternal</b> <b>health</b> systems in four apparently similar countries: Rwanda, Malawi, Niger, and Uganda. In comparison to the other three countries, Rwanda has an excellent recent record of improving maternal death rates. Based on their investigation of these varying country case studies, the researchers conclude that improving <b>maternal</b> <b>health</b> depends on three key factors: 1. reviewing all maternal health-related policies frequently {{to ensure that they}} are internally coherent; 2. enforcing standards on providers of <b>maternal</b> <b>health</b> services; 3. any local solutions to problems discovered should be promoted, not discouraged.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{integration}} of <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> into {{primary health care}} has been advocated to reduce the mental health treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study reports findings of a cross-country situation analysis on <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> and services available in five LMICs, to inform the development of integrated <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> services integrated into primary health care. Methods: The situation analysis was conducted in five districts in Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa and Uganda, {{as part of the}} Programme for Improving Mental Health Care (PRIME). The analysis reports secondary data on the prevalence and impact of priority maternal mental disorders (perinatal depression, alcohol use disorders during pregnancy and puerperal psychosis), existing policies, plans and services for <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health,</b> and other relevant contextual factors, such as explanatory models for mental illness. Results: Limited data were available at the district level, although generalizable data from other sites was identified in most cases. Community and facility-based prevalences ranged widely across PRIME countries for perinatal depression (3 – 50 %) and alcohol consumption during pregnancy (5 – 51 %). <b>Maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> was included in mental health policies in South Africa, India and Ethiopia, and a mental health care plan {{was in the process of}} being implemented in South Africa. No district reported dedicated <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> services, but referrals to specialised care in psychiatric units or general hospitals were possible. No information was available on coverage for <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> care. Challenges to the provision of <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> care included; limited evidence on feasible detection and treatment strategies for maternal mental disorders, lack of mental health specialists in the public health sector, lack of prescribing guidelines for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and stigmatising attitudes among primary health care staff and the community. Conclusions: It is difficult to anticipate demand for mental health care at district level in the five countries, given the lack of evidence on the prevalence and treatment coverage of women with maternal mental disorders. Limited evidence on effective psychosocial interventions was also noted, and must be addressed for mental health programmes, such as PRIME, to implement feasible and effective services...|$|R

25|$|There are {{significant}} maternal mortality intracountry variations, especially in nations with large equality gaps in income {{and education and}} high healthcare disparities.

40|$|Using interpretive {{descriptive}} methodology, this {{qualitative research}} explores midwives' perceptions {{of mental health}} and the assessment of <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> during pregnancy. Current literature suggests that <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> problems are {{associated with an increased}} risk of morbidity and mortality, and occur more frequently during pregnancy than in the postnatal period. Purposive and theoretical sampling strategies were used to recruit participants, and five focus groups were carried out, consisting of a total of twenty-five midwives working as lead maternity carers (LMCs), who provide continuity of care to a caseload of women throughout pregnancy, labour and birth, and the postnatal period. The data was analysed using qualitative content analysis. One overarching theme that emerged was 'The disparity between needs and service provision', illuminating the significance of the absence of appropriate services {{to meet the needs of}} women with mild or moderate <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> problems such as anxiety and mild/moderate depression. As a result of this disparity, the midwives carried the weight of <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> problems that did not meet the criteria for referral to the <b>Maternal</b> Mental <b>Health</b> (MMH) service. 'Carrying the weight' is integral to all three sub-themes, which are: 'Not meeting needs', 'The anxious woman needing extra support', and 'Safeguarding women's wellbeing and welfare'. The overarching statement of the research is: 'Holding the problem: plugging the gap between women and the service'. Results revealed that the participant midwives plugged the gap between women and the service in order to safeguard the women?s wellbeing and welfare when appropriate services were not available to meet their needs. This caused some difficulties for the midwives and evidently influenced their antenatal <b>maternal</b> mental <b>health</b> assessment and screening practices...|$|R
