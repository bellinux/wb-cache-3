This study focuses on earnings management in response to mounting pressure amongst investors, policy makers and corporate governance reformists for mechanism to curb excessive opportunistic behaviour amongst corporate <b>management.</b> <b>Auditor</b> independence and auditor specialization are the epicentre of this analysis as these two factors are considered to be key determinants of earnings management. As earnings <b>management,</b> <b>auditor</b> independence and auditor specialization are unobservable, I use absolute discretionary accruals, the ratio of non-audit to total fees and auditor industry market share as respective proxies. Using 2004 data hand collected from 325 Australian publicly listed firms I find no sig-nificant association between the non-audit/total fee ratio and the magnitude of earnings man-agement. Thus, this result suggests the provision of non-audit services by the incumbent auditor does not compromise independence and, therefore, the auditor 2 ̆ 7 s ability to constrain earnings management. This study also fail to find a firm engaging an audit firm with industry specializa-tion skills has significantly lower levels of absolute discretionary accruals than a firm using the services of a non-specialist. The main findings of this study are robust to various sensitivity checks. Findings have implications for various stakeholders. For instance, there is currently ap-pears to be a preoccupation amongst corporate governance reformists and policy makers inter-nationally to curb the provision of non-audit services by the incumbent auditor to aid in such matters as the reduction in earnings management. These findings suggest this preoccupation may be misplaced and that constraining the ability of firms purchase non-audit services from the in-cumbent auditor could provide only limited benefits whilst increasing costs.

40|$|In {{the world}} – based on recent frauds in {{financial}} reporting of partial {{deregulation of the}} financial system, {{as some of the}} causes for the latest economic crisis, there is once again a growing distrust in external audit, which again yields their growing distrust of the public and investors of the entire financial system. In recent years, even before the latest economic crisis, the emphasis in overlapping the gap in the quality of financial reporting was put on developing a model of internal audit functioning. Even besides the undoubtedly positive effect resulting from developing various models of internal control, sometimes catastrophic consequences of fraud were not avoided. International standards and code of ethics represent some of the instruments for the securing of independence and objectivity of auditors and professional accountants in regards to management demands. The objective of conducted interdisciplinary research was to point out the important role of personality traits and morality in acknowledgement of ethic principles by <b>management,</b> <b>auditors</b> and professional accountants in organization of corporate financial business operation, implementation of the systems of internal control and evaluating their functionality. This paper presents the results of personality trait research, evaluated by the questionnaire “Big five plus two“ and of the morality of <b>management,</b> <b>auditors</b> and accountants from 15 companies (public, joint stock, limited liability, middle and big companies, and auditing houses).

We consider our goal important due to the increasing number of governance failures and corporate scandals affecting banking environment, which gave rise to the present financial crisis and made from corporate governance a subject of controversy. Unlike prior research studies which were focused on similar goals - to test possible influences of corporate governance on firms’ value, our paper provides a particular approach on a specific business field, the banking one that was little explored on this topic before. Moreover, our research provides a more comprehensive approach of corporate governance impact over banks’ road to success, considering not just performances reached, but also the strategies followed, ensuring by thus originality, which adds a plus value to our study. The paper proceeds as it follows. Firstly, we briefly review prior literature concerning possible relationships between main “actors” of corporate governance and firms’ value often expressed by their performance.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{association}} between the magnitude of earnings management and auditor quality. It focuses on earnings management in response to mounting pressure amongst investors, policy makers and corporate governance reformists for mechanisms to curb excessive opportunistic behavior amongst corporate <b>management.</b> <b>Auditor</b> quality is the main focus of this study analysis as this factor is considered to be a key determinant of earnings management. Design/methodology/approach – The cross-sectional modified Jones model is used to measure discretionary accruals (the proxy for earnings management). Following prior studies (Pearson and Trompeter, Craswell et al., Hogan and Jeter, DeFond et al., Ferguson and Stokes), the author uses audit firm industry specialization to proxy auditor quality. Findings – The paper presents evidence of a negative association between auditor quality and the earnings management indicator. This finding infers that the magnitude of earnings management amongst firms engaging the services of a specialist is significantly lower than firms purchasing audit services from a non-specialist auditor. In addition, this study also reveals that the magnitude of earnings management is significantly lower amongst companies engaging a Big 4 specialist audit firm relative to companies using the audit services of a Non-Big 4 specialist. Originality/value – Insights drawn from this study may be of assistance to policy makers as they consider the costs and benefits associated with varying levels of audit market concentration. The findings provide stronger support for allowing the audit market to operate in a basic laissez-faire manner without any overbearing interference by policy makers. Given industry specialization is likely to play an increasingly important role in audit value in the future, policy makers and reformists play an important role in encouraging firms to use the services of, especially, Big 4 specialist auditors.

The testing also includes an examination {{of the relationship between the}} audit firm size and the audit firm industry specialization to financial statement restatements. Findings – The study found only limited evidence to support the concept that firms with higher NAS fees are more likely to restate earnings, thereby casting doubt on the public perception that NAS impairs auditor independence and the legislative approval of Section 201 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act prohibiting external auditors from providing certain NAS to audit clients as necessary to preserve auditor independence. The study did find stronger evidence that the level of total fees paid to the audit firm is significant in the predictability of a restatement.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} association between political connections and related party transactions (RPTs). This study also investigates whether politically-connected firms use RPTs to tunnel resources and mask “true” operating performance by managing earnings. This study is motivated by conflicting views on whether political connections are beneficial or detrimental to stakeholder interests. In addition, this research investigates how political connections, in concert with RPTs, determine auditor choice in Indonesia. This auditor choice aspect {{of the study is}} motivated by the conflicting views and inconclusive findings on whether politically-connected firms will appoint reputable auditors, i. e., the Big 4 audit firms, or non-Big 4 auditors. Essay one examines the relationship between political connections and RPTs and investigates whether firms with political connections engage more or less in RPTs. It hypothesizes that politically connected firms conduct more value-destroying RPTs compared to non-politically connected firms, because they have more power and opportunities gained from their connections. The findings of essay one reveal that politically connected firms conduct more RPTs compared to non-politically connected firms. In terms of economic significance, the reported coefficient suggests that, compared to non-connected firms, politically connected firms carry out 43 % more RPTs. However, the regression results show that the significant influence of political connections applies only to RPTLOAN (RPT loans and guarantees). In order to capture the richness in political dynamism in Indonesia, a finer classification of political connections is utilized where connected firms can be classified further into government, military, and Suharto connections. Using this approach, the study reveals that only the coefficient of GCON (government connection) is positive and significant, suggesting that listed firms having political connections with the Government will conduct more RPTLOANs. The insignificant influence of Suharto and military connections occurs because, after Suharto‟s resignation, firms associated with Suharto and military personnel had difficulties in establishing a connection with the new government, and experienced loss of government contracts, distributorships, and brokerage monopolies. Essay two investigates whether politically connected firms use RPTs to tunnel resources, and to mask “true” operating performance by managing earnings. This essay argues that politically connected firms have incentives to conduct more tunnelling compared to non-politically connected firms, due to the costs of establishment and maintenance of political connections, the opportunity to seize the benefits brought by political connections, and fewer disciplinary constraints from laws and regulations. Such tunnelling activities cause the economic performance of politically connected firms to deteriorate and, as a result, they need to be concealed by conducting income-increasing earnings management. Essay two provides empirical evidence that politically connected firms use RPTs to tunnel resources, and to engage in income-increasing earnings management designed to mask tunnelling activities. Essay three investigates how political connections determine auditor choice in Indonesia. This essay proposes that, because of tunnelling incentives, firms having political connections with the government might appoint non-big four auditors in order to allow them to have less transparent financial statements and to obfuscate their tunnelling activities. On the other hand, following the collapse of the Suharto regime, privileges and benefits enjoyed by firms having connections with Suharto and the military have gone, so that they have less incentive to engage in tunnelling and financial report manipulation in order to obfuscate such tunnelling. Therefore, essay three proposes that firms having connections with Suharto and the military are more likely to hire the Big 4 auditors. The results of essay three document that politically connected firms in Indonesia tend to choose non-Big 4 auditors. When a finer classification of political connections is used the regression results show that firms having connections with the government are more inclined to choose non-Big 4 auditors, whereas those with connections to Suharto have the option to appoint Big 4 auditors. Further, essay three also proposes that since RPTs involving loans allow politically connected firms to siphon resources, there is an incentive for those firms to manipulate financial reports in order to obfuscate “true” economic performance. Thus, politically connected firms with RPT loans are more likely to choose non-Big 4 auditors. Essay three documents that RPTs have a significant influence on the appointment of auditors of politically connected firms. The tendency to appoint non-Big 4 auditors increases when firms have political affiliations with the government and carry out RPTs.
