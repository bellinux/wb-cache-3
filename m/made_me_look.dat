500|$|Following the game, Burrows accused Auger {{of having}} a {{personal}} vendetta against him for a play against the Predators the previous month that had made him look bad. After Burrows had been hit into the boards by Nashville forward Jerred Smithson during a game on December 8, 2009, Auger assessed Smithson with a five-minute major and a game misconduct. However, the league later rescinded because it was believed Burrows had embellished injury. Burrows claimed that Auger told him before the January 11 game: [...] "you <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> bad [...] so I'm {{going to get you}} back tonight." [...] He went on to tell reporters that Auger [...] "should stay out {{for the rest of the}} year making calls like that ... We just blew two points because of his officiating tonight." ...|$|E

An Italian tenor {{sent by the}} Portuguese {{ambassador}} serenades the Marschallin ("Di rigori armato"), while Ochs works out the marriage contract with the Marschallin's notary. Two Italian intriguers, Valzacchi and Annina, try to sell the Princess the latest scandal sheets, but she coldly declines. Rudely interrupting the tenor's song, Ochs tells the notary to demand a dower from Sophie's family (having confused dower with dowry). The notary attempts to explain that such is impossible under the law. Valzacchi and Annina now offer their services to Ochs. He asks whether they {{know anything about the}} Princess's [...] "maid". They don't, but they assure him that they do. Amidst all the activity, the Marschallin remarks to her hairdresser: [...] "My dear Hippolyte, today you have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> like an old woman."

The 2007 winner's single, [...] "Here I Am", was written by Lindy Robbins and Tom Leonard, who had previously written for the Backstreet Boys. Both Corby and Gauci were critical of the track, with Gauci professing confusion as the demo version had male vocals – she adapted it {{to be consistent with}} her jazz music style. While Corby felt it was [...] "not something I'd choose to release ... Yes, I'm being diplomatic. Even though this competition has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> like I'm into pop, I'm really not". On 25 November 2007, Gauci was declared the winner of Australian Idol 2007.

2500|$|Blache was {{introduced}} to the idea of painting Leah Chase by his art representative at the time Eugene C. Daymude in the summer of 2009. The 20 small oil paintings that comprised the series detailed the day-to-day activities 92-year-old Chef Leah Chase encounters from early morning prep work to greeting guests in the dining room. [...] Blache was heralded for his depiction of the culinary icon for his accuracy and delicate handling of paint, color, and texture. [...] “Asked whether she thought the rendering was accurate, Chase, 89, said the young artist had gotten it right. [...] “I told him, ‘You could have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> like Halle Berry or Lena Horne, but you made it look like me,’” she said. [...] The painting Cutting Squash was acquired for its permanent collection by the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in 2011. [...] “We are always looking for portraits of nationally prominent figures,” National Portrait Gallery chief curator Brandon Fortune said. [...] “It is a very interesting image of a woman at work, doing a very simple task, cutting squash,” [...] [...] [...] “But in some ways it transcends the everyday and becomes something of national significance.” [...] This series reinforces Blache's commitment to documenting everyday labor and showcasing these intimate processes to the public. [...] Another one of the Smithsonian Institution Museums, National Museum of African History and Culture, came calling for another painting of Chase from the Blache series in 2013 and acquired Leah Red Coat Stirring (Sketch) in 2013, making it the third painting from Blache {{to be included in the}} permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
2500|$|I am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad, king of Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I have reigned {{after my}} father. And I have built this {{sanctuary}} for Chemosh in Karchah, a sanctuary of salvation, for he saved me from all aggressors, and <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> upon all mine enemies with contempt. Omri was king of Israel, and oppressed Moab during many days, and Chemosh was angry with his aggressions. His son succeeded him, {{and he also}} said, I will oppress Moab. In my days he said, Let us go, and I will see my desire upon him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy it for ever. Now Omri took the land of Madeba, and occupied it in his day, and {{in the days of}} his son, forty years. And Chemosh had mercy on it in my time. And I built Baal-meon and made therein the ditch, and I built Kiriathaim. And the men of Gad dwelled in the country of Ataroth from ancient times, and the king of Israel fortified Ataroth. I assaulted the wall and captured it, and killed all the warriors of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and Moab, and I removed from it all the spoil, and offered it before Chemosh in Kirjath; and I placed therein the men of Siran, and the men of Mochrath. And Chemosh said to me, Go take Nebo against Israel, and I went in the night and I fought against it from the break of day till noon, and I took it: and I killed in all seven thousand men, but I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-Chemosh; and I took from it the vessels of Jehovah, and offered them before Chemosh. And the king of Israel fortified Jahaz, and occupied it, when he made war against me, and Chemosh drove him out before me, and I took from Moab two hundred men in all, and placed them in Jahaz, and took it to annex it to Dibon. I built Karchah the wall of the forest, and the wall of the Hill. I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel. I built Aroer, and I made the road across the Arnon. I took Beth-Bamoth for it was destroyed. I built Bezer for it was cut down by the armed men of Daybon, for all Daybon was now loyal; and I reigned from Bikran, which I added to my land. And I built Beth-Gamul, and Beth-Diblathaim, and Beth Baal-Meon, and I placed there the poor people of the land. And as to Horonaim, the men of Edom dwelt therein, on the descent from old. And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim, and take it. And I assaulted it, And I took it, for Chemosh restored it in my days. Wherefore I made......year...and I....|$|E
