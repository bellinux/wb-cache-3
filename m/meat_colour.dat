40|$|Abstract: The {{colouring}} agents, as food additive, {{is believed}} to be necessary for producers. Because of the toxic effects of nitrite, to replace the use of nitrite mostly natural additives. Tomato industries yield a high amount of by-products mainly tomato peel and seeds. Since tomato peel is rich in lycopene, it can be added directly in 0 %, 3 % and 6 % (w/w) in meat mixture used in beef sausage manufacture. This study is designed to investigate the chemical properties of nitrosomyoglobinand oxidation level, sensorial properties and microbiological analyses of beef sausage which have been produced by both reducing the nitrite level and adding tomato peel powder. All samples have been stored at- 18 °C for 3 months. As the level of nitrite was reduced, the oxidation level of the beef sausage was increased significantly. Addition of tomato peel decreased the level of oxidation when compared to the samples which did not contain tomato peel. According to this result it can be stated that tomato peel retards the oxidation reaction. Nitrosomyoglobin (NOMb) content of the samples was decreased along with the decreased level of nitrite. Hardness values of treated samples were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than those of control samples. According to sensorial evaluations, tomato peel improved the consumer acceptability as well. Addition of tomato peel increased the colour scores and beef sausage were found to be more aceptable by the panellists.

The sex of the pigs had no major effect on any of the <b>meat</b> <b>colour</b> measurements. Commercial pigs sired by Hampshire or Hampshire-Duroc boars had characteristics of the loin and ham associated with a paler meat (lower ultimate pH and a higher Luminosity L*) than pigs sired by Landrace, Yorkshire or Duroc boars. A Chi-square analysis of the data indicates that the meat from pigs sired by Hampshire or Hampshire-Duroc boars was more often classified within the colour standards 1 and 2, and less often classified within the colour standards 4 and 5 than the meat from pigs sired by Landrace, Yorkshire or Duroc boars. Four-way cross and especially synthetic cross pigs had a paler meat than single cross, backcross and three-way cross pigs. Overall, less than 3 % and less than 1 % of the pigs produced meat with a colour standard of 1 (extremely pale) or 5 (extremely dark), respectively. Parity number of the dam did not affect <b>meat</b> <b>colour.</b> A factor analysis and Pearson's coefficients of correlation between the <b>meat</b> <b>colour</b> characteristics indicate that taking the same measurements on both the loin and ham muscle add relatively little information on <b>meat</b> <b>colour.</b> It appears that measuring the pH, the luminosity L* and the chromaticity value a* on either the loin or the ham muscle could be sufficient for an acceptable estimation of <b>meat</b> <b>colour</b> of commercial pigs from the present study.

40|$|Abstract A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the breast meat yield and quality of featherless broilers as compared to their feathered sibs fed with varying diets under hot conditions. The experimental set up involved 200 featherless chicks and 200 feathered sibs reared under hot conditions in two rooms (average temperature from 29 - 33 °C) divided into pens by genotype and diets (standard diet and 10 %, 15 % and 20 % protein and energy reduction). Traits measured were body weight at slaughter and breast meat yield in grams while the percent breast meat yield was calculated. Quality traits measured were breast <b>meat</b> <b>colour</b> lightness (L*) and redness (a*); and the calculated were drip loss % (24 - 72 h) PM and thaw loss % (24 - 72 h) PM on 56 featherless and 39 feathered sibs. Analysis of variance was performed with SAS software using GLM procedure. Applying the truncation of lightness values: lighter than normal (L*> 53); the featherless birds had normal breast <b>meat</b> <b>colour</b> while their feathered sibs had lighter than normal (pale). The redness (a*) values of breast <b>meat</b> <b>colour</b> were significantly higher in featherless (3. 22) than in their feathered sibs (2. 54). The better meat and specifically breast meat yield in the featherless (with normal breast <b>meat</b> <b>colour)</b> as compared to those of their feathered sibs under hot conditions was associated with quality traits such as higher water holding capacity as assessed by significantly lower drip loss (1. 27 % vs 1. 83 %; P= 0. 0003) and thaw loss (2. 28 % vs 3. 35 %; P<. 0001). Thus, it is concluded that the reduction in meat yield and quality of the fast-growing normally feathered birds under hot condition, can be counteracted by the introduction of the scaleless (sc) gene for efficient production of better quality broiler meat in hot climates...|$|E

40|$|Demands for {{products}} {{of animal origin}} are increasing worldwide owing to the significant growth in the human population and changes in the health, wealth and life expectancy of people. The agricultural sector has the scientific knowledge, expertise and technology to respond to these challenges, but consumers are concerned about the methods used to meet these new challenges. They are also concerned about the environmental impact of modern technologies and intensification of production systems. Various combinations of pasture-based and intensive systems are employed to raise ruminant livestock, depending on resources and climate. The quality of animal products from production systems differs, but there are advantages and disadvantages for each. In South Africa, cattle and sheep are generally fattened for short periods to ensure efficient production and to meet market requirements. This is more easily achieved by feeding different proportions of concentrate diets, with or without feed additives and growth promotants that are approved for use in food-producing animals. Hormonal growth implants are strictly regulated for use in animal production systems. Production systems affect both the extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of carcass and meat quality of livestock. Extrinsic aspects that are affected include weight gain, age at slaughter and carcass weight. Concentrate feeding generally yields a more consistent carcass composition than pasture-fed animals, which addresses the necessity for more consistent meat quality. Intrinsic aspects of animal products that are affected include carcass composition and conformation, carcass fat content and <b>colour,</b> <b>meat</b> composition, <b>colour,</b> tenderness and flavour. Beef and lamb from pastures are darker, and carcass fat contains more yellow pigments, which may affect a consumer’s choice to purchase. The typical pasture flavour in meat is {{because of the presence of}} branched-chain fatty acids, 3 -methylindole and other oxidation products, and off-flavours are often detected. In many countries, the meat flavour of intensively fed livestock is preferred to pasture-fed animals, but certain consumers prefer the more intense pasture flavour. Pasture feeding has beneficial effects on n- 3 fatty acids, notably eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C 20 : 5 n- 3) and docasahexaenoic acid (DHA, C 22 : 6 n- 3). Beef and lamb from pasture-fed animals are generally less tender, but shelf life is better, owing to the presence of antioxidants such as vitamin E. [URL]...|$|R
500|$|The Tahiti rail was {{supposedly}} flightless, and nested on the ground. Its social behaviour is unknown. Bruner {{claimed to have}} gained information about the behaviour of the species from [...] "the few people who still remember the bird". According to Bruner, {{the call of the}} bird was described as similar to that of other rails, though it differed in ending in a high-pitched whistle. It was said to have been seen in open areas, sometimes with other rails in marshes, and in coconut plantations. Its diet appears to have consisted mainly of insects found in grass, and it occasionally fed on copra (coconut <b>meat).</b> Its broken <b>colour</b> pattern was said to make it blend well with its surroundings, and it lacked [...] "shyness".|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} dietary chromium (Cr) as Cr methionine (CrMet) on growth performance, carcass traits, pork quality, <b>meat</b> <b>colour</b> and expression of meat colour-related genes in growing-finishing pigs, 189 crossbred Duroc×(Landrace×Yorkshire) growing-finishing pigs (male, castrated, average initial BW 74. 58 ± 1. 52 kg) were selected and randomly allocated into four groups. Dietary treatments per kg of feed were as follows: 0 (CT), 0. 3 mg/kg (T 1), 0. 6 mg/kg (T 2) and 0. 9 mg/kg (T 3) Cr (in the form of CrMet; as-fed basis), and each treatment was replicated five times with 8 to 10 pigs per replicate pen. During the 28 d of the experiment, both the ADG and the ADFI increased linearly (p< 0. 05) {{as the level of}} dietary Cr increased. The F/G ratio decreased linearly (p< 0. 05). As dietary Cr increased, loin muscle areas (linear, p = 0. 013) and average backfat thickness (linear, p = 0. 072) decreased. Shear force (linear, p = 0. 070) and Commission Internationale de I’Éclairage (CIE) redness (quadratic, p = 0. 028) were increased. In addition, CIE Lightness (quadratic, p = 0. 053) were decreased as dietary Cr increased. As dietary Cr increased, total myglobin (Mb) content (quadratic, p = 0. 015) and the mb mRNA levels (quadratic, p = 0. 046) in longissimus muscles of pigs were up-regulated. In conclusion, supplementation of dietary Cr improved growth and <b>meat</b> <b>colour,</b> but increased shear force and decreased IMF reduced palatability of longissimus muscles. Moreover, the increasing total Mb content and mb mRNA levels indicated that CrMet dietary supplementation may improve <b>meat</b> <b>colour</b> via up-regulating expression of the mb gene...|$|E

40|$|Meat quality {{score and}} its {{composite}} traits of the Hungarian Large White pigs {{were analyzed using}} the national station test database {{for the period of}} 1994 - 2005. Th e distribution of the meat quality score was substantially diff erent from the normal distribution and the average score of the population was close to the possible maximum. Based on the results the traits can hardly be improved by selection. Analysing separately the composite parameters of the meat quality score (pH 1, pH 2, colour, organoleptic evaluation) the highest heritability estimates were estimated for <b>meat</b> <b>colour</b> and pH 2 (0. 38 ± 0. 01; 0. 35 ± 0. 01, respectively). Th e lowest heritability was estimated for the organoleptic evaluation (0. 15 ± 0. 01), on the other hand this composite trait showed the highest genetic correlation with the meat quality score (0. 72 ± 0. 01), which is unfavourable. Based on the results the meat quality traits should be restricted to <b>meat</b> <b>colour</b> and pH 2. Key words pig, meat quality, genetic parameters, environmental factor...|$|E
50|$|Research into {{artificial}} marbling through fat injection {{was carried}} out {{as early as the}} 1960s. A 1999 Polish study found that fat-injected horse meat tended to retain more flavour than non-injected control samples after two-week and three-month periods of cold storage. Another 2007 U.S. study by Tyson Foods and the University of Arkansas used beef strip loin and injected it with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in powder form, or oil with high concentration of CLAs. Under visual assessment by independent panelists, the USDA marbling score of the powder-treated meat increased by two levels. The powder-treated meat tended to be juicier than the oil-treated meat after cooking, but otherwise the injected <b>meat</b> had similar <b>colour</b> and flavour to the untreated meat.|$|R

2500|$|Myoglobin {{contains}} hemes, pigments {{responsible for}} the <b>colour</b> of red <b>meat.</b> The <b>colour</b> that <b>meat</b> takes is partly determined by the degree of oxidation of the myoglobin. In fresh meat the iron atom is in the ferrous (+2) oxidation state bound to an oxygen molecule (O2). Meat cooked well done is brown because the iron atom {{is now in the}} ferric (+3) oxidation state, having lost an electron. If meat has been exposed to nitrites, it will remain pink because the iron atom is bound to NO, nitric oxide (true of, e.g., corned beef or cured hams). Grilled meats can also take on a pink [...] "smoke ring" [...] that comes from the iron binding to a molecule of carbon monoxide. Raw meat packed in a carbon monoxide atmosphere also shows this same pink [...] "smoke ring" [...] due to the same principles. Notably, the surface of this raw meat also displays the pink color, which is usually associated in consumers' minds with fresh meat. This artificially induced pink color can persist, reportedly up to one year. Hormel and Cargill are both reported to use this meat-packing process, and meat treated this way has been in the consumer market since 2003.|$|R
