5|$|Although early {{computers}} such as EDSAC made successful use {{of mercury}} delay line memory, the technology had several drawbacks; it was heavy, it was expensive, {{and it did}} not allow data to be accessed randomly. In addition, because data was stored as a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a <b>mercury</b> <b>column,</b> the device's temperature had to be very carefully controlled, as the velocity of sound through a medium varies with its temperature. Williams had seen an experiment at Bell Labs demonstrating the effectiveness of cathode ray tubes (CRT) {{as an alternative to the}} delay line for removing ground echoes from radar signals. While working at the TRE, shortly before he joined the University of Manchester in December 1946, he and Tom Kilburn had developed a form of electronic memory known as the Williams or Williams–Kilburn tube based on a standard CRT, the first random-access digital storage device. The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) was designed to show that the system was a practical storage device, by testing that data held within it could be read and written at the speed necessary for use in a computer.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} {{is illustrated in}} the diagram. When reservoir G is lowered, bulb B and tube T are filled with gas from the enclosure being evacuated (through tube A). When G is raised, mercury rises in tube F and cuts off the gas in B and T at C. This gas is then forced through the mercury in tube D into the atmosphere. The end of tube D is bent upward at E to facilitate collection of gas (or vapor). By alternately raising G, a pumping action results. Clearly tubes F and D must be long enough to support <b>mercury</b> <b>columns</b> corresponding to atmospheric pressure (76 cm at sea level). Instead of using mercury to provide a valving action at C, {{it is possible to}} use a glass float valve.|$|R

A fixed voltage drop occurs at the electrodes, which also produces heat. Some of the energy in the <b>mercury</b> vapor <b>column</b> is also dissipated, but about 85% is turned into visible and ultraviolet light.|$|R
2500|$|The {{concepts}} of total pressure and dynamic pressure arise from Bernoulli's equation and are {{significant in the}} study of all fluid flows. [...] (These two pressures are not pressures in the usual sense—they cannot be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube or <b>mercury</b> <b>column.)</b> [...] To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to pressure in fluid dynamics, many authors use the term static pressure to distinguish it from total pressure and dynamic pressure. [...] Static pressure is identical to pressure and can be identified for every point in a fluid flow field.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of tube {{does not}} have {{filaments}} to start it at all. [...] Instant start fluorescent tubes simply use a high enough voltage {{to break down the}} gas and <b>mercury</b> <b>column</b> and thereby start arc conduction. These tubes can be identified by a single pin {{at each end of the}} tube. The lamp holders have a [...] "disconnect" [...] socket at the low-voltage end which disconnects the ballast when the tube is removed, to prevent electric shock. In North America, low-cost lighting fixtures with an integrated electronic ballast use instant start on lamps originally designed for preheating, although it shortens lamp life. This ballast technology isn't common outside North America.|$|E
2500|$|Design {{changes to}} make the {{instrument}} more sensitive, simpler to read, and easier to transport resulted in variations such as the basin, siphon, wheel, cistern, Fortin, multiple folded, stereometric, and balance barometers. Fitzroy barometers combine the standard mercury barometer with a thermometer, {{as well as a}} guide of how to interpret pressure changes. [...] Fortin barometers use a variable displacement mercury cistern, usually constructed with a thumbscrew pressing on a leather diaphragm bottom. [...] This compensates for displacement of mercury in the column with varying pressure. [...] To use a Fortin barometer, the level of mercury is set to the zero level before the pressure is read on the column. [...] Some models also employ a valve for closing the cistern, enabling the <b>mercury</b> <b>column</b> to be forced {{to the top of the}} column for transport. [...] This prevents water-hammer damage to the column in transit.|$|E

A quantitative {{experimental study of}} the dipole Tonks-Dattner resonance oscillations of a cylindrical plasma column has been made for neon, argon and xenon plasma columns. Discharges were operated {{in the range of}} a few mTorr and resonances have been observed in the UHF and microwave frequency range. The resonances have been studied using strip-line and waveguide techniques and diagnostic studies have been made employing Langmuir probes and microwave cavity methods. For xenon, good agreement has been found with the theory of Parker, Nickel and Gould but for neon and argon definite discrepancies exist. This departure has been attributed to ion mean free paths which are not long compared to the tube radius. The effect of ion collisions seems to be to raise the electron density near the wall of the tube causing the resonances to occur at higher frequencies than are predicted by theory for the case of long ion mean free paths. The appearance of fewer and broader resonances than are observed in <b>mercury</b> <b>columns</b> is attributed primarily to the occurrence of moving striations which produce variations of electron density of about t 50 % of the average.

2500|$|A mercury {{barometer}} has a glass tube closed {{at one end}} with an open mercury-filled reservoir at the base. [...] The weight of the mercury creates a vacuum {{in the top of}} the tube known as Torricellian vacuum. Mercury in the tube adjusts until the weight of the <b>mercury</b> <b>column</b> balances the atmospheric force exerted on the reservoir. [...] High atmospheric pressure places more force on the reservoir, forcing mercury higher in the column. [...] Low pressure allows the mercury to drop to a lower level in the column by lowering the force placed on the reservoir. Since higher temperature levels around the instrument will reduce the density of the mercury, the scale for reading the height of the mercury is adjusted to compensate for this effect. [...] The tube has to be at least as long as the amount dipping in the mercury + head space + the maximum length of the column.|$|E

Calculated waveforms of lamp voltage and current agree well with experimental ones for both operating frequencies. This technique gives us dynamic characteristics of plasma parameters, and opens a way to computer aided design of the fluorescent lamps. ...|$|R

5000|$|Torricelli's chief {{invention}} was {{the mercury}} barometer. [...] "This instrument is named from two Greek words, signifying two measures of weight, since by it {{a column of}} air is weighed against a column of mercury." [...] The barometer arose from the need to solve a practical problem. Pump makers of the Grand Duke of Tuscany attempted to raise water to a height of 12 meters or more, but found that 10 meters was the limit with a suction pump (as recounted in Galileo's Dialogue). Torricelli employed mercury, thirteen times more dense than water. In 1643 he created a tube approximately one meter long, sealed at the top, filled it with mercury, and set it vertically into a basin of <b>mercury.</b> The <b>column</b> of <b>mercury</b> fell to about 76 cm, leaving a Torricellian vacuum above. As we now know, the column's height fluctuated with changing atmospheric pressure; {{this was the first}} barometer. The discovery of the principle of the barometer has perpetuated his fame ("Torricellian tube", [...] "Torricellian vacuum"). The torr, a unit of pressure used in vacuum measurements, is named after him. [...] "12 years before Torricelli's observations, Descartes, the French philosopher, had made the same observation, although he {{does not appear to have}} turned it to any account." ...|$|R
25|$|Macroscopically, the gas {{characteristics}} measured {{are either}} {{in terms of}} the gas particles themselves (velocity, pressure, or temperature) or their surroundings (volume). For example, Robert Boyle studied pneumatic chemistry for a small portion of his career. One of his experiments related the macroscopic properties of pressure and volume of a gas. His experiment used a J-tube manometer which looks like a test tube {{in the shape of the}} letter J. Boyle trapped an inert gas in the closed end of the test tube with a <b>column</b> of <b>mercury,</b> thereby making the number of particles and the temperature constant. He observed that when the pressure was increased in the gas, by adding more <b>mercury</b> to the <b>column,</b> the trapped gas' volume decreased (this is known as an inverse relationship). Furthermore, when Boyle multiplied the pressure and volume of each observation, the product was constant. This relationship held for every gas that Boyle observed leading to the law, (PV=k), named to honor his work in this field.|$|R

However, Killen et al. (1991) have pointed out that the claim is not supported by the published observations of K or sodium as a whole. Sprague et al. (1991) have responded by further hypothesizing the existence of several other sources of gas diffusing out of the regolith, all of which are time variable. In any case, the Sprague et al. data indicate large variations in abundance, and {{it is important to understand}} the cause. With this issue in mind, the available abundance estimates for correlation with possible controlling physical parameters has ben examined.

40|$|The {{environmental}} fate of chemicals describes the {{processes by which}} chemicals move and are transformed in the environment. Environmental fate processes that should be addressed include: persistence in air, water, and soil; reactivity and degradation; migration in groundwater; removal from effluents by standard waste water treatment methods; and bioaccumulation in aquatic or terrestrial organisms. Environmental fate models {{are by no means}} compulsory for managing priority substances. Efficient source control can be done without them, i. e. by reducing emissions gradually and monitoring the environment to track changes. However the {{environmental fate}} models are proposed for use for two main reasons: (i) because the quantitative models can improve the understanding of the managed system and (ii) because the models can be used to predict long term impacts of planned actions. Furthermore the residence times of some of the priority substances may be very long (e. g. 50 years for <b>mercury</b> in water <b>column),</b> therefore only monitoring can be not enough to detect if the taken measures are enough to reach the good ecological status. The use of environmental fate models in decision making is not a new concept. They are routinely used in the framework of environmental risk assessment.

Parameters influencing the on-line digestion efficiency and the separation effect were optimized.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the space charge wave modes of {{propagation}} which are usually associated with the drifting motion of an electron beam can also propagate and carry energy in stationary electron beams or plasmas of finite transverse cross section. The properties of these modes of propagation have been studied by considering the plasma as a dielectric and solving the field equations. The effect of d. c. magnetic fields have been included, while ion motion and thermal velocities have been neglected. These modes have phase velocities which are generally {{much less than the}} velocity of light. Two distinct types of propagation are reported; the first involves charge density variation within the plasma (body wave) and the second involves a perturbation of the surface of the plasma (surface wave). Both of these types have modes which exist down to zero frequency as well as backward wave modes. The angular dependent modes can exhibit Faraday rotation. One of the potentially useful features of these modes of propagation is that of plasma diagnostics. The effect of radial charge density variation within the plasma column has been investigated and methods for experimentally determining this variation, as well as the average charge density, are suggested. The effect of collisions on wave attenuation is examined approximately. The interaction of a moving electron beam with these modes is considered, as well as the backward wave start oscillation conditions for backward wave interaction. A qualitative explanation of these modes is given in terms of an equivalent electrical circuit transmission line. Many of the features of these modes have been verified experimentally by measuring the phase velocity along a <b>mercury</b> arc discharge <b>column</b> in an axial magnetic field. ...|$|R
40|$|Human {{exposure}} to mercury {{has been shown}} to cause a number of adverse health outcomes, predominantly neurological effects. The developing fetus is most susceptible, and even low levels of exposure have been shown to produce nervous system deficits. A systems approach was used {{to address the problem of}} human {{exposure to}} mercury from the consumption of contaminated fish from local waterways. Two models were developed in order to link environmental levels of mercury with human exposure. The human exposure model characterizes the disposition of mercury in the human body and fetus. The bioaccumulation model tracks the movement of <b>mercury</b> from water <b>column</b> to fish tissue. The two models were combined in order to evaluate the outcome of potential policy scenarios. The human disposition model projects mercury concentrations in common biomarkers of exposure in response to mercury concentrations in fish. The model predicts biomarkers for fish consumption rates representing the mean, 90 th, 95 th, and 99 th percentiles of populations of interest. Water quality and basin characteristics were inputs into the bioaccumulation model and fish tissue mercury the output. Mean average prediction error for calibration sites was 26 % and 51 % for evaluation sites. Sensitive parameters influenced the system at several points and included forested and wetlands coverage, and nutrient levels. Less sensitive parameters modified the system at only one point and included the total mercury input and the portion of the basin that is developed. The two models were combined and the impacts of potential policies were analyzed. Evaluated policy scenarios included fish consumption advisories, emissions reductions, and watershed management strategies. Simulations indicated the characteristics of a basin combined with the unique pattern of intake rates of susceptible populations determine the risk associated with fish consumption from a given waterway. Each population had a unique pattern of biomarker response to changes in fish tissue mercury. Bioaccumulation efficiency, a result of basin characteristics, determined the responsiveness of a basin to reductions in loading. Management strategies that lowered bioaccumulation rates lessened ecosystem services to an unacceptable degree. Targeting systems with greater bioaccumulation efficiency for reductions in loading would provide the benefit of reduced contamination and greater services...|$|R
