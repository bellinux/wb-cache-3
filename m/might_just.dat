The book is a leather bound manuscript decorated with Rhodochrosite (A precious stone) and a silver skull. The copy does have a note by Rowling to Mr. Cunningham as follows “To Barry, the man who thought an overlong novel about a boy wizard in glasses <b>might</b> <b>just</b> sell … THANK YOU.” She has also added a note about the stone as “traditionally associated with love, balance and joy in daily life”.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{the only}} planet in the Solar System on which deserts have been identified. Despite its low surface {{atmospheric}} pressure (only 1/100 of that of the Earth), the patterns of atmospheric circulation on Mars have formed a sea of circumpolar sand more than 5 million km² (1.9million sq mi) in area, much larger than deserts on Earth. The Martian deserts principally consist of dunes {{in the form of}} half-moons in flat areas near the permanent polar ice caps in the north of the planet. The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the Martian polar regions. Examination of the surface of rocks by laser beamed from the Mars Exploration Rover have shown a surface film that resembles the desert varnish found on Earth although it <b>might</b> <b>just</b> be surface dust. The surface of Titan, a moon of Saturn, also has a desert-like surface with dune seas.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that rural communities might obtain fuel from the biochar and synfuel process, which uses agricultural waste to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel and food, instead of the normal food vs. fuel debate. As the synfuel would be used on-site, the process would be more efficient and <b>might</b> <b>just</b> provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.|$|E

25|$|Justis {{asked the}} Yonkers police for some help {{tracking}} down Berkowitz. According to Mike Novotny—a sergeant at the Yonkers Police Department—the Yonkers police {{had their own}} suspicions about Berkowitz in connection with other strange crimes in Yonkers, crimes that they saw referred to {{in one of the}} Son of Sam letters. To the shock of the NYPD, they told the New York City detective that Berkowitz <b>might</b> <b>just</b> be the Son of Sam.|$|E

But six sixes and two fours later, it looked as though West Indies <b>might</b> <b>just</b> win. Sammy had amassed 58 runs, the fifty coming up off just twenty deliveries. It was the fastest fifty ever by a West Indies player, and more importantly, it had brought West Indies within reach of victory.|$|E

25|$|The use of guns in Noten's work {{came about}} by chance. In the past Noten had felt {{uneasy about the}} large number of people in his {{neighbourhood}} that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he had quite a collection and he thought he <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.|$|E
25|$|As {{time went}} by, Bradbury tended to dismiss {{censorship}} as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually {{claimed that the}} real messages of Fahrenheit 451 were {{about the dangers of}} an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451, I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as well not have been there. This was not fiction.|$|E
25|$|Jolly {{boats were}} usually the {{smallest}} type of boat carried on ships, and were generally between 16 and 18 feet long. They were clinker-built and propelled by four or six oars. When {{not in use}} the jolly boat normally hung from davits at the stern of a ship, and could be hoisted {{into and out of}} the water. Jolly boats were used for transporting people and goods to and from shore, for carrying out inspections of the ship, or other small tasks and duties that required only a small number of people, and did not need the use of the larger boats, such as the launch or cutter. Jolly boats were carried on practically all types of warships of the Royal Navy during the age of sail, from ships of the line down to sloops and brigs. Ships of the line would carry a barge, launch, pinnace, two cutters, all of various sizes, and a jolly boat, while the brigs <b>might</b> <b>just</b> carry a jolly boat and a cutter.|$|E

25|$|And also, {{thus it is}} {{that the}} fictitious troubadour Manrico can gain his rags-to-riches background, having risen from the obscurity of a Biscayan gypsy camp to become Urgel's chief general, a knight and a master swordsman in his own right, good enough to defeat Di Luna himself in a {{personal}} duel, or win a knightly tournament: only to lose it again on the military battlefield, where the odds are perpetually against him, and he is damned as an outlaw even before the opera begins, for no deed of his own but because his master is the rebel. And yet he gets to be a heroic, popular outlaw, who <b>might</b> <b>just</b> escape with his life in return for a vow of future loyalty, if put on trial in front of the Prince himself: a chance that Luna does not want to risk, given that his rivalry with Manrico is personal as well as political. Hence the challenge to the duel over the personal rivalry, instead of calling the guards and making the arrest political, in Act 1: and hence also the decision to execute without trial in Act 4 even though Luna knows he is abusing his position. Leonora and Azucena are, of course, as fictitious as Manrico, as is the story's conceit that the former Count of Luna had not one but two sons.|$|E
25|$|No {{distinguishing}} characteristic {{is currently}} one-hundred-percent reliable. Furthermore, results gained under captive conditions cannot be transferred one-on-one {{to the situation}} in the wild, because it is not known which characteristics permanently remain under the conditions of natural selection. Biology and behaviour of dingoes and other wild dogs are generally considered to be so similar, {{that it is difficult to}} discriminate between them. Furthermore, much of the information on dingoes <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as likely apply to any other wild dog in Australia. In addition, the external characteristics of living dingoes cannot always be reliably distinguished from dingo-hybrids; since many hybrids are visually indistinguishable from “pure” dingoes (e.g. hybrids resulting from mating with Australian Cattle Dogs). Even the colour variations, which are regarded as characteristics of the “pure” dingo, can be a hindrance when identifying hybrids and other domestic dogs, when they show the same colourations. Furthermore, historical records report black dingoes but did not mention black-and-tan ones. This colouration might have been overlooked; if not than this would be another feature of hybrids. During breeding experiments with dingoes and other domestic dogs, dogs were born that could not be distinguished from dingoes based on external features but had two heat-cycles annually even down to the third and fourth generation. In the case of skull features there is the problem that they don’t discriminate between the different degrees of dingo-content in the hybrids, are less and less effective the further the hybrid is genetically away from other domestic dogs and can only be used on already dead specimen. Methods like X-ray and CAT-Scans are possible, but impractical. Also signs of dingo attacks on livestock aren’t reliable as a distinguishing characteristic, since the attack methods and the success rate possible depends the most from the experience and motivation of the attacker and the reactions of the prey.|$|E
