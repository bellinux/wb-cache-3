40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{an example of}} the {{application}} of a technique, which we call robot shaping, to designing and building learning <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots.</b> Our <b>autonomous</b> <b>robot</b> (called HAMSTER 1) is a multi-sensor mobile robot that performs the task of collecting "food" and bringing it to its "nest". Its control architecture is based on the behavioral paradigm. The behavioral modules are implemented as classifier systems and are learned by a reinforcement learning technique exploiting the Bucket Brigade and an extended version of the Genetic Algorithm. The chief features of HAMSTER are that it combines innate (i. e., prewired) and learned behaviors, and that training was carried out in a simulated environment and then transferred to the real robot.

40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Walter D. Potter) <b>Autonomous</b> <b>robot</b> design is a challenging field in artificial intelligence. It {{is not easy to}} design <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> to perform useful tasks in real environments. There are two reasons why designing a control system for an <b>autonomous</b> <b>robot</b> is a difficult task. The first reason is {{that it is difficult to}} coordinate different parts of the robot to work together and to operate as the control system requested. The second reason is that <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> interact with an environment, which means they may face unpredictable environment situations so that their control system may be misled. A novel approach using Genetic Algorithm simulation is discussed in this thesis and the results of the simulation are verified physically by real robot implementation...|$|R

The coordinates of <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> are the fundamental parameters of robot control [1]. Due {{to the absence of}} Global Positioning System signals in an indoor-like environment, the <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> need an iterative localization algorithm to provide their position information. Laser, sonar, infrared, visual sensors, or some combinations of these methods are used to locate the robots [2]. However, those technologies may fail in some harsh environments, such as a firing building which is dusty, smoky, and dark.|$|R

An example of the <b>autonomous</b> <b>robot</b> in the human safety sector is the fire fighting robot, which is the main topic of this paper. As an <b>autonomous</b> <b>robot,</b> the fire fighting robot needs a robust navigation ability to execute a given task in the shortest time interval. Wall-following algorithm {{is one of several}} navigating algorithm that simplifies this autonomous navigation problem. As a contribution, we propose two methods that could be combined to make the existing wall-following algorithm more robust. The combined wall-flowing algorithm will be compared to the original wall-following algorithm. By doing so, we could determine which method has more impact on the robotâ€™s navigation robustness. Our goal is to see which method is more effective when combined with the wall-following algorithm...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the possible limits of reactive control architectures for <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots,</b> {{in terms of}} their non-linear dynamics. This validates work [Gat 94] which has suggested that such systems can manifest chaotic dynamics in their response to unstructured environments. Our work has involved two parallel activities, the first being research and development of two B 12 robots, which use a Behaviour Synthesis Architecture, (B. S. A) for reactive control, [Barnes et al 93], while the second has been studies of this behavioural control using a dynamic simulator of the B. S. A system, [Eustace 94]. Results from the simulation are presented which appear to confirm Gat's hypothesis that <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> can display sensitivity to initial conditions, and which display a fractal structure in the system dynamics.

40|$|An <b>autonomous</b> <b>robot</b> {{need not}} be given {{all the details of}} the {{environment}} in which it is going to act: it can acquire them by direct interaction. One approach to learn by interaction is reinforcement learning, though, the robot has also to be able to autonomously categorize the input data it receives from the environment, deal with the stability-plasticity dilemma, and learn very rapidly. In this paper we present a digital artificial brain architecture capable of dealing with such problems. Furthermore, we present its use for controlling a mobile <b>autonomous</b> <b>robot</b> in an obstacle avoidance task in a real arena. Keywords.
