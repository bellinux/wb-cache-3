50|$|Section 104 would authorize {{appropriations}} of $528 {{million and}} $505 million for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, respectively, for the Intelligence Community <b>Management</b> <b>Account</b> (ICMA).

Because CBO anticipates that the bill would be enacted near the start of fiscal year 2015, we estimate that this provision would not affect spending in 2014. However, assuming the appropriation of the amount authorized for fiscal year 2015, CBO estimates that implementing section 104 would cost about $330 million in fiscal year 2015 and about $500 million over the 2015-2019 period.|$|E
50|$|Identity {{interrogation}} {{is primarily}} employed during remote, not in-person interactions, such {{as with a}} teller at a bank.

Identity interrogation is used to assist with risk <b>management,</b> <b>account</b> security, and legal and regulatory compliance during remote interactions. In addition, the technique was developed to assist in the prevention of identity fraud, or the illegal use of another person's identity to commit fraud or other criminal activities.|$|E
