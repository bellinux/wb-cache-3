Passenger information systems were updated at the same time and now use dot <b>matrix</b> <b>display</b> screens. Leicester has automated announcements, which replaced the previous manual public address system on 5 September 2011. In 2006 automatic ticket barriers were installed on all approaches to the station, these were complemented with ticket vending machines and additional FastTicket machines.|$|E
25|$|The {{color of}} {{emergency}} vehicle lighting is blue. Vehicles using flashing blue lights and siren have {{right of way}} over all other vehicles. Only designated emergency/priority vehicles may use blue lights; this includes police, fire brigade, ambulance service and a few other, smaller services such as the blood bank and some lifeguard organizations. Dutch police vehicles have an LED <b>matrix</b> <b>display,</b> which can show different texts in red lighting. Most often used are STOP POLITIE (ordering a driver to pull over and stop) or VOLGEN POLITIE (ordering driver to follow the police vehicle). Standard Dutch police cars often have the text bar incorporated in the light bar, vans and motorcycles usually have a separate sign {{on the front of}} the vehicle. On ambulances, a green beacon indicates the command vehicle when multiple units are responding to an incident - usually this is the first vehicle that arrives on the scene. Newer ambulance models also have a text display that will alternate the words ‘Ambulance’ and ‘Spoed’ (‘urgent’). When ever the vehicles are on scene (usually fire brigade vehicles and some police vans), or staying in place for an other reason, they need to switch to amber lighting to signal that they are not moving.|$|E

500|$|Most of the PowerBook100's {{internal}} components {{were based on}} its predecessor, the Macintosh Portable. It included a Motorola 68HC000 16MHz processor, had 2MB memory, no floppy disk drive, and cost approximately $2,300. An external floppy disk drive was available for $279. The dimensions of the PowerBook100 were an improvement over the Portable. It was [...] deep, [...] wide, and [...] high, compared to the Portable, which was [...] deep, [...] wide and [...] high. Another significant difference was the less expensive passive <b>matrix</b> <b>display</b> used instead of the sharper active matrix used on the Portable (and the 170). The PowerBook100 included the System 7.0.1 operating system as standard, with support for all versions up to System 7.5.5. Apple, however, released System 6.0.8L, which allowed the PowerBook100 to run System 6. It {{could also be used}} with some earlier System6 versions, although Apple did not officially support this.|$|E
