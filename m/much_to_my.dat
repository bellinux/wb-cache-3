He remarked, [...] "I have {{become involved in the}} Navy tests, <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> disgust." [...] Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was still required because, as he said, [...] "I am {{one of the few people}} left here who are experienced bomb putter-togetherers." [...] He looked forward to resuming teaching and research into biophysics and radiobiology at the University of Chicago. He began training a replacement, Alvin C. Graves, to take over his Los Alamos work.|$|E

Just as I turned round, the donkey's face was right {{by me and}} it shook its head and I stuck a punch in among it somewhere, and the donkey went down like it was shot ... <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> amazement. But not to as much amazement as the donkey handler's– [...] I've never seen a bloke sober up so quick. It was a hole in one: the donkey {{struggled}} to its feet and looked really willing to go {{up the hill and}} the donkey handler lost his laugh.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the groups next album Succour, Select remarked {{negatively}} on Quique, opining that it [...] "owed as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> Bloody Valentine as Aphex, but never believably cemented the two influences." [...] The Times commented on the album in 1994, stating that the album [...] "drew sighs of admiration from critics and the public alike." [...] and that the album was [...] "a beautiful document which has its roots in an experimentalism that began with La Monte Young and has, in recent years, been continued variously by Glenn Branca, the Swans and Spiritualised. The points of contact with any of the current crop of dance music-makers are minimal." [...] In 1999, CMJ summarized the British critics' reception to Quique, stating that the album [...] "earned Seefeel several months of adoration in the British music press and subsequent obscurity which usually follows such kudos" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{family was}} arrested during the Russian Revolution of 1917 and imprisoned first at Tsarskoye Selo and later at private residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg, Siberia. The drastic change in {{circumstances}} and the uncertainty of captivity took its toll on Tatiana {{as well as on}} the rest of her family. [...] "She pines without work," [...] wrote her fellow nurse Valentina Chebotareva after receiving a letter from Tatiana on 16 April 1917. [...] "It is strange to sit in the morning at home, to be in good health and not to go to the change of bandages!" [...] Tatiana wrote Chebotareva. Tatiana, apparently trying to advocate for her mother, asked her friend Margarita Khitrovo in a letter on 8 May 1917 why their fellow nurses did not write to Tsarina Alexandra directly. Chebotareva wrote in her journal that, while she pitied the family, she could not write directly to the Tsarina because she blamed her for the Revolution. [...] "If anyone wishes to write us, let them write directly," [...] Tatiana wrote to [...] "my dear dove" [...] Chebotareva on 9 December 1917, after expressing concern for fellow nurses and a patient they had once treated together. Chebotareva's son, Gregory P. Tschebotarioff, noted the grand duchess's [...] "firm, energetic handwriting" [...] and how the letter [...] "reflected the nature which endeared her so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mother." ...|$|E
500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going to}} be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E

2500|$|Keeping {{called his}} {{completed}} illustrations for The God Beneath the Sea [...] "a {{set of drawings}} <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> disgust not all awfully good." [...] He saw them as violent and cruel illustrations of violent and cruel people, and attempted to visually project this by taking [...] "a symbolic line, so {{if you look at}} them you will find there's a symbolic overtone in them." [...] At the time of the book's publication, Keeping was looking forward to working with the authors on the sequel The Golden Shadow, as he hoped [...] "to redeem some of the mistakes of the first one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams married four times. She met {{her first}} husband Leonard Kovner while {{attending}} Los Angeles City College. She later wrote in her autobiography The Million Dollar Mermaid that [...] "he was smart, handsome, dependable...and dull. I respected his intelligence, and his dedication to a future career in medicine. He loved me, or so he said, and even asked me to marry him." [...] They were married in the San Francisco suburb of Los Altos on June 27, 1940. On their split she said [...] "I found, <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> relief, that all I needed for my emotional and personal security was my own resolve and determination. I didn't need a marriage and a ring. I had come to realize all too quickly that Leonard Kovner {{was not a man}} I could ever really love." [...] They divorced on September 12, 1944.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{box office}} success for The Lady Eve and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, {{conflict}} with Paramount's studio bosses increased. In particular, executive producer Buddy DeSylva never really trusted his star writer-director and was wary (and arguably jealous) of the independence Sturges enjoyed on his projects. One {{of the sources of}} conflict was that Sturges liked to reuse many of the same character actors in his films, thus creating what amounted to a regular troupe he could call upon within the studio system. [...] Paramount feared that the audience would tire of repeatedly seeing the same faces in Sturges productions. But the director was adamant, stating, [...] "hese little players who had contributed so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> first hits had a moral right to work in my subsequent pictures." [...] The way Sturges wrote and directed these actors created a succession of what film critic Andrew Sarris later called [...] "self-expressive cameos of aggressive individualism."> ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1971, Cameron took a {{leave of}} absence from UNB and moved to D'Escousse, a village on Isle Madame, a small island off the southeastern coast of Cape Breton. He wanted to write, he missed the sea and his first {{marriage}} had ended. He arrived in Cape Breton, a divorced father of three sons and a daughter. As he told a journalist 20 years later, [...] "Dr. Donald Cameron left his university office, drove to the village of D'Escousse, stepped into a phone booth and emerged as the award-winning author and playwright Silver Donald Cameron." [...] (He added the name [...] "Silver" [...] to set himself apart from the multitudes of other Camerons. Folk-singer Tom Gallant suggested the name because Cameron's head of prematurely grey hair was his most striking feature.) Cameron settled in D'Escousse after buying a house he describes as [...] "composed of two tiny ancient buildings pushed together to make one comfortable home." [...] He adds that the house was [...] "spang on the roadside, the floor plan was awkward, and it was half-renovated in a style not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> taste. But it felt right: a serene and happy little house where generations had loved and laughed and wept and died." ...|$|E
