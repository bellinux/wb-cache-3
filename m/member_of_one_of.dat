5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the five playable races {{was born out of}} a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as he saw an inherent contradiction in the idea of a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E

40|$|THIS PAPER DRAWS on John Fisher’s {{formative}} {{definition of}} spiritual health as comprising good relationships within four domains (the personal, the communal, {{the environmental and}} the transcendental) and uses the operationalization of these constructs proposed by Francis and Robbins (2005). Comparisons are made between the responses of five groups of 13 - to 15 -year-olds who report weekly church attendance: 1, 549 Anglicans, 1, 458 Roman Catholics, 830 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Free Churches, 212 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Pentecostal churches, and 212 Jehovah’s Witnesses. The data demonstrate significant variations in the levels of spiritual health reported by weekly churchgoers according to denominational affiliation. The conclusion is drawn that denominational affiliation {{needs to be taken}} into account alongside frequency of church attendance in constructing a view of the relationship between Christian practice and spiritual health during the adolescent years...|$|R
