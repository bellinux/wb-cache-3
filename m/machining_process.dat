5|$|Broaching is a <b>machining</b> <b>process</b> {{that uses}} a toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the {{workpiece}} to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual <b>machining</b> <b>process</b> because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
25|$|Single-pass bore {{finishing}} is a <b>machining</b> <b>process</b> {{similar to}} honing {{to finish a}} , except the tool only takes a single pass. The process was originally developed to improve bore quality in cast iron workpieces.|$|E
50|$|Machining vibrations, {{also called}} chatter, {{correspond}} to the relative movement between the workpiece and the cutting tool. The vibrations result in waves on the machined surface. This affects typical <b>machining</b> <b>processes,</b> such as turning, milling and drilling, and atypical <b>machining</b> <b>processes,</b> such as grinding.|$|R
50|$|The most {{sophisticated}} recent machines may also add facilities for forming and bending, {{as well as}} punch cutting. Although unlikely to replace a press brake for box making, the ability to form even small lugs may turn a two <b>machine</b> <b>process</b> into a one <b>machine</b> <b>process,</b> reducing materials handling time.|$|R

25|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} operation used to cut keyways into shafts. Electron beam machining (EBM) is a <b>machining</b> <b>process</b> where high-velocity electrons are directed toward a work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. Ultrasonic machining uses ultrasonic vibrations to machine very hard or brittle materials.|$|E
25|$|Gashing is a <b>machining</b> <b>process</b> used {{to rough}} out coarse pitched gears and sprockets. It is {{commonly}} used on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|E
25|$|Hobbing is a <b>machining</b> <b>process</b> for gear cutting, cutting splines, {{and cutting}} {{sprockets}} on a hobbing machine, {{which is a}} special type of milling machine. The teeth or splines are progressively cut into the workpiece {{by a series of}} cuts made by a cutting tool called a hob. Compared to other gear forming processes it is relatively inexpensive but still quite accurate, thus it is used for a broad range of parts and quantities.|$|E

25|$|Machinability can be {{difficult}} to predict because machining has so many variables. Two sets of factors are the condition of work materials and the physical properties of work materials. The condition of the work material includes eight factors: microstructure, grain size, heat treatment, chemical composition, fabrication, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength. Physical properties are those of the individual material groups, such as the modulus of elasticity, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and work hardening. Other important factors are operating conditions, cutting tool material and geometry, and the <b>machining</b> <b>process</b> parameters.|$|E
25|$|Discs {{are usually}} damaged {{in one of}} four ways: scarring, cracking, warping or {{excessive}} rusting. Service shops will sometimes respond to any disc problem by changing out the discs entirely, This is done mainly where {{the cost of a}} new disc may actually be lower than the cost of labour to resurface the old disc. Mechanically this is unnecessary unless the discs have reached manufacturer's minimum recommended thickness, which would make it unsafe to use them, or vane rusting is severe (ventilated discs only). Most leading vehicle manufacturers recommend brake disc skimming (US: turning) as a solution for lateral run-out, vibration issues and brake noises. The <b>machining</b> <b>process</b> is performed in a brake lathe, which removes a very thin layer off the disc surface to clean off minor damage and restore uniform thickness. Machining the disc as necessary will maximise the mileage out of the current discs on the vehicle.|$|E
500|$|The {{precision}} {{applications in}} which mechanical filters are used {{require that the}} resonators are accurately adjusted to the specified resonance frequency. [...] This is known as trimming and usually involves a mechanical <b>machining</b> <b>process.</b> [...] In most filter designs, this {{can be difficult to}} do once the resonators have been assembled into the complete filter so the resonators are trimmed before assembly. [...] Trimming is done in at least two stages; coarse and fine, with each stage bringing the resonance frequency closer to the specified value. [...] Most trimming methods involve removing material from the resonator which will increase the resonance frequency. [...] The target frequency for a coarse trimming stage consequently needs to be set below the final frequency since the tolerances of the process could otherwise result in a frequency higher than the following fine trimming stage could adjust for.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to address the urgent {{industrial}} need for energy efficient Computer Numerical Control machining systems by developing effective empirical energy consumption models and optimisation approaches for energy efficient <b>machining</b> <b>processes.</b> In the thesis, a comprehensive literature survey has been conducted to identify industrial needs, the state-of-the-art energy consumption modelling and optimisation methods. Related research has been analysed and benchmarked. Based on the survey, research gaps have been identified. To develop effective energy consumption models is {{an essential step to}} achieve sustainable <b>machining</b> <b>processes.</b> Based on literature survey, it is recognised that {{there is a lack of}} models suitable for various types of <b>machining</b> <b>processes,</b> in particular, milling processes. In this thesis, based on Main Effect and Interaction Plots techniques, qualitative analysis has been made to establish relationships between critical machining parameters (including spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and width of cut) and the energy required for machining. Effective energy consumption models that can be configurable for various <b>machining</b> <b>processes</b> have been developed. Two different model structures are proposed according to the model selection criteria used. Application of sensible optimisation methods will be imperative for implementing energy efficient <b>machining</b> <b>processes.</b> In this thesis, based on the energy consumption models, two optimisation methods have been developed to identify optimal machining parameters to achieve the minimum energy consumption during <b>machining</b> <b>processes.</b> It is concluded that new and effective models and optimisation methods have been developed in the thesis.

2500|$|... 3D printing, {{also known}} as {{additive}} manufacturing (AM), refers to processes {{used to create a}} three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object.
