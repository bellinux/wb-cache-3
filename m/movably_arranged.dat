The laser beam is directed on reflecting elements (4, 6) gradually or in a predefinable order. The reflecting element is arranged and/or aligned so that the reflected laser beam reaches {{on the surface of}} the target at different positions. An orifice plate (1) is arranged between a window element (9) and the target. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The optical {{arrangement for}} forming coatings on a substrate by a plasma formation within a vacuum chamber, comprises a pulsed laser beam (5) directed for the ignition of electrical arc discharges on a surface of a cylindrical target (10), which rotates around a rotation axis. The laser beam is directed on reflecting elements (4, 6) gradually or in a predefinable order. The reflecting element is arranged and/or aligned so that the reflected laser beam reaches {{on the surface of the}} target at different positions. An orifice plate (1) is arranged between a window element (9) and the target within the vacuum chamber and is equipped with openings in the actual planes, through which the pulsed laser beam is directed on the target and the orifice plate is synchronously movable relative to the target with the arrangement. The laser beam reflected from the reflecting element is directed to a plane focused on the surface of the target by an optical element (3) arranged in the plane. The arrangement with the reflecting element and the surface of the target are oscillatingly movable relative to each other between two charge-over points along an axis or in two axes standing vertical to each other and parallel to the surface of the target. The arrangement is arranged outside of the vacuum chamber. The openings at the orifice plate are formed as inner hollow element in channel-form. Two orifice plates are provided, which are directed parallel to each other and arranged in a distance one after another in relation to the reflected laser beam. The reflecting element in the optical planes is arranged in a plane vertical to a swivel axis of a tiltable reflecting element. The pulsed laser beam reaches gradually or with the predefinable order on the reflecting element of the individual optical plane by the tiltable reflecting element. The reflecting element is arranged radially outside to a cylindrical carrier rotating parallel to the rotation axis of the target. The cylindrical carrier is present in the respective planes and in the movable arrangement. The release of the laser impulses is synchronized with the position of the reflecting elements <b>movably</b> <b>arranged</b> to each other. The laser beam hits the reflecting element directed parallel to the rotation axis of the carrier. The laser beam is directed by different reflecting elements rotating around an axis. The laser beam is directed by through-openings during the rotation of the reflecting elements, which are fixedly arranged beneath by through-openings on plate-shaped elements, and the rotation of the reflecting element on the target fixedly arranged in the planes. The through-openings are formed as carrier in the plate-shaped elements. The rotation axis of the reflecting element is directed parallel to the rotation axis of the cylindrical shaped target. The two reflecting elements are arranged on the plate-shaped elements. The reflecting element is arranged in relation to through-openings in the optical axis of the rotary laser beam. A further reflecting element is present on each plate-shaped elements. The rotary reflecting elements are fastened to another carrier. The positions, at which the laser beam hits the surface of the target, have same distances. During the relative motion of arrangement with reflecting elements and target, a path, which put back between the charge-over points, is so large as the distance of the adjacent positions. The reflecting elements are concavely curved, so that the laser beam is focused in the direction of the target. USE - Optical arrangement for forming coatings on a substrate by a plasma formation within a vacuum chamber. ADVANTAGE - The optical arrangement is capable of economically, uniformly and effectively forming the coatings on the substrate surfaces with less maintenance cost in less-time consuming manner, and completely avoids an undesirable coating of window element in the interior of vacuum chamber...|$|E
