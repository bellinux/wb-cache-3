The {{players in this}} market use all their ingenuity {{in order to find}} competitive advantage wherever possible. Part of this competitive advantage comes from close interaction with their suppliers: of passive components, mechanics, control electronics and, of course, IGBT modules. When searching for competitive advantage the IGBT can be decisive, because a number of its characteristics define the critical parameters for the system design.

40|$|Abstract: Following fast on the {{successful}} market {{introduction of the}} 1200 V Soft-Punch-Through (SPT) IGBT range, ABB Semiconductors introduces the 1700 V SPT IGBT line-up. In this paper, we demonstrate that the new 1700 V SPT IGBT achieves the same desirable characteristics as {{the successful}} 1200 V SPT generation. The results presented here show that despite the low on-state and switching losses of 1700 V SPT IGBT, high levels of short circuit withstand capability and switching ruggedness have been realized. In addition, the unique Soft-Punch-Through structure achieves low levels of EMI. In parallel to the 1700 V SPT IGBT, a new fast and soft recovery 1700 V diode has been developed with very low reverse recovery losses and high ruggedness under all operating conditions. Both the 1700 V IGBT and diode exhibit positive temperature coefficients for the forward voltage drop at nominal currents, making them ideally suited for safe parallel operation in high current modules.

40|$|It is {{a widely}} held view that {{companies}} exist to make money, and that attempts to encourage, legislate or tax them into better environmental performance will be met with little enthusiasm if such actions “cost money”. In this paper we describe a postgraduate module which we have offered for over 20 years with strong links to local industry. Students attending the <b>module</b> <b>range</b> from industrially based students with considerable environmental experience to new graduates {{from a variety of}} disciplines. The module assignment is key to this paper. It provides a challenge to all students and reveals a possible mechanism to promote companies to engage in a carefully orchestrated and economically viable environmental strategy. Each student is allocated an individual company with basic company details. All of the companies are based on real SME s (small to medium enterprises). After conducting an environmental audit the student has to develop an environmental improvement strategy for the subsequent three years. In acknowledging the lack of commitment to the environment shown by most UK companies the assignment brief does not permit any new funding for environmental improvements: rather the student must make savings in the first year by judicious application of “no cost” or “low cost” measures. Any savings can be deposited into an environmental fund, which can be used to support more extensive and expensive improvements in the later years. This paper will present a typical student financial flow sheet which clearly illustrates that this approach can yield substantial economic returns {{while at the same time}} contributing to improved environmental performance.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{or partial}} deployment of liquid samples in low gravity is primarily {{influenced by the}} interfacial properties of the specific liquid and solid materials used because the overwhelming bias of the Earth gravitational acceleration is removed. This study addresses the engineering aspects of injecting and deploying drops of prescribed volume into an acoustic positioning chamber in microgravity. The specific problems of interest are the design, testing, and implementation of injector tips {{to be used in}} a simultaneously retracting dual-injector system in the Drop Physics Module microgravity experiment facility. Prior to release, the liquid to be deployed must be retained within a restricted area {{at the very end of}} the injectors under dynamic stimuli from the continuous injection flow as well as from the stepped motion of the injectors. The final released drop must have a well determined volume and negligible residual linear or angular momentum. The outcome of Earth-based short-duration low gravity experiments had been the selection of two types of injector tips which were flown as back-up parts. They were successfully utilized during the USML- 1 Spacelab mission as the primary tips. The combination of a larger contact surface, liquid pinning with a sharp edge, and selective coating of strategic tip surfaces with a non-wetting compound has allowed a significant increase in the success rate of deployment of simple and compound drops of aqueous solutions of glycerol and silicone oil. The diameter of the samples studied in the Drop Physics <b>Module</b> <b>range</b> between 0. 3 and 2. 7 cm.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of an asynchronous (i. e. independently firing) interplanetary laser transponder, capable of ranging between Earth and Mars {{and using the}} automated SLR 2000 Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) system as an Earth base station, has been suggested. Since that time, we have received {{a small amount of}} discretionary funding to further explore the transponder concept and to develop and test an engineering breadboard. Candidate operational scenarios for acquiring and tracking the opposite laser terminal over interplanetary distances have been developed, and breadboard engineering parameters were chosen to reflect the requirements of an Earth-Mars link Laboratory tests have been devised to simulate the Earth- Mars link between two independent SLR 2000 transceivers and to demonstrate the transfer of range and time in single photon mode. The present paper reviews the concept of the asynchronous microlaser transponder, the transponder breadboard design, an operational scenario recently developed for an asteroid rendezvous, and the laboratory test setup. The optical head of the transponder breadboard fits within a cylinder roughly 15 cm in diameter and 32 cm in length and is mounted in a commercial two axis gimbal driven by two computer-controlled stepper motors which allows the receiver optical axis to be centered on a simulated Earth image. The optical head is built around a small optical bench which supports a 14. 7 cm diameter refractive telescope, a prototype 2 kHz SLR 2000 microlaser transmitter, a quadrant microchannel plate photomultiplier (MCP/PMT), a CCD array camera, spatial and spectral filters, assorted lenses and mirrors, and protective covers and sun shields. The microlaser is end-pumped by a fiber-coupled diode laser array. An annular mirror is employed as a passive transmit/receive (T/R) switch in an aperture-sharing arrangement wherein the transmitted beam passes through the central hole and illuminates only the central 2. 5 cm of the common telescope (adequate to achieve a 10 arcsecond full laser beam divergence) while the receiver uses the remainder of the 14. 7 cm aperture. Additional electronic instrumentation includes the diode pump array and associated heat sink and current drivers, rubidium frequency standard, timing distribution <b>module,</b> <b>range</b> gate generator, a recently developed all-digital correlation range receiver, and system computer. Acquisition of the opposite transponder terminal requires a search within a three-dimensional volume determined by the initial pointing uncertainty and a maximum 500 microsecond uncertainty in the laser time of fire at the opposite terminal for totally uncorrelated Earth and spacecraft clocks. The angular search is aided by a sensitive CCD array capable of imaging the Earth, Moon, and surrounding stars within the nominal + 0. 5 degree cone of uncertainty associated with the initial pointing of a spacecraft body or microwave communications dish...|$|E
