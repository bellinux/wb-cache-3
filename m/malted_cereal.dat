50|$|Beer is {{produced}} through steeping a sugar source (commonly <b>malted</b> <b>cereal</b> grains) {{in water and}} then fermenting with yeast. Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archeological evidence suggests that this technique was used in ancient Egypt. Descriptions of various beer recipes {{can be found in}} Sumerian writings, some of the oldest known writing of any sort. Brewing is done in a brewery by a brewer, and the brewing industry is part of most western economies.|$|E
50|$|Beer is an {{alcoholic}} drink {{produced by the}} saccharification of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from <b>malted</b> <b>cereal</b> grains, most commonly malted barley and malted wheat. Most beer is also flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The preparation of beer is called brewing. Beer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic drink, and is the third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea. It is thought {{by some to be}} the oldest fermented drink.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{demonstrate}} the market potential for a proposed micro-malt house in eastern Washington State {{through the development of}} a business plan. This plan looks at the history of the malted products industry, specifically barley. The industry is examined from a world, or macro view, down to a local (Tri-cities, WA) or micro view. The plan explains why there is currently a shift away from mass produced malted products in favor of a locally sourced <b>malted</b> <b>cereal</b> grain and how this shift can be capitalized on my aspiring maltsters and business owners. This plan includes all of the elements traditionally found in a modern business plan including startup costs, web plan summary, proposed product line, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis of competitors and of the proposed business, management and ownership summaries, exit strategy, and perhaps most importantly, a full 5 year pro forma financial analysis. The researcher chose Tri-cities Washington (Richland, Pasco, and Kennewick) based on an existing relationship with a farmer local to that area. The farmer approached the researcher in the fall of 2013 and asked to partner in the research and development of the business plan. Should the business plan prove viable, it may be implemented to create the proposed micro-malt house as early as the spring of 2015...|$|E

40|$|Lactobacillus sakei 5, {{isolated}} from malted barley, produces three bacteriocins. Genetic and functional {{analysis of the}} purified bacteriocins showed that this strain produces a plasmid-encoded bacteriocin that is identical to sakacin P, {{as well as two}} novel, chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, which were designated sakacin T and sakacin X. The structural genes specifying sakacin T and sakacin X are part of the sakacin TX locus, which consists of two adjacent but divergently oriented gene clusters. The first gene cluster includes stxP, stxR, stxK, and stxT, which, based on functional and comparative sequence analysis, are believed to encode an inducing peptide and proteins involved in regulation and secretion of these bacteriocins. The second gene cluster includes the structural and immunity genes for sakacin T, a class IIb two-peptide bacteriocin composed of SakT and SakT, and sakacin X, a class IIa bacteriocin. Interestingly, a so-called transport accessory protein was absent from the locus, and based on our results it appears that a dedicated accessory protein is not required for processing and transport of sakacin T and sakacin X. <b>Malted</b> <b>cereals</b> contain high numbers of various microorgan-isms representing a wide range of bacteria, yeast, and fungal species (48).

They contain anti-nutrients which are the major phytochemicals which negatively affects their nutritive values. The phytochemicals of concern include tannins and phytates, which interfere with mineral absorption, palatability and protein digestibility. Malting and fermentation treatments were applied to reduce the anti-nutrients, improve protein digestibility, and acidity to increase the products shelf life. The effects of malting and fermentation on the cereals nutritive value and anti-nutrient reduction were studied and evaluated for a period of 8 days.

However, the detailed effects of malting on sorghum grain anthocyanins, a major class of phenolics that influence the taste and colour of sorghum-based foods, requires further investigation. Eight commercial sorghum hybrids harvested from three regions in eastern Australia were malted and analysed for colour, tannin content, total phenolic content (TPC), flavan- 4 -ols, total flavonoids, total anthocyanins and 3 -deoxyanthocyanins. Grains of all the sorghums were found to be tannin-free. Malting decreased the TPC of all samples.
