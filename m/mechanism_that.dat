40|$|In {{modelling}} {{competition among}} mechanism designers, {{it is necessary}} to specify the set of feasible mechanisms. These specifications are often borrowed from the optimal mechanism design literature and exclude <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> are natural in a competitive environment; for example, <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> depend on the mechanisms chosen by competitors. This paper constructs a set of <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> is universal in that any specific model of the feasible set can be embedded in it. An equilibrium for a specific model is robust if and only if it is an equilibrium also for the universal set of mechanisms. A key to the construction is a language for describing <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> is not tied to any preconceived notions of the nature of competition. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of human cooperation {{continues to be}} one of the biggest puzzles for scientists. Structured interactions and clustering of cooperators are recognized <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> help the dissemination of cooperative behavior. We analyze two dynamic micro structural <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> may contribute to the evolution of cooperation. We concentrate on two <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> have empirical justification: triadic closure and triadic balance. We study their relative efficiency under different parametric conditions, assuming that the structure of interactions itself might change endogenously as a result of previous encounters...|$|R

5|$|The {{underlying}} <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> causes {{differential rotation}} is turbulent convection inside a star. Convective motion carries energy {{toward the surface}} through the mass movement of plasma. This mass of plasma carries {{a portion of the}} angular velocity of the star. When turbulence occurs through shear and rotation, the angular momentum can become redistributed to different latitudes through meridional flow.|$|E
5|$|Corder's {{skeleton}} was put {{on display}} in a glass case in the West Suffolk Hospital, and apparently was rigged with a <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> made its arm point to the collection box when approached. Eventually, the skull was removed by Dr John Kilner, who wanted to add it to his extensive collection of Red Barn memorabilia. After a series of unfortunate events, he became convinced that the skull was cursed and handed it on to a friend named Hopkins. Further disasters plagued both men, and they finally paid for the skull {{to be given a}} Christian burial in an attempt to lift the supposed curse.|$|E
5|$|Currently Umbriel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its eccentricity would have been damped, turning off the heat source.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E
5|$|In {{less than}} a year, {{extensions}} to the Gell-Mann–Zweig model were proposed. Sheldon Lee Glashow and James Bjorken predicted {{the existence of a}} fourth flavor of quark, which they called charm. The addition was proposed because it allowed for a better description of the weak interaction (the <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> allows quarks to decay), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known leptons, and implied a mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses of the known mesons.|$|E

5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea {{has been}} created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian Ridge–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, {{view is that the}} hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era. However, while Hawaiian volcanism is well understood and extensively studied, there remains no definite explanation of the <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> causes the hotspot effect.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> caught them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} {{analysis of}} imaging, mass spectrometry, and magnetospheric data {{suggests that the}} observed south polar plume emanates from pressurized subsurface chambers, similar to Earth's geysers,. The <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> drives and sustains the eruptions {{is thought to be}} tidal heating. The intensity of the eruption of the south polar jets varies significantly {{as a function of the}} position of Enceladus in its orbit. The plumes are about four times brighter when Enceladus is at apoapsis (the point in its orbit most distant from Saturn) than when it is at periapsis. This is consistent with geophysical calculations which predict the south polar fissures are under compression near periapsis, pushing them shut, and under tension near apoapsis, pulling them open.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} evolutionary theory before Darwin's {{was that of}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck; based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics (an inheritance <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Thomas Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.|$|E
5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E

5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E
5|$|Dayton {{has been}} the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s. According to the National Park Service, citing {{information}} from the U.S. Patent Office, Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870. The Wright brothers, inventors of the airplane, and Charles F. Kettering, world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton. The city was also home to James Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier, the first mechanical cash register, and Arthur E. Morgan's hydraulic jump, a flood prevention <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> helped pioneer hydraulic engineering. Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American poet and novelist, penned his most famous works in the late 19th century and became {{an integral part of}} the city's history.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on exchange of indivisible goods finds natural application {{in the exchange}} of live donor kidneys for transplant. However, in kidney exchange, there are constraints {{on the size of}} exchanges. Initially, kidney exchanges are likely to be between just two patient–donor pairs. We show that, although this constraint eliminates some potential exchanges, there is a wide class of constrained-efficient <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> are strategy-proof when patient–donor pairs and surgeons have 0 – 1 preferences. This includes deterministic <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> accommodate the priority setting that organ banks currently use to allocate cadaver organs, and stochastic <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> allow distributive justice issues to be addressed...|$|R
