50|$|The DeSoto Firedome was a {{full-size}} automobile produced between 1952 to 1959 by DeSoto automobiles {{a division of}} the Chrysler Corporation. Introduced as DeSoto's premium line of vehicles in 1953 and 1954, the Firedome also occupied the least expensive position in the model lineup during 1955 and 1956 model years before it was reclassified as a <b>mid-range</b> <b>vehicle</b> offered by DeSoto between 1957 and 1959.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, {{the service}} was called [...] "Executive" [...] and was {{intended}} for a niche group, with high-end vehicles that were slightly more expensive than taxis. In June 2013, the company launched Cabify Lite, with <b>mid-range</b> <b>vehicles</b> that were usually cheaper than taxis. By the end of 2015, Cabify Lite represented 85% of the company's offer.|$|R
50|$|From {{around the}} year 2000, side-impact airbags became commonplace on even low- to <b>mid-range</b> <b>vehicles,</b> such as the smaller-engined {{versions}} of the Ford Fiesta and Peugeot 206, and curtain airbags were also becoming regular features on mass-market cars. The Toyota Avensis, launched in 2003, was the first mass-market car to be sold in Europe with nine airbags.|$|R
5000|$|The Packard Cavalier [...] is an {{automobile}} {{produced by the}} Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan during 1953 and 1954. Produced only as a sedan, the Cavalier took {{the place of the}} Packard 300 model which was fielded in 1951 and 1952 as Packard’s <b>mid-range</b> priced <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R

2500|$|To some extent, results {{along these}} lines have been {{achieved}} in trials performed around the globe, making use of GPS, mobile phone signals, and vehicle registration plates. [...] GPS is becoming standard in many new high-end vehicles and is an option on most new low- and <b>mid-range</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In addition, many users also have mobile phones which transmit trackable signals (and may also be GPS-enabled). [...] Mobile phones can already be traced for purposes of emergency response. [...] GPS and mobile phone tracking, however, do not provide fully reliable data. Furthermore, integrating mobile phones in vehicles may be prohibitively difficult. Data from mobile phones, though useful, might even increase risks to motorists as they tend {{to look at their}} phones rather than concentrate on their driving. Automatic registration plate recognition can provide high levels of data, but continuously tracking a vehicle through a corridor is a difficult task with existing technology. Today's equipment is designed for data acquisition and functions such as enforcement and tolling, not for returning data to vehicles or motorists for response. GPS will nevertheless be one of the key components in VII systems.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for {{detecting}} vehicles in image sequences without pre-knowledge about {{the position of the}} road. Image data is provided by a single camera placed in a moving vehicle. We describe one approach for detecting <b>mid-range</b> and distant <b>vehicles,</b> and another for detecting passing <b>vehicles.</b> For <b>mid-range</b> and distant <b>vehicles</b> we use a combination of three dierent clues. First, we select regions in the image plane that exhibit the characteristics of shadow projected underneath a vehicle. Next we analyze the entropy and horizontal symmetry of these selected regions. Only those regions that contain enough entropy and symmetry are identied as potential vehicles. For passing vehicle detection we propose a combination of temporal dierencing and projected motion. The intensity distribution of the surface of the road, observed {{in the corner of the}} eye is analyzed. If a signicant intensity variation is observed, the projected motion of this area is analyzed. This analysis determines whether to intensity variation is caused by a vehicle or not. We test our algorithms by means of many dierent experiments, all based on practical video data recorded under dierent circumstances. These experiments illustrate the robust and accurate performance of both the detection method for passing vehicles as the method for <b>mid-range</b> and distant <b>vehicles.</b> Keywords Intelligent Vehicles, Vehicle Detection, Shadow, Texture, Symmetry, Temporal Dierencing, Projected Motion I...|$|R
50|$|The Lincoln Custom {{was based}} on the Lincoln-Zephyr, a smaller, unit-bodied, <b>mid-range</b> priced <b>vehicle</b> {{introduced}} in 1937 with a smaller 292 cu. inch V-12 (based on the Ford V-8) while drawing many similarities to the De Luxe Ford and the all-new Lincoln Continental. This car competed with the smaller Packard 110, Packard 120 and Cadillac Series 60 and La Salle; smaller cars introduced in the mid-1930s to a shrinking luxury car market. The large Lincoln Model K sold 3024 units in 1934, the first year of its production and only 133 units in the last year, 1939. 1940 saw only the Zephyr and the higher priced Continental carrying the Lincoln name.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the design, and development of design methods for vehicles, mainly two wheeled. Part I. Design of the tilting chassis for a three wheels <b>vehicle</b> for <b>mid-range</b> mobility. The <b>vehicle,</b> equipped by electric assistance, thus can achieve reasonable speed. To avoid the overturning in curve an innovative tilt system, developed by the research group, was implemented and optimized by means of multibody dynamics simulation. Part II. The market of enduro motorcycles oﬀers no vehicles speciﬁcally designed for the needs of non-professional users, therefore was developed a motorcycle designed for handling rather than performance. The early deﬁnition of design objectives diﬀerent from the traditional ones led the development of a controlled stiﬀness chassis, and an engine characterized by reduced gyroscopic eﬀects. Part III. The need to objectively measure and quantify the behavior of the motorcycle driver out of the laboratory is now urgent in applied research. Only few attempts have been made, mainly because of cost and technical diﬃculties. The use of techniques of emph image processing allowed the development of a noncontact measurement system, using a single emph action camera to reconstruct the movements of the pilot in six degrees of freedom. Part IV. Laser cutting of tubes provides technological potential not fully exploited in vehicle frame construction. Techniques have been developed of design for rapid assembly, and structural optimization of tubular structures. The implementation is immediate within prototyping, while the research acts as foreground for industrial application. Prototypes. Collaboration with industry yielded to the construction of prototypes in all projects, consequently have been studied some themes essentials for the complete design of the vehicles. Having dealt with transversal themes allowed to operate a proﬁtable technological transfer between the areas addresse...|$|R
