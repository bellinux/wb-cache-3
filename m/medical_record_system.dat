2500|$|In 2002, Kaiser Permanente {{abandoned}} {{its attempt to}} build its own clinical information system with IBM, writing-off some $452 million in software assets. This information technology failure led to {{major changes in the}} organization's approach to digital records. Under George Halvorson's direction, Kaiser looked closely at two medical software vendors, Cerner and Epic Systems, ultimately selecting Epic as the primary vendor for a new system, branded KP HealthConnect. Although Kaiser's approach shifted to [...] "buy, not build," [...] the project was unprecedented for a civilian system in size and scope. Deployed across all eight regions over six years and at a cost of more than $6 billion, by 2010, it was the largest civilian electronic <b>medical</b> <b>record</b> <b>system,</b> serving more than 8.6 million Kaiser Permanente members, implemented at a cost exceeding a half million dollars per physician.|$|E
2500|$|Prescriptions may {{be entered}} into an {{electronic}} <b>medical</b> <b>record</b> <b>system</b> and transmitted electronically to a pharmacy. Alternatively, a prescription may be handwritten on preprinted prescription forms {{that have been}} assembled into pads, or printed onto similar forms using a computer printer or even on plain paper according to the circumstance. In some cases, a prescription may be transmitted from the physician to the pharmacist orally by telephone; this practice may {{increase the risk of}} medical error. The content of a prescription includes the name and address of the prescribing provider and any other legal requirement such as a registration number (e.g. DEA Number in the United States). [...] Unique for each prescription {{is the name of the}} patient. [...] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the patient's name and address must also be recorded. Each prescription is dated and some jurisdictions may place a time limit on the prescription. In the past, prescriptions contained instructions for the pharmacist to use for compounding the pharmaceutical product but most prescriptions now specify pharmaceutical products that were manufactured and require little or no preparation by the pharmacist. Prescriptions also contain directions for the patient to follow when taking the drug. These directions are printed on the label of the pharmaceutical product.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Electronic <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> <b>systems</b> {{may improve}} the {{efficiency}} and quality of health services in developing countries. However the supporting evidence is limited as {{there are a number}} of barriers to their implementation, including lack of infrastructure, resources and skills. The objective of this study was to evaluate the introduction and assess the potential benefits of an Electronic <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> <b>System</b> in Rural at an NGO-supported health post in rural Nepal. &# 13; Methods: Original research in the form of a case report was carried out using participant observation of health clinics, semi-structured interviews with health workers and recording of time spent on clinic activities at the pilot and a control site. &# 13; Results: This evaluation found that the Electronic <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> <b>System</b> was well used and easy to learn. Health workers thought it improved continuity of care and found decision-support tools useful. Monthly report creation was faster but the system was difficult to integrate with government services, which limited the reduction in paperwork. Other problems identified included minor software issues, a lack of back-up, continuity of power supply and inadequate technical support. There was no significant impact on consultation length or time spent interacting with patients. &# 13; Conclusions: The introduction of the Electronic <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> <b>System</b> was largely successful. With adequate technical support and training, Electronic <b>Medical</b> <b>Records</b> <b>System</b> could provide a relatively low-cost means of improving patient care and health worker efficiency in developing countries. However they must be designed to fit their intended environment. &# 13; Keywords: computerized; electronic health records; <b>medical</b> records; <b>medical</b> <b>records</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R
