25|$|Cracking of the {{concrete}} section {{is nearly impossible to}} prevent; however, the size and location of cracks can be limited and controlled by appropriate reinforcement, control joints, curing methodology and concrete <b>mix</b> <b>design.</b> Cracking can allow moisture to penetrate and corrode the reinforcement. This is a serviceability failure in limit state design. Cracking is normally the result of an inadequate quantity of rebar, or rebar spaced at too great a distance. The concrete then cracks either under excess loading, or due to internal effects such as early thermal shrinkage while it cures.|$|E
2500|$|Workability is {{the ability}} of a fresh (plastic) {{concrete}} mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of hydration) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or segregation of aggregates (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh <b>mix</b> <b>design</b> with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little or too much sand for the same reason, or using too little water, or too much cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles. [...] Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.|$|E

5000|$|Volumetric mixers can {{seamlessly}} {{change all}} aspects of the <b>mix</b> <b>design</b> while still producing concrete.

50|$|Measuring (or proportioning) {{by volume}} not weight {{is at the}} heart of the {{volumetric}} mobile mixer and the final product is capable of accuracies better than +/- 1%. Materials are stored in separate bins and based on the <b>mix</b> <b>design</b> are proportioned into the mix; this enables the operator to mix on-site exactly what is needed eliminating overages and shortages.

40|$|Specific {{proportions}} of Portland cement, fly ash, and {{blast furnace slag}} cement mixtures where chosen by a ternary phase diagram to be investigated. By experimental testing and company data history fly ash was limited to not exceed 30 % and contribution of Portland cement must be over 50 %. Ten chosen <b>mix</b> <b>designs</b> were batched by following ASTM C 305 - 94 and cured for twenty-eight and forty-two days, the extended cure length allows the reaction of pozzolanic material with calcium hydroxide to complete. Compressive strength testing at forty-two days yielded low strength for <b>mix</b> <b>designs</b> with 20 % or less Portland cement compared to our 100 % Portland cement control. The three <b>mix</b> <b>designs</b> with 30 % Portland cement reached the greatest strength of all ternary designs and were averaged to be 1742 psi lower than the 7406 psi control, {{this is due to}} the more sufficient amount of calcium hydroxide produced for reacting with the fly ash, compared to the low, 10 % and 20 %, Portland cement <b>mixes.</b> The ternary <b>design</b> consisting of 30 % Portland cement, 20 % fly ash, and 50 % slag exhibited the highest strength, 5879 psi, 1527 psi below the control. With the cementitious reactions being of greatest significance, SEM analysis was performed on selected <b>mix</b> <b>designs.</b> Images show cementitious reactions as hair like structures throughout the sample, additional observations of un-reacted spherical fly ash particles are present along the fracture area. Fly ash being a low strength contributor, it can be determined as a reason of low strength failure. With use of ternary <b>mix</b> <b>designs</b> environmental impacts are reduced; additionally meeting new California Air Resource board and California Department of Transportation pozzolanic regulations...|$|R
