40|$|Focused on {{the impact}} of {{stringent}} intellectual property mechanisms over the uses of plant agricultural biodiversity in crop improvement, the article delves into a systematic analysis of the relationship between institutional paradigms and their technological contexts of application, identified as mass selection, controlled <b>hybridisation,</b> <b>molecular</b> breeding tools and transgenics. While the strong property paradigm has proven effective in the context of major leaps forward in genetic engineering, it faces a systematic breakdown when extended to mass selection, where innovation often displays a collective nature. However, it also creates partial blockages in those innovation schemes rested between on-farm observation and genetic modification, i. e. conventional plant breeding and upstream molecular biology research tools. Neither overly strong intellectual property rights, nor the absence of well delineated protection have proven an optimal fit for these two intermediary socio-technological systems of cumulative incremental innovation. To address these challenges, the authors look at appropriate institutional alternatives which can create effective incentives for in situ agrobiodiversity conservation and the equitable distribution of technologies in plant improvement, using the flexibilities of the TRIPS Agreement, the liability rules set forth in patents or plant variety rights themselves (in the form of farmers’, breeders’ and research exceptions), and other ad hoc reward regimes...|$|R

A phylogenetic {{study of the}} relationships and evolutionary trends in Craterocapsa was undertaken based on morphological and DNA sequence data (the nuclear ribosomal ITS and the plastid trnL–trnF regions). An additional aim {{was to investigate the}} status of the various species in the genus. The generic circumscription of Craterocapsa was supported, however {{there is a lack of}} morphological evidence for the recognition of C. alfredica as a distinct taxon, and topologies of the <b>molecular</b> phylogenies suggest <b>hybridisation</b> and/or introgression as likely processes for its origin. C. alfredica is therefore here excluded from the genus. The morphological and molecular phylogenies are highly incongruent, suggesting convergence in features such as growth form and leaf shape in response to environmental factors, most notably altitude. The widespread Craterocapsa tarsodes is the first species to diverge, with dispersal northwards to Mount Inyangani a likely explanation for its highly disjunct distribution. C. insizwae and C. tarsodes are hypothesised to have speciated sympatrically in the Kokstad–Weza region, a ‘hotspot’ for the genus, whereas the sister species Craterocapsa montana and Craterocapsa congesta appear to have diverged in allopatry with ecological speciation playing a role...|$|R

40|$|Recent reviews {{have shown}} that {{hybridisation}} among ant species {{is likely to be}} more common than previously appreciated. but that documented cases of introgression remain rare. After molecular phylogenetic work had shown that European Lasius niger (LINNAEUS, 1758) and L. psammophilus SEIFERT, 1992 (formerly L. alienus (FOERSTER. 1850)) are unlikely to be very closely related, we decided to analyse an old data set confirming the conclusion by PEARSON (1983) that these two ants can indeed form viable hybrids. We show that signatures of introgression can be detected in a Danish site and that interspecific gene-flow is asymmetrical (only from L. niger into L. psammophilus) as inferred previously by Pearson for the southern England site that he studied and from which we also collected data. We compare the observed patterns of hybridisation and introgression in the Danish and British site and infer that overlap in nuptial flights in Denmark {{may have contributed to the}} higher frequency of introgressed genes relative to the southern England site where nuptial flights are clearly separated in time. We also report the first mating system data for L. psammophilus. showing that this species has facultative multiple mating of queens similar to L. niger. We suggest that L. psammoplillus-niger introgression may be much more common than previously appreciated, which would explain that European myrmecologists have often found it difficult to distinguish between these species at sites where they occur sympatrically.

Key words: citrus, virus diseases, CTV, <b>molecular</b> <b>hybridisation,</b> sequencing. Citrus is an ancient crop in Greece, where it is grown in 29 of the 54 prefectures of the country. Sweet orange is the dominant species, followed by lemon, mandarin and grapefruit, all grafted primarily onto sour orange (Kyriakopoulou, 2002). With about 3. 5 millions trees, the Arta valley is the main citrus-growing area of Epirus. Most of the virus and virus-like diseases of citrus occur in Greece, e. g. psorosis A and B, concave gum, impietratura, cristacortis, crinkly leaf, ringspot, exocortis, cachexia, gummy bark and sour orange woody gall (Kyriakopoulou, 2002). Surveys for Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) were started in Greece in 1995 and large-scale testing was carried out by DAS-ELISA and direct tissue blot immunoassay (DTBIA). In June 2000, CTV was detected {{for the first time in}} Argolis (North East Peloponnese) and in Chania (Crete), due to the accidental introduction of CTV-infected budwood from Spain (Dimou et al., 2002).

40|$|Faecal {{contamination}} of water sources {{can only be}} managed if the sources of pollution are identified and thus tools to distinguish between human and animal faecal sources are needed. Male-specific F-RNA coliphages have been classified into four sero-groups and evidence has been presented that two of these sero-groups are specific for human excreta {{and the other two}} for animal excreta. The sero-groups are readily detectable as genotypes with the application of <b>molecular</b> techniques, notable <b>hybridisation</b> tests using gene probes specific for each genotype. A standard ISO method was used for the detection of F-RNA coliphages. Wastewater containing predominantly animal excreta was collected from cattle, pig and chicken feedlots. Wastewater containing predominantly human excreta was collected from hospitals. The F-RNA genotyping study was qualitative and focussed on determining which groups of F-RNA phages were present in different wastewater and environmental samples. The results were in agreement with earlier reports on the specificity of F-RNA phage Genotypes 1 and 4 for animal wastes, and Genotypes 2 and 3 for human excreta. Besides being detected in human wastewater, F-RNA Group 3 was detected in both chicken and pig wastewater indicating that this Group was not specific to humans. The results showed that F-RNA phage Group 2 was the only group detected in seven of the twenty-six positive samples from the Dorpspruit, Slangspruit and uMsunduze Rivers, suggesting human faecal input. All other river water samples contained mixtures of F-RNA phage groups suggesting that the faecal input could not exclusively be ascribed to humans or animal sources alone. This suggested that both human and animal sources were responsible for {{contamination of}} receiving water at these sampling sites. The research proved that the genotyping of F-RNA phages was feasible in practice and could be used to assist in identifying the source of faecal pollution.

40|$|The {{different}} classes of leukaemia comprise numerous heterogeneous subgroups, which {{differ in their}} cellular and molecular characteristics. Accurate risk stratification is essential for tailoring of therapy.

Whilst these genetic abnormalities are important in leukaemogenesis, and provide diagnostic and prognostic markers, co-operating oncogenic aberrations are often required for the production of a full leukaemic phenotype. A number of additional aberrations have been identified within some cytogenetic subgroups, but the full complement of cooperating abnormalities, and their distribution within ALL subtypes remains to be defined. In this study the genomic changes in a total of 94 ALL patients from the ETV 6 -RUNX 1 (n= 34), iAMP 21 (n= 19) and unclassified (n= 41) patient subgroups were characterised using cytogenetics, FISH, array comparative genomic <b>hybridisation,</b> <b>molecular</b> copy number counting, mutation analysis, qRT-PCR and targeted gene expression arrays.

Of the 104 specimens that were positive for HBV DNA of any form, 53 annealed to the probe. Serial specimens from the same subject taken over a period of months showed that the proportion of supercoil to other HBV DNA forms was variable. The presence of supercoil HBV DNA was not closely correlated with the level of serum HBV DNA polymerase.

The young age {{of some of these}} cases indicates that such integration can occur early in liver disease and is not related to the duration of viral infection. Thirteen children exhibited serological evidence of active viral multiplication. All but one had free HBV DNA in liver tissue and integrated HBV DNA sequences were found in four cases.

This line, 16 c, expresses the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP), highly and constitutively, and has been a major resource for visualising the mobility and actions of small RNAs. Insights into the mechanisms studied at a molecular level in N. benthamiana 16 c are likely to be deeper and more accurate with a greater knowledge of the GFP gene integration site. Therefore, using next generation sequencing, genome mapping and local alignment, we identified the location and characteristics of the integrated T-DNA. As suggested from previous <b>molecular</b> <b>hybridisation</b> and inheritance data, the transgenic line contains a single GFP-expressing locus. However, the GFP coding sequence differs from that originally reported. Furthermore, a 3. 2 kb portion of a transposon, appears to have co-integrated with the T-DNA. The location of the integration mapped to a region of the genome represented by Nbv 0. 5 scaffold 4905 in the www. benthgenome. com assembly, and with less integrity to Niben 101 Scf 03641 in the www. solgenomics. net assembly. The transposon is not endogenous to laboratory strains of N. benthamiana or Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV 3101 (MP 90), which was reportedly used in the generation of line 16 c. However, it is present in the popular LBA 4404 strain. The integrated transposon sequence includes its 5 ' terminal repeat and a transposase gene, and is immediately adjacent to the GFP gene.

The data obtained were worked out with the Jaccard genetic similarity coefficient, applying the SAHN clustering method. The resulting dendrograms showed that all genotypes could be unequivocally distinguished. Because the sanitary status of very few of the selected plants conformed to legislative health requirements, most of the selected accessions underwent sanitation by in vitro meristem tip culture, in vivo and in vitro heat therapy, and rapid in vitro subculturing of shoots tips.
