40|$|Over {{the past}} two to three decades, our {{understanding}} of poverty has broadened from a narrow focus on income and consumption to a multidimensional notion of education, health, social and political 1 participation, personal security and freedom and environmental quality. Thus, it encompasses not just low income, but {{lack of access to}} services, resources and skills; vulnerability; insecurity; and voicelessness and powerlessness. Multidimensional poverty is a determinant of health risks, health seeking behaviour, health care access and health outcomes. As analysis of health outcomes becomes more refined, it is increasingly apparent that the impressive gains in health experienced over recent decades are unevenly distributed. Aggregate indicators, whether at the global, regional or national level, often tend to <b>mask</b> <b>striking</b> variations in health outcomes between men and women, rich and poor, both across and within countries [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The {{loss of the}} World Tag Team Championship signalled {{the end of the}} team; in the {{following}} weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by The Hurricane's injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle at the request of Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his <b>mask</b> and <b>striking</b> Rosey (who had come to the ring to his aid). The following week, The Hurricane did not show up in a World Tag Team title match leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, now going by his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd and that he had been carrying Rosey as a tag team partner.|$|R
30|$|The tone {{analyses}} were conducted on a large database of recorded tones sampled from a Hohner D 6 Clavinet (Hohner Musikinstrumente GmbH & Co. KG, Trossingen, Germany). Recordings include Clavinet tones for the whole keyboard range, with different pickup and switch settings. The recording sessions were carried out in a semi-anechoic recording room. The recordings were done with the Clavinet output and an AKG C- 414 B-ULS condenser microphone (AKG Acoustics GmbH, Vienna, Austria) placed close to the strings, and both were connected to the acquisition sound card. The latter recordings were useful only {{in the analysis of}} the tail of the sound as the mechanical noise generated by the key, its rebound, and the tangent hitting the anvil <b>masked</b> the <b>striking</b> portion of the tone nearly entirely. This was {{due to the fact that}} the Clavinet soundboard is not intended as an amplifying device, but rather as a mechanical support to the instrument.|$|R

40|$|The REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) is a {{joint effort}} by MIT and Harvard to build the student-collaboration {{experiment}} aboard OSIRIS-Rex, an asteroid sample return mission sponsored by the NASA New Frontiers program. OSIRISREx is scheduled to launch to near-Earth asteroid Bennu in 2016. REXIS is a coded-mask imaging X-ray spectrometer that supports the missions scientific goals by globally and spatially mapping the soft X-ray emission spectrum of Bennu. X-rays corresponding to unique elements are fluoresced from the asteroid by incident solar radiation and enter the instrument through a coded-aperture mask composed of a psuedorandom pinhole pattern. The X-rays that pass through the <b>mask</b> <b>strike</b> an array of four charge-coupled devices (CCDs) that detect the incident photon energy and location on the imaging array. A spatial map of selected elemental abundances on Bennu is constructed by cross-correlating the mask pattern with the collected data. The CCDs are integrated into a Detector Assembly Mount (DAM) that serves three critical functions: Mechanical alignment, calibration and protection of the CCDs. In this thesis we outline the overall design of the REXIS DAM {{with a focus on}} its three main functions. Chapter 1 provides background on the OSIRIS-REx mission and the REXIS instrument. Chapter 2 discusses the adaptation of the AXAF CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) focal plane mechanical design and X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) flexprint electrical design for the REXIS DAM. Chapter 3 outlines the heritage of the DAM internal calibration sources from XIS and the MIT MicroX project. Driving science and engineering considerations for a calibration scheme are described and then used to inform the mechanical design of a novel calibration set for the REXIS DAM. Chapter 4 illustrates the need for protection from the space environment and analyzes the specific risks to the detectors and DAM in space. Special coatings and a one-time deployable radiation shield are used to protect the assembly and ensure integrity of REXIS science data. Chapter 5 describes the test performed to validate the CCD alignment scheme and the dynamic model of the radiation cover. Chapter 6 summarizes the key results of the present work and outlines plans for future work on the DAM. by Harrison L. Bralower. Thesis: S.

50|$|Toombes {{experiences}} difficulties {{while working}} on set, publicly berating his female co-star; later that evening, she is found hanged by her own hair, another scene from a Dr. Death film. Scotland Yard questions him, but finds no conclusive evidence. While returning to Flay's house on several occasions, Toombes is harassed by {{the parents of the}} young actress, who recovered his watch and threaten to deliver it to the police unless he pays them a ransom. But the <b>masked</b> man <b>strikes</b> again by luring them into the house and impaling them both with a broadsword. On the set, the director is crushed by a descending bed canopy, suspected to be the intended fate for Toombes himself; Toombes is chased through the BBC studio later that evening by the masked man while on his way to an interview. Julia Wilson (Natasha Pyne), Quayle's public relations chief, discovers a contract in Quayle's files, but is killed by the masked man; Toombes discovers her lifeless body and suffers a nervous breakdown, reliving Ellen's death and his own doubt as to his role in it. Taking Julia's body onto the set, he locks himself inside and sets it ablaze.|$|R
50|$|A neutral evil {{character}} is typically selfish {{and has no}} qualms about turning on allies-of-the-moment, and usually makes allies primarily to further their own goals. A neutral evil character has no compunctions about harming others {{to get what they}} want, but neither will they {{go out of their way}} to cause carnage or mayhem when they see no direct benefit for themselves. Another valid interpretation of neutral evil holds up evil as an ideal, doing evil for evil's sake and trying to spread its influence. Examples of the first type are an assassin who has little regard for formal laws but does not needlessly kill, a henchman who plots behind their superior's back, or a mercenary who switches sides if made a better offer. An example of the second type would be a <b>masked</b> killer who <b>strikes</b> only for the sake of causing fear and distrust in the community.|$|R
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by Hurricane's {{on-screen}} injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle {{at the request of}} Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his <b>mask</b> and <b>striking</b> Rosey because he did not help him fend off Angle. The next week, The Hurricane no-showed a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, reverting to his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd, and that he was sick of carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. This turned him into a heel in the process. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Helms and Rosey faced off in a singles match, which Helms won. Subsequently, Helms wrestled mostly on Raws sister show, Heat. On the January 2, 2006 episode of Raw Helms confronted Jerry Lawler over jokes that Lawler had been making at Helms' expense, and Lawler said that when Helms was The Hurricane, he was entertaining and called Helms a joke. Helms responded by slapping Lawler, who hit Helms back. This confrontation led to Lawler defeating Helms in a match at New Year's Revolution.|$|R
60|$|Amazing, incredible, the Subway, and {{the fact}} that human beings could become used to it, consent to spend an hour in it daily. There was a heroic side to this {{spectacle}} of steel trains clanging at forty miles an hour beneath twenty-story buildings. The engineers had done their work well, made a great thought in steel and cement. And then the business men and bureaucrats had made the great thought a curse. There was in the Subway all the romance which story-telling youth goes seeking: trains crammed with an inconceivable complexity of people--marquises of the Holy Roman Empire, Jewish factory hands, speculators from Wyoming, Iowa dairymen, quarreling Italian lovers, with their dramatic tales, their flux of every human emotion, under the city <b>mask.</b> But however <b>striking</b> these dramatic characters may be to the occasional spectator, they figure merely as an odor, a confusion, to the permanent serf of the Subway.... A long underground station, a catacomb with a cement platform, this was the chief feature of the city vista to the tired girl who waited there each morning. A clean space, but damp, stale, like the corridor to a prison--as indeed it was, since through it each morning Una entered the day's business life.|$|R
50|$|Relic Run {{takes place}} in the Lara Croft subseries, a {{continuity}} separate from the mainline rebooted Tomb Raider games. When the project was first proposed, it was intended that Lara should retain key abilities from the main series, specifically her acrobatic abilities and the combat segments. While they used other endless runner games as a base, {{they did not want to}} copy them, instead trying to evolve them in a meaningful way. The bosses, such as the Tyrannosaurus, were included to give the game a fantastical feel, as opposed to the more mature and realistic entries in the main series. The ducking and diving sequences Lara went through entering these stages were incorporated to <b>mask</b> loading times. <b>Striking</b> the balance between the game's challenge and encouraging players to return was a crucial part of game development. Franchise developer Crystal Dynamics worked closely with developer Simutronics when designing the game, ensuring that it would remain faithful to the series despite its status as a mobile spin-off. The core fanbase was also consulted during development. The game's aesthetic was deliberately intended to evoke earlier Tomb Raider games: for instance, the opening Jungle stage evoked the opening levels of Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft. It was also intended to appeal to a wider audience due to its platform and genre. Relic Run was first announced in April 2015, shortly thereafter going on a soft release in the Netherlands so any problems with the game could be sorted out prior to the full release. The game included advertisements incorporated in partnership with NativeX. It was released on May 28, 2015 for Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8.|$|R
