5|$|Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler {{crabs and}} shrimp, among the {{mangroves}} also occupy a significant {{place in the}} local economy. While {{a large number of}} shrimp species inhabit the Senegambian area, a single family exists in Casamance: Penaeidae. Southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed {{the extent to which the}} shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing <b>multiple</b> <b>causes,</b> including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the prevalence, predictors, and {{prognosis of patients}} with <b>multiple</b> potential <b>causes</b> of syncope. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study with prospective follow-up of consecutive patients with syncope of uncertain cause who were referred to the electrophysiology service for syncope evaluation from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 1998. The main outcome measures were prevalence of <b>multiple</b> potential <b>causes</b> of syncope, survival of patients with <b>multiple</b> potential <b>causes</b> of syncope compared with survival of patients with a single cause, and clinical predictors of <b>multiple</b> potential <b>causes</b> of syncope. Results: A total of 987 patients were studied (mean SD age, 58. 0 +/- 21. 4 years; male, 550 [55. 7 %]). <b>Multiple</b> potential <b>causes</b> were present in 182 patients (18. 4 %). Patients with <b>multiple</b> potential <b>causes</b> of syncope had a lower survival rate at 4 years, 73. 1 % (95 % confidence interval, 64. 6 %- 82. 8 %), vs those with a single cause, 89. 3 % (95 % confidence interval, 86 AW- 92. 2 %) (P <. 001). Multivlariate predictors of <b>multiple</b> potential <b>causes</b> were older age, atrial fibrillation, use of cardiac medications, and New York Heart Association classification II, III, and IV. Conclusion: Of the patients evaluated for syncope, 18. 4 % had <b>multiple</b> potential <b>causes.</b> The presence of <b>multiple</b> potential <b>causes</b> was an independent predictor of increased mortality among patients with syncop...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two major}} {{databases}} that track radiation accidents: The American ORISE REAC/TS and the European IRSN ACCIRAD. REAC/TS shows 417 accidents occurring between 1944 and 2000, causing about 3000 cases of acute radiation syndrome, of which 127 were fatal. ACCIRAD lists 580 accidents with 180 ARS fatalities for an almost identical period. The two deliberate bombings {{are not included in}} either database, nor are any possible radiation-induced cancers from low doses. The detailed accounting is difficult because of confounding factors. ARS may be accompanied by conventional injuries such as steam burns, or may occur in someone with a pre-existing condition undergoing radiotherapy. There may be <b>multiple</b> <b>causes</b> for death, and the contribution from radiation may be unclear. Some documents may incorrectly refer to radiation-induced cancers as radiation poisoning, or may count all overexposed individuals as survivors without mentioning if they had any symptoms of ARS.
