40|$|Many {{chemicals}} {{which have}} been demonstrated to be mutagenic {{in a variety of}} organisms are either present in our environment or are used-for human consumption. A variety of techniques have been developed for the detection of chemical mutagens. Some of these techniques have recently been reviewed and compiled (1). The important question, from the viewpoint of using these testing systems as a guide to human responsiveness, is one concerning the relevance of the results obtained from such tests to the actual or potential <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazard</b> to man. We know too little to provide simple answers to the question, but a screening system utilizing the metabolism of potential mutagens or carcinogens by intact animals appears to be the most direct means of obtaining results that are as relevant as possible to man. Fischer first developed a cell culture system for detection of mutagens using mouse leukemic L 5178 Y cells; this system was later combined with the metabolic capability of the animal host {{in the development of a}} host-mediated assay system in 1969 (2). This system seems to be very useful for detecting potential mutagens in man since it detects mutagenic effects of compounds in mammalian cells. These compounds ar...|$|E
40|$|Mutagenic {{properties}} of terpenes (both synthesis and plant derived) have benne tested, till now, as single molecule. A terpenes containing hydro-alcoholic solution deriving from frankincense and myrrh resins and hyssop essential oil was assayed for mutagenicity {{by means of}} Ames test. Extraction technique conducted with electromagnetic fields at room temperature permitted to obtain a solution of free active molecules that did not undergo thermal degradation and characterized by biocidal activity. In order to verify lack of <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazard</b> in coming into contact with human, the solution was appropriately diluted and tested with Salmonella typhimurium TA 98, TA 1535 and YG 1024 strains both in absence and in presence of metabolic system S 9. For none of tested conditions a 2 -fold increase of induced revertants as regards to spontaneous was registered. The ratio between induced and spontaneous His+ revertants (Mutagenic Index) always resulted of about 1. 00 and {{no statistically significant difference}} could be identified comparing sample and negative control. Analogous result was obtained for dose-response curve. In conclusion, having verified that tested terpenes solution is lacking of mutagenicity on Salmonella typhimurium with and without metabolic activator, this plant extract can be safely used as biocide...|$|E
40|$|How human {{self-renewal}} tissues co-ordinate proliferation with differentiation is unclear. Human epidermis undergoes continuous cell {{growth and}} differentiation and is permanently exposed to <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazard.</b> Keratinocytes {{are thought to}} arrest cell growth and cell cycle prior to terminal differentiation. However, {{a growing body of}} evidence does not satisfy this model. For instance, it does not explain how skin maintains tissue structure in hyperproliferative benign lesions. We have developed and applied novel cell cycle techniques to human skin in situ and determined the dynamics of key cell cycle regulators of DNA replication or mitosis, such as cyclins E, A and B, or members of the anaphase promoting complex pathway: cdc 14 A, Ndc 80 /Hec 1 and Aurora kinase B. The results show that actively cycling keratinocytes initiate terminal differentiation, arrest in mitosis, continue DNA replication in a special G 2 /M state, and become polyploid by mitotic slippage. They unambiguously demonstrate that cell cycle progression coexists with terminal differentiation, thus explaining how differentiating cells increase in size. Epidermal differentiating cells arrest in mitosis and a genotoxic-induced mitosis block rapidly pushes epidermal basal cells into differentiation and polyploidy. These observations unravel a novel mitosis-differentiation link that provides new insight into skin homeostasis and cancer. It might constitute a self-defenc...|$|E

40|$|Settled house dust (SHD) {{may be a}} {{significant}} source of children's indoor exposure to hazardous substances including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, the extent to which mutagenic PAHs are present in SHD was examined, and the overall <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazards</b> of SHD were evaluated using the Salmonella Mutagenicity Test. The results indicate a predominance of frameshift mutagens in the SHD, and {{a significant}} positive correlation was identified between mutagenicity and PAH concentration. Mutagenicity was empirically related to several household attributes including vacuuming habits and the number of inhabitants in the home. There is some indication that PAH concentration in SHD is related to an urban home location and the presence of smokers, but the effects are weak. A risk assessment to evaluate the excess lifetime cancer risks posed by preschoolers' non-dietary ingestion of PAHs in SHD revealed that such exposures may result in risks that exceed 1 x 10 - 5...|$|R
40|$|Background Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are persistence organic chemicals with proved carcinogenic and <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazards.</b> These compounds are usually adsorbed in soils in vicinity {{of oil and}} gas industries. Bioremediation of PAHs contaminated soils is difficult due to hydrophobic nature of PAHs. Objectives The main purpose of the current {{study was to determine the}} pyrene removal efficiency in synthetically contaminated soil, using biosurfactant. Materials and Methods Four pure bacterial strains capable of pyrene degradation were isolated from contaminated soils via enrichment techniques. The soil samples were spiked with an initial pyrene concentration of 500 mg/kg and subjected to bioremediation using a mixed culture comprised of previously isolated strains, in addition to application of biosurfactant during 63 days. Results The pyrene removal efficiency in samples containing biosurfactant, without biosurfactant and controls, were 86. 4 %, 59. 8 % and 14 %, respectively, after 63 days. The difference of pyrene removal efficiency between the biosurfactant-containing samples and the ones without it was significant (P < 0. 05). Conclusions Application of rhamnolipid biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa significantly improved pyrene removal in contaminated soils...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTest {{batteries}} {{to screen}} chemicals for <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazard</b> include several endpoints regarded as effective for detecting genotoxic carcinogens. Traditional in vivo methods primarily examine clastogenic endpoints in haematopoietic tissues. Although {{this approach is}} effective for identifying systemically distributed clastogens, some mutagens may not induce clastogenic effects; moreover, genotoxic effects may be restricted {{to the site of}} contact and/or related tissues. An OECD test guideline for transgenic rodent (TGR) gene mutation assays was released in 2011, and the TGR assays permit assessment of mutagenicity in any tissue. This study assessed the responses of two genotoxicity endpoints following sub-chronic oral exposures of male Mutaâ„¢Mouse to 9 carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Clastogenicity was assessed via induction of micronuclei in peripheral blood, and mutagenicity via induction of lacZ transgene mutations in bone marrow, glandular stomach, small intestine, liver, and lung. Additionally, the presence of bulky PAH-DNA adducts was examined. Five of the 9 PAHs elicited positive results across all endpoints in at least one tissue, and no PAHs were negative or equivocal across all endpoints. All PAHs were positive for lacZ mutations in at least one tissue (sensitivity= 100 %), and for 8 PAHs, one or more initial sites of chemical contact (i. e., glandular stomach, liver, small intestine) yielded a greater response than bone marrow. Five PAHs were positive in the micronucleus assay (sensitivity= 56 %). Furthermore, all PAHs produced DNA adducts in at least one tissue. The results demonstrate the utility of the TGR assay for mutagenicity assessment, especially for compounds that may not be systemically distributed...|$|E
40|$|The {{genotoxicity}} of energetic compounds (i. e., explosives) {{that are}} known to be present in contaminated soils at military training sites has not been extensively investigated. Thus, the Salmonella mutagenicity and Muta(TM) Mouse assays were employed as in vitro assays to examine the mutagenic activity of twelve explosive compounds, as well as three soil samples from Canadian Forces Base Petawawa. Salmonella analyses employed strains TA 98 (frameshift mutations) and TA 100 (base-pair substitution mutations), as well as the metabolically-enhanced YG 1041 (TA 98 background) and YG 1042 (TA 100 background), with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S 9). For Salmonella analyses, the results indicate that ten of the explosive compounds were mutagenic, and consistently elicited direct-acting, base-pair substitution activity. All three soil samples were also observed to be mutagenic, eliciting direct-acting, frameshift activity. Mutagenic potencies were significantly higher on the metabolically-enhanced strains for all compounds and soil samples. For Muta(TM) Mouse analyses on FE 1 cells, the results indicate that the majority of explosive compounds did not exhibit mutagenic activity. All three soil samples elicited significant positive responses (PET 1 and PET 3 without S 9, and PET 2 with S 9), and although there is some evidence of a concentration-related trend, the responses were weak. Correspondence of the mutagenic activity observed with the two assay systems, for both the explosive compounds and soil samples, was negligible. The differential response is likely due to differences in metabolic capacity between the two assay systems. Furthermore, it is likely that there are unidentified compounds present in these soil samples that are, at least in part, responsible for the observed mutagenic activity. Additional testing of other explosive compounds, as well as soil samples from other military training sites, using a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays, is warranted in order to reliably estimate <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazard</b> and subsequently assess risk to human health...|$|E
40|$|The present review {{gives the}} details of the {{genotoxic}} studies carried out till date for some selected synthetic progestins. Mutagenicity is defined as a permanent change in content or structure of the genetic material of an organism. A <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazard</b> can be manifested as a heritable change resulting from germ-line mutations and/or somatic mutations leading to cancer or other chronic degenerative processes such as aging. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generated through normal metabolic processes or from toxic products, can lead to a state of oxidative stress that contributes to the pathogenesis of a number of human disease by damaging lipids, protein and DNA. Oral contraceptives have been used since the early 1960 s and are now used by about 90 million women world wide. The pill is given as a combination of an estrogen and a progestogen. The estrogen component of combined oral contraceptives is either ethinylestradiol or mestranol and the progestogens used are cyproterone acetate, desogestrol, ethynodiol diacetate, levonorgestrel, lynestrenol, megestrol acetate, norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, norethynodrel, norgestimate and norgestrel. Little is known about the long term health risks and potential protective effects of these individual components. Synthetic progestins induced the genotoxic damage and also various types of cancers, both singly as well as in combination with estrogens. Various synthetic progestins have been tested for their genotoxic effects in different experimental models, using different genotoxic end points. Ethynodioldiacetate, norethynodrel, norgestrel, lynestrenol and medroxyprogesterone acetate were found to be genotoxic only in the presence of metabolic activation supplemented with NADP. Megestrol acetate, cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate were found to be genotoxic in the absence of metabolic activation. On the basis of reports available it is suggested that the progestins in which double bond between carbon- 6 and carbon- 7 is present, they undergo nucleophilic reaction and generates free radical in the system to show the genotoxic effects and the progestins in which double bond between carbon- 6 and carbon- 7 is absent, they need metabolic activation like estrogens, such as estradiol- 17 Î² and ethinylestradiol to show the genotoxic effects...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dihydrodiol. {{dehydrogenase}} (DDH) is {{a member}} of the aldo-keto reductases superfamily which may be involved in normal detoxification process of environmental <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazards</b> like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Previous clinical studies have demonstrated the over-expression of DDH in various types of cancers, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and its correlation with tumor progression and grave prognosis. Objective: To investigate possible mechanisms for DDH's correlation with tumor progression and unfavorable prognosis. Methods: DDH expression in SCC A 431 cell line was examined by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting. RNA interference (RNAi) by transduction with retro-virat vector containing DDH-targeting small interfering RNA was employed to inhibit DDH expression by A 431 cells. With DDH expression inhibited or not, sensitivity of A 431 cells to UVB-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin were then examined and compared. Results: DDH was found highly expressed by SCC A 431 cells, which was barely detectable in other normal or malignant cutaneous cells, including keratinocytes, fibroblast, and basal cell carcinoma cell tine. RNAi Inhibition of DDH expression in A 431 cells led to increased sensitivity to UVB-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity of bleomycin treatment. Conclusion: DDH may play important roles in tumor progression of SCC via induction of apoptosis- and drug-resistance. (c) 2005 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

40|$|Abstract Background Parkinson 2 Ì† 019 s Disease is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease, characterized by symptoms of motor impairment, {{resulting from the}} loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, however non-neuronal symptoms are also common. Although great advances {{have been made in the}} pathogenic understanding of Parkinson 2 Ì† 019 s Disease in the nervous system, little is known about the molecular alterations occurring in other non-neuronal organ systems. In addition, a higher rate of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer has been observed in the Parkinson 2 Ì† 019 s Disease population, indicating crosstalk between these diseases. Methods To understand the molecular pathogenesis and gene expression alterations of Parkinson 2 Ì† 019 s Disease in peripheral tissues, and in order to explore the possible link between skin cancer and neurodegeneration, whole transcriptomic profiling of patients 2 Ì† 019 skin was performed. Skin biopsies from 12 patients and matched controls were collected, and processed with high-throughput RNA-sequencing analysis. Results This analysis resulted in a large collection of over 1000 differentially expressed genes, among which clear biological and functional networks could be distinguished. The central functional processes altered in patients skin can be grouped into six broad categories: impaired cellular metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction, defective protein metabolism, disturbed skin homeostasis, dysfunctional nuclear processes, altered signalling and tumour pathways, as well as disordered immune regulation. Conclusions These results demonstrate that the molecular alterations leading to neurodegeneration in the CNS are systemic and manifest also in peripheral tissues, thereby indicating the presence of 2 Ì† 01 cskin-brain 2 Ì† 01 d crosstalk in Parkinson 2 Ì† 019 s Disease. In addition, the extensive homeostatic imbalance and basal stress can lead to increased susceptibility to external and internal <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazards</b> in these patients, and thus provide a possible molecular link for the crosstalk between skin cancer and Parkinson 2 Ì† 019 s Disease...|$|R
40|$|I was {{planning}} to ask the audience a few questions-not what the conference gave to them-for which I have no answers. I thought I could get information about some compounds by inviting these experts but they declined: the reason some gave {{was that there was}} nothing as yet to report about health effects. The first problem, spontaneous copolymerization, is not acute but probably will arise in the future. Today this process is still too expensive for production and only the developers of these products at this stage are interested in their properties, but the principles of formation of alternating copolymers by spontaneous copolymerization (1) are interesting. I don't know details about the products, but the reason I raised the question {{is that most of the}} compounds II, IV, VI, VIII, except for the acrylamide (which is neurotoxic) are carcinogenic alkylating agents. If the process materialized into full industrial usage, we could have a potentially serious health hazard. The odd-numbered compounds (I, III, V, VII) with which the alkylating agents react to form polymers, could be replaced by the bases of human DNA. That would create carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic</b> <b>hazards.</b> Could anyone here predict that this is not likely to be a process of the future, that it will not be developed, or that it could be "handled with care " because of the recognition that this would be an occupational hazard? Another type of polymer is the class of polyorganophosphazenes (IX) which are formed from simple inorganic starting materials, namely, ammonium chloride and phosphorus pentachloride, which form a trimer which is then reacted with organic groups such as amines, to give a whole variety of either crosslinking or straight-chain polymers which may have properties of interest to industry (2) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Several {{mouthwash}} brands {{were investigated}} {{for the evaluation}} of mutagenicity and cell-transforming activity in short-term mutagenicity test systems.

Mouthwash, with and without an external metabolic activation system (S 9), consistently showed no mutagenic or cytotoxic activity in the Ames test, UDS assay or the V 79 -HGPRT-assay. These results indicate that the tested mouthwash brands are unlikely to present a <b>mutagenic</b> or carcinogenic <b>hazard.</b> However, these findings derived from an in vitro study cannot imitate the situation in situ, where a plethora of pharmacologically or bio-chemically active agents pass the oral cavity, thereby reacting with each other and th...|$|R
