5|$|Visits to one {{hospital}} that was experienced {{in addressing the}} health problems of drug addicts left Hope {{feeling that he was}} being experimented on, so he went to another, St. Clare's. Here, according to his wife, the treatment was not adjusted for the <b>methadone</b> program he was on, putting added strain on his heart. Hope was hospitalized with pneumonia in 1967 and died a few weeks later, on May 19, of heart failure. His wife was aged 31 {{at the time of his}} death. They had three children; their daughter, Monica Hope, became a singer.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a <b>methadone</b> treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2011, former Alice in Chains bassist Mike Starr {{was found}} dead {{at his home in}} Salt Lake City. Police told Reuters they were called to Starr's home at 1:42pm and found his body; Starr was 44. Reports later {{surfaced}} that Starr's roommate had seen him mixing <b>methadone</b> and anxiety medication hours before he {{was found dead}}. Later reports indicated Starr's death may have been linked to two different types of antidepressants prescribed to him by his doctor. A public memorial was held for Starr at the Seattle Center's International Fountain on March 20, 2011. A private memorial was also held, which Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney attended according to Mike Inez.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Methadones</b> were a band {{formed in}} 1993 by guitarist/vocalist Dan Vapid. The <b>Methadones</b> {{initially}} {{lasted only a}} few shows before Dan put them to the side to focus on his main band Screeching Weasel. By 1999 Dan {{was no longer a}} member of Screeching Weasel or his other band The Riverdales, and decided to restart The <b>Methadones</b> with B-Face of The Queers on bass, and Dan Lumley on drums. The band recorded their first album Ill At Ease in 2001. After the recording, B-Face and Lumley left the band. Schafer formed a new lineup of The <b>Methadones</b> with guitarist Mike Byrne, bassist Pete Mittler, and drummer Mike Soucy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Methadones</b> is {{the last}} album by punk rock band The <b>Methadones.</b> It was {{released}} on November 16, 2010 by Asian Man Records. The albums contains 5 new songs, 6 songs from The Methadones/The Copyrights Split with the remaining songs coming from out of print singles.|$|R
50|$|The Bomb {{was formed}} in 1999 by Jeff Pezzati of Naked Raygun. Producer Steve Albini (Shellac, Big Black) {{recorded}} their first two records, 'Arming' and 'Torch Songs'. Current members include Jeff Dean, Pete Mittler (The <b>Methadones,</b> Naked Raygun) and Mike Soucy (The <b>Methadones,</b> Dan Vapid and the Cheats).|$|R
5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to <b>methadone</b> in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
25|$|Recovering heroin addicts {{can receive}} <b>methadone</b> {{treatment}} {{free of charge}} under the <b>Methadone</b> Treatment Scheme.|$|E
25|$|Both {{buprenorphine}} and <b>methadone</b> are medications {{used for}} detoxification, short- and long-term opioid replacement therapy. Buprenorphine {{has the advantage}} of being only a partial agonist; hence negating the potential for life-threatening respiratory depression in cases of abuse. Studies show the effectiveness of buprenorphine and <b>methadone</b> are almost identical, and largely share adverse-effect profiles apart from more sedation among <b>methadone</b> users. At low flexible doses from 2 to 6mg, however, buprenorphine has a lower retention rate than from low doses 40mg or less of <b>methadone.</b>|$|E

25|$|Dr. Wecht {{announced}} on Larry King Live that the autopsy he performed showed that Daniel {{died from a}} lethal combination of antidepressants Zoloft, Lexapro, and the painkiller <b>methadone.</b> Dr. Wecht explained that <b>methadone</b> {{is used in the}} treatment of heroin addiction and chronic pain.|$|E
25|$|In March 2004, <b>methadone</b> {{maintenance}} treatment (MMT) trials begin.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of the successes of the pilot, the {{programme}} began scale-up in 2004 and plans are in place to open an additional 1500 <b>methadone</b> maintenance treatment clinics for about 300,000 heroin users by 2008. A National Training Center for <b>methadone</b> maintenance treatment has been established in Yunnan to provide clinical and technical support. The services offered at such clinics have been broadened and provide access to other services, including HIV and hepatitis testing, antiretroviral therapy for eligible AIDS patients, group activities, and skills training for employment. The use of <b>methadone</b> maintenance therapy has been incorporated into the AIDS Regulations as a treatment for heroin addiction. Additionally, the requirements for entrance into <b>methadone</b> maintenance treatment programmes have been relaxed to encourage greater access. For example, patients are no longer required to have local residency or a previous history of internment in a detoxification centre. The programme is not without problems, however, and retaining drug users in the programme remains a critical challenge.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Methadones</b> covered [...] "He's a Whore" [...] on 21st Century Power Pop Riot, {{an album}} of covers {{released}} in 2006. Concrete Blonde covered [...] "Mandocello" [...] on Still in Hollywood.|$|R
50|$|Dan Vapid and the Cheats are a pop punk {{band from}} Chicago that {{features}} {{former members of}} Screeching Weasel, The Riverdales, The <b>Methadones,</b> Noise By Numbers, The Vindictives, Sludgeworth and The Bomb.|$|R
25|$|Several opioids, {{particularly}} <b>methadone</b> and ketobemidone, possess NMDA antagonism {{in addition}} to their µ-opioid agonist properties. <b>Methadone</b> does so because it is a racemic mixture; only the l-isomer is a potent µ-opioid agonist. The d-isomer does not have opioid agonist action and acts as an NMDA antagonist; d-methadone is analgesic in experimental models of chronic pain. Clinical studies are in progress to test the efficacy of d-methadone in neuropathic pain syndromes.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that when <b>methadone</b> is used long-term it can build up unpredictably {{in the body}} and lead to potentially deadly slowed breathing. Used medically, approaching toxicity goes unrecognized because the pain medication effect ends long before the drug's elimination half-life. According to the USCDC, <b>methadone</b> was involved in 31% of opioid related deaths in the US between 1999-2010 and 40% as the sole drug involved, far higher than other opioids. Regular physician monitoring reduces the likelihood of problems.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{have been approved}} {{for the treatment of}} substance abuse. These include replacement therapies such as buprenorphine and <b>methadone</b> as well as antagonist medications like disulfiram and naltrexone in either short acting, or the newer long acting form. Several other medications, often ones originally used in other contexts, have also been shown to be effective including bupropion and modafinil. <b>Methadone</b> and buprenorphine are sometimes used to treat opiate addiction. These drugs are used as substitutes for other opioids and still cause withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
