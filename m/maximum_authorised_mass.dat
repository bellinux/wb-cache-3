40|$|Zinc from {{zinc chelate}} of {{amino acids hydrate}} would not exert {{additional}} or different adverse effects in target species than those observed for zinc from authorised inorganic sources. Consequently it is concluded that the zinc chelate of amino acids hydrate is a safe source of zinc for all animal species, considering the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorised</b> contents for total zinc in feedingstuffs. The use of zinc chelate of amino acids hydrate as feed additive {{is not expected to}} modify the current consumer exposure to zinc. Therefore, no concerns for consumer safety are expected from the use of zinc chelate of amino acids hydrate in animal nutrition up to the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorised</b> levels of total zinc in feedingstuffs. The additive should be considered as a skin and eye irritant and, due to its amino acid/peptide component, as a skin sensitiser. The risk of exposure by inhalation would be low. The use of zinc as a feed additive does not pose a direct concern for the soil compartment. However, there is a potential environmental concern related to drainage and run-off of zinc to surface water. Most vulnerable for these processes are acid sandy soils. In order to draw a final conclusion, some further refinement to the assessment of zinc-based feed additives in livestock needs to be considered, for which additional data would be required. The use of zinc-containing feed additives in aquaculture up to <b>maximum</b> <b>authorised</b> zinc level in feeds is not expected to pose an appreciable risk to the environment. Zinc chelate of amino acids hydrate is recognised as an efficacious source of zinc in meeting animal requirements...|$|R

40|$|Purpose This {{study is}} in line with the debate {{concerning}} the compatibility between the qualitative and quantitative food production objectives. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the causal relationship that may exist between public food safety regulations (specifically, the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorised</b> levels of chemical or microbiological contaminants), and the expected price in the spot markets (wholesale markets, for example). Design/methodology/approach The authors propose a theoretical industrial economic model that identifies the causal link which may exist between public food safety regulations (e. g. the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorised</b> levels of chemical or microbiological contaminants), the expected price in domestic markets, and the rate of exclusion of local producers. This general model allows one to characterize the price formation process in markets subject to maximum residue level constraints by focusing on the role of the official inspection systems established by public authorities. Findings The authors show how strengthening official controls does not systematically impact negatively on producers’ participation and does not always decrease supply. Moreover, the authors show that reinforcing the maximum permitted contamination thresholds is not always sufficient for ensuring consumer health. Originality/value The originality of the model is that it shows how all variables (economic and sanitary variables) interact in the formation of agricultural prices and determine the final size of the productive system (number of active producers). The characterisation of the market price as a function of producers’ investment efforts and of the level of official control reliability allows one to determine both the total supply and the proportion of this supply that is contaminated (i. e. does not comply with the maximum threshold of contamination) ...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} {{construction}} of gendered and ethnicised national identities in Australia and Japan. I conceptualise national identities as discourses of national belonging, discourses which are actively negotiated and ever-shifting. Specifically, I examine <b>authorised,</b> <b>mass</b> mediated and folk discourses of national identity in these two national settings. I draw my data from the following: Australian and Japanese state and academic publications; a sample of television advertisements in Australia and Japan; and focus groups and in-depth interviews with participants in two communities, 'Plainsview,' Tasmania and `Hirogawa,' Hokkaido. I pursue three main objectives in the thesis: I examine the ways national identities are constituted in <b>authorised</b> discourses, the <b>mass</b> media and face-to-face interactions in Australia and Japan; I examine the way discourses of national identity reflect, reinforce and challenge current power relations in Australia and Japan; and I examine the place of globalisation in Australian and Japanese constructions of national identity. I argue that <b>authorised,</b> <b>mass</b> mediated and folk discourses of national identity in Australia and Japan are imbricated in complex ways. Widely circulating discourses of national identity are not imposed on the masses in a top-down fashion, but {{are the product of}} active negotiations of meaning. Neither do such discourses go uncontested. I demonstrate that individuals in a variety of social locations challenge dominant discourses of national identity and construct counter-narratives of nation. Furthermore, I argue that discourses of national identity which marginalise women and ethnic Others in Australia and Japan, both mirror and help sustain the continued subordination of these social groups. At the same time, counter-narratives of nation constructed by Australians and Japanese both reflect and contribute to the changing status of marginalised groups in these two settings. Finally, I critique the notion that globalising political, economic and other social changes are destabilising national identities and rendering them less salient. Evidence presented in the thesis suggests that globalised social conditions are conducive to the generation of gendered and ethnicised discourses of national identity in Australia and Japan...|$|R
40|$|The {{additive}} hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine {{consists of}} synthetic R,S- 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylselenobutanoic acid (HMSeBA) and {{is intended to}} be used as a source of the essential trace element selenium for all animal species/categories. Based on data from tolerance studies in chickens and turkeys for fattening and piglets, the additive is considered as safe for all species/categories up to the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorised</b> total selenium level in complete feed. After being absorbed, HMSeBA is metabolised to selenomethionine; consequently, no residues of the compound itself occur in animal tissues and products. Compared with inorganic selenium sources, the use of HMSeBA in animal nutrition would result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from selenised yeast. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals supplemented with HMSeBA, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. The additive should be regarded as an eye irritant, but should not be classified as skin irritant or skin sensitiser. Inhalation exposure poses a hazard to users; the FEEDAP Panel concludes, therefore, that the formulation and conditions of use of the solid form of the additive should minimise user exposure by inhalation. The use of HMSeBA in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared to other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorised</b> content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. Based on the response of plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and the plasma/liver concentration of selenium in chickens for fattening and pigs for fattening, the FEEDAP Panel considers that HMSeBA is an efficaceous source of selenium for all animal species/categories. HMSeBA does not modify the quality of meat as measured by physico-chemical properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{additive}} methionine-zinc, technically pure (Met-Zinc) is zinc chelated with methionine in a {{molar ratio}} 1 : 2. It {{is intended to}} be used as a source of the amino acid in ruminants, and as compound of trace element for all species. The additive is safe for all animal species/categories considering that its use in supplementing feed is first limited by the regulatory maximum content of zinc. However, its contribution to dietary methionine needs consideration when formulating diets. The use of the additive will not modify the methionine content in tissues/products. Zinc from Met-Zinc would not lead to higher zinc deposition in tissues/products, and hence consumer exposure, than zinc from other authorised sources. The use of Met-Zinc in animal nutrition is safe for consumers when used up to the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorised</b> zinc level. In the absence of data, the compound should be considered as a potential irritant to skin and eye and skin sensitiser. Zinc compounds are hazardous by inhalation; Met-Zinc shows high dusting potential, thus exposure by inhalation represents a hazard to persons handling the additive. The use of Met-Zinc in feed as a source of zinc does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared with other sources of zinc for which it will substitute, as long as the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorised</b> content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. Methionine from the additive does not represent a risk to the environment. Based on data from a balance study on piglets and from a study on zinc tissue deposition in broilers, Met-Zinc is considered an efficacious source of zinc for all animal species/categories. The weak evidence seen for Met-Zinc is insufficient to conclude on its efficacy in ruminants; however, considering also an EFSA opinion on DL-Met, the Panel concludes that Met-Zinc has some potential as an effective source of methionine for ruminants...|$|R

40|$|Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl, {{provided}} as powder and as granulate, {{is intended for}} use as a copper source in animal nutrition. Tolerance studies with chicken for fattening and weaned piglets, allowed the FEEDAP Panel to conclude that copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is a safe source of copper for all animal species, provided that the <b>maximum</b> copper contents <b>authorised</b> in feed are respected. The supplementation of feeds with copper from copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl up to the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorised</b> copper levels is not expected to result in a different copper deposition in edible tissues/products than the standard inorganic source cupric sulphate pentahydrate. No concerns for consumer safety will arise from the use of the additive in animal nutrition, provided that the <b>maximum</b> copper contents <b>authorised</b> in feed are respected. The powder form of copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl should be considered as a risk by inhalation; exposure by inhalation should be minimised. Neither form of the additive is a dermal irritant but the powder form is an eye irritant. In the absence of data, it is considered prudent to regard both forms as potential skin sensitisers. Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is intended to be a substitute for other authorised copper additives; it will therefore not further increase the environmental burden from copper. Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is an efficacious source of copper in meeting animal requirements. The Panel made some recommendations regarding the Description and Conditions of use of the additive and the maximum residue limits established for copper in animal tissues and products...|$|R
