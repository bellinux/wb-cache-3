Entanglement with the Ottoman Empire was avoided due to its potential ability {{to take over the}} Bey's prerogatives; however, religious ties to the Caliph were fostered, adding prestige to the Beys and winning approval of the local ulama and deference from the notables. Janissaries were still recruited, but increasing reliance was placed on tribal forces. Turkish was spoken at the apex, but use of Arabic increased in government use. Kouloughlis (children of mixed Turkish and Tunisian parentage) and native Tunisians notables were given increased admittance into higher positions and deliberations. Yet the Husaynid Beys did not themselves intermarry with Tunisians; instead they often turned to the institution of mamluks. The dynasty never ceased to identify as Ottoman, and therefore privileged. Nonetheless, the local ulama were courted, with funding for religious education and the clerics. Maliki jurist entered government service. Rural <b>marabouts</b> were mollified. Tribal shaykhs were recognized and invited to conferences. Especially favored were a handful of prominent families, Turkish speaking, who were given business and land opportunities, as well as important posts in the government, depending on their loyalty.|$|E

500|$|The {{movement}} was primarily religious, {{and its leaders}} included both Mandé and Fulbe <b>marabouts.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Muhammad al-Sheikh {{proceeded}} to invade Wattasid Fez in September 1544/5, defeating and capturing the sultan Ahmad al-Wattasi. [...] But the religious jurists and the Qadiri <b>marabouts,</b> strong in Fez, refused him {{entry into the}} city. [...] Muhammad al-Sheikh was forced him to lay siege and finally conquered the city by force in September 1549. The Saadians {{proceeded to}} advance east and annex Tlemcen in 1550.|$|E
2500|$|In 1458, Marinid emir Abd al-Haqq II finally {{cleared out}} his {{powerful}} Wattasid viziers, who had dominated {{the palace of}} Fez for nearly forty years. The Hintata chiefs of Marrakesh promptly broke off into open revolt and the country took a decided turn towards the Sufi <b>marabouts.</b> It is reported that al-Jazuli, {{at the head of}} 13,000 followers from the Sous, crossed over the Atlas and established Sufi zawiya all over the country, a score of them in Marrakesh alone. The assassination of Imam al-Jazuli in 1465 by Marinid agents led to an uprising in Fez which finally brought the Marinid sultanate to an ignominious end. [...] A new wave of anarchy followed. [...] The prospects of turning Morocco into a Sufi republic was interrupted by the return of the Wattasids, who seized power in Fez by 1472, this time installing themselves as sultans, but they were unable to exert their power much beyond the environs of Fez. The Hintata emirs in Marrakesh were similarly confined, the bulk of the south crumbling into the hands of local Sufi <b>marabouts.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Saadians faced {{difficulties}} legitimizing their rule. As sharifs, descendents of the Prophet, {{they claimed}} to stand above the ulama (religious jurists) and the Ottoman caliph. [...] But the Saadians had no secure tribal basis, their ascendancy had been consistently {{opposed by the}} Maliki religious jurists and the rival Qadiri branch of Sufi <b>marabouts,</b> and many questioned their claims of sharifian ancestry and their jihadist credentials (in light of the Spanish alliance). The Saadians responded to these doubts in [...] "the language of monuments", their showpiece: Marrakesh.|$|E
2500|$|Sembène {{continued}} {{this theme}} with the 1973 novel Xala, {{the story of}} an El Hadji Abdou Kader Beye, a rich businessman struck by what he believes to be a curse of impotence ("xala" [...] in Wolof) on the night of his wedding to his beautiful, young third wife. El Hadji grows obsessed with removing the curse through visits to <b>marabouts,</b> but only after losing most of his money and reputation does he discover the source to be the beggar who lives outside his offices, whom he wronged in acquiring his fortune.|$|E
2500|$|Al-Rashid {{started his}} {{campaign}} from Taza {{in the north}} and entered Fez in 1666, where he was proclaimed sultan. Two years later, he defeated the Dili <b>marabouts</b> that controlled the Middle Atlas. Muley al-Rashid proceeded south to capture Marrakesh in 1669, massacring the Shabana Arabs in the process. He then proceeded down into the Sous, conquering it by 1670, thereby reunifying Morocco (save for the coastal areas, which would take a little longer). [...] Al-Rashid is usually credited for the erecting the shrine and mosque of Qadi Iyad ("Cadi Ayyad") in Marrakesh, where the remains of his father, Ali al-Sharif, stem of the Alawite dynasty, were translated. Two later Alawite rulers (Moulay Suleiman and Muhammad IV) would choose be buried here as well.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the rest}} of Morocco was parcelled out to other parties, Marrakesh {{remained}} practically the sole citadel of a succession of irrelevant Saadian sultans, their small southern dominion only extending from {{the foot of the}} High Atlas to the Bou Regreg. [...] The neighboring middle Atlas, Sous and Draa valleys were in the hands of rivals and <b>marabouts,</b> and the Atlantic coast in the hands of various local warlords and companies of Morisco corsairs. [...] In 1659, the Shabana (Chebana, Shibanna, Shbanat), an Arab Bedouin tribe of Hillalian descent, once part of the Saadian army, seized control of Marrakesh and put the last Saadian sultan, Abdul al-Abbas, to death. [...] Their qaid, Abd al-Karim ibn Abu Bakr al-Shbani declared himself the new sultan of Marrakesh.|$|E
2500|$|Sufism {{had arrived}} in the Maghreb and local Sufi <b>marabouts</b> arose to fill the vacuum of declining Marinid central power. At least two main {{branches}} of Sufi maraboutism can be identified:- the Shadhiliyya (strong in Marrakesh, the Sous, the Rif and Tlemcen), was more radical and oppositional to the established Marinid-Wattasid authorities, [...] while the Qadiriyya (influential in Fez, Touat, Algiers and Bougie) was more moderate and cooperative. [...] Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Jazuli ("Sidi Ben Slimane"), a Sufi Shadhili imam from the Sous, catapulted to prominence in the mid-15th century. [...] Being a sharif (i.e. a descendant from the family of the Prophet Muhammad), Imam al-Jazuli rode a wave of nostalgia for the 9th-century sharifian Idrisids, whose popular cult had recently been revived, partly as a contradistinction to the unpopular Marinids-Wattasids.|$|E
60|$|Yakoub and Eyoub with {{flashing}} sabres {{were actually}} flying at each other, but <b>Marabouts</b> were seizing them and holding them back, and the Sunakite's chant arose {{above all the}} uproar.|$|E
60|$|The Cabeleyzes, {{though most}} {{irregular}} Moslems, were extremely superstitious as regarded the supernatural arts {{supposed to be}} possessed by the <b>Marabouts,</b> and if these could be induced {{to take up the}} cause of the prisoners, there would be at least some chance of their success.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{like such}} a pair of milkmaid's cheeks, looking so ridiculously delighted, too,' said Lady Bannerman, crossly. 'Really, Phoebe, one would think you were but just come up from the country, and {{had never been to}} a concert before. Those stupid little white <b>marabouts</b> in your hair again, too!' ...|$|E
60|$|This {{completed}} the alarm. The bodyguard fled away pell-mell, Yakoub after them. His women shut themselves into some innermost recesses, {{and the field}} was left to the <b>Marabouts</b> and the prisoners, who, not understanding what all this meant, were still kneeling in their corner. Hadji Eseb bade Arthur and the interpreter go to reassure them.|$|E
60|$|The sabres were sheathed, {{and there}} was a {{shuffling}} away at the advance of the <b>Marabouts,</b> Sheyk Yakoub making some apology about having delayed to admit such guests, but excusing himself on the score of supposing they were emissaries sent by those whose authority he so defied that he had sworn to slaughter his prisoners rather than surrender them.|$|E
60|$|The Consuls were {{somewhat}} disgusted {{at the notion}} of having recourse to the <b>Marabouts,</b> whom the French Consul called vilains charlatan, and the English one filthy scoundrels and impostors. Like the Indian Fakirs, opined Captain Beresford; like the begging friars, said M. Dessault, and to this the Consuls assented. Just, however, as the Dominicans, besides the low class of barefooted friars, had a learned and cultivated set of brethren in high repute at the Universities, and a general at Rome, so it appeared that the <b>Marabouts,</b> besides their wild crew of masterful beggars, living at free quarters, partly through pretended sanctity, partly through the awe inspired by cabalistic arts, had a higher class who dwelt in cities, and were highly esteemed, for the sake of either ten years' abstinence from food or the attainment of fifty sciences, by one or other of which means an angelic nature was held to be attained.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now {{heaven and}} all the saints be praised! The Chevalier safe and well! 'Tis a very miracle!' cried Lanty, letting fall his burthen, as he clasped his hands in ecstasy and {{performed}} a caper which, {{in spite of all}} his master Eyoub's respect for the <b>Marabouts,</b> brought a furious yell of rage, and a tremendous blow with the cudgel, which Lanty, in his joy, seemed to receive {{as if it had been}} a feather.|$|E
60|$|Fifty sciences! This greatly {{astonished}} the strangers, {{but they}} were told by the residents that all {{the knowledge of the}} highly cultivated Arabs of Bagdad and the Moors of Spain had been handed on to the select few of their African descendants, and that really beautiful poetry was still produced by the <b>Marabouts.</b> Certainly no one present could doubt of the architectural skill and taste of the Algerines, and Mr. Thompson declared that not a tithe of the wonders of their mechanical art had been seen, describing the wonderful silver tree of Tlemcen, covered with birds, who, by the action of wind, were made to produce the songs of each different species which they represented, till a falcon on the topmost branch uttered a harsh cry, and all became silent. General education had, however, fallen to a low ebb among the population, and the wisdom of the ancients was chiefly concentrated among the higher class of <b>Marabouts,</b> whose headquarters were at Bugia, and their present chief, Hadji Eseb Ben Hassan, had the reputation of a saint, which the Consuls believed to be well founded.|$|E
6000|$|JOHN.--What a good fellow you are, sir! You'd {{give your}} head off your shoulders, that you would. Is the fish for dinner to-day? Band-box for my lady, I suppose, sir? [Looks in]--Turban, feathers, bugles, <b>marabouts,</b> spangles--doose knows what. Yes, it's for her ladyship. [To Page.] Charles, take this band-box to her ladyship's maid. [To his master.] What sauce would you like with the turbot? Lobster sauce or Hollandaise? Hollandaise is best--most {{wholesome}} for you. Anybody besides Captain Touchit coming to dinner? ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>Marabouts</b> had, {{at their}} chief's signal, ranged {{themselves}} {{in front of}} the inner court, and the authority of the Hadji had imposed silence even on the fanatic. He spoke again, making them understand that Frankish vengeance in case of a massacre could reach them even in their mountains when backed by the Dey. And to Abderrahman he represented that the only safety for his son, the only peace for his tribe, was in the surrender of these two dangerous causes of altercation.|$|E
60|$|Hadji Eseb averted {{a further}} blow; and {{understanding}} from Arthur {{that the poor}} fellow's transport {{was caused by the}} tidings of the safety of his master's son, he seemed touched, and bade that he and Eyoub should lead the way to the place of durance of the chief prisoners. On the way Ibrahim Aga interrogated both Eyoub in vernacular Arabic and Lanty in French. The former was sullen, only speaking from his evident awe of the <b>Marabouts,</b> the latter voluble with joy and hope.|$|E
60|$|Meantime Hebert, having ascertained {{that both}} the Jew and Hassan were going away, the one to Constantina, the other to Algiers, wrote, and so did Estelle, to the Consul at Algiers, {{explaining}} their position and entreating to be ransomed. Though only nine years old, Estelle could write a very fair letter, and the amazement of the Arabs was unbounded that any female creature should wield a pen. <b>Marabouts</b> and merchants were known to read the Koran, but {{if one of the}} goats had begun to write, their wonder could hardly have been greater; and such crowds came to witness the extraordinary operation that she could scarcely breathe or see.|$|E
60|$|The <b>Marabouts</b> {{seemed to}} be praying or reciting the Koran {{on one side of}} it, for there was a {{continuous}} chant or hum going on there; but they seemed to have no objection to the Christians sitting together on the other side conversing and exchanging accounts of their adventures. Maitre Hebert could not sufficiently dilate on the spirit, cheerfulness, and patience that Mademoiselle had displayed through all. He only had to lament her imprudence in trying to talk of the Christian faith to the children, telling them stories of the saints, and doing what, if all the tribe had not been so ignorant, would have brought destruction on them all. 'I would not have Monseigneur there know of it for worlds,' said he, glancing at the Grand Marabout.|$|E
6000|$|Nor {{did they}} come up with the party till they found them waiting in the road, close to the Rays' lodgings, having evidently just missed them, for Mr. Ogilvie and the clergyman were turning back to look for them when they were gladly hailed, half apologised to, half laughed at by a babel of voices, among which Nita's was the loudest, informing her sister that she had lost the best bit of all, for just {{at the turn of the}} lane there had come on them Babie's fiery-eyed monster, which had [...] "burst on the path," [...] when they were in mid song, {{flashing}} over them, and revealing, first a horse, and then a brougham, wherein there sat the august forms of Colonel and Mrs. Brownlow, going home from a state dinner, the lady's very <b>marabouts</b> quivering with horror.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was only}} just {{time for a}} start and a response, 'M. Arture! And is it yourself?' before a howl of vituperation was heard--of abuse of all the ancestry of the cur of an infidel slave, the father of tardiness--and a savage-looking man appeared, brandishing a cudgel, with which {{he was about to}} belabour his unfortunate slave, when he was arrested by astonishment, and perhaps terror, at the goodly company of <b>Marabouts.</b> Hadji Eseb entered into {{conversation}} with him, and meanwhile Lanty broke forth, 'O wirrah, wirrah, Master Arthur! an' have they made a haythen Moor of ye? By the powers, but this is worse than all. What will Mademoiselle say?--she that has held up the faith of every one of us, like a little saint and martyr as she is! Though, to be sure, ye are but a Protestant; only these folks don't know the differ.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Le Geyt {{smiled a}} {{compassionate}} smile. [...] "Ah, I forgot," [...] she cooed, sweetly. [...] "Dear Hugo never CAN understand the upbringing of children. It {{is a sense}} denied him. We women know"--with a sage nod. [...] "They were wild little savages when I took them in hand first--weren't you, Maisie? Do you remember, dear, how you broke the looking-glass in the boudoir, like an untamed young monkey? Talking of monkeys, Mr. Cotswould, HAVE you seen those delightful, clever, amusing French pictures at that place in Suffolk Street? There's a man there--a Parisian--I forget his honoured name--Leblanc, or Lenoir, or Lebrun, or something--but he's a most humorous artist, and he paints monkeys and storks {{and all sorts of}} queer beasties ALMOST as quaintly and expressively as you do. Mind, I say ALMOST, for I never will allow that any Frenchman could do anything QUITE so good, quite so funnily mock-human, as your <b>marabouts</b> and professors." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} cold, being {{the last week}} in November, and all were wrapped in heavy woollen haiks over their white garments, except one wild-looking fellow, whose legs and arms were bare, and who only seemed to possess one garment of coarse dark sackcloth. He skipped and ran {{by the side of}} the mules, {{chanting}} and muttering, and Ibrahim observed in French that he was one of the Sunakites, or fanatic <b>Marabouts,</b> and advised Arthur to beware of him; but, though dangerous in himself, his presence would be a sufficient protection from all other thieves or vagabonds. Indeed, Arthur saw the fellow glaring unpleasantly at him, when the sun summoned all the rest to their morning devotions. He was glad that he had made the fact of his Christianity known, for he could no more act Moslem than be one, and Hadji Eseb kept the Sunakite in check by a stern glance, so that no harm ensued.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was just}} going to {{commence}} a tirade regarding the aristocracy here, and to rage against that cool assumption of superiority which distinguishes their lordships' commerce with artists of all sorts: that politeness which, if it condescends to receive artists at all, takes care to have them altogether, so {{that there can be no}} mistake about their rank--that august patronage of art which rewards it with a silly flourish of knighthood, to be sure, but takes care to exclude it from any contact with its betters in society--I was, I say, just going to commence a tirade against the aristocracy for excluding artists from their company, and to be extremely satirical upon them, for instance, for not receiving my friend Morgiana, when it suddenly came into my head to ask, was Mrs. Walker fit to move in the best society?--to which query it must humbly be replied that she was not. Her education was not such as to make her quite the equal of Baker Street. She was a kind honest and clever creature; but, it must be confessed, not refined. Wherever she went she had, if not the finest, at any rate the most showy gown in the room; her ornaments were the biggest; her hats, toques, berets, <b>marabouts,</b> and other fallals, always the most conspicuous. She drops [...] "h's" [...] here and there. I have seen her eat peas with a knife (and Walker, scowling on the opposite side of the table, striving in vain to catch her eye); and I shall never forget Lady Smigsmag's horror when she asked for porter at dinner at Richmond, and began to drink it out of the pewter pot. It was a fine sight. She lifted up the tankard with one of the finest arms, covered with the biggest bracelets ever seen; and had a bird of paradise on her head, that curled round the pewter disc of the pot as she raised it, like a halo. These peculiarities she had, and has still. She is best away from the genteel world, that is the fact. When she says that [...] "The weather is so 'ot that it is quite debiliating;" [...] when she laughs, when she hits her neighbour at dinner on the side of the waistcoat (as she will if he should say anything that amuses her), she does what is perfectly natural and unaffected on her part, but what is not customarily done among polite persons, who can sneer at her odd manners and her vanity, but don't know the kindness, honesty, and simplicity which distinguish her. This point being admitted, it follows, of course, that the tirade against the aristocracy would, in the present instance, be out of place--so it shall be reserved for some other occasion.|$|E
5000|$|HRW {{has warned}} that the social status enjoyed by <b>marabouts</b> has emboldened “those {{responsible}} for the proliferation of forced child begging and other abuses committed by the <b>marabouts</b> against talibé children.” [...] Perry cautiously agrees that “reverence of <b>marabouts</b> {{and respect for the}} talibé institution may be a dominant ideology, but it is not now, nor ever was, totalising or uncontested.” ...|$|E
50|$|In the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, <b>marabouts</b> are {{organized}} in elaborate hierarchies; the highest marabout of the Mourides, for example, has been elevated {{to the status}} of a Caliph or ruler of the faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). Older, North African based traditions such as the Tijaniyyah and the Qadiriyyah base their structures on respect for teachers and religious leaders who, south of the Sahara, often are called <b>marabouts.</b> Those who devote themselves to prayer or study, either based in communities, religious centers, or wandering in the larger society, are named <b>marabouts.</b> In Senegal and Mali, these <b>Marabouts</b> rely on donations to live. Often there is a traditional bond to support a specific marabout that has accumulated over generations within a family. <b>Marabouts</b> normally dress in traditional West African robes and live a simple, ascetic life.|$|E

5000|$|The Senegalese have {{a mystical}} aspect to Islam, much like other Sufism brotherhoods. In Senegal, Islamic {{practice}} usually requires membership in religious brotherhoods that {{are dedicated to}} the <b>marabouts</b> of these groups. <b>Marabouts</b> {{are believed to be}} the mediators between Allah and the people. The people seek the help of <b>marabouts</b> for protection from the evil spirits, to improve one’s status (in terms of career, love or relationship, finances etc.), to obtain a cure or remedy for sickness, or even to curse an enemy. <b>Marabouts</b> are believed {{to have the ability to}} deal with the spirit world and seek the spirits’ help in things impossible for humans. The spirits’ help is sought since they are thought to be a source of much baraka [...] "blessings, divine grace".|$|E
50|$|The {{significant}} religious {{authority is}} the marabout. He {{is believed to}} be a miracle worker, a physician, and a mystic, who exercises both magical and moral authority. He is also respected as a dispenser of amulets, which protect the wearer—Muslim or non-Muslim—against evil. The influence of <b>marabouts</b> has produced a number of reactions in Ivoirian society, among them a series of reformist movements. These reform movements often condemn Sufism and <b>marabouts</b> as un-Islamic, but the poor see that <b>marabouts</b> often speak out on behalf of the downtrodden.|$|E
