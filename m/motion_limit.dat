40|$|Recently a {{negative}} nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) among the backbone protons {{as well as}} a positive NOE between the backbone and ring protons of tryptophan in a peptide was reported. While the negative NOE is indicative of slow overall reorientation of the molecule, simultaneous Occurrence of a positive NOE is indicative of internal motions in the molecule. To explain these observations we develop here a model in which the overall motion is anisotropic reorientation and the internal motion modulates the internuclear distance. Analytical expressions for the spectral density functions for dipole-dipole relaxation are obtained when the internal motion is a bistable jump. Steady-state and transient NOE calculations are performed for two relaxation-coupled spins. The results confirm that when the overall motion is in the slow <b>motion</b> <b>limit</b> and the side chain internal motion is in the fast <b>motion</b> <b>limit,</b> the NOE within the backbone protons is negative and that between the backbone and the side chain protons is positive. This model further shows that the NOE between the backbone and the side chain is proportional to the weighted average of the inverse sixth power of the distance between the interacting spins only when the overall motion is isotropic, dominates the relaxation process and is much faster than the internal motion. With use of this model, multispin steady-state NOES are computed to explain the experimental observation of positive and negative NOE’s and their temperature dependence in a tryptophan-containing polypeptide...|$|E

We describe the system dynamics in a master equation approach in the Brownian <b>motion</b> <b>limit</b> of slow particles and fast phonons, which we find appropriate for our system. In a wide regime of parameters, the reduced dynamics of the particles leads to physical realizations of extended Hubbard models with tuneable long-range interactions mediated by crystal phonons.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the steady state statistics of turbulence in general classes of dissipative hydrodynamic equations, where the fluctuations are sustained by a random source concentrated at large scales. It {{is well known}} that in some particular cases, such as non-relativistic incompressible turbulence, a Kolmogorov-type exact scaling relation for a correlation function holds. We show that all such scaling relations follow from a general relation on the current-density correlation function. The derivation does not require an energy cascade picture and suggests that this traditional interpretation of the Kolmogorov relation for incompressible turbulence may be misleading. Using this we derive exact scaling results for compressible turbulence in relativistic hydrodynamics, which reduce in the slow <b>motion</b> <b>limit</b> to the Kolmogorov relation. We discuss the experimental implications of the results...|$|E
