25|$|Another {{evolution}} of Taliban ideology was <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> 1999 decree {{calling for the}} protection of the Buddha statues at Bamyan and the March 2001 destruction of them.|$|E
25|$|As the Pakistani Army began offensives {{against the}} Pakistani Taliban, many {{unfamiliar}} with the region thought incorrectly that the assault was against the Afghan Taliban of <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> which was not the case.|$|E
25|$|One {{day before}} the August 1998 capture of Mazar, bin Laden {{affiliates}} bombed two U.S. embassies in Africa, killing 224 and wounding 4,500, mostly Africans. The U.S. responded by launching cruise missiles on suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan, killing over 20 though failing to kill bin Laden or even many Al-Qaeda. <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> condemned the missile attack and American President Bill Clinton. Saudi Arabia expelled the Taliban envoy in protest over the refusal to turn over bin Laden, and after <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> allegedly insulted the Saudi royal family. In mid-October the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to ban commercial aircraft flights to and from Afghanistan, and freeze its bank accounts worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Excerpt from <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar's</b> August 22, 1998, {{phone call}} with a U.S. diplomat ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{emerged as}} a major tribal leader soon after the 2004 death of Nek Mohammad. [...] In a {{ceremony}} attended by five leading Taliban commanders, including Mullah Dadullah, Baitullah was appointed <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar's</b> governor of the Mehsud area.|$|R
2500|$|The Taliban {{have been}} criticized for their {{strictness}} toward those who disobeyed their imposed rules, and <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar's</b> taking of the title of Amir al-Mu'minin. [...] Many Muslims complained that most Taliban rules had no basis in the Qur'an or sharia.|$|R
25|$|That year, <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> {{is said to}} {{have argued}} that Bin Laden should not draw further {{reprisals}} against Afghanistan by striking the United States again. This led to a schism among al-Qaeda leadership, where Atef sided with Bin Laden, while leaders like Saif al Adel sided with Omar.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the attacks, the US government responded militarily, and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the Taliban regime it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. Before the US attacked, it offered Taliban leader <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were Paramilitary Officers from the CIA's elite Special Activities Division (SAD).|$|E
25|$|Taliban decision-makers, {{particularly}} <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar,</b> seldom if {{ever talked}} directly to non-Muslim foreigners, so aid providers {{had to deal}} with intermediaries whose approvals and agreements were often reversed. Around September 1997 the heads of three UN agencies in Kandahar were expelled from the country after protesting when a female attorney for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees was forced to talk from behind a curtain so her face would not be visible.|$|E
50|$|Many groups {{crossed into}} Afghanistan {{including}} the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan with its leader Usman Ghazi. He found a sanctuary in Zabul province of Afghanistan besides Mullah Mansoor Dadullah. Mansour was vocal against the Taliban leadership that had emerged after <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar's</b> death.|$|R
50|$|As {{the burden}} of {{sanctuary}} and protection extends even to fighting against government troops {{on behalf of the}} person seeking refuge, some have suggested that <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar's</b> refusal to turn in Osama bin Laden was due only to his having availed himself of nanawatai.|$|R
50|$|Having {{become a}} foot soldier for several known Taliban commanders, he {{eventually}} {{became a member of}} Taliban leader <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar’s</b> elite mobile reserve force before the attacks on September 11, 2001. From 2003 onwards Rauf served as a Taliban spokesman, and was the Taliban's last Governor of Konar Province.|$|R
25|$|Iran has {{historically}} been {{an enemy of the}} Taliban. In early August 1998, after attacking the city of Mazar, Taliban forces killed several thousand civilians and 10 Iranian diplomats and intelligence officers in the Iranian consulate. Alleged radio intercepts indicate <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> personally approved the killings. In the following crisis between Iran and the Taliban, the Iranian government amassed up to 200,000 regular troops on the Afghan-Iranian border. War was eventually averted.|$|E
25|$|Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei made a 95-minute {{documentary}} titled The Giant Buddhas (released in March 2006) on the statues, {{the international}} reactions to their destruction, and {{an overview of}} the controversy. Testimony by local Afghans validates that Osama bin Laden ordered the destruction and that, initially, <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> and the Afghans in Bamiyan opposed it.. A novel titled 'An Afghan Winter' provides a fictional backdrop to the destruction of the Buddhas {{and its impact on the}} global Buddhist community.|$|E
25|$|Decisions {{are based}} on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us {{consultation}} is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> will be the highest authority and the government {{will not be able to}} implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with Sharia and therefore we reject them.|$|E
50|$|When the Soviets left in 1988, {{the leader}} of the Mujahideen group Hizb-i-Islami, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, began to fight with Jamil al-Rahman over control of the area. Hekmatyar was victorious and {{eventually}} his troops sacked Asadabad. By 1996 however, <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar's</b> Taliban had invaded Kunar and driven out Hekmatyar.|$|R
50|$|Abdul Rauf {{testified that}} he was from Helmand Province, and that an injury from a Soviet land mine had left him too injured for {{military}} duties, so he had been employed providing food during his Taliban conscription. Having become a foot soldier for several known Taliban commanders, he eventually {{became a member of}} Taliban leader <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar’s</b> elite mobile reserve force before the attacks on September 11, 2001. He was the Taliban's last Governor of Konar Province.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{an extreme}} form of Islamism, Bin Laden {{believed}} that the restoration of God's law will set things right in the Muslim world. He stated, [...] "When we used to follow Muhammad's revelation we were in great happiness and in great dignity, to Allah belongs the credit and praise." [...] He believed [...] "the only Islamic country" [...] in the Muslim world was Afghanistan {{under the rule of}} <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar's</b> Taliban before that regime was overthrown in late 2001.|$|R
25|$|In Pakistan, Khadr renovated an {{abandoned}} building, which had previously {{used by the}} KhAD secret police, {{to be used for}} his charity, but once it was refurbished, the government announced they would re-take control of the building. An angry Khadr wrote a letter to Taliban leader <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar,</b> complaining that he should be compensated for the money he spent in fixing the building. He clashed with the Taliban again when they objected to the fact he had opened a school for girls, who were not allowed to receive an education under Taliban law.|$|E
25|$|In late September 2001, VOA aired {{a report}} that {{contained}} brief excerpts of an interview with then Taliban leader <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> Mohammad, along with segments from President Bush's post-9/11 speech to Congress, an expert in Islam from Georgetown University, and comments by {{the foreign minister of}} Afghanistan's anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. State Department officials including Richard Armitage and others argued that the report amounted to giving terrorists a platform to express their views. In response, reporters and editors argued for the VOA's editorial independence from its governors. VOA received praise from press organizations for its protests, and the following year in 2002, it won the University of Oregon's Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism.|$|E
25|$|Southern Afghanistan {{was under}} the control of neither foreign-backed militias nor the {{government}} in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as Gul Agha Sherzai and their militias. In 1994, the Taliban (a movement originating from Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the tyranny of the local governor. <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> started his movement with fewer than 50 armed madrassah students in his hometown of Kandahar. When the Taliban took control of the city in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities. In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|Mohammed Saduq {{acknowledged}} to his interrogators {{that he had}} met <b>Mullah</b> Mohammed <b>Omar,</b> and much of his interrogations focussed around these brief meetings.|$|R
50|$|On February 26, 2001, the Taliban’s supreme leader, <b>Mullah</b> Mohammad <b>Omar,</b> declared, “these idols {{have been}} gods of the infidels” and ordered them destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} primary factors favor release or transfer :a. At {{the time}} of his capture, the detainee claims he was attempting to assist the U.S. in capturing <b>Mullah</b> Mohammed <b>Omar.</b> He claims if the Americans had not arrested him, then they might have captured <b>Mullah</b> Mohammed <b>Omar</b> and the detainee's superior, Qari Ahmadullah, head of Taliban Intelligence.:b. Detainee has very few citations, primarily for non-aggressive infractions including physical training in cell, leading prayer; making excessive noise; and periodically refusing medications, food, and showers.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{pipeline}} was {{to pass through}} Afghanistan, {{it was necessary to}} work with the Taliban. The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley, moved into CentGas in 1997. In January 1998, the Taliban, selecting CentGas over Argentinian competitor Bridas Corporation, signed an agreement that allowed the proposed project to proceed. In June 1998, Russian Gazprom relinquished its 10% stake in the project. On 7 August 1998, American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed. The United States alleged that Osama bin Laden was behind those attacks, and all pipeline negotiations halted, as the Taliban's then leader, <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar,</b> announced that bin Laden had the Taliban's support. Unocal withdrew from the consortium on 8 December 1998, and soon after closed its offices in Afghanistan and Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Photos of a {{training}} camp for Uyghur children {{run by the}} Turkistan Islamic Party were released by Islam Awazi. Photos released by Turkistan Islamic Party's Islam Awazi media which showed Uyghur militants along with Uyghur children in Syria, including one child holding an AK-47, the Uyghurs cooperated with Jabhat Al-Nusra and had pledged alleigance (bay'ah) to Taliban leader <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar.</b> Another photo released by Islam Awazi showed Uyghur children training with AK-47's and with shahada headbands at a camp in the Afpak (Afghanistan-Pakistan) region. Pictures were released by Islam Awazi of Afghanistan-based Turkistan Islamic Party training children for Jihad. A video of {{a training}} camp in Waziristan in Pakistan's tribal areas showing children being trained with weapons was released by the Turkistan Islamic Party's Islam Awazi.|$|E
25|$|Kabul was {{occupied}} {{by a number of}} mujahideen rebel groups and warlords before Najibullah's government collapsed in 1992. The city and province were contested by the various rebel forces who fought for power until it was captured by the Taliban in 1996. A new strict law was introduced by the Taliban. There was very little information on how Afghanistan was governed but the country had only one leader, <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar,</b> the head of Taliban who fled to Pakistan after the US-led invasion on October 7, 2001. The Taliban laws were quickly abolished and humanities came in effect to enable Kabul to recover from the destruction caused by the mujahideen and Taliban forces. The 2002 loya jirga took place to solve the country's political problems.|$|E
5000|$|Since mid-2005, {{the militants}} have {{maintained}} a multilingual website that has repeatedly changed service providers {{to avoid being}} shut down. On April 9, The Washington Post reported that, {{for more than a}} year, a Houston-based firm had unwittingly hosted a site claiming to be the voice of the [...] "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan" [...] (the name of <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar's</b> regime, deposed by the 2001 U.S. invasion) before it was identified as such. It was updated with official messages and battlefield reports that were clearly and incredulous pieces of propaganda.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{considers}} {{the construction of}} the terrorist Other, in relation to the fractured Self of the Coalition of the Willing. Despite mutual appeals to the essential evil-ness of enemies during the War on Terror, analyzing the discursive construction of threat and Otherness reveals that divergent understandings of Self-identity inevitably impacted upon a heterogeneous construction of Osama bin Laden’s Al Qaeda and <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar’s</b> Taliban, as well as Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath Party. In making this argument the chapter analyzes speeches from political leaders in the United States, Britain and Australia shortly after the events of September 11 th, 2001...|$|R
50|$|Mullah Mohammad Rabbani Akhund (1955 - 15 April 2001) {{was one of}} {{the main}} leaders of the Taliban movement. He was second in power only to the supreme leader, <b>Mullah</b> Mohammed <b>Omar,</b> in the Taliban hierarchy.|$|R
25|$|NATO and Afghan troops {{led many}} offensives against the Taliban in this period. By 2009, a Taliban-led shadow {{government}} began to form, complete {{with their own}} version of mediation court. In 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama deployed an additional 30,000 soldiers over a period of six months and proposed that he would begin troop withdrawals by 2012. At the 2010 International Conference on Afghanistan in London, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he intended {{to reach out to the}} Taliban leadership (including <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar,</b> Sirajuddin Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar). Supported by senior U.S. officials Karzai called on the group's leadership to take part in a loya jirga meeting to initiate peace talks. According to the Wall Street Journal, these steps were initially reciprocated with an intensification of bombings, assassinations and ambushes.|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 1998, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, {{and three}} other leaders of Islamic militant {{organizations}} issued a fatwa {{in the name of}} the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, publishing it in Al-Quds Al-Arabi. Deploring the stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, the alleged U.S. aim to fragment Iraq, and U.S. support for Israel, they declared that [...] "The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies — civilian and military — is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it." [...] In spring 1998, Saudi elites became concerned about the threat posed by al-Qaeda and bin Laden; militants attempted to infiltrate surface-to-air missiles inside the kingdom, an al-Qaeda defector alleged that Saudis were bankrolling bin Laden, and bin Laden himself lambasted the Saudi royal family. In June 1998, Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah (Saudi intelligence) director Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud traveled to Tarnak Farms to meet with Taliban leader <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> to discuss the question of bin Laden. Turki demanded that the Taliban either expel bin Laden from Afghanistan or hand him over to the Saudis, insisting that removing bin Laden was the price of cordial relations with the Kingdom. American analysts believed Turki offered a large amount of financial aid to resolve the dispute over bin Laden. Omar agreed to the deal, and the Saudis sent the Taliban 400 pickup trucks and funding, enabling the Taliban to retake Mazar-i-Sharif. While the Taliban sent a delegation to Saudi Arabia in July for further discussions, the negotiations stalled by August.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2001, {{the statues}} were {{destroyed}} by the Taliban of <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> following a decree issued by him. The Taliban supreme leader <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar</b> explained why he ordered the statues to be destroyed in an interview: ...|$|E
50|$|Just {{weeks before}} the Taliban {{admitted}} that it had hid <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar’s</b> death for over two years, Ghazi had released a statement questioning {{the status of the}} Taliban leader and praising the Islamic State. Ghazi likely viewed the Taliban’s admission as confirmation that he was right to be skeptical all along, and on August 6, 2015, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan released a video that featured the group’s leader, Uthman Ghazi, and numerous IMU fighters swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Usman Ghazi and the IMU officially pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and merged with its fledgling Khorasan province.|$|R
5000|$|These beliefs, in {{conjunction}} with violent jihad, have sometimes been called Qutbism after being promoted by Sayyid Qutb. Bin Laden believed that Afghanistan, {{under the rule of}} <b>Mullah</b> <b>Omar's</b> Taliban, was [...] "the only Islamic country" [...] in the Muslim world. Bin Laden consistently dwelt on the need for violent jihad to right what he believed were injustices against Muslims perpetrated by the United States and sometimes by other non-Muslim states. He also called for the elimination of the Israeli state, and called upon the United States to withdraw all of its civilians and military personnel from the Middle East, as well as from every Islamic country of the world.|$|R
25|$|Until {{his death}} in 2013, <b>Mullah</b> Mohammed <b>Omar</b> was the supreme {{commander}} of the Taliban. Mullah Akhtar Mansour was elected as his replacement in 2015, and following Mansour's killing in a May 2016 U.S. drone strike, Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada became the group's leader.|$|R
