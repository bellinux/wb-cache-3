Moreover, they combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous solid catalysts in esterification reactions, which enabled them to <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> homogeneous <b>catalysts</b> to catalyze the reactions and be conveniently recovered by simple filtration after the reactions. They could be reused several times without noticeable decrease in efficiency...|$|R

50|$|These strikes, {{along with}} the 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike (led by the Communist Party USA), were {{important}} victories after years of union defeats led by class collaborationist union bureaucrats.

5000|$|Traditionally, {{aryl halides}} (ArX) {{alkylate}} amines only reluctantly. The reaction usually requires [...] "activated" [...] aryl halides, {{such as those}} with strong electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups ortho or para to the halogen atom. For the arylation of amines with unactivated aryl halides, the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction is useful. In this process, palladium complexes <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>catalysts.</b>|$|R
