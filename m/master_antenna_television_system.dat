This paper studies the performance of digital collective systems {{in the presence of a}} noisy phase reference (phase noise) and a noisy clock reference (clock jitter). For this purpose, an attempt has been made to characterize the performance of this digital transmission system through the bit error rate (BER) or symbol error rate (SER) as a function of the Eb/No ratio. The Eb/No ratio has been parametrised by phase noise and clock jitter, obtained through computer simulations. It is shown that these effects produce a significant increase in the BER/SER performance. The simulator used was the SPW (Signal Processing WorkSystem) by means of which the BER/SER has been estimated using a quasianalytical (semianalytic) approach and the Monte Carlo method, so that the results can be compared and checkedPublicad...|$|R

He found that with a large antenna he could receive KRSC's signal on the roof of the Hotel Astoria and from there he ran coaxial cable across the street to his apartment. When the station (now KING-TV) went on the air in November 1948, Parsons was the only one in town able to see television.
