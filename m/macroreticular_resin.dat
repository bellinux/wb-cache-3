40|$|The {{influence}} of the concentration of polar reactants and products on the working-state morphology of ion exchange catalysts has been investigated over different acidic ion-exchange resins for di-n-octyl ether (DNOE) synthesis from 1 -octanol dehydration at 423 - 448 K and atmospheric pressure in a batch reactor equipped with a Dean & Stark device. By removing water formed 1 -octanol conversion was practically complete; the olefin formation being the main secondary reaction. When 1 -octanol is completely consumed the working-state morphology of ion exchange resins changes, which influences the selectivities towards products. At this point, for microporous resins all reactions stop while with macroreticular ones DNOE decomposes and significant amounts of olefin dimers appears. The best selectivity to DNOE was found in gel-type and <b>macroreticular</b> <b>resins</b> with low crosslinking degree. <b>Macroreticular</b> <b>resins</b> with medium or high crosslinking give good results in olefin formation...|$|R

No compounds higher than trimers were significantly detected at studied conditions. By plotting product yields versus conversion at 343 K, it was showed no significant differences between all catalysts tested. However, at 383 K, the ion exchange resins which mainly work in the external zone were more selective to dimerization and less to cracking and trimerization products, which suggests that trimerization and cracking mainly took place inside the gel-phase of the <b>macroreticular</b> <b>resins.</b> The most active catalysts were the oversulfonated resins with high cross-linking degree and high acid capacity.

The optimum time for production of GAs was 240 th hour after the start of cultivation. In the presence of hydrophobic <b>macroreticular</b> <b>resin</b> Amberlite XAD- 2 added at the 144 th hour, the concentration of total GAs increased compared to normal cultivation.

The alternative diterpenoid pathway directed towards GA 13 biosynthesis was highly active under these conditions. We hypothesize that the main reason for metabolic processes being directed in this way is the different adsorption of GAs on resin depending on their polarity. The changes of GA concentrations in the presence of hydrophobic resin disturb the equilibrium of enzymatic reactions, mainly 1, 2 dehydrogenation, and direct it towards GA 4 biosynthesis...|$|E

High temperature catalytic (HTC) methods (Sugimura and Suzuki, 1988) used to reoxidize the central North Pacific gyre water samples reveal that the total DOC (DOCHTC) is about twice that of the UV-oxidizable DOC (DOCuv). Indications from the original study suggest that this additional DOC contains higher concentrations of radiocarbon than in the DOCuv(Williams and Druffel, 1987). This evidence implies that DOC is older and thus more refractory with respect to biological utilization, yet is more chemically reactive with respect to photooxidation, than the fraction resistant to UV (DOCres).

Separations were more rapid with am-monium chloride/acetonitrile stepwise elution than with acetate stepwise elution, and urine constituents could be detected at 225 nm with the former system. Analytical conditions were convenient and the method has proven to be useful for routine blinical analysis. Much useful information on body functions can be obtained by liquid-chromatographic analysis of physiologic fluids (1 - 3). Many systems have been proposed for analysis of constituents in urine (4 - 6). Katz et al. (7) showed that an anionexchange chromatographic system with ultraviolet detection, originally developed by C. D. Scott and coworkers, was a useful tool for evaluation of metabolic profiles. The analysis time was dras-tically reduced to 8 h by using sequential columns of micro-reticular and pellicular resins (8).

40|$|The {{research}} program {{developed during the}} Ph. D. School {{is focused on the}} study of metal catalysts supported on cross-linked functional polymers (CFPs) for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide. In the last twenty years this compound has become a commodity with a constant increasing demand because of its strong oxidant properties and the formation of water as the reduction byproduct. In particular, H 2 O 2 is widely employed as environmentally-friendly bleaching and cleaning agent. The best alternative to the current process, in particular for the small-scale production, is certainly the synthesis of H 2 O 2 from the elements (direct synthesis). This is generally carried out with a heterogeneous catalyst under triphase condition. For safety reasons, the hydrogen-oxygen mixtures, according to the wide explosion range, are properly diluted with an inert gas, usually nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The catalyst is generally composed by one or more nanostructured noble metals, supported on an inorganic solid, carbon or organic materials. It is well known in literature that the presence in solution of additives, like halides (bromide and chloride) and mineral acids, dramatically improves the catalytic performances, in particular the selectivity towards H 2 O 2. However, the use of these additives presents some process drawbacks, such as corrosion, leaching of catalyst, etc, which do not allow the straightforward use of the H 2 O 2 solutions obtained from the direct synthesis. It is therefore mandatory a further step of purification to remove the additives. As a consequence, in order to evaluate the effective performance of the catalysts,the research activity during this PhD thesis aim at the investigation of catalytic systems free of selectivity enhancers. In particular, their presence has been avoided not only in the reaction mixture, but also during the preparation of the catalysts. In the frame of this PhD Thesis, a few sets of mono- and bimetallic catalysts, supported on the commercially available <b>macroreticular</b> <b>resin,</b> Laxness Lewatit K 2621, have been studied in detail. This work has been performed in a research group with a long standing experience in the investigation of polymer-based metal catalysts for industrially relevant reactions and, for a few months, in the Laboratory of Industrial Chemistry and Reaction Engineering of Akademi Prof. Tapio Salmi (Department of Chemical Engineering, Process Chemistry Centre, Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland) for the detailed study of the catalysts performances. The {{research program}} is based on the synthesis, the characterisation and the investigation of the catalytic behaviour of the catalysts, obtained by carefully controlling a few essential parameters during the synthesis, such as the nature of the precursor, the reducing agent and the experimental conditions. These three key-points remarkably affect the features of metal nanoparticles (size distribution, difective structure, etc [...] .) and, hence, the behaviour of the catalysts.

These alkyl levulinates are found to be possible oxygenated chemicals additives that could upgrade fuel’s quality, turning into in “greener” ones. The absence in the literature of information of acid ion-exchange resins as catalysts for the dehydration of fructose to 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural and subsequent rehydration to obtain levulinic acid, make the study of the behaviour of these catalysts useful and interesting. The reaction system was studied using dioxane as solvent, a fixed composition of reactants (14 % wt. fructose and 4 % wt. water) and in the temperature range between 90 ºC and 110 ºC. Two sets of resins are used during the study in the catalysts screening: a set of <b>macroreticular</b> <b>resins</b> (Amberlyst 15 and Amberlyst 39) and another one of gel-type (Dowex 50 x 8, Dowex 50 x 4 and Dowex 50 x 2).

There’s two stages in the reaction: a conversion of FA to 2 -(butoxymethyl) furan (Bmf) and the production of BL from the intermediate mentioned. The main drawback of this reaction is the polymerization of FA, producing some insoluble substances as oligomeric products, for example, 5 - 5 -dibutoxy- 2 -pentanone (DBPent), resulting in a drop of selectivity. During the last years, the production of BL is being investigated, since interest in the use of lignocellulosic biomass for the production of chemicals, fuel or energy increases {{at the same time that}} global awareness do about fuels resource depletion and the environmental impact causes to carry out some industrial processes.

40|$|Functionalized ion-exchange resins are polymer-based {{materials}} {{that can be}} used as catalysts, {{in a wide variety of}} chemical reactions, to achieve highly selective formation of desired products at cost-effective rates. Among these catalysts, sulfonic <b>macroreticular</b> ion-exchange <b>resins</b> have become critical in major industrial processes, such as the etherification of isoolefins to obtain branched ethers. The production of branched ethers, which are oxygenated antiknocking additives used in commercial gasoline formulation, became massive after the phase out of lead-based compounds in the 1990 s. Among the ethers which are used nowadays, the most relevant ones, in terms of their global market share, are methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE). These ethers are industrially obtained under mild conditions (i. e., at relatively low temperature and pressure) by means of the catalytic reaction between 2 -methylpropene (isobutene) and methanol or ethanol, respectively, over sulfonic <b>macroreticular</b> ion-exchange <b>resins.</b> On the other hand, the use of reactants obtained from renewable feedstocks to produce fuel components is convenient, since it allows reducing the carbon footprint of transportation fuels in a context in which the global vehicle fleet is growing. In this sense, the trend has been to use biomass-derived ethanol as an alternative to carbon-based alcohols. Nevertheless, this option has generated concerns regarding its competition with the food supply chain. Alternatively, the use of other alcohols, such as 1 -propanol and 1 -butanol, which can also be obtained through fermentative processes, is becoming more attractive, given that they would not compete with food supplies. Etherification of isobutene with these alcohols would produce heavier ethers (i. e., propyl tert-butyl ether, PTBE, and butyl tert-butyl ether, BTBE, respectively), which have potential benefits as gasoline additives. Nowadays, this is one of the alternatives at hand to achieve an actual improvement of the gasoline formulation in the short- midterm. Even though the industrial-scale production of MTBE and ETBE is today widely spread, relevant physicochemical aspects regarding ion-exchange resins have not been completely understood. Therefore, studies aimed at providing a deeper insight into the catalytic behavior of these materials are of interest. The present PhD thesis contains several studies related to the liquid phase syntheses of MTBE, ETBE, PTBE, and BTBE. In the first place, an investigation was carried out aimed to determine the chemical equilibrium composition and thermodynamic properties of the liquid-phase syntheses of the mentioned reactions. Secondly, a study was performed regarding the products distribution and the conditions that favor side reactions taking place along with etherification reactions. On the other hand, in order to further understanding the catalytic behavior of sulfonic <b>macroreticular</b> ion-exchange <b>resins,</b> relations were established between the catalytic activity of sixteen different resins and their most relevant properties, taking into account the reaction media properties, in the four reaction systems. Also, the viability of an integrated process to obtain, simultaneously, ETBE and BTBE over sulfonic <b>macroreticular</b> ion-exchange <b>resins</b> was studied. In this sense, individual and simultaneous processes were compared, a catalytic screening study was carried out to determine the most suitable catalyst and the effect of temperature and initial reactants composition on the ethers formation, in terms of conversion, selectivity and reaction rate, was discussed. Finally, a kinetic study of three of the studied reaction systems is provided. These are the individual syntheses of PTBE and BTBE and the simultaneous syntheses of ETBE and BTBE over AmberlystTM 35. A mechanistic kinetic model, in terms of components activities, was proposed for each studied reaction and it was found that the most likely reaction mechanism is an Eley-Rideal mechanism in which the surface reaction step is the rate-determining step. Les resines de bescanvi iònic funcionalitzades són materials polimèrics que s’utilitzen com a catalitzadors en una gran varietat de reaccions químiques. Entre aquests catalitzadors, les resines sulfòniques han assolit una importància cabdal en processos industrials molt rellevants, com ara l’eterificació d’isoolefines per obtenir èters ramificats, els quals, s’utilitzen com a additius oxigenats en la formulació de gasolines comercials. D’èters ramificats, se’n pot destacar el metil terc-butil èter (MTBE) o l’etil terc-butil èter (ETBE), que s’obtenen per reacció entre isobutè i metanol o etanol, respectivament, utilitzant resines de bescanvi iònic sulfòniques macroreticulades com a catalitzadors. Alternativament, l’ús d’ 1 -propanol i 1 -butanol produeix propil terc-butil èter (PTBE) i butil terc-butil èter (BTBE). Tot i que la producció d’MTBE i ETBE està molt estesa, hi ha aspectes de la naturalesa fisicoquímica dels processos catalítics en què participen les resines que continuen sense comprendre’s completament. En conseqüència, calen estudis que aportin nous coneixements en aquest sentit. És per això, doncs, que aquesta tesi inclou diversos estudis relatius al comportament catalític de resines de bescanvi iònic sulfòniques macroreticulades en les reaccions de síntesi en fase líquida d’MTBE, ETBE, PTBE i BTBE. Pel que fa a l’estudi sobre l’equilibri químic d’aquestes reaccions, s’han pogut determinar les propietats termodinàmiques corresponents i s’han pogut estimar els increments d’entalpia i entropia de formació dels èters resultants. En relació amb la formació de subproductes en aquests processos, s’ha pogut concloure que totes les reaccions secundàries es veuen afavorides per un increment de la temperatura d’operació. També s’han establert relacions entre les propietats dels catalitzadors i el nivell d’activitat catalítica que presenten i s’ha determinat que la capacitat àcida i el volum expansible de la fase gel de les resines determinen l’activitat catalítica que presenten. Quant a la producció simultània d’ETBE i BTBE, s’ha comprovat que el procés de síntesi simultània de tots dos èters presenta avantatges significatius respecte de la producció de cada èter individualment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation on ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) liquid-phase synthesis from isobutene (IB) and ethanol (EtOH), catalyzed by an acidic <b>macroreticular</b> ion exchange <b>resin,</b> Amberlyst 15 (A 15). The experiments were carried out batchwise in a Parr reactor in the range 323 - 363 K at 2 MPa for different initial EtOH/IB mole ratios and amounts of catalyst. Data collected at equilibrium gave thermodynamic information which was compared with theoretical calculations using the UNIFAC method. The kinetic results were used to develop a reaction mechanism and a kinetic model. The resin's affinity for polar substances and the strong nonideality of the liquid phase lead to a complex expression, which is valid both in the presence of high and low alcohol concentrations. Simulations performed with this kinetic model agree satisfactorily with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} liquid-phase etherification of isobutene with ethanol and 1 -butanol to give {{ethyl tert-butyl ether}} (ETBE) and butyl tert-butyl ether (BTBE) {{has been}} studied, at temperatures {{in the range of}} 315 - 353 K and at 2. 5 MPa, over six commercial acidic <b>macroreticular</b> ion-exchange <b>resins</b> as catalysts. The initial alcohol to isobutene molar ratio was varied in the range of 0. 5 - 5. 5 and the initial ethanol to 1 -butanol molar ratio in the range of 0. 5 - 2. 0. Strongly acidic catalysts with a rigid polymer backbone structure enhance reaction rate. This fact, along with the reduced side reactions extent, makes Amberlyst¿ 35 the most promising catalyst, among the tested ones, for the studied simultaneous etherification process. Irrespectively of the used catalyst, initial ETBE synthesis reaction rate is hardly sensitive to the variation of the ethanol to 1 ‐butanol molar ratio, whereas initial BTBE synthesis reaction rate strongly diminishes at high ethanol concentration. Preferential adsorption of ethanol over 1 ‐butanol on the catalysts active sites has been detected. As expected, both etherification reaction rates increase at increasing isobutene concentration. At 353 K, the highest temperature, both etherification rates are affected by internal mass transfer resistances due to diffusion limitations even when small catalyst beads are used. The simultaneous process has been compared to the individual syntheses of ETBE and BTBE and it has been found that the isobutene selectivity towards ethers is enhanced in the simultaneous system...|$|R
40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of the dimerization and the trimerization of isoamylenes (2 -methyl- 1 -butene and 2 -methyl- 2 -butene) in liquid-phase catalyzed by the acidic <b>macroreticular</b> ion {{exchange}} <b>resin</b> Amberlyst™ 15 was performed in a continuous-stirred tank reactor in the temperature range 323 – 393 K using n-hexane as a solvent. Reaction rate data were obtained free of internal and external mass transfer resistance effects. The best kinetic models that fit the experimental results {{were based on the}} LHHW–ER formalisms. They included the participation of isoamylene, dimer and n-hexane in the adsorption term. The number of active sites or clusters implied in the surface reaction was one for dimerization and three for trimerization. It was also inferred that trimers were formed via dimers. Finally, the obtained apparent activation energies for dimerization and trimerization were 37 ± 2 and 89 ± 3 kJ/mol, respectively, being the dimerization activation energy value in agreement with literature data...|$|R

40|$|Two sets of {{bimetallic}} Pd-Pt (Pd: 1. 0; Pt: 0. 25 - 1. 0 %, w/w) and Pd-Au (Pd: 1. 0; Au: 0. 25 - 1. 0 %, w/w) catalysts {{have been}} used, with no added promoter, {{in the catalytic}} direct synthesis (CDS) of hydrogen peroxide from its elements at 2 degrees C with a CO 2 /O- 2 /H- 2 mixture (72 / 25. 5 / 2. 5 %, respectively). The catalysts were supported on the commercial <b>macroreticular</b> ion-exchange <b>resin</b> Lewatit K 2621 and {{were obtained from the}} reduction with H 2 of ion-exchanged cationic precursors at 5 bar and at 60 degrees C. The addition of Pt or Au to Pd produced an increase of the initial overall catalytic activity in comparison with monometallic Pd with both the second metals, but with Pt the increase was much higher than with Au. Moreover, the addition of 0. 25 % (w/w) Pt, or more, invariably made all the Pd-Pt catalysts less selective with respect to Pd alone. In the case of Au, by contrast, the addition of 0. 25 % w/w produced an increase, albeit small, of the selectivity. As the result, the most active and productive Pd-Pt catalyst was 1 Pd 025 PtK 2621 with 1891 mol((H 2)) mol((Pd+Pt)) -(1) h-(1) initially consumed, 1875 (mol(H 2 O 2)) mol((Pd+Pt)) -(1) h-(1) initially produced, a 45 % selectivity towards H 2 O 2 at 50 % conversion of H- 2. In the case of the Pd-Au bimetallic catalysts, 1 Pd 025 AuK 2621 was the best one, with 1184 mol((H 2)) mol((Pd+Pt)) -(1) h-(1) initially consumed, 739 mol((H 2 O 2)) mol((Pd+Pt)) -(1) h-(1) initially produced, a 55 % selectivity towards H 2 O 2 at 50 % conversion of H- 2. Although the characterization of the Pd-Pt and Pd-Au catalysts with TEM showed that the morphology of the nanostructured metal phases in the Pd-Pt and Pd-Au catalysts was very different from each family to the other, no clear correlation between the size of the nanoparticles and their distribution and the catalytic performance was apparent. These catalysts were also generally different, especially the Pd-Au ones, from previously reported related materials obtained from the same support and the same precursor, but with a different reducing agent (formaldehyde).

40|$|Although <b>macroreticular</b> acidic ion-exchange <b>resins</b> {{have been}} widely used as {{catalysts}} in the industrial world for decades, their catalytic behavior is still far from being completely understood at a molecular level. Several characterization techniques coexist, which provide information about their properties. Only few of these techniques give an actual picture of their working-state features when swollen in anhydrous polar reactive media such as in etherification processes, where they are extensively used. The inverse steric exclusion chromatography technique, based on modeling the micropores structure, or gel phase, as a set of discrete volume fractions with a characteristic polymer chain density, constitutes an appropriate procedure to assess the morphology of ion-exchangers in the swollen state. Present work proposes an empirical model to correlate the properties of the volume fractions with their catalytic activity in the etherification reaction rates of isobutene by addition of C 1 to C 4 linear primary alcohols. Sixteen different macroreticular acidic ion-exchange catalysts, both commercial and lab-made, have been used, which differ in acid capacity, sulfonation type, cross linking degree and swollen-phase volume fractions distribution. Experimental reaction rates have been expressed as a sum of contributions of each individual volume fraction. The contribution of each polymer volume fraction corresponds to the product of the catalyst acidity, the characteristic volume fraction within the gel phase of the catalyst, and a specific turnover frequency (TOF) of that fraction. Accessibility of the reacting alcohol, expressed in terms of the Ogston coefficient, has been also included in the empirical dependency equation presented in this work...|$|R

A sample of such a resin, XE- 305 was procured from a commercial company and used for synthesis. The carboxylated derivative with carboxylate loading from 42 % to 88 % were used to oxidise 2 -chloropyndine to its N-oxide {{in the presence of}} excess hydrogen peroxide and mineral acid. Yields of the order of 33 - 35 % were achieved. 2 -Chloropyridine-N-oxide is used for the manufacture of a number of commercially important antifungal and anti- bacterial biocides. Despite numerous changes and modifications to the reaction conditions, including the use of a peroxide stabiliser, the yield could not be increased above 33 - 35 %. For commercial success, yields greater than 60 % would have to be achieved inorder to compete with existing processes such as the peracetic acid process reported in the literature. A mass balance examination showed that up to 24 % of the initial 2 -chloropyridine was unaccounted for at the end of oxidation. A further study of 2 -chloropyndine and its N-oxide stability, demonstrated that product N-oxide and not 2 -chloropyridine was unstable and decomposed under conditions likely to prevail m the oxidations. No way was found to prevent this decomposition and so it was concluded that this process using immobilized catalyst could not compete with existing batch processes utilising peracetic or acetic acid/hydrogen peroxide...|$|R
40|$|A {{study in}} search of new {{heterogeneous}} catalysts {{that can be used}} in place of homogeneous catalysts for biodiesel synthesis has been carried out. The objective of this study is to investigate and evaluate the use of solid catalysts for transesterification of triglycerides and esterification of free fatty acid for biodiesel synthesis. Two types of heterogeneous catalyst have been studied that are solid acid and solid base. Three different solid acids and two solid bases were explored. The solid acids investigated were sulfonated hypercrosslinked polystyrene resin, sulfonated polyvinyl alcohol and sulfated zirconia. The solid bases were lithium zirconate and composite calcium oxide-magnetite. Sulfonated hypercrosslinked polystyrene resin has been studied in the esterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol and rearrangement of α-pinene to camphene and limonenes. The activity of this catalyst was compared with conventional macroporous polystyrene sulfonic acids such as Amberlyst- 15, Amberlyst- 35 and Nafion SAC- 13 which is a composite of Nafion and silica. The activity of this catalyst is superior to those of Amberlysts and SAC- 13 in the esterification of oleic acid. This catalyst also has high reusability at elevated temperature. Sulfonated polyvinyl alcohol catalyst has been studied in the same way the esterification of oleic acid and rearrangement of α-pinene. The activity of the catalyst was compared with sulfonated <b>macroreticular</b> polystyrene <b>resin</b> Amberlyst- 35 and Nafion SAC- 13. In the esterification reaction, sulfonated polyvinyl alcohol shows a better activity than SAC- 13 and the Amberlyst- 35 resin catalyst. In the rearrangement/isomerisation reaction, the sulfonated polyvinyl alcohol is the least active. The activity of sulfated zirconia as a solid acid catalyst has been studied in the esterification of oleic acid and in simultaneous esterification- transesterification of a mixture oleic acid and triglycerides. In the simultaneous reaction, the activity of this catalyst was compared with sulfonated polystyrene catalysts (Amberlyst- 15 Amberlyst- 35 and Purolite D 5081) and commercial sulfated zirconia XZO- 1720. The result showed that in the transesterification reaction, the sulfated zirconias are more active but in the esterification reaction the sulfonated polystyrene catalysts are better than sulfated zirconia. The effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic activity of the catalyst was also studied. The study shows that 600 oC calcination gives the best catalytic activity. The lithium zirconate is one of the solid base catalysts evaluated in this study. The catalyst was very active in the transesterification of tributyl glycerate with methanol. The effect of calcination temperature on its activity in the transesterification reaction of tributyl glycerate was studied. The study shows that 700 oC calcination yielded the highest catalytic activity which is associated with the formation of the tetragonal phase which gives the highest concentration of basic sites and basic strength. A composite between calcium oxide and magnetite is the last catalyst reported in this study. The study of this catalyst is due to ease of separation by an external magnetic field. The catalytic performance in the transesterification of tributyl glycerate and methanol was studied. The catalytic activity of the catalyst was maximum at the calcination temperature of 700 oC. Loss of catalytic activity and magnetic properties were shown at higher calcination temperature. Despite the relatively high activities found for the catalysts studied, further improvement is needed if the catalysts are to be applied for industrial use. However, sulfonated hypercrossliked polystyrene resin catalysts showed promising activity for the pre-esterification reaction and it is one of the best catalysts for reducing free fatty acid in low grade vegetable oil...|$|R
40|$|Combustion {{of diesel}} fuel in a diesel engine {{is a complex}} process where several {{pollutants}} are emitted in the engine exhausts. To solve this problem {{and at the same}} time accomplish with the increasingly stringent regulations for diesel composition, diesel reformulation with oxygenate compounds is proposed. Linear symmetrical ethers with more than 9 carbon atoms represent a group of oxygenate compounds with excellent properties as diesel additives. Its addition in small quantities to diesel enhances the blending cetane number, improves cold start performance of diesel engine and dilutes undesired components. C 10 -C 16 linear ethers such as di-n-pentyl ether (DNPE), di-n-hexyl ether (DNHE) and di-n-octyl ether (DNOE) are three linear symmetrical ethers with excellent properties to be added to commercial diesel. This work proves that the synthesis of DNOE from 1 -octanol dehydration over acid catalysts (acidic zeolites and polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) ion exchange resins) is possible at 413 - 473 K. At the same time, the present work continues with the series of synthesis of linear symmetrical ethers from n-alcohols started with DNPE and DNHE in previous works. A catalyst screening of acidic PS-DVB ion exchange resins showed best performances to yield DNPE, DNHE and DNOE selectively on low-crosslinked <b>macroreticular</b> and gel­type <b>resins</b> with high acid capacity. The ability to swell in the reaction media of low­crosslinked and gel-type resins contributes to create porosity,allowing the diffusion of alcohols and ethers almost equally regardless the length of the molecules. On medium and large pore zeolites synthesis of linear symmetrical ether was found to be strongly related to the zeolites mesoporous surface and the acid sites number. Selectivity to linear ether decreased as the chain length increased which revealed a great steric hindrance for bulky molecules. The large pore zeolite H-BEA- 25 showed the best yield of linear ether due to the combination of high conversion of alcohol and high selectivity to linear ether. In this work, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant of 1 -octanol dehydration to DNOE was determined, proving that dehydration of 1 -octanol to DNOE is an exothermic reaction. The study, allowed at the same time improving current methods to estimate molar entropy of DNOE. A kinetic study of the alcohol dehydration to linear ether was performed over zeolites and the thermostable resin Amberlyst 70. Over Amberlyst 70 a series of kinetic equations based on LHHW-RE mechanisms were fitted to rate data of 1 -octanol dehydration to DNOE. Pure 1 -octanol experiments revealed that kinetic models where 1 -octanol and water are the adsorbed compounds in the resin and the fraction of free active sites is negligible fit the best. Influence of products (water and DNOE) and solvent (1, 4 -dioxane) was evaluated which revealed a strong inhibition effect of water. Inhibition effect of water was quantified by means of correction factors which described the fraction of active sites not blocked by water according to different adsorption isotherms. Freundlich isotherm was found to better describe the water inhibition effect in an scenario where one molecule of 1 -octanol adsorbed reacts with another molecule of 1 -octanol of the liquid phase in a Rideal-Eley mechanism. Activation energy determined accounting water deactivation was 110 ± 5 kJ·mol- 1. Over zeolites, LHHW-RE kinetic models were fitted to rate data for DNHE and DNOE synthesis showing that the best kinetic models assume that the fraction of active sites is negligible. Within these models, two type of equations were found to best represent rate data, one assumes that alcohol and linear ether are adsorbed in the zeolite surface. The other equation assumes that alcohol and water are preferably adsorbed through the reaction. Apparent activation energy of 100 - 120 kJ·mol- 1 were estimated for the reactions on tested zeolites. La reformulació del combustible dièsel amb compostos oxigenats com els èters lineals de més de 9 carbonis permet augmentar la qualitat ambiental del combustible als motors dièsel. Els èters lineals simètrics com el di-n-pentil èter (DNPE), di-n-hexil èter (DNHE) i di-n-octil èter (DNOE) es presenten com tres compostos amb propietats excel·lents com additius pel dièsel ja que n’augmenten l’índex de cetà i en milloren les propietats fluidodinàmiques del dièsel. Aquest treball demostra que la deshidratació de 1 -octanol a DNOE és possible sobre catalitzadors sòlids àcids (resines de bescanvi iònic de poliestirè reticulades amb divinilbenzè (PE-DVB) i zeolites) i a la vegada continua amb la sèrie de síntesis d’èters lineals simètrics a partir de n-alcohols començada amb el DNPE i DNHE en treballs previs. Les resines de bescanvi iònic PE-DVB macroreticulars amb baixos continguts de DVB i les resines tipus gel foren les resines que mes rendiment a DNPE, DNHE i DNOE van obtenir.

En aquest treball es va determinar la constant d’equilibri de la reacció de deshidratació de 1 -octanol a DNOE i es va demostrar que la reacció mencionada és una reacció exotèrmica. Fruit de l’estudi d’equilibri es van poder corregir els mètodes actuals per estimar l’entropia molar del DNOE, proposant-ne un valor nou.

Així mateix es va constatar que la presència d’aigua exercia un fort efecte desactivador de la reacció i es va quantificar al model cinètic mitjançant un terme corrector basat en la isoterma Freundlich.
