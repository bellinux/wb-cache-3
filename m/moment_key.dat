In this paper, all I-girders are simply supported and models flange are constant but webs used of I-girder are different, critical moment of beams have calculated and compared.

It turns out that under suitable conditions on the joint distribution of the random variables the derivatives exist and coincide with the conditional expectations of the variables given that their combination just equals the quantile. Moreover, using this result, we deduce formulas for the derivatives with respect to the weights of the variables for the so-called expected shortfall (first or higher moments) of the combination. Finally, we study in some more detail the coherence properties of the expected shortfall in case it is defined as a first conditional <b>moment.</b> <b>Key</b> words: quantile; value-at-risk; quantile derivative; conditional expectation; expected shortfall; conditional value-at-risk; coherent risk measure. ...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Consider a {{critical}} random multigraph Gn with n vertices {{constructed by the}} configuration model such that its vertex degrees are independent random variables with the same distribution ν (criticality means that the second moment of ν is finite and equals twice its first moment). We specify the scaling limits of the ordered sequence of component sizes of Gn as n tends to infinity in different cases. When ν has finite third moment, the components sizes rescaled by n− 2 / 3 converge to the excursion lengths of a Brownian motion with parabolic drift above past minima, whereas when ν is a power law distribution with exponent γ ∈ (3, 4), the components sizes rescaled by n−(γ− 2) /(γ− 1) converge to the excursion lengths of a certain drifted process with independent increments above past minima. We deduce the asymptotic behavior of the component sizes of {{a critical}} random simple graph when ν has finite third <b>moment.</b> <b>Key</b> words.

40|$|Abstract. In {{an effort}} to test stellar {{structure}} and evolution models, analysis of oscillations in A and F stars in open clusters is {{carried out by the}} STACC network (Frandsen 1992). In this paper we describe our effort to locate a suitable open cluster in the northern hemisphere for a future multi-site campaign. We present BV Johnson and time series CCD photometry of four poorly studied open clusters: NGC 7245, NGC 7062, NGC 7226 and NGC 7654. New improved colour-magnitude diagrams for these four northern hemisphere clusters, together with the results from the search for variable stars in the clusters are presented. The cluster reddening, distance and age are estimated from isochrone fitting. In the four clusters, we discovered a total of two δ Scuti stars, one eclipsing binary, one variable of unknown type and evidence for 3 potential variables all situated within the δ Scuti instability strip. We find that the fraction of δ Scuti stars in these four open clusters is much lower than among field stars and in other open clusters suggesting that some additional parameters control the pulsation, parameters that we do not understand at this <b>moment.</b> <b>Key</b> words: open clusters – HR diagrams – stars: oscillations – stars: δ Scuti – stars: evolution 1...|$|E

40|$|Machines as {{the measure}} of women: colonial irony in a Cape to Cairo automobilejourney, 1930 Georgine ClarsenHistories of {{transport}} have been notably deficient in considering women ascompetent technological actors, but, in seeking to correct that elision, feministscholars have argued that adding women to those histories does much morethan merely expand established narratives. Instead, an analysis of womensengagement with transport and travel offers an analytics of the power relationsthat inhere within those practices and allows us to consider the standard masculiniststories in new ways. Georgine Clarsen explores some of the intimate links betweengender, technological modernity and colonialism by focusing on white womenstranscontinental travel in Africa {{at the end of}} the 1920 s, when assumptions ofBritish colonial and industrial superiority were being challenged and Americaneconomic supremacy was replacing the old empires of Europe.

40|$|Abstract. Using the auroral {{boundary}} index {{derived from}} DMSP electron precipitation {{data and the}} Dst index, changes {{in the size of}} the auroral belt during magnetic storms are studied. It is found that the equatorward boundary of the belt at midnight expands equatorward, reaching its lowest latitude about one hour before Dst peaks. This time lag depends very little on storm intensity. It is also shown that during magnetic storms, the energy of the ring current quanti®ed with Dst increases in proportion to L 3 e, where Le is the L-value corresponding to the equatorward boundary of the auroral belt designated by the auroral boundary index. This means that the ring current energy is proportional to the ion energy obtained from the earthward shift of the plasma sheet under the conservation of the ®rst adiabatic invariant. The ring current energy is also proportional to Emag, the total magnetic ®eld energy contained in the spherical shell bounded by Le and Leq, where Leq corresponds to the quiet-time location of the auroral precipitation boundary. The ratio of the ring current energy ER to the dipole energy Emag is typically 10 %. The ring current leads to magnetosphere in¯ation as a result of an increase in the equivalent dipole <b>moment.</b> <b>Key</b> words.

40|$|Contribution to {{catalogue}} for related exhibition: Antonio Manuel, {{curated by}} Claudia Calirman. Notorious amongst Antonio Manuel's {{work of the}} 1960 s are the Flans (Flongs, or Stereotype Moldes). These were produced using high and low relief matrices for the printing process of newspaper pages, over which the artist applied paint. The actual process of production involved a semi-clandestine access to the newspaper’s printing workshop, leading eventually to interference in certain runs of the newspaper itself. The portrayal of ‘common people’ had been a widespread theme in Brazilian modern art and its re-emergence in the 1960 s could {{be considered as a}} project of demythication of prevailing associations with the ethnic composition of the nation. Antonio Manuel’s infatuation with the ordinariness of the human condition can be remarked in his early expressive drawing technique that recalls, in its repetitiveness, and its simple outlines, Dubuffet’s faux-naive paintings. These drawings developed into the Flan series where the work becomes inextricably associated with the newspaper’s content and process of production. As a result, visual interferences within the newspaper layout became increasingly economical as whole sections were allowed to become legible or visible, with particular emphasis being given to news items covering the violence perpetrated by the state on ordinary people. Shortly after Nova Objetividade Brasileira, Antonio Manuel participated in Apocalipopótese, an open air ‘happening’ at the Aterro do Flamengo landfill area that took place in 1968 on the eve of AI 5. The event, named as a consideration of the hypothesis of apocalypse, gathered a diverse group of artists including, Oiticica, Rogerio Duarte, Lygia Pape, dancers from the favela of Mangueira samba school, among others. Prior to the event, organisational meetings were held at Oiticica’s house where Antonio Manuel and Rogério Duarte discussed a possible collaboration. They proposed building a structure entitled Cabine do Amor (Love-hut) where the viewer would enter and through gaps in the wooden structure, see images of bodies projected within another compartment. A fascination with the relation between inside and outside and an engagement with the viewer as active participant within the work become at this <b>moment</b> <b>key</b> issues for Antonio Manuel. According to the artist, the actual structure had already been constructed by Oiticica but Duarte’s other commitments disrupted the project. Antonio Manuel developed an alternative project that involved around 20 wooden boxes of simple construction each containing images, newspaper cut-outs, poems and slogans. As the boxes were sealed, their content could only be revealed through a destructive act. The artist was interested in the revelation of their content by the public but admits being surprised by the violence demonstrated towards these boxes. They were named Urnas-Quentes, which translate literally into English as Hot-Ballot-Boxes...|$|E
