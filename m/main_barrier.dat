40|$|This study {{draws upon}} a {{questionnaire}} survey distributed amongst SMEs in Australia {{to offer an}} insight into the <b>main</b> <b>barriers</b> to BIM adoption within Australian SMEs. Based on analyses of 78 completed questionnaires from non-adopters, the <b>main</b> <b>barriers</b> making SMEs shy away from BIM adoption are discussed. The findings show that currently around 42 % of Australian SMEs are engaged with BIM. It comes to light that lack of knowledge and resources within SMEs {{is not a major}} barrier for Australian SMEs. In essence, the <b>main</b> <b>barriers</b> stem from lack of interests of clients and subcontractors working for SMEs alongside the risks associated with an uncertain return on investment (ROI) for BIM as perceived by key players in SMEs. The study contributes to the field by providing an updated insight into the status quo of BIM in Australian SMEs and spots the <b>main</b> <b>barriers</b> to target for promoting BIM adoption across Australian SMEs...|$|R

The renowned mezzo-soprano Célestine Galli-Marié (known professionally as [...] "Galli-Marié") was engaged to sing the title role. According to Dean, she was as delighted by the part as Bizet was by her suitability for it. There were rumours that he and the singer pursued a brief affair; his relations with Geneviève were strained at this time, and they lived apart for several months.|$|E
500|$|Secondary {{dysfunction}} {{results from}} factors that follow from the injury, such as loss of bladder and bowel control or impaired movement. The <b>main</b> <b>barrier</b> to sexual activity {{that people with}} SCI cite is physical limitation; e.g. balance problems and muscle weakness cause difficulty with positioning. Spasticity, tightening of muscles due to increased muscle tone, is another complication that interferes with sex. Some medications have side effects that impede sexual pleasure or interfere with sexual function: antidepressants, muscle relaxants, sleeping pills and drugs that treat spasticity. Hormonal changes [...] that alter sexual function may take place after SCI; levels of prolactin heighten, women temporarily stop menstruating (amenorrhea), and men experience reduced levels of testosterone. Testosterone deficiency causes reduced libido, increased weakness, fatigue, and failure to respond to erection-enhancing drugs.|$|E

He added that the <b>main</b> <b>barrier</b> to the band getting back together was his brother's condition following his stroke. Two months later, he told the BBC that the band was beginning to write new material for a possible reunion, but failed to detail which members were involved. In an interview aired that December on the Biography Channel, Quaife rejected any possibility that he would take part in a reunion. That same month, Ray Davies spoke again about the possibility of performing with his brother: [...] "I suggested he do some low-key shows to see how well he can play. If we're going to play together again, we can't hit the road straight away with a big-time announcement....

40|$|China {{promoted}} the large-scale adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in its 13 th five-year plan; however, this target faces many obstacles. This paper analyzes the <b>main</b> <b>barriers</b> to widespread adoption of EVs through a survey in Shenzhen, {{which has the}} biggest EVs market share out of China’s major cities. Based on previous research, this paper conducted a new study using 406 approved questionnaires among 500 participants. Our study proposed five hypotheses to examine the <b>main</b> <b>barriers</b> to widespread adoption of EVs. The analysis was conducted using statistical method that included two-way frequency tables, chi-square test, and factor analysis. The results indicated that perception of advantages of EVs and access to recharging EVs remained the <b>main</b> <b>barriers</b> in large-scale penetration. Furthermore, our study revealed that a drop in financial incentives would not cause a significant decline in the future adoption of EVs. The study provides suggestions to car manufacturers and government policy advisors based on our analysis and discussion...|$|R

2500|$|Due to a miner's a {{death in}} Colville, Washington, {{committed}} by unknown Indians in early 1858, Colonel Edward Steptoe received orders to lead an expedition to the area to show {{the strength of the}} U.S. Army to convince the Indians to turn in those who were responsible. He left Fort Walla Walla in May 1858 to head for the Colville area and planned to cut through the Coeur d’Alene and Spokane territories. However, the troops that Steptoe brought numbered only 159, and they were very poorly armed. [...] Steptoe expected cooperation from the Nez Perce and Spokanes since in the past they had given him boats and men at the Snake River, which was the <b>main</b> <b>barrier</b> to reaching Colville. Therefore, in their attempts to reach Colville, Steptoe crossed the Snake River, unaided however, which was the previously assigned line of hostility, sparking the tribes’ belief that the army was going to engage them. The Coeur d'Alene, Palouse, Spokane, and some of the Yakima gathered in preparation of a fight. Chief Vincent of the Coeur d’Alene demanded Steptoe’s reason for his trespass, and he responded that {{they were on their way}} to Colville. Vincent returned to his camp to try and calm down the young warriors who were intent on fighting, while Steptoe attempted to return to Fort Walla Walla. Steptoe's journey, however, was interrupted by the Indian leaders, who asked him to return to meet with them. The meeting ended with a handshake and a mutual agreement that Steptoe would leave their territory and travel via a different route to reach Colville. Despite this peaceful agreement, a frustrated Coeur d’Alene warrior later shot at Steptoe’s men, inciting the start of fighting between Steptoe and the Coeur d’Alene, Spokane, and other tribes. Steptoe’s men struggled to fight the 1000 Indian warriors, but because they were so severely outnumbered, Steptoe made the decision to escape that night, and return to Fort Walla Walla.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to shed light on the <b>main</b> <b>barriers</b> faced by Mozambican micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and their implications in respect to the support policies available for these enterprises. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review was made on those barriers faced by the MSEs and on the policies and governmental instruments of assistance available for MSEs. Then, a two-step research was conducted. The first phase consisted of collecting data from 21 MSEs in Mozambique, mainly by means of interviews where the <b>main</b> <b>barriers</b> faced by those interviewed were identified and hence, this led to the second phase, which was interviewing governmental/support entities in order to know what they had done to minimize those barriers which had been identified by the entrepreneurs. Findings - The results show that financial and competitive <b>barriers</b> are the <b>main</b> <b>barriers</b> faced by the analyzed MSEs. These barriers vary according to the field of activity of the enterprises. Originality/value - This study serves to enrich {{the state of the art}} on the subject of smaller enterprises in Africa and will specially. help to fill the lack of academic research available about Mozambique...|$|R
