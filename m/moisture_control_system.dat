The air system in the blow boxes was used to control the fast moisture transients in the paper machine. The new control system was combined with a previously developed physical model and was then compared with a conventional <b>moisture</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The comparison concerned the ability to restore the moisture ratio for two different dynamic changes, a moisture disturbance and a paper grade change.

Because {{the sinter}} mixture <b>moisture</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> has time-varying, {{nonlinear}} and time-delay characteristics, {{it is difficult}} to establish its precise mathematical model. According to the defects that the conventional PID control in the fixed parameter is difficult to guarantee the system performance, this paper proposed the parameter self-tuning fuzzy PID controller which is used to the system. Based on the sintering furnace structural features and control performance requirements, the PID parameters are set by fuzzy logic reasoning. The actual operation results proved that the parameter self-tuning fuzzy PID controller improved more obviously the system performance than the original PID controller, and stabilized the sinter mixture moisture, and improved the sintering production condition and promoted the production capacity.

40|$|Improving the {{efficiency}} of the agricultural irrigation systems substantially contributes to sustainable water management. This improvement can be achieved through an automated irrigation system that includes a real-time control strategy based on the water, soil, and crop relationship. This paper presents a model driven control strategy applied to an irrigation system, in order to make an efficient use of water for large crop fields, that is, applying the correct amount of water in the correct place at the right moment. The proposed model uses a predictive algorithm that senses soil moisture and weather variables, to determine optimal amount of water required by the crop. This proposed approach is evaluated against a traditional irrigation system based on the empirical definition of time periods and against a basic soil <b>moisture</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Results indicate that the use of a model predictive control in an irrigation system achieves a higher efficiency and significantly reduce the water consumption...|$|E

A concern relating to chemical stability, chemical control, and safe storage of the waste is the potential for propagating reactions as a result of ferrocyanide-oxidizer and organic-oxidizer concentrations in the SSTS. Propagating reactions in fuel-nitrate mixtures are precluded if the amounts of fuel and moisture present in the waste are within specified limits. Because most credible ignition sources occur near the waste surface, the main emphasis of this study is toward monitoring and <b>controlling</b> <b>moisture</b> in the top 14 cm (5. 5 in.) of waste.

40|$|Biorefineries {{refer to}} {{conversion}} operations where biomass feedstock {{is converted to}} multiple products such as chemicals, fuels, and bioproducts. The concept focuses on maximizing valued extractables while minimizing waste streams. A low cost collection and converting the biomass to feedstock {{is critical to the}} success of these emerging industries. A conservative estimate shows that demand for feedstock for biorefineries may reach 172 million dry tons over the next decade (2010) and more than 508 million dry tons in 2020 if biomass technology implementation achieves the stated goals. An orderly supply of this large amount of biomass to biorefineries requires new and robust equipment and well-established infrastructure. At the present, low and inconsistent demand for biomass for energy is the main reason for lack of interest on the part of manufacturers to invest in equipment development. It is important however, that research and development in production and supply technologies proceed in parallel with developments in conversion technologies. This paper reviews the operations involved in biomass supply and identifies three areas of research: <b>moisture</b> <b>control,</b> densification, and <b>systems</b> modeling as key areas of research. Other areas of work such as single step harvesting and on farm fractionation of biomass for added value purposes has also been identified as important areas of work...|$|R
