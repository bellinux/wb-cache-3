40|$|Cadastre started {{simply as}} a public {{register}} of land boundaries and later went on to include the various other interests in the land. The twin concepts of planning and management were introduced over the ensuing centuries and millennia and required the incorporation of other available information concerning the land parcel. From this stage, what had started simply as cadastre became <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre.</b> This development substantially increased the usefulness of cadastre and made it much more relevant {{to the needs of}} the society. However, it became impracticable to have so much information on one map or to handle and combine too many map themes of the same geographical area. With the introduction of computers into multipurpose cadastral processes it became possible to hold the various map themes in different layers, attach attribute data to them using Database Management System and combine or disaggregate them in a GIS environment according to any desired purpose. But <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre</b> is ordinarily limited to only a single land parcel. In order to derive maximum benefit from <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre</b> it is necessary to take cadastre beyond the single land parcel and to cover the entire country in a national <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre.</b> In this way, <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre</b> can become one of the most widely and frequently used dataset...|$|E
40|$|One aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the state of development of <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre</b> systems (MPCs) internationally, and, based on the findings to design a <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre</b> data model enhancing the current cadastre system in Malaysia. A second aim was to determine the organizational and legal requirements for implementing a <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre</b> system, within the current Malaysian context. As a final aim, the service oriented architecture (SOA) concept was examined to investigate how it might support the storage, maintenance and delivery of the different layers of data found in an MPC. The data model and service oriented architecture were developed using Oracle Spatial technologies and the SQL language. Sample data from the national digital cadastre database, utility data and topographic mapping data from Malaysia were used in the case study. The investigation enabled data from various agencies to be integrated into a single <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre</b> database in the Oracle Spatial database environment, and a case study of an easement as a legal land object was executed. It was discovered that it was beneficial to show the complete legal situation of a parcel compared to the previous system where the user had to manually search for legal documents and deal with the ambiguous locations of legal land objects. The results of the SOA investigation showed that the application of the SOA concept to the construction of an MPC database will require extensive IT investment, especially a high specification server, but it is expected to reduce redundancy in data collection and processing and reduce the costs. The study also showed that existing legislation in the National Land Code 1965 should be amended. The principal conclusion is that an open source system should be adopted before any further investment in IT software and hardware is made. Another conclusion is that a <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre</b> system has to be managed by personnel highly trained in spatial, programming and IT competencies. An open source system combined with the SOA concept seems the best option if a <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre</b> system is to contribute to the sustainable management of land resources within a rapidly developing Malaysia...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years spatial {{information}} technologies and sustainability theory drove the creation of new visions, models and roles for the <b>cadastre.</b> Concepts including <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastres,</b> Cadastre 2014, and sustainable land administration radically altered understandings of the cadastre and its potential. Many of these concepts continue to be relevant in the contemporary context; however, like all disciplines, cadastral science must continue to look to the future to remain relevant. This paper begins this process and aims to provide preliminary insights into the characteristics and potential role of future cadastres. A qualitative research design based upon an exploratory case study underpins the research. Factors including globalisation, population urbanization, good governance, climate-change response, environmental management, 3 D visualization/analysis technologies, wireless sensor networks, standardization, and interoperability are found to be driving developments in the cadastral domain. Consequently, six design elements of future cadastre emerge: Survey-Accurate Cadastres, Object-Oriented Cadastres, 3 D/ 4 D Cadastres, Real-Time Cadastres, Global Cadastres, and Organic Cadastres. Together, these elements provide a preliminary vision for the role and nature of future cadastres: the elements can be seen as likely characteristics o...|$|R

40|$|Potential {{users of}} Geographic Information Systems (GIS), among them private {{companies}} and public institutions, have different necessities {{in terms of}} quality, quantity and type of data stored in the spatial database, especially {{in the development of}} their land planning and management. With the recent city halls computerization process, the Geographic Information Systems represent {{one of the most important}} tools for manipulating cadastral data. The Cadastral Cartography has benefited from this technology, once it needs mapping in different scales which serve the prerogatives of the <b>Multipurpose</b> Technical <b>Cadastre</b> and the territorial management. Currently, the automated cartographic generalization is one of the most utilized techniques in the scale transforming of geo-referenced geographic data. In this context, this paper aimed to develop methods of cartographic generalization using GIS. Thus, the generalization models were generated, evaluated, and presented through different criteria. Among these criteria, the structure of the digital data storage, the effectiveness of the recovery operations in the generalization process, and the necessity of a spatial perception for applying the operations.

40|$|The {{world of}} science {{communication}} is changing {{with the increased}} use of social media and online resources. No longer is science for science’s sake; some scientists are beginning to understand the value and necessity of sharing scientific research with a wider audience. Scientific journals are great for sharing trusted findings between scientists within a specific field. However, outside of the field, these articles tend to be too complex and full of jargon for the average person. Also, research journal articles can be costly, limiting the availability of scientific articles to the public. Therefore, scientists are realizing they require a more effective way to share information to a general audience with no monetary costs. Social media, such as Facebook, Twitter and blogging, have shown potential to fill this void. This project investigates the use of social media as an aid to science outreach. I designed a survey instrument and distributed it to independent scientists and scientific institutions to gain insight into how social media is used to promote science research as well as why scientists do not use social media. In addition, I worked with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coastal Services Center (CSC) on the <b>Multipurpose</b> Marine <b>Cadastre</b> (MMC) project, with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), as social media specialist. I managed Twitter, Facebook and a blog for this project and gained intimate knowledge of how it works on the ground to use social media inside of a government agency, using this experience as a case study. Using the knowledge gained from this case study experience, as well as the survey results, I developed a set of best practices for social media use in science outreach. These guidelines are meant to aid in social media use to ensure greater success in terms of science outreach by scientists to the general public...|$|R

Programa de Pós-Graduação em Engenharia Civil, Florianópolis, 2013 Abstract: For the {{construction}} of small hydroelectric plants ? Small Hydro, companies | corporations and | or contractors must obtain Environmental Licensing (Permitting) (EL). The EL procedure is established "legally"in a bureaucratic routine that requires a series of documents, including maps. However, the specification and characterization of cartographic documentation for this purpose lies below the real need for analysis of the human intervention that will occur, especially from the environmental point of view. Aiming to better recognize the territory to be impacted and suit the environmental licensing procedures {{in accordance with the}} new national standards (Law 10. 267, Guideline 511 of 2009 of the Ministry of Cities), among others - research proposes the use of information form the <b>Multipurpose</b> Territorial <b>Cadastre</b> - MTC. Starting from the consideration of the relevance of the MTC in the current context of environmental permits, the potential {{in the use of the}} MTC in the licensing process were listed. In this sense, the goals were tied to political and institutional constraints, the availability of information and interests inherent in the decision making process of environmental licensing. In this regard, some limitations regarding the mandatory use of information from the multipurpose territorial register were highlighted, which stem from the current national situation. The method was based on descriptive exploratory study that proposed the introduction of the MTC as a compulsory tool for improving the environmental licensing of SH. From the case study of SH Bocaiuva the proposition has been consolidated and made research investigation consistent with the demand of environmental agencies, since the use of the MTC in the environmental licensing process for the profile of SH Bocaiuva, replicates in many other similar situations nationwide. As a result, adaptations and extensions in the administrative, physical, biotic and anthropic parameters were proposed, considering the land plot and thematic register as a focus on graphical representation, and therefore being a reference to the environmental licensing process...|$|R

It was assumed that a digital cadastral map together with other digital maps could improve GIS use. Furthermore {{it was assumed that}} a digital cadastral map could increase the possibilities for registration of property regulations in the cadastre. The aim was a <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre.</b> Since 1997 four new themes have been registered in the Danish cadastre. The four all are the registration of regulations according to new land use legislations. Regional authorities carry out the practical registration of the themes. The implementations of the registrations have been top down. The top down implementation and the new users give some challenges for the cadastral authority – the NSC- to make the processes of the registrations of the new themes efficient and to make the quality of the registrations sufficient. The challenges of the <b>multipurpose</b> <b>cadastre</b> have legal, organisational and technological aspects. The challenges and the aspects are primarily related to the use of a digital cadastral map. Depending on the point of view {{one of the biggest challenges}} have been building up and maintaining cadastral knowledge at new users of the cadastre. In the preparation of registration of a new theme it is important that the legislation authority and the NSC exchange knowledge in a broad sense.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project, “the Assessment of Existing Information on Atlantic Coastal Fish Habitat”, is to inform conservation planning for the Atlantic Coastal Fish Habitat Partnership (ACFHP). ACFHP is recognized as a Partnership by the National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP), whose overall mission is to protect, restore, and enhance the nation’s fish and aquatic communities through partnerships that foster fish habitat conservation. This project is a cooperative effort of NOAA/NOS Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment (CCMA) Biogeography Branch and ACFHP. The Assessment includes three components; 1. a representative bibliographic and assessment database, 2. a Geographical Information System (GIS) spatial framework, and 3. a summary document with description of methods, analyses of habitat assessment information, and recommendations for further work. The spatial bibliography was created by linking the bibliographic table developed in Microsoft Excel and exported to SQL Server, with the spatial framework developed in ArcGIS and exported to GoogleMaps. The bibliography is a comprehensive, searchable database of over 500 selected documents and data sources on Atlantic coastal fish species and habitats. Key information captured for each entry includes basic bibliographic data, spatial footprint (e. g. waterbody or watershed), species and habitats covered, and electronic availability. Information on habitat condition indicators, threats, and conservation recommendations are extracted from each entry and recorded in a separate linked table. The spatial framework is a functional digital map based on polygon layers of watersheds, estuarine and marine waterbodies derived from NOAA’s Coastal Assessment Framework, MMS/NOAA’s <b>Multipurpose</b> Marine <b>Cadastre,</b> and other sources, providing spatial reference {{for all of the}} documents cited in the bibliography. Together, the bibliography and assessment tables and their spatial framework provide a powerful tool to query and assess available information through a publicly available web interface. They were designed to support the development of priorities for ACFHP’s conservation efforts within a geographic area extending from Maine to Florida, and from coastal watersheds seaward {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. The Atlantic Coastal Fish Habitat Partnership has made initial use of the Assessment of Existing Information. Though it has not yet applied the AEI in a systematic or structured manner, it expects to find further uses as the draft conservation strategic plan is refined, and as regional action plans are developed. It also provides a means to move beyond an “assessment of existing information” towards an “assessment of fish habitat”, and is being applied towards the National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP) 2010 Assessment.

This {{is one of the}} most important areas from the point of view of implementing active land policy, area management, and real estate taxation. Area management and land policy are not regulated satisfactory, not even in urban areas, which reflects negative phenomena and trends that restrain, both economic as well as social development of the country. Another big issue is the lack of the developed land and building but not built on land data which represent vital spatial potential and have the key role in land policy.

In order to improve efficiency and quality, the FEAB has dedicated itself to establishing a data infrastructure based on Geographic Information Systems, GIs. The value of GIS was explained in an article dating back to 1980 entitled "Need for a <b>Multipurpose</b> <b>Cadastre</b> which stated, "There is a critical need for a better land-information system in the United States to improve land-conveyance procedures, furnish a basis for equitable taxation, and provide much-needed information for resource management and environmental planning.

According to most text books, Geographic Information Systems is a class of software that stores, manages, and analyzes mapable features on, above, or {{below the surface of the}} earth. GIS software is basically database management software to the management of spatial data and information. Simply put, Geographic Information Systems manage, analyze, chart, graph, and map spatial information. At the outset, I was given goals and expectations from my branch and from my mentor with regards to the further implementation of GIs. Those goals are as follows: (1) Continue the development of GIS for the underground structures. (2) Extract and export annotated data from AutoCAD drawing files and construct a database (to serve as a prototype for future work). (3) Examine existing underground record drawings to determine existing and non-existing underground tanks. Once this data was collected and analyzed, I set out on the task of creating a user-friendly database that could be assessed by all members of the branch. It was important that the database be built using programs that most employees already possess, ruling out most AutoCAD-based viewers. Therefore, I set out to create an Access database that translated onto the web using Internet Explorer as the foundation.

The existing NDCDB, which covers the entire country, has been referenced to the new Geocentric Datum for Malaysia 2000 (GDM 2000). It has been adjusted with respect to cadastral control infrastructure developed using Global Positioning System (GPS) MyRTKnetto provide a homogenous and seamless cadastral network for the entire Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan. The targeted spatial accuracy of NDCDB is better than 5 cm in the urban area and 10 cm in the rural area. On the other hand, the main source of large-scale geographical features for urban areas will be based on the Mobile Terrestrial Laser Scanning (MLTS) surveythat is also referenced to GDM 2000 and Mean Sea Level (MSL) height datum. However for rural areas,existing database from State Geospatial Data Centre (SGDC) at the scale 1 : 10, 000 to 1 : 25, 000 will be used. The survey accurate MPC database will include the following fundamental layers: i) NDCDB; ii) two-dimensional large scale geographical features; iii) three-dimensional city model; iv) utility data; andv) street addresses. MPC for Putrajayawill be developed based on On-Line Web Access or OWA and will be accessible to the government, private and public users. The pilot project towards the development of Survey Accurate MPC for Putrajaya will provide informative insight on thefuture directionin implementingnationwide MPC and new cadastral management in Malaysia...|$|E
