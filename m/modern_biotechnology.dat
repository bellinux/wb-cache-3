40|$|The {{consolidation}} of the adoption and diffusion of biotechnologies in developed countries relies heavily on their systems of innovation and public policies (Niosi et al, 2005; Cooke, 2007, Cockburn and Stern, 2010). In the last two decades, emerging countries have attempted to adopt and develop <b>modern</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> in order to increment {{their participation in the}} global economy (Nature Biotechnology, 2004). Several authors have analyzed the context of emerging countries like China, India, and Singapore that seem to have a great potential to become important players in the creation and development of biotechnology-related products. There are other emerging countries, like Mexico, with the scientific and commercial potential to adopt biotechnologies and use them as engine to generate economic growth (Possani, 2003).

2500|$|Biotechnology {{has contributed}} to the {{discovery}} and manufacturing of traditional small molecule pharmaceutical drugs as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology – biopharmaceutics. <b>Modern</b> <b>biotechnology</b> can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 Genentech developed synthetic humanized insulin by joining its gene with a plasmid vector inserted into the bacterium Escherichia coli. Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of abattoir animals (cattle or pigs). The resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost. Biotechnology has also enabled emerging therapeutics like gene therapy. [...] The application of biotechnology to basic science (for example through the Human Genome Project) has also dramatically improved our understanding of biology and as our scientific knowledge of normal and disease biology has increased, our ability to develop new medicines to treat previously untreatable diseases has increased as well.|$|E

One response to this challenge which has dominated policy agendas in the region for a long time, and with more prominence after the 2002 - 2003 food emer-gency, is that of harmonisation of national biosafety regulatory systems.
