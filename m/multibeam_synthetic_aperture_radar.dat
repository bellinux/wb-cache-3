Each beam iilluminates a separate range and azimuth interval, and images for different beams may be separated {{on the basis}} of the Doppler spectrum of the beams or their spatial azimuth separation in the image plane of the radar processor. The azimuth resolution of the radar system is selected so that the Doppler spectrum of each beam does not interfere with the Doppler foldover due to the finite pulse repetition frequency of the radar system...|$|E
40|$|A single-frequency <b>multibeam</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>radar</b> {{for large}} swath imaging is disclosed. Each beam {{illuminates}} a separate ""footprint'' (i. e., range and azimuth interval). The distinct azimuth intervals for the separate beams produce a distinct Doppler frequency spectrum for each beam. After range correlation of raw data, an optical processor develops image {{data for the}} different beams by spatially separating the beams to place each beam of different Doppler frequency spectrum in a different location in the frequency plane {{as well as the}} imaging plane of the optical processor. Selection of a beam for imaging may be made in the frequency plane by adjusting the position of an aperture, or in the image plane by adjusting the position of a slit. The raw data may also be processed in digital form in an analogous manner...|$|E
40|$|Remote sensing is an {{incredibly}} broad subject ranging from photographic imaging to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging to seismic tomography to <b>multibeam</b> sonars to <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>radars</b> [...] . In this class we'll limit the scope to: • satellite (or aircraft) remote sensing of the Earth (mostly); • information carried by electromagnetic waves; and • no discussion of atmospheric sounding. When you look through the textbook by Rees [2001], you will not find detailed discussion of applications of remote sensing. Instead {{the focus is on}} the physical principles of remote sensing. Studying all the applications in a 10 -week course would be impossible. Moreover, the methods and applications change frequently so details learned today will be obsolete tomorrow. It is more important to learn the fundamental principles and learn the details later as needed. For the graduate-level course, the students select a scientific problem that can be addressed using one or more remote sensing tools. Then they can become experts on the particular application with scientific guidance from a researcher at SIO. Over the years I have collected perhaps 100 term papers from SIO graduate students. The topics are very diverse. For example a student prepared a term paper on the correlation of offshore bird census information (from ship observations) with ocean surface temperature measured by satellite. My area of expertise uses the tools satellite geodesy to measure the properties of the solid earth. This includes measuring micro variations in the pull of gravity over the oceans using radar altimetry and measuring crustal deformation using <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>radar</b> interferometry. Each year new remote sensing instrumentation is being developed. This technology development is driven by scientific questions and practical needs. I hope that you can get the following out of this course: • a brief review of some basic physics; • a broad understanding of the methods and limitations of remote sensing systems; • an introduction to image processing and display methods; • an overview of a few of the systems being deployed today; and • finally, throught the term project (graduate students only), I hope you can obtain a detailed understanding of a particular remote sensing system and how it addresses a scientific issue...|$|R

A parameter estimation scenario is then described in which the Interferometric <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> <b>Radar</b> cross-correlation amplitude and phase are the observations from which vegetation and surface topographic parameters are estimated. It is shown that, even in the homogeneous-layer model of the vegetation, the number of parameters needed to describe the vegetation and underlying topography exceeds the number of Interferometric <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> <b>Radar</b> observations for single-baseline, single-frequency, single-incidence-angle, single-polarization Interferometric <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> <b>Radar.</b> Using ancillary ground-truth data {{to compensate for the}} underdetermination of the parameters, forest depths are estimated from the INSAR data.
