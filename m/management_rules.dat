2500|$|Fisheries {{management}} is {{the activity of}} protecting fishery resources so sustainable exploitation is possible, drawing on fisheries science, and including the precautionary principle. [...] Modern fisheries {{management is}} often referred to as a governmental system of appropriate <b>management</b> <b>rules</b> based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which are put in place by a system of monitoring control and surveillance. A popular approach is the [...] According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), there are [...] "no clear and generally accepted definitions of fisheries management". However, the working definition used by the FAO and much cited elsewhere is: The integrated process of information gathering, analysis, planning, consultation, decision-making, allocation of resources and formulation and implementation, with enforcement as necessary, of regulations or rules which govern fisheries activities in order to ensure the continued productivity of the resources and the accomplishment of other fisheries objectives.|$|E
2500|$|Implementing the {{additional}} stages required {{a more formal}} process. Throughout 1987, FWP held hearings and solicited comments on Shouse report, {{with an eye toward}} issuing a more complete management plan. This management document, the [...] "Smith River Management Plan", was issued in 1988. Shouse's data analysis, findings, and recommendations were almost completely incorporated into the 1988 plan. FWP made one change to the recommendations, deciding to base carrying capacity on the total number of float parties per day rather than the total number of floaters. FWP used the average size of a float party in 1985 (6.5 individuals), determining that the floater carrying capacity was 15 float parties per day. FWP also imposed a maximum size of 15 on the number of individuals a float party could contain, as this was the maximum capacity of the boat camps each night. As is readily apparent, this formula did little to restrict use of the Smith River if float party size increased from 6.5 to the maximum of 15 (a 125 percent {{increase in the number of}} floaters). Implementation of the Stage 1 <b>management</b> <b>rules</b> went into effect smoothly, although floaters disliked having their watercraft tagged.|$|E

Buffett was reluctant to create the class B shares, but did so to thwart the creation of unit trusts that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire look-alikes. As Buffett said in his 1995 shareholder letter: [...] "The unit trusts that have recently surfaced fly {{in the face of}} these goals. They would be sold by brokers working for big commissions, would impose other burdensome costs on their shareholders, and would be marketed en masse to unsophisticated buyers, apt to be seduced by our past record and beguiled by the publicity Berkshire and I have received in recent years.
