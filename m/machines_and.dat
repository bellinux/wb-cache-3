40|$|The wide use of <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> {{machinery}} in {{the construction}} industry can reduce the dependency on foreign workers. The Construction Industry Development Board is formulating a strategic plan to promote the use of <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> machinery {{in the construction}} industry. Therefore, this study aims to study the level and status of the usage <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> machinery among the G 7 contractors at construction sites. The instrument used in the study consist of questionnaire and interviews. Based on the literature findings, there are 9 types of <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> 9 types machinery used {{in the construction industry}}. The percentage use of <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> machinery as well as the level of mechanisation for each phase of construction is at level 1, where the <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> machinery is still driven by the operator and do not involved high technology. The main recommendation in this study is to provide training on the latest information on <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> machinery and CPD (Continue Professional Development) training to promote the use of <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> machinery. In addition, the offering better incentives such as tax breaks and loan facilities should be awarded and provided by the government to activate the economic growth...|$|R

5|$|A pancake {{machine is}} an electrically-powered machine that {{automatically}} produces cooked pancakes. It {{is believed that}} the earliest known pancake machine was invented in the United States in 1928. Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies mass-produce pancake <b>machines,</b> <b>and</b> some have been homemade. The Happy Egg Company constructed a novelty pancake machine in 2013 in commemoration of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom.|$|E

Strobe lights, smoke <b>machines,</b> <b>and</b> even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} to farmers.

The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of <b>machines,</b> <b>and</b> population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s and collapsed completely in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E

Metrological characterizations consist in the direct and indirect verification of the hardness <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> measuring system. In the direct verification, main parameters are verified; in the indirect verification, a comparison of the whole performances of <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> measuring system are verified through a comparison with INRIM Primary Hardness Standard (PHS) <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> Measuring System. Results have been compared with technical specifications of Hardness <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> Measuring System to verify the quality of LTF realization...|$|R

Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of metronome, had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.|$|E

Therefore, researchers should thoroughly understand the radial stiffness characteristics of the wheel. In reality, <b>machining</b> <b>and</b> installation errors are inevitable [21, 22]. Owing {{to the design of}} the ME-Wheel, the <b>machining</b> <b>and</b> installation errors significantly influence the radial {{stiffness of}} the wheel. Therefore, it is of theoretical and practical significance to investigate the effects of <b>machining</b> <b>and</b> installation errors on the radial stiffness of the ME-Wheel.|$|R

5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, <b>machines</b> <b>and</b> entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous investment in {{a large number of}} sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E
