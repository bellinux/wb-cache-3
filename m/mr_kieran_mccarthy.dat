5000|$|According to AllMusic's <b>Kieran</b> <b>McCarthy</b> [...] "It's next to {{impossible}} to describe their sound, because — by design — it rarely follows consistent patterns". Some of their music {{has been described as}} having [...] "a majestic ebb and flow that suggests natural wonders" [...] or a [...] "witchy, tribal side".

[...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Wes Borland {{has picked}} up Ween's affectations (pitch-altered vocals with wacky accents, ultra-chintzy synth beats)...for genre mocking....working up a functional head of silliness a few times." [...] CMJ called the album [...] "A sick marriage of over-the-top death metal and Ween-y pop....it's an absolutely ridiculous record, chock full of pitch-shifted voices and ludicrous lyrics." [...] Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Dumb? Check. Big? Not likely. But at least Duke Lion Fights the Terror isn't only about the nookie." ...|$|R

5000|$|The 2011 Telegraph article {{included}} {{an interview with}} <b>Kieran</b> <b>McCarthy,</b> [...] "a Fabergé expert from the Mayfair jeweller Wartski" [...] and McCarthy stated [...] "whoever has this piece will {{have no idea of}} its provenance and significance - nor will they know they are sitting on a royal relic which could be worth £20  million." [...] McCarthy hypothesized that there [...] "is every chance this egg is somewhere in this country, because even though it was not sold as Fabergé in the 1964 auction, a lot of Fabergé collectors and buyers of “Fabergé-style” works of art were English collectors at the time." [...] While the hypothesis of current English ownership proved invalid, the search efforts and commentary in the United Kingdom led to the publication of the Telegraph article which included the black and white photograph from the 1964 catalog and repeated much of the description, including that the egg contained [...] "a gold watch by the Swiss watch maker Vacheron & Constantin." [...] The article was archived online and thereafter available to the global (English-reading) audience and searchable on Google.|$|R

2500|$|The {{school was}} led by its first non-Christian Brother headmaster, <b>Mr</b> <b>Kieran</b> Fouhy, for 27 years from 1989 until 2015 (by far the longest tenure of any headmaster). Under his leadership, [...] the student roll at St Peter's {{increased}} from 669 in 1989 to 1344 students in 2015. He was also responsible for the completion of significant building projects. During the 1990s, {{as well as the}} renovation (and naming) of the Brother J. B. Lynch Science Laboratories, the Brother P. C Ryan sports pavilion replaced the original pavilion built in 1960 and which had been ruined by fire. The Brother W. R. Smith Music and Drama Suite was built. Brother Smith (1948–1953), the third headmaster of the college, had initiated the first school orchestra. The [...] Brother L. H. Wilkes Technology Block was opened in 2001 (awarded the NZIA Resene Supreme Award for Architecture 2002 and the NZIA Resene Branch Award for Architecture 2001) and a dedicated building for the intermediate school ("the Middle School") on Mountain Road, named after Brother V.A. Sullivan, was occupied in 2003. The St Peter's College Sports Complex was erected on the old netball courts and was a 2012 Auckland Architecture Award winner. In 2015 a 12-classroom block named the [...] "Outhwaite Building," [...] named after Isa Outhwaite, the donor of the school site, was completed on Mountain Rd.|$|R
5000|$|The school {{operated}} as St Paul's College after Queen's Birthday 1955 (from Tuesday 7 June) {{under the}} same motto [...] "Confortare esto vir". The same traditions were faithfully upheld {{as they had been}} for the previous 50 years. Many sons of old boys preferred to attend St Paul's in the following years, both because it was more central and because their fathers had attended school there. The school maintained a substantial roll into the 1970s. On 8 August 1982, when the school was integrated it had a roll of 330 (280 in the secondary section and 50 in the middle or intermediate school), but this was increased in 1998 to a maximum roll of 400. [...] However, with the establishment of other secondary schools in the school's traditional catchment, enrolment numbers declined. Many of the families associated with the school moved out of the local area as the socio-economic character of suburbs adjacent to the school changed although many still sent their sons to St Paul's by bus, mostly from South Auckland. The school is attempting to attract the sons of the new local demographic as well as the college's traditional supporters. In 2015 a 1700 square metre slice of unused school land was sold to fund new class rooms, an administration block and a new middle school due to open in 2018. The middle school block is expected to enable St Paul's to increase its roll from 280 to 400 students. Afterwards $25m is to be spent to redevelop the secondary school so that the total school roll would be 1000 by 2025. The school hopes as a local college, to enrol more local students from the nearby suburbs of Grey Lynn and Westmere by [...] "exhorting students" [...] to [...] "exam success" [...] and [...] "altruistic action." [...] The Headmaster of St Paul's appointed in 2016, <b>Mr</b> <b>Kieran</b> Fouhy said, on his appointment, that he aimed to incorporate students' families {{in the life of the}} college and to further increase the spirit of independence and personal responsibility amongst the students.|$|R
50|$|The {{opening of}} the film makes direct {{reference}} {{to the events of}} A Christmas Story, and the ending narration strongly parallels it. However, because the cast of the original film had aged {{to the point where they}} no longer fit their roles, it was entirely recast, with the exception of Tedde Moore, who returns as Ralphie's teacher, Miss Shields. Charles Grodin stars as the Old Man (Mr. Parker), Mary Steenburgen plays <b>Mrs.</b> Parker, and <b>Kieran</b> Culkin plays Ralphie. Shepherd provides the narration, just as he had done for A Christmas Story.|$|R
