5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on <b>monozygotic</b> twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of <b>monozygotic</b> twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> twins {{always have}} {{different}} phenotypes. Normally {{due to an}} environmental factor or the deactivation of different X chromosomes in female <b>monozygotic</b> twins, and in some extremely rare cases, due to aneuploidy, twins may express different sexual phenotypes, normally from an XXY Klinefelter syndrome zygote splitting unevenly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> {{twins are}} genetically nearly {{identical}} {{and they are}} always the same sex unless {{there has been a}} mutation during development. The children of <b>monozygotic</b> twins test genetically as half-siblings (or full siblings, if a pair of <b>monozygotic</b> twins reproduces with another pair or with the same person), rather than first cousins. Identical twins {{do not have the same}} fingerprints, because even in the confines of the womb, the fetuses touch different parts of this environment, which gives small variations in the same fingerprint, making them unique.|$|E
25|$|The predisposing {{factors of}} <b>monozygotic</b> {{twinning}} are unknown.|$|E
25|$|The strong genetic {{component}} is borne out in studies on <b>monozygotic</b> twins, with a concordance of 38-55%, {{with an even}} higher concordance of circulating thyroid antibodies not in relation to clinical presentation (up to 80% in <b>monozygotic</b> twins). Neither result was seen to a similar degree in dizygotic twins, offering strong favour for high genetic aetiology.|$|E
25|$|Dizygotic (fraternal) and <b>monozygotic</b> (identical) twins show {{evidence}} of epigenetic influence in humans. DNA sequence differences {{that would be}} abundant in a singleton-based study do {{not interfere with the}} analysis. Environmental differences can produce long-term epigenetic effects, and different developmental <b>monozygotic</b> twin subtypes may be different with respect to their susceptibility to be discordant from an epigenetic point of view.|$|E
25|$|Identical {{triplets}} {{come from}} a <b>monozygotic</b> pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (<b>monozygotic)</b> pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling {{are the result of}} a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> {{twinning}} is not increased after blastocyst transfer {{compared with}} cleavage-stage embryo transfer.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} study, where 114 <b>monozygotic</b> twins and 80 dizygotic twins were {{analyzed}} for the DNA methylation status of around 6000 unique genomic regions, concluded that epigenetic similarity {{at the time}} of blastocyst splitting may also contribute to phenotypic similarities in <b>monozygotic</b> co-twins. This supports the notion that microenvironment at early stages of embryonic development can be quite important for the establishment of epigenetic marks.|$|E
25|$|Some twin {{studies have}} found rates as low as 11.0%13.8% among <b>monozygotic</b> twins, and 1.8%4.1% among dizygotic twins, however.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> twins, {{although}} genetically very similar, are not genetically {{exactly the}} same. The DNA in {{white blood cells}} of 66 pairs of <b>monozygotic</b> twins was analyzed for 506,786 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to occur in human populations. Polymorphisms appeared in 2 of the 33 million comparisons, leading the researchers to extrapolate that the blood cells of <b>monozygotic</b> twins may have {{on the order of}} one DNA-sequence difference for every 1.2 x 107 nucleotides, which would imply hundreds of differences across the entire genome. The mutations producing the differences detected in this study would have occurred during embryonic cell-division (after the point of fertilization). If they occur early in fetal development, they will be present in a very large proportion of body cells.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of twins are either dizygotic (fraternal) or <b>monozygotic</b> (identical). Less common variants are discussed further down the article.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> {{twinning}} {{occurs in}} birthing {{at a rate}} of about 3 in every 1000 deliveries worldwide. (about 0.3% of the world population).|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{spontaneous}} {{or natural}} <b>monozygotic</b> twinning, a recent theory proposes that <b>monozygotic</b> twins are formed after a blastocyst essentially collapses, splitting the progenitor cells (those that contain the body's fundamental genetic material) in half, leaving the same genetic material divided in two {{on opposite sides}} of the embryo. Eventually, two separate fetuses develop. Spontaneous division of the zygote into two embryos is not considered to be a hereditary trait, but rather a spontaneous and random event.|$|E
25|$|Artificial embryo {{splitting}} or embryo twinning, {{a technique that}} creates <b>monozygotic</b> twins from a single embryo, is not considered {{in the same fashion}} as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor embryo is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via embryo transfer. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of IVF {{to increase the number of}} available embryos. If both embryos are successful, it gives rise to <b>monozygotic</b> (identical) twins.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the {{siblings}} themselves from a multiple birth may {{be referred to}} as <b>monozygotic</b> if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause of}} {{difference}} between <b>monozygotic</b> twins is epigenetic modification, caused by differing environmental influences throughout their lives. Epigenetics refers {{to the level of}} activity of any particular gene. A gene may become switched on, switched off, or could become partially switched on or off in an individual. This epigenetic modification is triggered by environmental events. <b>Monozygotic</b> twins can have markedly different epigenetic profiles. A study of 80 pairs of <b>monozygotic</b> twins ranging in age from three to 74 showed that the youngest twins have relatively few epigenetic differences. The number of epigenetic differences increases with age. Fifty-year-old twins had over three times the epigenetic difference of three-year-old twins. Twins who had spent their lives apart (such as those adopted by two different sets of parents at birth) had the greatest difference. However, certain characteristics become more alike as twins age, such as IQ and personality.|$|E
25|$|Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet. 2009 May 15;151C(2):136-41. Not really identical: {{epigenetic}} {{differences in}} <b>monozygotic</b> twins {{and implications for}} twin studies in psychiatry. Haque FN, Gottesman II, Wong AH.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> twins {{may also}} be created artificially by embryo splitting. It {{can be used as}} an {{expansion}} of in vitro fertilization (IVF) {{to increase the number of}} available embryos for embryo transfer.|$|E
25|$|No two humans—not even <b>monozygotic</b> twins—are genetically identical. Genes and {{environment}} influence human biological variation from visible characteristics to physiology to disease susceptibly to mental abilities. The exact influence of genes {{and environment}} on certain traits {{is not well}} understood.|$|E
25|$|Twin studies, {{adoption}} studies, {{and artificial}} selection {{studies have shown}} that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism. Evidence from twin studies show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for <b>monozygotic</b> twins than dizygotic twins—76% for <b>monozygotic</b> twins and 61% for dizygotic twins. However, female twin studies demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males. Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers. Twin studies suggest that males {{are more likely to have}} a genetic predisposition for alcoholism. However, this does not suggest that a male who does have a genetic predisposition will become an alcoholic. Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|Genetic and {{hereditary}} causes {{are being}} considered and several epidemiologic findings indicate considerable genetic influence especially for early onset cases. First degree relatives have a 2.5-fold risk, and nearly 6-fold risk when considering early onset cases. <b>Monozygotic</b> twins have double concordance rate for hysterectomy compared to dizygotic twins.|$|E
25|$|In {{very rare}} cases, twins become {{conjoined}} twins. Non-conjoined <b>monozygotic</b> twins form up to day 14 of embryonic development, but when twinning occurs after 14 days, the twins {{will likely be}} conjoined. Furthermore, there can be various degrees of shared environment of twins in the womb, potentially leading to pregnancy complications.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} {{epigenetic}} consequences {{is evident in}} multiple sclerosis in <b>monozygotic</b> (identical) twins. There are pairs of twins that are discordant with multiple sclerosis and do not both show the trait. After gene testing, {{it was suggested that}} DNA was identical and that epigenetic differences contributed to the gene difference between identical twins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monozygotic</b> twins {{who share}} a {{placenta}} can develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This condition means that blood from one twin is being diverted into the other twin. One twin, the 'donor' twin, is small and anemic, the other, the 'recipient' twin, is large and polycythemic. The lives of both twins are endangered by this condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} twin design {{compares the}} similarity of <b>monozygotic</b> (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins. If identical twins are considerably more similar than fraternal twins (which is found for most traits), this implicates that genes {{play an important role}} in these traits. By comparing many hundreds of families with twins, researchers can then understand more about the roles of genetic effects, shared environment, and unique environment in shaping behavior.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{mechanism}} of synesthesia {{has long been}} debated. Due to the prevalence of synesthesia among the first-degree relatives of synesthetes, {{there is evidence that}} synesthesia might have a genetic basis, however the <b>monozygotic</b> twins case studies indicate there is an epigenetic component. Synesthesia might also be a oligogenic condition, with Locus heterogeneity, multiple forms of inheritance (including Mendelian in some cases), and continuous variation in gene expression.|$|E
25|$|A {{multiple}} pregnancy {{may be the}} result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it {{may be the result}} of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A {{multiple pregnancy}} from a single zygote is called <b>monozygotic,</b> from two zygotes is called dizygotic, or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic.|$|E
25|$|Genetic factors: Genetic factors {{predispose}} both to {{alcoholism and}} to alcoholic liver disease. Both <b>monozygotic</b> twins {{are more likely}} to be alcoholics and to develop liver cirrhosis than both dizygotic twins. Polymorphisms in the enzymes involved in the metabolism of alcohol, such as ADH, ALDH, CYP4502E1, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine polymorphism may partly explain this genetic component. However, no specific polymorphisms have currently been firmly linked to alcoholic liver disease.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} there is a genetic proclivity for dizygotic twinning. However, it is only the mother who has any effect on the chances of having such twins; there is no known {{mechanism}} for a father to cause the release of more than one ovum. Dizygotic twinning ranges from six per thousand births in Japan (similar to the rate of <b>monozygotic</b> twins) to 14 and more per thousand in some African countries.|$|E
25|$|Several {{circumstances}} {{have been}} identified {{that are associated with}} an increased risk of sleep paralysis. These include insomnia, sleep deprivation, an erratic sleep schedule, stress, and physical fatigue. It is also believed {{that there may be a}} genetic component in the development of RISP, because there is a high concurrent incidence of sleep paralysis in <b>monozygotic</b> twins. Sleeping in the supine position has been found an especially prominent instigator of sleep paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{likelihood}} of a single fertilization resulting in <b>monozygotic</b> twins is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. This is {{in marked contrast to}} dizygotic twinning, which ranges from about six per thousand births in Japan (almost similar to the rate of identical twins, which is around 4–5) to 15 and more per thousand in some parts of India and up to over 20 in some Central African countries. The exact cause for the splitting of a zygote or embryo is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{significant}} intrafamilial variability {{observed in}} the severity of renal and extrarenal manifestations points to genetic and environmental modifying factors that may influence the outcome of ADPKD, and results of {{an analysis of the}} variability in renal function between <b>monozygotic</b> twins and siblings support the role of genetic modifiers in this disease. It is estimated that 43–78% of the variance in age to ESRD could be due to heritable modifying factors, with parents as likely as children to show more severe disease in studies of parent-child pairs.|$|E
25|$|Although 99.9% {{of human}} DNA {{sequences}} {{are the same}} in every person, enough of the DNA is different {{that it is possible}} to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are <b>monozygotic</b> ("identical") twins. DNA profiling uses repetitive ("repeat") sequences that are highly variable, called variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), in particular short tandem repeats (STRs), also known as microsatellites, and minisatellites. VNTR loci are very similar between closely related individuals, but are so variable that unrelated individuals are extremely unlikely to have the same VNTRs.|$|E
25|$|Idiopathic {{scoliosis}} {{represents a}} majority of cases, but its causes are largely unknown. Results of recent studies indicate potential heritability of the disorder. About 38% of variance in scoliosis risk is due to genetic factors, and 62% {{is due to the}} environment. The genetics are likely complex however, given the inconsistent inheritance and discordance among <b>monozygotic</b> twins. The specific genes that contribute to development of scoliosis have not been conclusively identified. At least one gene, CHD7, has been associated with the idiopathic form of scoliosis.|$|E
