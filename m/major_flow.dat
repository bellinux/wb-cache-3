40|$|The Noachian-Hesperian {{transition}} on Mars was {{a period}} marked by changes in volcanic processes and styles of aqueous alteration. Understanding the timing and nature of environmental change requires the exploration of units recording both sets of processes. Herein, we report the compositional stratigraphy of distinctive Noachian to Hesperian units along the northeastern margin of the Syrtis <b>Major</b> volcanic <b>flows.</b> A layered, polyhydrated sulfate-bearing unit with jarosite ridges has been discovered beneath the Syrtis <b>Major</b> lava <b>flows</b> and above the regionally-extensive stratigraphy of Noachian plains units reported previously. Sequential clay-, carbonate-, and sulfate-bearing units formed in-situ and record a transition from alkaline pH to acidic pH waters. The sequence is chronologically bookended by the Isidis impact and Syrtis <b>Major</b> <b>flows,</b> {{and is one of}} the most temporally-constrained and well-preserved stratigraphic sections from early Mars available for landed exploration...|$|R

40|$|Composition {{of traffic}} flow {{is one of}} the most {{important}} factors which affect operations at intersections. The effect of different vehicle types in a flow may be reflected by using passenger car equivalence (PCE) values. In this study, it is intended to determine the effect of heavy vehicles, particularly buses that are the most observed heavy vehicle type in urban traffic, on traffic circles. Data of the study are obtained from five different traffic circles in İzmir. The results show that when calculating the heavy vehicle adjustment factor (fHV), different PCE values should be used for minor and major flows. Using the same PCE value for both kind of flows may lead engineers to overdesign or make inadequate designs. Furthermore, it was determined that the effect of heavy vehicles on the <b>major</b> <b>flow</b> was greater when the mean speed of the <b>major</b> <b>flow</b> was low...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The <b>major</b> <b>flow</b> through a rectangular slit virtual impactor was experimentally studied. The impactor was a two-dimensional rectangular slit dichotomous sampler. A series of experiments were performed using monodisperse liquid oleic acid particles, monodisperse solid Polystyrene Latex particles, solid polydisperse Arizona road dust particles and solid superconducting precursor powders. The critical flow rates for separation were investigated both theoretically and experimentally using the CFX 4. 0 code and the newly designed virtual impactor. The tests were conducted in the laminar regime with a Reynolds number of approximately 100. The liquid oleic acid particles were aerosolized using a vibrating orifice aerosol generator (VOAG). The solid road dust particles and superconducting powder were aerosolized using a Wright dust feeder. The concentration at the outlet of the feeder was controlled by varying the pressure drop across the feeder and also providing a dilution air supply to the dispersed air. The particles were collected on 47 mm membrane filters and were analyzed using various techniques including fluorometry, optical microscopy and Coulter counter studies. The effect of mass concentration of the particles on the <b>major</b> <b>flow</b> through the impactor was also studied. However there was a limitation to the maximum amount of mass loading obtained through the Wright dust feeder as higher concentration resulted in the formation of large agglomerates. Due to the formation of agglomerates, most of the particles ended up in the minor flow and consequently the <b>major</b> <b>flow</b> decreased. The results obtained concur with the previous studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Valhall Field is an Upper Cretaceous chalk {{reservoir}} {{located in}} the Central Graben area of the North Sea with production coming from the fractured Torand Hod formations. Well tests and production history indicate that these formations are highly heterogeneous and that significant fluid flow ccurs through both the matrix and fracture system. However there remained significant uncertainty about he specific controls and location of the main productivity conduits and how they would influence sweep efficiency during planned water flood. To address these uncertainties a range of possible conceptual fracture models were considered with respect o controls on <b>major</b> <b>flow</b> within the reservoir. Analysis indicated that the reservoir is dominated by a connected series of seismic scale faults acting as <b>major</b> <b>flow</b> conduits with smaller fractures providing aless significant enhancement to matrix permeability. A key input to {{this study was the}} examination fover 80 well tests. Simulation of a number of key well tests using a simple discrete fracture network model comprising a connected fault network and pseudo-matrix layer was able to reproduce the majority of the observed pressure derivative shapes. This gave some confidence to the understanding of major eservoir flow paths as well as providing calibrated fault properties for direct inclusion within the simulation model...|$|E

The adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is driven by a generic, simple and efficient error estimator based on the jump in value between cell faces for a given variable. It is shown that AMR based on vapour fraction provide unsatisfactory results both for (quasi-) steady and unsteady cavitation, as the <b>major</b> <b>flow</b> features are not captured. Instead, adaptivity driven by the Q-value proved successful even for resolving the cavity interface...|$|E

In this paper, Voronoi Tessellations are obtained by an optimization method where the minimized function is modified from the classical Cen- troidal Voronoi function. The geological features are considered as inner surfaces, dividing the reservoir into closed subdomains. These methodologies are applied successfully to 3 D synthetic reservoirs with internal features such as horizons, faults, partly cutting faults and pinch-outs...|$|E
40|$|A massive {{amount of}} videos are {{uploaded}} on video websites, smooth video browsing, editing, retrieval, and summarization are demanded. Most of the videos employ several types of camera operations for expanding field of view, emphasizing events, and expressing cinematic effect. To digest heterogeneous videos in video websites and databases, video clips are profiled to 2 D image scroll containing both spatial and temporal information for video preview. The video profile is visually continuous, compact, scalable, and indexing to each frame. This work analyzes the camera kinematics including zoom, translation, and rotation, and categorize camera actions as their combinations. An automatic video summarization framework is proposed and developed. After conventional video clip segmentation and video segmentation for smooth camera operations, the global flow field under all camera actions has been investigated for profiling various types of video. A new algorithm {{has been designed to}} extract the <b>major</b> <b>flow</b> direction and convergence factor using condensed images. Then this work proposes a uniform scheme to segment video clips and sections, sample video volume across the <b>major</b> <b>flow,</b> compute flow convergence factor, in order to obtain an intrinsic scene space less influenced by the camera ego-motion. The motion blur technique has also been used to render dynamic targets in the profile. The resulting profile of video can be displayed in a video track to guide the access to video frames, help video editing, and facilitate the applications such as surveillance, visual archiving of environment, video retrieval, and online video preview. ...|$|E
