The VCPI is {{the ratio of the}} system equivalent impedance to the load equivalent impedance. In this paper, an algorithm for network equivalent impedance is proposed; it employs the PV-PQ sensitivity and "referencing" techniques to determine an equivalent impedance of a multi-machine multi-node power system. The validity and effectiveness of this method is demonstrated with the application of different network configurations ranging from the standard IEEE 14 -bus to the realistic 116 -bus Qatar power system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Knowing {{the water}} content in {{transformer}} solid insulation is basic {{to determine the}} transformer <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>load.</b> As direct measurement of this variable is not possible, indirect techniques should be used as those based in the measurement of transformer dielectric response in time or frequency domain. By the application of these techniques is possible to get more accurate information that from traditional methods but some problems remain related to the interpretation of measurements. This paper is focused {{in the application of}} frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) to the determination of water content into the different parts of transformer solid insulation. FDS field measurements over real transformer are reported extracting some general conclusions that may be useful to perform this kind of measurements...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{producer}}-consumer model of multimedia-on-demand (MOD) servers. The producer retrieves media {{data from a}} disk and places it into a set of buffers, while the consumer sends out the data in the buffers to the users. We develop for the producer a buffer-inventory-based dynamic scheduling (BIDS) algorithm that guarantees non-zero inventory and non-overflow of data in the buffers to meet the continuity requirement and no-loss of data for each media stream. The algorithm can deal with heterogeneous media streams {{as well as the}} transient circumstances upon service completions and arrivals of new requests. To smooth out the impact of bursty data of variable-bit-rate media streams and therefore increase the <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>load</b> of requests, we also introduce into the scheduling scheme a time-scale dependent peak consumption rate and a virtual cycle time. Based on BIDS, an effective admission control mechanism can be easily established by checking two simple conditions respectivel [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} {{the assessment of the}} performances of glued laminated wood corner joints for outdoor window profiles applications, proposing a methodology to appreciate the strength of 90 ° tenon mortise corner joints. The rationale relies on the potential damage (i. e. breaking of the frame) that can be caused by poor glueing processes and/or typology of adhesives. There is a number of standards for assessment of wood-adhesive bonds for outdoor windows; however, {{there is a lack of}} specific standards related to glueing assessment for outdoor wood frames, which can take into account all the factors influencing the glueing quality. The proposed methodology was tested on red oak window profiles. A commercially available polyvinyl acetate-based adhesive was used for corner joints. Bending strength of 90 ° tenon mortise corner joints was measured and compared with <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>loads</b> on the frame to limit its deformations within admissible ranges. The test results show that the 90 ° tenon mortise corner joints strength exceeds the <b>admissible</b> <b>load</b> to preserve the functionality of the frame. In order to appreciate the influence of conditioning processes on adhesion, shear strength tests of the flatwise glued joint samples (bond lines of lamellae) were carried out after different conditioning processe...|$|R

This class “intuitively ” has the property that by increasing the load on the network, both the average throughput and the average time delay also increase. It is shorn that the control that achieves the maximum throughput under a bounded average time delay criterion can be specified by a “Hindow ” flow control mechanism (bang-bang control). The window size L, the maximum number of unacknowledged packets in the system, can be easily derived from the preassigned upper bound on the time delay T, the Norton equivalent of the queueing system p, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> total <b>load</b> on the network c. 0 I...|$|R

The bounds of the state variables Δ f_i, [...] = 1.5 [...] Hz, Δ P_G, i, [...] = u_i, [...] and z_ 1, i, [...] = z_ 2, i, [...] = 3 [...] s are standardized, holding for all i = 1, 2. In particular, the bounds Δ f_i, [...] are mentioned in [8], whereas the bounds z_ 1, i, [...] and z_ 2, i, [...] are derived from [22]. The bounds of the tie line power deviations Δ P_tie, i, [...] were selected through extensive simulations.

The bounds of the control signals u_i, [...] were selected in the following manner. First of all, {{they have to be}} at least equal to the <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>load</b> changes, {{in order to be able}} to service them. Furthermore, they have to amend for potential overshoots during the transient response, so they need to be further increased. The final tuning was performed again through simulations, since the bounds of the control inputs determine to a great extent whether or not a nonempty robust invariant set for the networked system actually exists. Ultimately, they had to be pushed to their current values to ensure the existence of the robust invariant set Â_net, ∞^(ψ).|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{materials}} have large use in many components acting as impact energy absorbers. These components {{have to be}} designed {{on the basis of}} the kind of impact, of the involved energy amount and of the <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>load.</b> The choice of the most suitable density for the selected type of foam is based on stress-strain behaviour, obtained by means of experimental tests and/or models. Only a few micro-mechanical models, as the Gibson model, take into account the density effects. These models could result quite complex to manage because of the need of, at least, a rough analysis of the actual foam structure. Conversely, most of the models used for numerical simulations are phenomenological models and have simple parameter identification based on fitting of experimental data, but they do not account for density effect. Experimental uniaxial compression tests performed for several types of foams, namely EPP, PUR (Bayfill EA), EPS and PPO/PS (Noryl GTX), at different density levels are used in order to identify, with an optimisation procedure devoted to the minimisation of the fitting residual evaluated by the least square method, the parameters of four cellular solid models. The considered models are four: the Gibson model [Gibson LJ, Ashby MF. Cellular solids. Structure and properties. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1997], the Rusch model [Rusch KC. Load-compression behavior of flexible foams. J Appl Polym Sci 1969; 13 : 2297 - 311; Rusch KC. Energy-absorbing characteristics of foamed polymers. J Appl Polym Sci 1969; 14 : 1133 - 47; Rusch KC. Load-compression behavior of brittle foams. J Appl Polym Sci 1970; 14 : 1263 - 73], a modified version of the Gibson model and a new empirical model. The third and fourth models have been developed in order to better fit the experimental stress-strain curve. The obtained improvements in terms of weighted sum of the squared errors are shown. The experimental data are a good representation of the typical behaviour of these kinds of foams and can be useful for the validation of models and the comparison of their performance. Moreover the large basis of experimental data for different types of foams at different densities could be used for the analysis of the influence of the density on the model parameters. Explicit empirical formulations are proposed to express the dependency of the phenomenological model parameters on the foam density. These relationships permit the identification of whatever density foam derived from the same solid material and with the same micro-structure by means of a minimum set of experimental tests. At the same time the availability of a large quantity of experimental data is helpful to reach a higher level of confidence in the model parameter values. Finally the identified parameters vs. density laws for the considered types of foam could be used in order to assist the design of a given absorber and to find the optimum density for the specific application. Closed form expression for the specific energy W and the efficiency E can be obtained, based on the resulting identified phenomenological model...|$|E

30|$|Time {{delay is}} usually {{encountered}} in many practical situations such as signal processing, image processing etc. There {{has been an}} increasing research activity on time-delay systems during the past years [1 – 16]. The problem of the delay-dependent stability analysis of time-delay systems has become a hot research topic in the control community [17, 18] {{due to the fact}} that stability criteria can provide a <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> upper bound of time delay. The <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> upper bound can be regarded as an important index for the conservatism of stability criteria [19 – 23]. To our knowledge, Jensen’s inequality has been mostly used as a powerful mathematical tool in the stability analysis of time-delay systems. However, Jensen’s inequality neglected some terms, which unavoidably introduced some conservatism. In order to investigate the stability of a linear discrete systems with constant delay, Zhang and Han [24] established the following Abel lemma-based finite-sum inequality, which improved the Jensen inequality to some extent.|$|R

In such cases, a prevailing absence of surveillance schemes may allow in beaches undetected pollution from stormwater, domestic sewage and industrial effluents (Kuylenstierna et al., 2009). The situation is exacerbated as less developed nations are often at a loss on how to develop workable standards for the purpose of beach water quality monitoring (Johnstone, 2007). Reimann and David Banks (2004) also highlighted the problems of setting meaningful action levels or <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> concentrations (MAC-values) for water quality. Usually, public authorities and responsible politicians consider water quality statistics and take a decision on what proportion of failures they think can be accepted based on a consideration of political factors, economic factors and suggested MAC hinged on available empirical data.

We show that the principle of <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> departure is incompatible with common apportionment properties, such as monotonicity and Hare-quota. When multiple apportionments satisfy the smallest <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> departure property we find a unique apportionment by the repeated application of the property. The allotment such that the differences from the average district size are lexicographically minimized can be found using an efficient algorithm. This apportionment rule is a well-defined allocation mechanism compatible with and derived from the recommendation of the Venice Commission. Finally, we compare this apportionment rule with mainstream mechanisms using data from Hungary, Germany and the United States...|$|R
