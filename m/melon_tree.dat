40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted with}} 80 unsexed broilers of the Arbor Acress strain to determine the capability of a carrot and fruit juice wastes mixture (carrot, apple, mango, avocado, orange, <b>melon</b> and <b>tree</b> tomato) in the same proportion for replacing corn in broiler diet. This study involved a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 5 treatments (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 % of juice wastes mixture in diets) and 4 replicates per treatment. Diets were isonitrogenous (22 % crude protein) and isocaloric (3000 kcal/kg diet). Measured variables were feed consumption, average daily gain, feed conversion, as well as percentages of abdominal fat pad, carcass, digestive organs (liver, pancreas and gizzard) and heart. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance for CRD. Increasing juice wastes mixture levels in diets increased feed consumption (p 0. 05) on carcass, liver, pancreas, gizzard or heart percentages. In conclusion, up to 20 % of juice wastes mixture could be included for the broiler diet to effectively replace up to 40 % corn in the diet...|$|R
40|$|The Juice Wastes Mixture (JWM) is a {{combination}} of waste from carrot and some fruits (apple, mango, avocado, orange, <b>melon</b> and <b>tree</b> tomato) in the same proportion after their juices were squeezed for fresh drink. The JWM could be as an alternative potential feed for replacing corn in the broiler diet. The problem of JWM as broiler feed is the high in crude fiber and low in metabolic energy contents. After processing the JWM by soaking in 20 % concentration of rice hull ash filtrate for 72 hr (IJWM), its crude fiber decreased, while its metabolizable energy increased. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the utilization of IJWM in broiler diets. The experiment was performed in a completely randomized design with different levels of IJWM (0, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 %) for replacing corn in the broiler diets. The variables measured were feed consumption, average daily gain, feed conversion, live body weight, abdominal fat pad percentage, carcass percentage, liver percentage and pancreas percentage. Every treatment was repeated 4 times. The results showed that the IJWM influenced the feed consumption, average daily gain, live body weight, feed conversion and abdominal fat pad very significantly (P< 0. 01). Meanwhile, liver percentage and pancreas percentage were not affected by the IJWM. In conclusion, the IJWM could be included up to 40 % to effectively replace 80 % corn in the broiler diets...|$|R

Life as an apple farmer in Wenatchee, Washington, could be challenging, but Dad was looking particularly depressed. “What is it now? ” Bruce asked. “Seems that the last beekeeper in the area has lost almost all of his hives, ” Bruce’s dad replied. After a semester of introductory entomology at Washington State University and a childhood spent in an apple orchard, Bruce {{knew that this was}} bad. Bees were necessary to pollinate apple trees to produce the fruit. They pollinated over 130 different food crops, such as berries, beans, nuts, <b>melons,</b> and <b>tree</b> fruit. In fact, bees were responsible for over $ 15 billion in agricultural products in the United States alone. Without bees, there would be none of these foods. And that included apples—which were paying for Bruce’s college education! Bruce thought for a moment. “Can you call anyone from outside the area? ” he asked. “If we can find someone—but, even if we could, it might be too late. We only have a window of a week for pollination,” Bruce’s dad answered. “With the loss of so many hives around here, beekeepers from outside the area might be reluctant to come up here. ” Bruce pondered this. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), the phrase used to describe the unexplained death or disappearance of a hive, could have over 60 different factors involved.

40|$|O etileno ?? o horm??nio indutor e acelerador da matura????o e senesc??ncia de frutos climat??ricos, como ?? o caso de mel??es Cantaloupe (Cucumis melo var. Cantalupensis, Naud cv. Vedrantais) e de tomates (Licopersicum esculentum L. cv. Micro-Tom). Sabe-se que a redu????o de produ????o e/ou a a????o desse horm??nio prolonga o per??odo de conserva????o desses frutos. Assim, com o objetivo de reduzir a produ????o desse hidrocarboneto, foram transformados geneticamente meloeiros com clones da ACC oxidase antisense, de mel??o (pMEL 1 AS, Ayub et al., 1996) e de ma???? (pAP 4 AS, Silva et al., 2004). Como era esperado, em ambos os casos, a produ????o de etileno foi reduzida, prolongando a vida de prateleira dos frutos em 7 dias. Entretanto, a produ????o de compostos vol??teis tamb??m foi afetada. Os mel??es transg??nicos produziram, em m??dia, 70 % menos ??steres do que os n??o transformados (NT), independentemente de terem sido transformados com o pMEL 1 AS ou pAP 4 AS. Como a interven????o feita agiu na redu????o da produ????o do etileno, emitiu-se a hip??tese de que com a suplementa????o do horm??nio, a s??ntese de aromas seria restaurada. Tal hip??tese foi comprovada em mel??es pMEL 1 AS, mas n??o nos pAP 4 AS. As causas exatas dessa diferen??a ainda n??o foram esclerecidas. Acredita-se que pela maior redu????o da produ????o de etileno nos frutos pAP 4 AS, al??m de ter-se afetado genes diretamente relacionados com as vias metab??licas cl??ssicas do amadurecimento, genes relacionados a outras vias de s??ntese de horm??nios tamb??m tenham sido afetados, como ?? o caso de citocininas ou poliaminas. Pela observa????o do fen??tipo de plantas pAP 4 AS percebeu-se que essas tiveram maior crescimento vegetativo e brota????es laterais. Considerando-se tais observa????es, lan??ou-se a hip??tese de que com o aumento dos n??veis de citocininas poderia interferir nas respostas ao etileno, retardando a evolu????o normal dos frutos. Em mel??es pAP 4 AS comprovou-se haver maiores teores de citocininas, tanto nas ra??zes quanto nos frutos. Por??m, para confirmar que essas altera????es s??o efetivamente consequ??ncia de maiores teores de citocininas, fez-se aplica????o ex??gena desse regulador de crescimento. No entanto, n??o se observaram as respostas esperadas. Ent??o optou-se por testar a aplica????o de citocininas noutro modelo vegetal, o tomateiro cv. Micro-Tom, que tamb??m ?? produtor de frutos climat??ricos e que propicia maior facilidade de cultivo e obten????o de maior quantidade de frutos em ambientes protegidos e em ??reas com limita????o de espa??o. Como vari??veis moleculares para avalia????o dos tratamentos em mel??es determinou-se o ac??mulo de transcritos de genes de HPL, LOX e AAT, al??m da ACCO e ACCS. Em tomates, foram {{realizadas}} an??lises f??sico-quimicas. Para mel??es, ao se quantificar o ac??mulo de transcritos de genes da ACC sintase (ACCS), verificou-se que os genes ACCS 1 e ACCS 3 apresentaram maiores express??es nos frutos NT, sugerindo que esses t??m forte rela????o com a evolu????o da crise climat??rica. Por outro lado, o gene ACCS 5 foi mais expresso nos frutos pMEL 1 AS e pAP 4 AS, indicando que ?? regulado negativamente pelo etileno. Para as demais vari??veis avaliadas (s??lidos sol??veis totais, colora????o, caroten??ides, clorofilas, firmeza de polpa) durante o amadurecimento na planta, n??o houve diferen??as marcantes entre pMEL 1 AS e pAP 4 AS. Ap??s a colheita e tratamento dos frutos pMEL 1 AS com etileno, houve desverdeamento da casca, e aumento da produ????o de ??steres, correlacionado com maiores n??veis de transcritos dos genes da HPL, LOX, AAT 1, AAT 2, AAT 3 e AAT 4. Nos frutos pAP 4 AS, os n??veis desses transcritos foi significativamente inferior, n??o tendo-se observado desverdeamento, nem amarelamento, tampouco restauro da s??ntese de ??steres. Nesses frutos (pAP 4 AS) foi detectada uma maior concentra????o de zeatina e zeatina ribose do que nos pMEL 1 AS e nos NT. Para tomateiros, nos quais fez-se a aplica????o de citocininas, houve prolongamento do ciclo vegetativo e retardamento da matura????o. Nos frutos provenientes de plantas tratadas verificou-se que a a????o do etileno foi regulada, em particular em rela????o ?? varia????o dos principais pigmentos desse fruto (&# 946;-caroteno e licopeno). Desse modo, acredita-se que as citocininas possam ser as respons??veis pela menor sensibilidade ao etileno em mel??es, mas essa hip??tese precisa ser testada com maior profundidade. A tentativa de prov??-la usando tomateiros como modelo n??o foi totalmente eficiente. Ethylene is the inductor and acceleratorhormone of the maturation and senescence of climacteric fruits, as is {{the case}} of Cantaloupe melons (Cucumismelo var. Cantalupensis, Naud cv. Vedrantais) and tomatoes (LicopersicumesculentumL. cv. Micro-Tom). It is known that the reduction of production and/or the action of this hormone prolongs the shelf life of these fruits. Thus, {{in order to reduce the}} production of such hydrocarbon, were genetically transformed <b>melon</b> <b>trees</b> with clones of the ACC oxidase 'antisense', of melon (pMEL 1 AS, Ayubet al., 1996) and of apple (pAP 4 AS, Silva et al., 2004). As expected, in both cases, the ethylene production was reduced, prolonging shelf life of fruits in 7 days. However, the production of volatile compounds was also affected. The transgenic melons produced, on average, 70 % less esters than the WT, independently of having been transformed with pMEL 1 AS or pAP 4 AS. As the intervention made acted in the reduction of the production of ethylene. It was emitted the hypothesis that, with the supplementation of the hormone, the synthesis of flavors would be restored. Such fact was proven in pMEL 1 AS melons, but not in pAP 4 AS. The exact causes of this difference were not yet made clear. It is believed that because of the greater reduction of the ethylene production in the fruit pAP 4 AS, besides affecting genes directly related to the ripening classical metabolic pathways, genes related to other pathways of synthesis of hormones have also been affected, {{as is the}} case of cytokininsor polyamines. By observation of the phenotype of pAP 4 AS plants we realized that these had more vegetative growth and lateral sproutings. Considering such observations, it was launched the hypothesis that with the increase of the levels of cytokinins one could interfere in the responses to ethylene, delaying the normal evolution of the fruits. In pAP 4 AS melons it was proved that there are higher levels of cytokinins, both in the roots and fruits. However, to confirm that these changes are effectively consequence of higher levels of cytokinins, exogenous application of that growth regulators was made. Nevertheless, were not observed any expected responses. So we decided to test the application of cytokinin in another plant model, the tomato tree cv. Micro- Tom, who is also a producer of climacteric fruits and that provides greater ease of cultivation and obtainment of greater quantity of fruit in protected environments and in areas with limited space. As molecular variables for assessment of the treatments in melons were determined the accumulation of transcript of genes of HPL, LOX and AAT, besides the ACCO and ACCS. In tomatoes, were performed physicochemical analyzes. For melons, when quantifying the accumulation of transcripts of genes of ACC synthase (ACCS), it was found that genes ACCS 1 and ACCS 3 showed higher expressions in WT fruits, suggesting that they have a strong relation with the evolution of the climacteric crisis. Moreover, the gene ACCS 5 was more expressed in fruits pMEL 1 AS and pAP 4 AS, indicating that it is negatively regulated by ethylene. For the other variables evaluated (total soluble solids, color, carotenoids, chlorophylls, pulp firmness) during the ripening on the plant, there were no marking differences between pMEL 1 AS and pAP 4 AS. After harvesting and treatment of pMEL 1 AS fruits with ethylene, there was a degreening of the peel and increase of the production of esters, correlated with higher levels of transcripts of the genes of HPL, LOX, AAT 1, AAT 2, AAT 3 and AAT 4. In pAP 4 AS fruits, the levels of these transcripts was significantly lower, not having been observed degreeningor yellowing, nor restoration of the synthesis of esters. In these fruits (pAP 4 AS) it was detected a higher concentration of zeatin and zeatin ribose than in pMEL 1 AS and WT. For tomato plants, in which was done application of cytokinins, there was prolongation of the vegetative cycle and delay in the maturation. The fruits from the treated plants also prolonged the maturation cycle, but did not decrease sensitivity to ethylene action. It is believed that cytokinins may be the responsible ones for lower sensitivity to ethylene in melons, but this hypothesis was not confirmed and must be tested with greater profundity. The attempt to prove it using tomato plants as model was not efficient...|$|R
