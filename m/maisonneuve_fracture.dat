50|$|The <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>{{fracture}}</b> {{is similar}} to the Galeazzi fracture in the sense that there is an important ligamentous disruption in association with the fracture. The fracture is named after the surgeon Jules Germain François Maisonneuve.|$|E
50|$|Jules Germain Francois Maisonneuve (10 December 1809 - 9 April 1897) was a French {{surgeon and}} student of Guillaume Dupuytren. Maisonneuve is notable {{as the first}} surgeon to explain the role of {{external}} rotation {{in the production of}} ankle fractures. The eponymously named <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fracture</b> describes a specific fibular fracture.|$|E
40|$|<b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fractures</b> {{result from}} a {{disruption}} of the medial ankle structures and a proximal fibular fracture. Patient complaints can be misleading {{and there is a}} significant rate of delayed diagnosed injuries. We present a case of bilateral <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fractures</b> after a fall due to a syncopal collapse. A precise clinical examination led to this rare diagnosis. The injuries were treated with syndesmotic screw fixation, removal of hardware followed after 6 weeks. The patient was asymptomatic at threemonths follow up. Patients with bilateral injuries undergoing standard surgical treatment can gain full recovery, but high suspicion in clinical examination is needed to detect this uncommon bilateral injury...|$|R
40|$|Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114 D iagnosis and {{treatment}} of syndesmotic injuries, whether associated with mal-leolar ankle <b>fractures,</b> <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fractures</b> or purely ligamentous injuries, has been extensively researched. There has been increasing interest as more recent studies have demonstrated a relatively high rate of syndes-motic malreduction and resultant morbidity after surgical fixation. These studies {{suggest the need for}} more advanced imaging studies both preoperatively and intraoperatively, as well as a change in traditionally used surgi-cal techniques, to ensure optimal treatment of syndesmotic injuries. Obtaining plain radiographs of the injured ankle followed by fixation of the syndesmosis using classically taught reduction techniques with intraoperative fluoroscopy to ensure prop-er reduction has long been the standard of care. However, the current evidence suggests that doing things the old way may be the wrong way. We present an illustrative case report as well as a commentary based on the current literature...|$|R
40|$|There is sparse {{information}} {{in the literature on}} the outcome of Maisonneuve-type pronation-external rotation ankle fractures treated with syndesmotic screws. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine the long-term results of such treatment of these fractures as indicated by standardized patient-based and physician-based outcome measures. The secondary aim was to identify predictors of the outcome with use of bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Fifty patients with pronation-external rotation (predominantly <b>Maisonneuve)</b> <b>fractures</b> were treated with open reduction and internal fixation of the syndesmosis utilizing only one or two screws. The results were evaluated at a mean of twenty-one years after the fracture utilizing three standardized outcomes instruments: (1) the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), (2) the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scale, and (3) the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) Scale. Osteoarthritis was graded according to the van Dijk and revised Takakura radiographic scoring systems. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of long-term outcome. Forty-four (92 %) of forty-eighty patients had good or excellent AOFAS scores, and forty-four (90 %) of forty-nine had good or excellent FAAM scores. Arthrodesis for severe osteoarthritis was performed in two patients. Radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis was observed in twenty-four (49 %) of forty-nine patients. Multivariate analysis identified pain as the most important independent predictor of long-term ankle function as indicated by the AOFAS and FAAM scores, explaining 91 % and 53 % of the variation in scores, respectively. Analysis of pain as the dependent variable in bivariate analyses revealed that depression, ankle range of motion, and a subsequent surgery were significantly correlated with higher pain scores. No firm conclusions could be drawn after multivariate analysis of predictors of pain. Long-term functional outcomes at a mean of twenty-one years after pronation-external rotation ankle fractures treated with one or two syndesmotic screws were good to excellent in the great majority of patients despite substantial radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis in one-half of the patients. The most important predictor of long-term functional outcome was patient-reported pain rather than physician-reported function or posttraumatic osteoarthritis. There was no significant association between radiographic signs of posttraumatic osteoarthritis and perceived pain in the present serie...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>{{fracture}}</b> is {{a spiral}} fracture of the proximal {{third of the}} fibula associated with a tear of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis and the interosseous membrane. There is an associated fracture of the medial malleolus or rupture of the deep deltoid ligament. This type of injury {{can be difficult to}} detect.|$|E
50|$|On {{clinical}} examination, it {{is important}} to evaluate the exact location of the pain, the range of motion and the condition of the nerves and vessels. It is important to palpate the calf bone (fibula) because there may be an associated fracture proximally (<b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fracture),</b> and to palpate the sole of the foot to look for a Jones fracture at the base of fifth metatarsal (avulsion fracture).|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of X-rays, {{demonstration}} of widening of the tibia and fibula 'mortise', a fracture of the medial malleolus, or a <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fracture,</b> will indicate an unstable or potentially unstable injury. However, 'normal' x-rays do not exclude significant ligament injury, and in one study, the ratio of diagnostic X-ray to known syndesmotic injury was only one in 17. By contrast, ultrasound may permit the injury to be visualized while the mortise is being stressed. Consequently, a diagnostic modality such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that demonstrates the ligament itself may be helpful, if clinical suspicion remains.|$|E
50|$|In this {{sequence}} of events, {{the most vulnerable}} structure is the anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament, uniting {{the lower end of}} the tibia and fibula and playing an important role in the maintenance of the mortise. The injury to this ligament may vary from simple stretch to complete rupture. Some restraint to further injury is offered by the structures on the inside of the ankle, the medial malleolus and the medial collateral ligament. However, should these structures fail, then the force will be transmitted beyond the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament to the strong membrane that holds the tibia and fibula together for most of their length. This force may then exit through the upper end of the fibula, creating a so-called <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fracture.</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} whether a two-hole locking plate has biomechanical advantages over conventional screw stabilisation of the syndesmosis in this injury pattern. METHODS:: Six pairs of fresh-frozen human cadaver lower legs were prepared to simulate an unstable <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fracture.</b> Each limb was compared with its pair; the syndesmosis in one being stabilised with two 4. 5 mm quadricortical cortical screws, the other a two-hole locking plate with 3. 2 mm locking screws. The limbs were then mounted on a servo-hydraulic testing rig and axially loaded to a peak load of 800 N for 12000 cycles. Fibula shortening and diastasis were measured. Each limb was then externally rotated until failure occurred. Failure was defined as fracture of bone or metalwork, syndesmotic widening or axial migration > 2 mm. RESULTS:: Both constructs effectively stabilised the syndesmosis during the cyclical loading within 0. 1 mm of movement. However the locking plate group demonstrated greater resistance to torque compared to quadricortical screw fixation (40. 6 Nm vs 21. 2 Nm respectively, p valu...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Ankle {{fractures}} {{are among}} {{the most common type of}} fractures in the lower extremity. A posterior malleolar fracture is frequently part of a more complex ankle fracture and only in rare cases it occurs as isolated injury. Posterior malleolar fractures often occur with associated injuries, such as a <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fracture</b> or with bi- or trimalleolar ligamentous injuries. Knowledge about these associated injuries is essential to prevent missed diagnoses. The aim of this article is to describe the isolated posterior malleolar fracture, the possible associated injuries, the diagnostic work-up and therapeutic consequences. Presentation of case: We present a case of a 26 -year-old male patient who sustained an isolated posterior malleolar fracture with 4. 5 years follow-up. Discussion: Isolated fractures of the posterior malleolus are uncommon injuries. Diagnosis, treatment and outcome can seldom be extracted from large series. However, several cases have been described in literature, which we have summarized. Conclusion: This case report and literature review shows that isolated posterior malleolar fractures might occur as part of a more complex ankle injury, in combination with a fracture of the lower leg or after high energy trauma. Physicians should be aware of these associated injuries. Diagnostic work-up should include X-rays of the knee and lower leg and a CT scan of the ankle. If diagnosed and treated properly, isolated posterior malleolar fractures have a good long-term functional outcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to review the published clinical evidence available for the treatment of Maisonneuve fractures. Medline via PubMed, Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) annual meetings' abstracts archives Web site, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Clinical Trial register were searched for the period extending from January 1970 to May 2009 in order to identify studies relating to the treatment of Maisonneuve ankle fractures. Six level 4 (case series, N >= 5) studies, describing a total of 83 patients with a <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fracture,</b> were included in the review. Although the authors did not compare the different treatment strategies described in the reports, the overall outcomes were generally good, and included 74 (89 %) patients in which the outcome was considered good or excellent, and 9 (11 %) patients in which the outcome was considered fair or poor. Based on this review, some grade B and C recommendations for the treatment of Maisonneuve fractures were formulated, including: 1) the medial malleolus should be fixated, 2) the torn deltoid ligament need not be directly repaired, 3) syndesmotic instability can be treated with one or two 3 - or 4 -cortical screws and these can be placed percutaneously, and 4) the proximal fibular fracture does not require direct internal fixation. Recommendations for future research were also formulated and described in this report. (C) 2011 by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|David A Porter, Ryan R Jaggers, Adam Fitzgerald Barnes, Angela M Rund Methodist Sports Medicine/The Orthopedic Specialists, Indianapolis, IN, USA Abstract: Syndesmosis {{injuries}} {{occur when}} there is a disruption of the distal attachment of the tibia and fibula. These injuries occur commonly (up to 18 % of ankle sprains), and the incidence increases in the setting of athletic activity. Recognition of these injuries is key to preventing long-term morbidity. Diagnosis and treatment of these injuries requires a thorough understanding of the normal anatomy and the role it plays in the stability of the ankle. A complete history and physical examination is of paramount importance. Patients usually experience an external rotation mechanism of injury. Key physical exam features include detailed documentation about areas of focal tenderness (syndesmosis and deltoid) and provocative maneuvers such as the external rotation stress test. Imaging workup in all cases should consist of radiographs with the physiologic stress of weight bearing. If these images are inconclusive, then further imaging with external rotation stress testing or magnetic resonance imaging are warranted. Nonoperative treatment is appropriate for stable injuries. Unstable injuries should be treated operatively. This consists of stabilizing the syndesmosis with either trans-syndesmotic screw or tightrope fixation. In the setting of a concomitant Weber B or C fracture, the fibula is anatomically reduced and stabilized with a standard plate and screw construct. Proximal fibular fractures, as seen in the <b>Maisonneuve</b> <b>fracture</b> pattern, are not repaired operatively. Recent interest is moving toward repair of the deltoid ligament, which may provide increased stability, especially in rehabilitation protocols that involve early weight bearing. Rehabilitation is focused on allowing patients to return to their pre-injury activities as quickly and safely as possible. Protocols initially focus on controlling swelling and recovery from surgery. The protocols then progress to restoration of motion, early protected weight bearing, restoration of strength, and eventually a functional progression back to desired activities.
