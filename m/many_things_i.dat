500|$|... "Within" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} tracks to be {{recorded}} for the album. It features Gonzales on piano with minimal accompaniment consisting of bass and a percussion track, as well as vocoder. In the context of the album, [...] "Within" [...] marks the transition from the key of A minor of the previous three songs, to the key of B-flat minor of subsequent tracks. Regarding the lyrics, critic Nick Stevenson observed, [...] "A deep vocoder sings about not understanding the world, being lost and not even remembering his own name." [...] Jeremy Abbott of Mixmag added, [...] "So <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> don't understand is the prominent lyric and Chilly's chords combined with grazing cymbals make for a beautiful summer lullaby." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} {{generally}} well received by critics. Abby West of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "one of the <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> love {{about the show}} is how current it is. I love the pop-culture references, like Losts Dharma Initiative, Deal or No Deal, and that soon-to-be classic SNL/Chronicles of Narnia sketch. IGN's Brian Zoromski said that although the episode had [...] "a few hit and miss moments", it [...] "was a very well done episode that carried through on three main storylines" [...] and [...] "began and ended beautifully". Aaron from eTV Review said that even if it [...] "wasn’t as good as last week’s episode", it was still [...] "another great one". In a poll done by OfficeTally.com, [...] "Initiation" [...] was ranked by viewers as the thirteenth funniest of the twenty-three episodes of the third season.|$|E

He said: [...] "over {{the course of}} several years, I gradually became Catholic and then decided one day to accept the faith I had already come to embrace". He decided to officially become a Catholic when he saw Pope Benedict XVI, during the Pope's visit to the United States in 2008: [...] "Catching a glimpse of Pope Benedict that day, I was struck by the happiness and peacefulness he exuded. The joyful and radiating presence of the Holy Father was a moment of confirmation about the <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> had been thinking and experiencing for several years." [...] At a 2011 appearance in Columbus, Ohio, he said, [...] "In America, religious belief is being challenged by a cultural elite trying to create a secularized America, in which God is driven out of public life." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{established}} {{actors were}} {{considered for the}} leading role of Rusty Sabich. Kevin Costner turned down the role, and Robert Redford was vetoed by Pollack due to his age. When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, all the action takes place around him. Things happen to him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There are <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> found I could express with that short haircut. Simplest of all, I wanted to tell the audience to leave their baggage at home — not to expect the Harrison Ford they've seen before." ...|$|E

I don't see the advantage of saying, 'You shouldn't have liked that movie because ultimately, if you were an Objectivist, you wouldn't have.'

2500|$|In May 2016, Keys {{initiated}} a #NoMakeup movement, where she wrote on Lenny [...] "Before I started my new album, I wrote {{a list of}} all the things that I was sick of. And one was how much women are brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. One of the <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> was tired of was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size. Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked". Keys presented her movement at various events, and received a range of both complimentary and critical responses.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kampusch's {{official}} statement after her escape, she and Přiklopil {{would get up}} early each morning to have breakfast together. Přiklopil gave her books, so she educated herself. Later, when explaining that in general she did not feel she had missed anything during her imprisonment, she noted, [...] "I spared myself <b>many</b> <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company". But she also said: [...] "I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. I give up in despair about this unfairness. I always felt like a poor chicken in a hen house. You saw my dungeon {{on television and in}} the media. Thus you know how small it was. It was a place to despair." [...] She was given a television and radio to pass the time with, although she was initially only allowed to watch taped programmes and listen to foreign radio stations so she would not be aware of the publicised search for her. At one point, she tried to escape by jumping out of a car.|$|E

2500|$|Dance in the Rain is the {{follow-up}} to Coulter's third studio album Fear & Freedom (2012), which debuted at number seven on the ARIAAlbumsChart and became her first top-ten album. Coulter {{began working on}} Dance in the Rain shortly {{after the completion of}} Fear & Freedom. As executive producer of Dance in the Rain, Coulter had full control over the songwriters and producers she wanted to work with. She also spent her own money to travel overseas to write and record material for the album. Coulter intended for DanceintheRain to be an honest album and wanted to avoid following a certain sound and concept. She worked on it for two years in various places around the world, including Bali, Brisbane, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Nashville, New York City, Paris, Sweden and Sydney. Stuart Crichton co-produced a majority of the album's songs alongside Coulter. Speaking of the inspiration behind Dance in the Rain, Coulter stated: [...] "Life throws so much at you and I write about it all...I figured I had a lot to say and there were so <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> wanted to express – and I managed to pull it all together for this one album." ...|$|E

Her last few films were mostly comedies: Les Novices (1970), Boulevard du Rhum (1971) (with Lino Ventura). The Legend of Frenchie King (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with Claudia Cardinale. She made one more with Vadim, Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked [...] "Underneath what people call [...] "the Bardot myth" [...] was something interesting, {{even though she}} was never considered the most professional actress in the world. For years, since she has been growing older, and the Bardot myth has become just a souvenir... I was curious in her as a woman and I had to {{get to the end of}} something with her, to get out of her and express <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> felt were in her. Brigitte always gave the impression of sexual freedom - she is a completely open and free person, without any aggression. So I gave her the part of a man - that amused me.|$|E
