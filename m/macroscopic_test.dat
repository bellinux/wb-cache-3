In this work a nanoindenter based approach is introduced to gain insight into the contact mechanics of micron-sized glass beads sliding on rough silicon surfaces at various constant low normal loads.

Although this rock resembles a mesosiderite in its hand-sample aspect and in having Ni-bearing iron metal, it is not a meteorite. This inference is based on the lack of a fusion crust, the lack of cosmogenic nuclides, oxygen with terrestrial isotope ratios, and several mineral chemical criteria. Most likely, the rock is from the iron-metal-bearing basalts of the Siberian Trap basalt sequence, which are mined for their base and platinum-group metals. Mesosiderite imposters like this may be recognized by: (1) the presence of Cu metal in hand sample or as microscopic blebs in the low-Ni metal (kamacite), (2) the absence of high-Ni metal (taenite), and (3) the presence of iron carbide (cohenite) enclosing the kamacite.

Several limitations of the AFM as a microscopic adhesion tester were elucidated - in particular the necessity for the accurate evaluation of the tip radius and cantilever spring constant. Scan rate an applied load also appeared to play a minor role in the measured adhesion -low loads and low scan rates appearing to produce more accurate data. <b>Macroscopic</b> adhesion <b>tests</b> performed on polyester and fluorocarbon paint coated sheet steel, found the white polyester in question to be significantly poorer than all other paint combinations evaluated in terms of pull-off strength, and environmental durability, irrespective of ageing environment.
