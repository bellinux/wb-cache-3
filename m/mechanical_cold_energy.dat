For the LNG regasification unit consisting of two-stage heat exchangers, a primary Rankine cycle was applied as a typical power cycle of the type A for recovering <b>cold</b> <b>energy</b> to the first-stage heat exchanger. A secondary Rankine cycle of the type B was serially inserted between the first-stage and the second-stage heat exchangers for recovery of the remaining <b>cold</b> <b>energy</b> of preheated LNG. Then, in the type C, the exhaust gas, which had a relatively high temperature, was applied as the heat source of the secondary Rankine cycle, instead of seawater. In such a sequential procedure, the type C was finally suggested as an integrated heat recovery system, in which the seawater and exhaust gas were combined as the heat sources. When the net outputs produced from each heat recovery system were maximized by changing the pressure and mass flow rate of working fluid, the thermal efficiency of the integrated heat recovery system of the type C was η[subscript I,EG] = 0. 0741. The results showed an improvement of approximately 13. 3 % (25. 6 %) in the thermal efficiency compared {{to the value of}} η[subscript I,SW] = 0. 0654 (η[subscript I] = 0. 0590) for the conventional <b>cold</b> <b>energy</b> recovery system of the type B (the type A), which only used seawater as the heat source.

The cold storage system is aiming to save electricity for data center cooling. A typical wickless heat pipe - thermosiphon (thermal-diode heat pipe) will be employed in this application. The thermosiphon <b>cold</b> <b>energy</b> storage systems can be designed into several types that are ice storage, cold water storage and precool heat exchanger.

The heat load used for discussing in this paper is 8800 kW which represents a large scale data center. The methodology addressed in this paper can be also converted into the middle and small sizes of the data centers. This type of storage system will help to downsize the chiller and decrease its running time that would be able to save significant electricity cost and decrease green house gas emissions from the electricity generation.

40|$|AbstractSympathetic fibres {{maintain}} {{some forms of}} neuropathic pain, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, this study investigated the possible involvement of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA 1) {{and the role of}} the sympathetic nervous system (involved in sympathetically maintained neuropathic pain) in a model of neuropathic pain induced by sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) in mice. Systemic injection of the selective TRPA 1 antagonist HC- 030031 reversed the <b>mechanical</b> and <b>cold</b> allodynia that was induced by sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI). Nerve injury also sensitised mice to nociception, which was induced by the intraplantar injection of a low dose of the TRPA 1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate without changing TRPA 1 immunoreactivity in the injected paw. Furthermore, chemical sympathectomy produced by guanethidine largely prevented CCI-induced <b>mechanical</b> and <b>cold</b> allodynia. CCI also induced a norepinephrine-triggered nociception that was inhibited by an α-adrenoceptor antagonist, norepinephrine transporter block and monoamine oxidase inhibition. Finally, the peripheral injection of HC- 030031 also largely reduced CCI-induced norepinephrine nociception and <b>mechanical</b> or <b>cold</b> allodynia. Taken together, the present findings reveal a critical role of TRPA 1 in <b>mechanical</b> and <b>cold</b> hypersensitivity and norepinephrine hypersensitivity following nerve injury.

The baseline dialysate NO− concentrations in the GN were decreased in ZDF rats compared to lean control (LC) rats (<. 05). In ZDF rats, dialysate NO− releases in the GN were markedly increased during EA ST 36, whereas in LC rats, the releases were moderately enhanced at 20 – 40 [*]min after EA ST 36.
