50|$|After its opening, the Corps of Engineers rerouted U.S. Highway 13 {{onto the}} new bridge {{and for a}} few years, closed the old St. Georges Bridge, with the intent of {{demolishing}} it. After local opposition, the old St. Georges Bridge was rehabilitated with new lead-free paint, new roadway deck, and several joint and structural repairs that allows <b>medium</b> <b>weight</b> <b>trucks,</b> for local deliveries, to use the old crossing. A new exit for U.S. 13 and Lorewood Grove Road, which connects St. Georges with Summit was opened after the rehabilitation project was completed.|$|R

40|$|The mining {{industry}} annually consumes trillions of British thermal units of energy, {{a large part}} of which is saveable. Diesel fuel is a significant source of energy in surface mining operations and haul trucks are the major users of this energy source. Gross vehicle <b>weight,</b> <b>truck</b> velocity and total resistance have been recognised as the key parameters affecting the fuel consumption. In this paper, an artificial neural network model was developed to predict the fuel consumption of haul trucks in surface mines based on the gross vehicle <b>weight,</b> <b>truck</b> velocity and total resistance. The network was trained and tested using real data collected from a surface mining operation. The results indicate that the artificial neural network modelling can accurately predict haul truck fuel consumption based on the values of the haulage parameters considered in this study...|$|R
