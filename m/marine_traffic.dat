Many ships of the White Star line that served Canada, such as SS Calgaric, SS Albertic, SS Laurentic, and SS Megantic, had to provide cheap cruises in order to earn money. Britannic, which offered more affordable rates because of lower operating costs, became the ideal ship for the then economic situation.|$|E

2500|$|Collisions {{were also}} too common, when steamboats {{continued}} {{to operate in}} fog or night, without radar or other modern navigation aids, and often caused greater loss of life than fire. [...] Unlike fire, which often could be fought until the vessel reached a beach where passengers and crew could evacuate, collisions came suddenly. [...] Where [...] a substantial difference existed between the size or construction of the vessels, such as steel against wooden hull, destruction could be quick. [...] Thus, {{on the night of}} November 18, 1906, the small, lightly built passenger steamer Dix (130 tons), designed specifically for the very short run across Elliott Bay from Seattle to Alki Point, collided with the much larger steam schooner [...] [...] The night was clear, and the collision seems to have been caused by an error of the Dixs unlicensed mate, who had the wheel while the captain, consistent with the practice of the day, collected the fares. [...] Though the collision speed was small, Dix was lightly built and top-heavy; she quickly heeled over, filled with water, and sank in 103 fathoms, taking 45 people down with her, including her mate.
