5|$|A <b>microbrewery,</b> or craft brewery, {{produces}} {{a limited amount}} of beer. The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a <b>microbrewery</b> varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year. A brewpub is a type of <b>microbrewery</b> that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries. The Benedictine Weihenstephan Brewery in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of Freising in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Cold Feet {{was adapted}} {{into a series}} of the same name for American network NBC. He wrote the {{screenplay}} for one of the pilot episodes. At the same time, NBC and Granada Entertainment USA commissioned a pilot script from Bullen entitled Small Beer, which centred on {{a group of people who}} take over a <b>microbrewery</b> in the north-western United States.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a {{total of}} 500 barrels were produced; this was {{forecast}} to grow to 1,000 barrels by 2009. In 2010, production {{was moved to the}} newly constructed William Worthington's Brewery, a <b>microbrewery</b> based at the National Brewery Centre in Burton. It also produces other Worthington beers such as Red Shield and seasonal beers. In 2012, increasing demand saw White Shield production moved to the main Coors brewery in Burton. In 2013, Roger Protz described White Shield as the highest selling bottle conditioned beer in Britain.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, many <b>microbreweries</b> {{have opened}} in Italy, due to {{increasing}} beer popularity among young people. According to Coldiretti, <b>microbreweries</b> {{have grown in}} ten years by 1900%. There are more than 600 <b>microbreweries</b> active in Italy.|$|R

5|$|The Worthington brand was {{purchased}} from Bass by the American brewing company Coors in 2002, which following a merger became Molson Coors in 2005. Creamflow {{is the third}} highest selling ale in the United Kingdom, {{as well as the}} highest selling ale in Wales, and is brewed in Burton. Worthington's White Shield IPA has continued to be brewed since 1829, and has been the recipient of a number of awards. In 2010, Molson Coors opened the William Worthington <b>microbrewery,</b> which brews historical and seasonal beers.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s White Shield {{had become}} a cult drink brewed in small {{quantities}} for a dedicated following; production in 1965 was just 15,000 barrels as drinkers switched to filtered and pasteurised bottled and keg beers. It found renewed popularity in the early 1970s as the demand for real ale grew, but lost this position as cask ale became easier to find. Bass moved production from Burton to their Hope & Anchor brewery in Sheffield in 1981. The Hope & Anchor brewery closed in 1992, and production was moved to Cape Hill in Birmingham, before being contracted to King and Barnes of Sussex in 1998. By this time, production was down to just 1,000 barrels a year, and the beer's long-term survival was in doubt. The King and Barnes brewery closed in 2000, and production moved to the Bass owned White Shield <b>microbrewery</b> in Burton upon Trent.|$|E

40|$|Includes figures, {{photographs}} and bibliography. In this study, we investigate how <b>microbreweries</b> serve {{a part of}} that neolocal ethic of the Madison area as they reflect and shape local meanings and attachments to place through experience and symbolism. People yearn for something in their community to attach themselves in order to foster a local identity. <b>Microbreweries</b> provide this attachment. As <b>microbreweries</b> rise in popularity, inhabitants can re-establish a connection with the communities they live as they have something to represent the new, unique, and the local. The Madison <b>microbreweries</b> and brewpub we studied {{are an integral part of}} the proliferation of community identity. They stay local and appeal to a specific customer base. The breweries themselves, events they host or sponsor, and the labeling and naming of their product are all characteristics of Madison <b>microbreweries</b> that reflect the culture of the Madison area. By examining several components of <b>microbreweries</b> in the greater Madison area, it became clear how these institutions contribute to community identity and the shape of Madison culture...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, <b>microbreweries</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular in both Sweden and abroad. These breweries focus on producing beer on a smaller scale, with craftsmanship and high-quality raw material as guiding principles. Today, there are around 50 <b>microbreweries</b> in Sweden with different backgrounds, sizes, locations, and lifespan. Given this increase in <b>microbreweries</b> in Sweden, the need for establishing a sturdy position on this evolving market is becoming increasingly important, and seeing that the  microbreweries in this study consist of less than 13 employees, specialized knowledge of each employee becomes pivotal for the organizations’ survival and competitiveness. Therefore, the need for finding and utilizing organizational capabilities that helps them to establish and sustain a certain positioning strategy increases. In this thesis, we have interviewed and investigated five Swedish <b>microbreweries</b> {{with the purpose of}} describing how these <b>microbreweries</b> position themselves and how organizational capabilities facilitate them in reaching their positioning strategy. We investigated the <b>microbreweries</b> by using a qualitative research approach and designed case studies on each, which was based on both primary and secondary data. We interviewed these <b>microbreweries</b> by telephone, using a semi-structured interview form. Each case study was then analyzed using Hooley et al’s (1998) positioning dimensions, Porter’s (1996) positioning bases, and theories concerning organizational capabilities. The study concludes that <b>microbreweries</b> position themselves as a high-quality alternative, and tend to base their positioning strategy upon a needs-based view of positioning. The organizational capabilities that facilitate them in the reaching of their positioning strategies were experience, knowledge, motivation, teamwork, self-criticism, and industrial thinking...|$|R
5000|$|In Canada, <b>microbreweries</b> flourished {{mostly on}} the West Coast, in Québec and in Ontario where a large {{domestic}} market was dominated by a few large companies.

25|$|Although {{there had}} been breweries before, brewing in North Korea began in earnest in 2000, when the country's leader Kim Jong-il {{wanted to build a}} {{showcase}} brewery in the country. The Taedonggang Brewing Company was allowed to buy the old brewery of Ushers of Trowbridge in the United Kingdom and import it to North Korea. The Taedonggang Beer Factory opened in April 2002 in the capital Pyongyang. The Rakwon Paradise <b>Microbrewery</b> and the Yanggakdo Hotel <b>Microbrewery</b> soon followed.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} trends in {{development}} of beer industry in Slovakia. It {{is focused on}} the establishing of new <b>microbreweries.</b> Slovak beer market is characterized by high concentration (as a result of globalisation). More than 80 % of beer consumption in Slovakia origins from two large international companies – Heineken Slovakia (owned by Heineken Corporation) and Pivovary Topvar (owned by SAB Corporation) which bought the traditional domestic beer brands. <b>Microbreweries</b> cover only about 4 % of the total market share. Beer consumption was 94 litres per capita (annually) in 2002 but decreased significantly to 73 litres per capita (annually) in 2011. In 2012 and 2013 small increase in beer consumption was achieved. Due to the smaller consumption the production decreased as well. However, new innovative methods and formulas (Radlers, alcohol free beers, premium beers…) helped to stop the decrease of beer production in recent years, partially thanks to the quality beers produced by the new established <b>microbreweries.</b> The results are based on data of The Brewers of Europe and Slovak Beer and Malt Association. To identify the motives for establishing <b>microbreweries,</b> the interviews with owners and managers of Slovak <b>microbreweries</b> were held...|$|R
