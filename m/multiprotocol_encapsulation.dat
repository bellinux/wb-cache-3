50|$|The Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) is an {{extension}} of the ATM ARP routing mechanism that is sometimes used to improve the efficiency of routing computer network traffic over Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) Networks. It is defined in IETF RFC 2332, and further described in RFC 2333. It can be used by a sender to determine a route with the fewest number of hops to a receiver. The protocol differs from ARP-type protocols in that it allows routing optimization across multiple IP subnets. NHRP is implemented by means of next-hop servers across IP subnets. The NHRP forms a part of the <b>Multiprotocol</b> <b>Encapsulation</b> over ATM (MPOA) protocol as described in RFC 2684. It also plays a role in Cisco's Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network. A limitation of NHRP is its inability to improve multicast protocols.|$|E
30|$|The most {{frequently}} used method to carry IP datagrams over MPEG TS is <b>Multiprotocol</b> <b>Encapsulation</b> (MPE);however, MPEG TS is a protocol optimized for broadcasting and not for IP services, so MPE suffers from design constrains as DVB protocol use MPEG TS at the link layer. If we consider the channel bandwidth efficiency, the encapsulation of IP datagrams by the MPEG TS MPE adds additional overheads to the transmitted data, thus reducing efficiency compared to GSE {{that is designed to}} carry general data, mainly over IP protocol. GSE efficiently encapsulates IP datagrams over variable length link layer packets, which are then directly inserted to the physical layer baseband frames. If IP datagrams use GSE, the reduction in overhead is more than two times compared to MPEG-TS transmission.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{television}} {{devices are}} not only connected to broad-casting systems {{but they are also}} connected to the In-ternet. Their purpose is not only to show TV channels but they are also used to provide interactive applications in form of Smart TV applications and HbbTV (Hybrid Broadcast Broadband Television) applications. HbbTV is an open standard for delivery of interactive ap-plications which was later improved by HBB-Next (Next generation Hybrid Broadcast Broadband) standard. HBB-Next architecture provides additional features and secu-rity to HbbTV applications. HBB-Next defines data trans-fer from application to terminals mainly in form of mul-timedia. Delivery of IP data is present in DVB systems in form of MPE (<b>Multiprotocol</b> <b>Encapsulation)</b> and ULE (Unidirec-tional Lightweight Encapsulation) protocols, however IP data delivery is not specified in HBB-Next.

30|$|Stockhammer et al. [5] {{defined the}} {{protocol}} stack, including the FEC coding at the AL and the PL, for the multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS) download and streaming in universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). In [5], a Raptor code [16] is {{used at the}} AL and a turbo code at the PL. Gomez-Barquero and Bria [10] suggested employing the Raptor codes as the AL FEC in DVB-H systems for mobile terminals and demonstrated its advantages over conventional <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>encapsulation</b> (MPE) FEC. Conventional MPE FEC employs the Reed-Solomon codes to encode the video stream; hence, it lacks the flexibility of LT coding at the AL. Courtade and Wesel [11] considered a setup with LT coding at the AL and turbo coding at the PL, and showed that the available channel bandwidth should be optimally split between the AL and PL FEC codes to improve the system performance.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the need of}} and objectives for new error criteria for mobile broadcasting and the problems related to defining numerical error criteria for video services. The current error criterion used in digital video broadcasting to handheld (DVB-H), namely, <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>encapsulation</b> forward error correction (MPE-FEC) frame error ratio (MFER) 5 %, was defined to enable instantaneous measurements but is not accurate enough for detailed simulations or postprocessing of measured data. To enable accurate transmission system design, parameter optimization, and performance evaluation, {{it is necessary to}} define new practical criteria for measuring the impact of transmission errors. The ambiguity of the MFER criterion is studied, and results for other conventional error criteria are derived from transmission system simulations and objective video quality measurements. The outcomes are compared to results from studies on subjective audiovisual quality. Guidelines are given on the next steps of developing new objective criteria for wireless and mobile video. It is suggested that subjective tests are performed based on the average length and average amount of errors derived from verified mobile radio channel models.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMetro {{networks}} support increasing traffic volumes and evolving traffic profiles. Revisiting metro network architecture, optical packet rings with packet optical add {{and drop}} multiplexing (POADM) features are proposed {{in order to}} support both optical transparency and subwavelength granularity. A medium access control (MAC) structure for multiring POADM networks is proposed, which can support <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>encapsulation</b> and provides the support of differentiated quality of service (QoS) and differentiated protection on a per-flow basis. Unicast and multicast flows are efficiently transported between stations, with a lightweight control within each station. An opportunistic insertion process associated with an appropriate scheduling process is shown to ensure transport network QoS levels. Simple models are provided to assess the transfer performance on the POADM ring. Per-flow protection mechanisms are proposed, and their efficiency is assessed. Dimensioning costs are derived, which take into account the number of used wavelengths and the number of fixed receivers required to support a given traffic matrix. Finally, it is shown that POADM rings can be used to directly support metro Ethernet services and thus allow collapsing the stack of transport network layers...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{methods for}} robust audio-video broadcast over the digital video broadcasting-handheld (DVB-H) system. DVB-H includes a link-layer {{forward error correction}} (FEC) scheme known as <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>encapsulation</b> (MPE) FEC, which provides equal error protection (EEP) to the transmitted media streams. Several approaches for unequal error protection (UEP) have been proposed in the literature, and the applicability of {{some of them to}} DVB-H is analyzed in the paper. A link-layer UEP method based on priority segmentation of the media streams is chosen for more detailed analysis. According to the method, audio and the most important coded video pictures are protected by MPE-FEC more robustly compared to the remaining coded pictures. In order to compare EEP and UEP in a DVB-H environment, an error-prone DVB-H channel was simulated, audio-visual clips were sent through it, and a comprehensive subjective quality evaluation was conducted in a controlled laboratory environment. The results of the subjective evaluation revealed that the use of UEP improves the subjective quality of some test clips noticeably when the channel conditions were severe, while in other tested channel conditions and clips, UEP and EEP performed equally well. </p...|$|E
