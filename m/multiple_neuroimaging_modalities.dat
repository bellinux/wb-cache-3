40|$|Abstract — Quantitative {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} structural and functional brain networks based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI) data have received extensive interest recently. However, the regularity of these structural and functional brain networks across <b>multiple</b> <b>neuroimaging</b> <b>modalities</b> and also across different individuals is largely unknown. This paper presents a novel approach to inferring group-wise consistent brain sub-networks from multimodal DTI/fMRI datasets via multi-view spectral clustering of cortical networks, which were constructed upon our recently developed and validated large-scale cortical landmarks-DICCCOL (Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-based Cortical Landmarks). We applied the algorithms on 100 healthy young females and 50 healthy young males, obtained consistent multimodal brain networks within and across multiple groups, and further examined the functional roles of these networks. Our experimental results demonstrated that the derived brain networks have substantially improved inter-modality and inter-subject consistency, and in addition, these networks exhibited meaningful functional modules...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although neuroimaging {{has greatly}} {{expanded}} our {{knowledge about the}} brain-behavior relation, combining <b>multiple</b> <b>neuroimaging</b> <b>modalities</b> with complementing strengths can overcome some limitations encountered when using a single modality. Valuable candidates for a multimodal approach are functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG). fNIRS is an imaging technology that localizes hemodynamic changes within the cortex. However, hemodynamic activation is an intrinsically slow process. On the other hand, EEG has excellent time resolution by directly measuring the manifestation of the brain electrical activity at the scalp. Based on their complementary strengths, the integration of fNIRS and EEG may provide higher spatiotemporal resolution than either method alone. In this effort, we integrate fNIRS and EEG to evaluate the behavioral performance of six healthy adults in a working memory task. To this end, features extracted from fNIRS and EEG were used separately, {{as well as in}} combination, and their performances were compared against each other...|$|E

40|$|Objective Reliable {{biomarkers}} for {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) are needed, {{given the}} clinical heterogeneity of the disease. Here, we provide proof‐of‐concept for using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic biomarker for ALS. Specifically, we evaluated the added diagnostic utility of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods Twenty‐nine patients with ALS and 30 age‐ and gender‐matched healthy controls underwent brain MRI which used proton MRS including spectral editing techniques to measure γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) and DTI to measure fractional anisotropy of the corticospinal tract. Data were analyzed using logistic regression, t ‐tests, and generalized linear models with leave‐one‐out analysis to generate and compare the resulting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results The diagnostic accuracy is significantly improved when the MRS data were combined with the DTI data {{as compared to the}} DTI data only (area under the ROC curves (AUC)  =  0. 93 vs. AUC  =  0. 81; P  =  0. 05). The combined MRS and DTI data resulted in sensitivity of 0. 93, specificity of 0. 85, positive likelihood ratio of 6. 20, and negative likelihood ratio of 0. 08 whereas the DTI data only resulted in sensitivity of 0. 86, specificity of 0. 70, positive likelihood ratio of 2. 87, and negative likelihood ratio of 0. 20.

Time delay analysis {{has been one of}} the most reliable and most widely used computational electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis methods for localizing ictal onset zones. However, the majority of previous studies have only been applied to the localization of ictal onset zones in focal epilepsy. In the present study, we analyzed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings acquired from patients with Lennox–Gaustaut syndrome (LGS), which is a type of intractable, pediatric, secondary generalized epilepsies with bilaterally synchronous ictal epileptiform discharges. To estimate the ictal onset zones from ictal iEEG recordings, we estimated time delays among iEEG signals based on the information theoretical approach. The results of the time delay analysis applied to the iEEG data of four successfully treated LGS patients corresponded well with the surgical resection areas identified by experienced epileptologists and <b>multiple</b> <b>neuroimaging</b> <b>modalities,</b> suggesting that the time delay analysis may provide useful information on the precise locations of ictal onset zones prior to epilepsy surgery in LGS patients...|$|E

Among all multimodal asymmetries, three PET asymmetries formed the best predictive model (100 % success in full sample, > 95 % success in split-sample validation).

Probabilistic classifications were obtained for new clinical cases, which showed correct lateralization for 7 / 7 new TLE patients (100 %) and for 4 / 5 operated patients with discordant or non-informative PET reports (80 %). Metabolism showed closer relationship with white matter in LTLE and closer relationship with gray matter in RTLE. Our data suggest that metabolism is a powerful modality that can predict seizure laterality with high accuracy, and offers high value for automated predictive models.

40|$|Healthy aging {{simultaneously}} affects brain structure, {{brain function}} and cognition. These effects are often investigated in isolation ignoring any relationships between them. It is plausible that age related declines in cognitive performance {{are the result}} of age-related structural and functional changes. This straightforward idea is tested in within a conceptual research model of cognitive aging. The current study tested whether age-related declines in task-performance were explained by age-related differences in brain structure and brain function using a task-switching paradigm in one hundred and seventy-five participants. Sixty-three young and one hundred and twelve old participants underwent MRI scanning of brain structure and brain activation. The experimental task was an executive context dual task with switch costs in response time as the behavioral measure. A serial mediation model was applied voxel-wise throughout the brain testing all pathways between age group, grey matter volume, brain activation and increased switch costs, worsening performance. There were widespread age group differences in grey matter volume and brain activation. Switch costs also significantly differed by age group. There were brain regions demonstrating significant indirect effects of age group on switch costs via the pathway through grey matter volume and brain activation. These were in the bilateral precuneus, bilateral parietal cortex, the left precentral gyrus, cerebellum, fusiform and occipital cortices. There were also significant indirect effects via the brain activation pathway after controlling for grey matter volume. These effects were in the cerebellum, occipital cortex, left precentral gyrus, bilateral supramarginal, bilateral parietal, precuneus, middle cingulate extending to medial superior frontal gyri and the left middle frontal gyri. There were no significant effects through the grey matter volume alone pathway. These results demonstrate that {{a large proportion of the}} age group effect on switch costs can be attributed to individual differences in grey matter volume and brain activation. Therefore, age-related neural effects underlying cognitive control are a complex interaction between brain structure and function. Furthermore, the analyses demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing <b>multiple</b> <b>neuroimaging</b> <b>modalities</b> within a conceptual research model of cognitive aging...|$|E
40|$|Functional brain {{images are}} {{extraordinarily}} rich data sets that reveal distributed brain networks {{engaged in a}} wide variety of cognitive operations. It is a substantial challenge both to create models of cognition that mimic behavior and underlying cognitive processes and to choose a suitable analytic method to identify underlying brain networks. Most of the contemporary techniques used in analyses of functional neuroimaging data are based on univariate approaches in which single image elements (i. e. voxels) are considered to be computationally independent measures. Beyond univariate methods (e. g. statistical parametric mapping), multivariate approaches, which identify a network across all regions of the brain rather than a tessellation of regions, are potentially well suited for analyses of brain imaging data. A multivariate method (e. g. partial least squares) is a computational strategy that determines time-varying distributed patterns of the brain (as a function of a cognitive task). Compared to its univariate counterparts, a multivariate approach provides greater levels of sensitivity and reflects cooperative interactions among brain regions. Thus, by considering information across more than one measuring point, additional information on brain function can be revealed. Similarly, by considering information across more than one measuring technique, the nature of underlying cognitive processes become well-understood. Cognitive processes have been investigated in conjunction with <b>multiple</b> <b>neuroimaging</b> <b>modalities</b> (e. g. fMRI, sMRI, EEG, DTI), whereas the typical method has been to analyze each modality separately. Accordingly, little work has been carried out to examine the relation between different modalities. Indeed, due to the interconnected nature of brain processing, it is plausible that changes in one modality locally or distally modulate changes in another modality. This thesis focuses on multivariate and multimodal methods of image analysis applied to various cognitive questions. These methods are used in order to extract features that are inaccessible using univariate / unimodal analytic approaches. To this end, I implemented multivariate partial least squares analysis in study I and II in order to identify neural commonalities and differences between the available and accessible information in memory (study I), and also between episodic encoding and episodic retrieval (study II). Study I provided evidence of a qualitative differences between availability and accessibility signals in memory by linking memory access to modality-independent brain regions, and availability in memory to elevated activity in modality-specific brain regions. Study II provided evidence in support of general and specific memory operations during encoding and retrieval by linking general processes to the joint demands on attentional, executive, and strategic processing, and a process-specific network to core episodic memory function. In study II, III, and IV, I explored whether the age-related changes/differences in one modality were driven by age-related changes/differences in another modality. To this end, study II investigated whether age-related functional differences in hippocampus during an episodic memory task could be accounted for by age-related structural differences. I found that age-related local structural deterioration could partially but not entirely account for age-related diminished hippocampal activation. In study III, I sought to explore whether age-related changes in the prefrontal and occipital cortex during a semantic memory task were driven by local and/or distal gray matter loss. I found that age-related diminished prefrontal activation was driven, at least in part, by local gray matter atrophy, whereas the age-related decline in occipital cortex was accounted for by distal gray matter atrophy. Finally, in study IV, I investigated whether white matter (WM) microstructural differences mediated age-related decline in different cognitive domains. The findings implicated WM as one source of age-related decline on tasks measuring processing speed, but they did not support the view that age-related differences in episodic memory, visuospatial ability, or fluency were strongly driven by age-related differences in white-matter pathways. Taken together, the architecture of different aspects of episodic memory (e. g. encoding vs. retrieval; availability vs. accessibility) was characterized using a multivariate partial least squares. This finding highlights usefulness of multivariate techniques in guiding cognitive theories of episodic memory. Additionally, competing theories of cognitive aging were investigated by multimodal integration of age-related changes in brain structure, function, and behavior. The structure-function relationships were specific to brain regions and cognitive domains. Finally, we urged that contemporary theories on cognitive aging need to be extended to longitudinal measures to be further validated...|$|E
