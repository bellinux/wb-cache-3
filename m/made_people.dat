Firstly, a recession set in across New Zealand that <b>made</b> <b>people</b> move to where work opportunities presented themselves, and locally those opportunities were created near the stations of the Methven Branch railway.

5|$|The {{technology}} utilized on Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie grid {{also came}} under fire from critics. It is claimed that this technology, used to improve performance, safety, and reliability, <b>made</b> <b>people</b> in Quebec over-dependent on the power grid for their energy needs, since electricity, especially hydroelectric power, makes up over 40% of Quebec's energy supply. This dependence, evidenced by the fact Ontario farmers had more backup generators than farmers in Quebec, can increase {{the severity of the}} consequences when the grid fails, as it did in January 1998.|$|E
5|$|The 1601 Act {{sought to}} deal with 'settled' poor who had found {{themselves}} temporarily out of work—it was assumed they would accept indoor relief or outdoor relief. Neither method of relief was {{at this time in}} history seen as harsh. The act was supposed {{to deal with}} beggars who were considered a threat to civil order. The Act was passed at a time when poverty was considered necessary as fear of poverty <b>made</b> <b>people</b> work. In 1607 a House of Correction was set up in each county. However, this system was separate from the 1601 system which distinguished between the settled poor and 'vagrants'. There was much variation in the application of the law and there was a tendency for the destitute to migrate towards the more generous parishes, usually situated in the towns. This led to the Settlement Act 1662 also known as the Poor Relief Act 1662, this allowed relief only to established residents of a parish; mainly through birth, marriage and apprenticeship. Unfortunately the laws reduced the mobility of labour and discouraged paupers from leaving their parish to find work. They also encouraged industry to create short contracts (e.g. 364 days) so that an employee could not become eligible for poor relief.|$|E

5|$|Sega {{released}} the Saturn in Japan on November 22, 1994, {{at a price}} of JP¥44,800. Virtua Fighter, a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan.s 3D characters have a presence that 2D sprites just can't match. The characters really do seem 'alive', whether they're throwing a punch, unleashing a special move or reeling from a blow... The Saturn version of Virtua Fighter is an exceptional game in many respects. It's arguably the first true 'next generation' console game, fusing the best aspects of combat gameplay with groundbreaking animation and gorgeous sound (CD music and clear samples). In the arcades, Virtua Fighter <b>made</b> <b>people</b> stop and look. On the Saturn, it will make many people stop, look at their bank balance and then fork out for Sega's new machine. Over to you, Sony. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210173015/http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/virtua-fighter-review/ |archivedate=December 10, 2014 }} The only other first-party title available on launch day was Wan Chai Connection. Sega had wanted the launch to include both Clockwork Knight and Panzer Dragoon, but the latter was not ready in time. Fueled by the popularity of Virtua Fighter, Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side-by-side, the Saturn {{proved to be the}} more popular system. Meanwhile, Sega {{released the}} 32X on November 21, 1994 in North America, December 3, 1994 in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at {{less than half of the}} Saturn's launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. 500,000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher sell-through rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day order system that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.|$|E

25|$|It was {{impossible}} to achieve both these aims, as the principle of less eligibility <b>made</b> <b>people</b> search for work in towns and cities.

White Democrats cast the full vote of the parish for President Grant's opponent. The KKK killed and wounded more than 200 black Republicans, hunting and chasing them through the woods.

25|$|In 2016, Dikembe Mutombo <b>made</b> <b>people</b> {{question}} the draft's legitimacy when he prematurely tweeted a congratulatory {{message to the}} Philadelphia 76ers for receiving the first pick hours before the lottery was conducted. Philadelphia did indeed win the first overall pick. Further questions were raised a bit when the NBA Draft revealed that every spot remained {{exactly the same as}} it was before the event took place, which was the first occurrence in draft lottery history. A year later, Lakers executive Magic Johnson raised even further questions about the draft process with him assuring head coach Luke Walton that the Lakers would acquire a top 3 pick for the 2017 NBA draft after an interview Walton had on May 4, 2017, twelve days before the draft lottery commenced and moved up to the second pick. As a result of the way teams like the Philadelphia 76ers were manipulating draft odds in their favor by losing games on purpose, starting September 28, 2017 with the end of the 2018 NBA draft, the NBA would implement a new system discouraging teams from going through Philadelphia's route in the mid-2010's by not only giving the worst three teams equal odds at the #1 pick, but also increasing their odds at going down within the draft with four teams being selected instead of the usual three.|$|E
25|$|New {{forms of}} New Media are {{emerging}} like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with {{video games and}} the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and {{that people want to}} watch. Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube for the world to see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created {{that the majority of the}} gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that <b>made</b> <b>people</b> see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.|$|E
