25|$|Although {{steel is}} an alloy {{of iron and}} {{a small amount of}} carbon, {{historically}} steel and iron-making were intended for different products given the high costs of steel over wrought iron. The main difficulty with making steel is that its higher melting point than pig or cast iron was not easily achievable in large-scale production until methods that introduced air or oxygen to oxidize the carbon in the <b>molten</b> <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> were developed, allowing the direct conversion of <b>molten</b> <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> to molten steel.|$|E

40|$|The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget {{process was}} {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to the traditional blast furnace process by Kobe Steel. The process aimed to produce <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets, which have similar chemical and physical properties to blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> in a single step. The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget process utilizes coal instead of coke and self reducing and fluxing dried green balls instead of pellets and sinters. In this process the environmental emissions caused by coke and sinter production, and energy lost between pellet induration (heat hardening) and transportation to the blast furnace can be eliminated. The objectives of this research were to (1) produce <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets in the laboratory, (2) characterize the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget produced and compare them with blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> (3) investigate the furnace temperature and residence time effects on the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget production, and (4) optimize the operational furnace temperatures and residence times. The experiments involved heat treatment of self reducing and fluxing dried green balls at various furnace temperatures and residence times. Three chemically and physically different products were produced after the compete reduction of iron oxides to iron depending on the operational furnace temperatures and/or residence times. These products were direct reduced iron (DRI), transition direct reduced <b>iron</b> (TDRI), and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets. The increase in the carbon content of the system as a function of furnace temperature and/or residence time dictated the formation of these products. The direct reduced iron, transition direct reduced <b>iron,</b> and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets produced were analyzed for their chemical composition, degree of metallization, apparent density, microstructure and microhardness. In addition, the change in the carbon content of the system with the changing furnace temperature and/or residence time was detected by optical microscopy and Microhardness measurements. The sufficient carbon dissolution required for the production of <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets was determined. It was determined that <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets produced had a high apparent density (6. 7 - 7. 2 gr/cm 3), highly metallized, slag free structure, high iron content (95 - 97 %), high microhardness values (> 325 HVN) and microstructure similar to white cast iron.

25|$|The {{problem of}} mass-producing cheap steel was solved in 1855 by Henry Bessemer, with the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer converter at his steelworks in Sheffield, England. (An early converter can still be seen at the city's Kelham Island Museum). In the Bessemer process, <b>molten</b> <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> from the blast furnace was charged into a large crucible, and then air was blown through the molten iron from below, igniting the dissolved carbon from the coke. As the carbon burned off, the melting point of the mixture increased, but the heat from the burning carbon provided the extra energy needed to keep the mixture molten. After the carbon content in the melt had dropped to the desired level, the air draft was cut off: a typical Bessemer converter could convert a 25-ton batch of pig iron to steel in half an hour.|$|E

2500|$|The furnace {{operated}} {{twenty four}} hours a day, seven days a week, except for when it was closed for repairs. Cornwall Iron Furnace was capable of producing 24 tons of iron a week. [...] A large waterwheel powered the bellows. Carts loaded with charcoal passed to and fro between the coal barn and the furnace under a protective roof designed to keep the charcoal dry. Other wagons hauled the ore from the mine {{to the top of}} the furnace on the hillside. Workers then manually transported the charcoal and ore to the furnace. The guttermen worked at the base of the furnace. They raked the cooling sand and dug channels for the <b>molten</b> <b>pig</b> <b>iron.</b> Next, they stacked the bars of pig iron outside.

50|$|Traditionally, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was {{worked into}} wrought iron in finery forges, later {{puddling}} furnaces, {{and more recently}} into steel. In these processes, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is melted and a strong current of air is directed over it while it is stirred or agitated.

50|$|<b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> is an {{intermediate}} {{product of the}} <b>iron</b> industry. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> has a very high carbon content, typically 3.5-4.5%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle, and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> is made by smelting iron ore into a transportable ingot of impure high carbon-content iron in a blast furnace as an ingredient for further processing steps. The traditional shape of the molds used for <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> ingots was a branching structure formed in sand, with many individual ingots {{at right angles to}} a central channel or runner, resembling a litter of piglets being suckled by a sow. When the metal had cooled and hardened, the smaller ingots (the pigs) were simply broken from the runner (the sow), hence the name <b>pig</b> <b>iron.</b> As <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is intended for remelting, the uneven size of the ingots and the inclusion of small amounts of sand caused only insignificant problems considering the ease of casting and handling them.|$|R
