5|$|The <b>mouse</b> <b>cursor</b> {{helps to}} provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The cursor {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering the cursor over. For example, to move in a direction, the cursor changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the cursor changes to a hand holding a magnifying glass. By clicking and dragging the cursor, the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|E

5|$|Ultima Underworld II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that takes place}} from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player's goal is to adventure through dungeon-like indoor environments across eight parallel dimensions, while completing quests to help the inhabitants of each world. The player uses a freely movable <b>mouse</b> <b>cursor</b> {{to interact with the}} game's world and to manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. Icons on the HUD allow the player to examine objects closely, to converse with non-player characters (NPCs) and to ready the player character's weapon, among other things. During the game, the player collects items and stores them in an inventory on the HUD. Because it uses the same engine as its predecessor, Ultima Underworld II shares many of that game's features. For example, it allows the player character to jump and swim, and it contains an automap.|$|E
5|$|Ultima Underworld is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (RPG) {{that takes place}} from a first-person perspective in a three-dimensional environment. The player's goal is to adventure through a large, multi-level dungeon, in which the entire game is set. The player uses a freely movable <b>mouse</b> <b>cursor</b> {{to interact with the}} game's world, and with the icon-based interface on the heads-up display (HUD). Each icon has a specific effect; for example, the Look icon allows the player to examine objects closely, while the Fight icon causes the player character to ready his or her weapon. The player's progression through the game is non-linear: areas may be explored, and puzzles and quests finished, in any order. An automatically filling map, to which the player may add notes, records what the player has seen above a minimum level of brightness. The player character may carry light sources to extend the line of sight in varying amounts. Exploratory actions include looking up and down, jumping, and swimming.|$|E

40|$|Much of BCI {{research}} {{to date has}} focused on the direct control of computer interfaces (e. g., <b>mouse</b> <b>cursors</b> or text input systems) by sensing brain states. While using brain activity as a replacement for motor movement is an astonishing and worth-while endeavor, we believe that brain-computer interfaces used in this capacity will remain limited to a fairly small group of users with limited motor abilities. We think there is a potential to use brain sensing in a more passive context, looking beyond direct system control to make BCI useful to the general population {{in a wide range of}} scenarios. Here we present some potential applications and considerations for using brain sensing as a supplementary input in HCI contexts. What are the differences from using BCI for direct interaction? How do we deal with the noise associated with typical users’ environments and usage? How do we make BCI systems cheap enough to be used by any computer user?

VCMP will provide <b>mouse</b> <b>cursors</b> movement with voice in eight directions, which will be helpful for the people with disabilities. VCMP uses Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) for speech features extractions and features matching will be done by calculating minimum distance between the extracted features of voice and stored features in the features library. VCMP does not require the user‟s voice database; it extracts the voice features online during training and stores them into the features library. This makes VCMP speaker independent. VCMP will provide instantaneous mouse cursor‟s movement on the screen as soon as speech is recognized by the system. VCMP also provides voice commanding, where user can command the computer to open various operating systems‟ programs with voice...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} the Elastic Images, a novel pseudo-haptic feedback technique which enables {{the perception of}} the local elasticity of images without the need of any haptic device. The proposed approach focus on whether visual feedback is able to induce a sensation of stiffness when the user interacts with an image using a standard mouse. The user, when clicking on a Elastic Image, is able to deform it locally according to its elastic properties. To reinforce the effect, we also propose the generation of procedural shadows and creases to simulate the compressibility of the image and several <b>mouse</b> <b>cursors</b> replacements to enhance pressure and stiffness perception. A psychophysical experiment was conducted to quantify this novel pseudo-haptic perception and determine its perceptual threshold (or its Just Noticeable Difference). The results showed that users were able to recognize up to eight different stiffness values with our proposed method and confirmed that it provides a perceivable and exploitable sensation of elasticity. The potential applications of the proposed approach range from pressure sensing in product catalogs and games, or its usage in graphical user interfaces for increasing the expressiveness of widgets...|$|R
40|$|Human {{capabilities}} in dexterously manipulating many different tools suggest modular neural organization at functional levels, but anatomical modularity underlying the capabilities {{has yet to}} be demonstrated. Although modularity in phylogenetically older parts of the cerebellum is well known, comparable modularity in the lateral cerebellum for cognitive functions remains unknown. We investigated these issues by functional MRI (fMRI) based on our previous findings of a cerebellar internal model of a tool. After subjects intensively learned to manipulate two novel tools (the rotated <b>mouse</b> whose <b>cursor</b> appeared at a rotated position, and the velocity <b>mouse</b> whose <b>cursor</b> velocity was proportional to the mouse position), they could easily switch between the two. The lateral and posterior cerebellar activities for the two different tools were spatially segregated, and their overlaps were < 10 %, even at low statistical thresholds. Activities of the rotated mouse were more anterior and lateral than the velocity mouse activities. These results were consistent with predictions by the MOdular Selection And Identification Controller (MOSAIC) model that multiple internal models compete to partition sensory-motor experiences and their outputs are linearly combined for a particular context...|$|R

When a user held the <b>mouse</b> <b>cursor</b> over blacked-out {{parts of a}} tweet, the worm within the script would automatically open links and re-post itself on the reader's account. The exploit was then re-used to post pop-up ads and links to pornographic sites. The origin of the worm is unclear, but Pearce H. Delphin (known on Twitter as @zzap) and a Scandinavian developer, Magnus Holm, both claim to have modified a related exploit found by another user (possibly Masato Kinugawa) who was using it to create coloured Tweets. Kinugawa, a Japanese developer, reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} kinematic templates, end-user drawing {{tools that}} influence the <b>mouse</b> <b>cursor's</b> movement within specific areas of a digital canvas. Two types of kinematic templates influence the cursor's movement: passive and active templates. Passive templates modify existing movement received from a pointing device to change the cursor's speed or direction of one's stroke. Active templates add movement to the cursor without movement from the pointing device. Since templates are provided as user-specified regions, these regions {{can be associated with}} areas of detail and they can be overlapped as a means of function composition. [¶] A kinematic template can be configured to improve upon one's freehand output without producing perfect output. Since templates do not necessarily prescribe geometric output, they constitute a visual composition aid that lies between unaided freehand drawing and drawing aids such as snapping constraints and perfect geometric primitives. [¶] Since kinematic templates can improve upon the consistency of one's strokes, it is beneficial for drawing visual styles such as hatching (an artistic effect that adds depth to a drawing with uniform strokes drawn in close proximity) and repetitive patterns. Since kinematic templates do not prescribe a type of output, one can "fight against" a template's preferred path of movement and discover unexpected, serendipitous outcomes...|$|R
