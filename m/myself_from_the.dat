But, I eventually had to distance <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> emergent stream of the network because friends like Brian McLaren and Doug Pagitt began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and knowledge of the future, denial of the substitutionary atonement at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is one hell of a mistake.|$|E
500|$|.....as soon as I got out I {{climbed on}} to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E

500|$|Danny Elfman {{had great}} enthusiasm for {{returning}} because [...] "I didn't {{have to prove}} <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first film. I remember Jon Peters was very skeptical at first to hire me." [...] Elfman's work schedule was 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. [...] "When completing this movie I realized it {{was something of a}} film score and an opera. It was 95 minutes long, twice the amount of the average film score." [...] Burton allowed Elfman to be more artistic with the sequel score, such as the [...] "scraping" [...] on violins for the cat themes. Under the pressure of finishing the score, however, {{the relationship between the two}} strained, which — along with further [...] "creative differences" [...] on The Nightmare Before Christmas — led Burton to use Howard Shore to score his next film Ed Wood. The musician co-orchestrated [...] "Face to Face", which was written and performed by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The song can be heard in one scene during the film and during the end credits.|$|E
500|$|Plath's semi-autobiographical novel, {{which her}} mother wished to block, was {{published}} in 1963 and in the US in 1971. Describing the compilation of the book to her mother, she wrote, [...] "What I've done is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalising to add colour– it's a pot boiler really, but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown.... I've tried to picture my world {{and the people in}} it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar". She described her novel as [...] "an autobiographical apprentice work which I had to write in order to free <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> past". She dated a Yale senior named Dick Norton during her junior year. Norton, upon whom the character of Buddy in The Bell Jar is based, contracted tuberculosis and was treated at the Ray Brook Sanatorium near Saranac Lake. While visiting Norton, Plath broke her leg skiing, an incident that was fictionalized in the novel. Plath also used the novel to highlight the issue of women in the workforce during the 1950s. She strongly believed in their abilities to be writers and editors, while society forced them to fulfill secretarial roles.|$|E

That same day, he told other reporters, [...] "I totally support the war," [...] and Shays supported the President’s decision to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq on February 17, 2007, when he {{voted in favor of}} the surge.|$|E
2500|$|Emin openly {{discusses}} her 1998 installation My Bed for {{audiences and}} interviewers alike. She {{has been as}} saying that, [...] "By realizing how separate I was from it, I separated <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bed. I wasn't there any more." [...] This notion of a female using the domestic space and then removing herself from the environment, thus confronting stereotypes and taboos in a confessional work was a controversial event. Feminists critics have described Emin as using the historical notion of the bedroom and its importance for female experiences, as a site for crude intervention.|$|E
2500|$|William Harvey's {{experiences}} {{led him to}} an {{even more}} pessimistic view:"But what remains {{to be said about}} the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth wont and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men."In more general terms, Robert K. Merton remarks that [...] "the history of science abounds in instances of basic papers having been written by comparatively unknown scientists, only to be rejected or neglected for years." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, it was {{announced}} that the single would be re-released on 28 May 2012, coinciding with the 35th anniversary of the original release and the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Lydon has voiced his disapproval over the re-release and the campaign, saying in a statement: [...] "I would like to very strongly distance <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> recent stories and campaign to push 'God Save The Queen' for the number one spot. This campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. It is certainly not my personal plan or aim. I am proud of what The Sex Pistols achieved and always will be but this campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. This is not my campaign. I am pleased that the Sex Pistols recordings are being put out there for a new generation, however, I wish for no part in the circus that is being built up around it." [...] The 2012 re-release peaked at no. 80 in the singles chart.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Gellately in The Gestapo and German Society. Enforcing Racial Policy 1933–1945 {{writes about}} such cases of German women being {{found guilty of}} sexual {{relations}} with prisoners of war and foreigner workers. One case in March 1941 was of a married woman who {{had an affair with}} a French prisoner of war had her head shaved and was marched through the town of Bramberg in Lower Franconia carrying a sign which said, [...] "I have sullied the honour of the German woman." [...] Another case was Dora von Calbitz who in September 1940 was found guilty of having sexual relations with a Pole. She had her head shaved and was placed in the pillory of her town of Oschatz near Leipzig, with a sign that proclaimed, [...] "I have been a dishonourable German woman in that I sought and had relations with Poles.

2500|$|Former IRA member (and Irish Government {{intelligence}} agent) Sean O'Callaghan {{claimed he}} was at an IRA Revolutionary Council meeting in 1983 which was also attended by Adams. O'Callaghan gave his account in testimony to the High Court in Dublin. Former IRA members Anthony McIntyre and Richard O'Rawe have claimed Adams was {{a key figure in}} the IRA. Adams said: [...] "I'm very, very clear about my denial of IRA membership but I don't disassociate <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> IRA." [...] Former IRA member Peter Rogers has alleged that Adams and Martin McGuinness ordered Rogers to transport explosives to Great Britain in 1980, allegations Sinn Féin said were untrue. (Rogers was jailed for the 1980 killing of Detective Garda Seamus Quaid in the Republic of Ireland, and was later released {{under the terms of the}} Good Friday Agreement.) Father Gerry Reynolds, who facilitated secret meetings between SDLP leader John Hume and Adams, has said that asking Adams about his IRA membership is a [...] "stupid question" [...] as the IRA was a secret society and the [...] " [...] of the secret society is that it is secret". Adams described Father Reynolds as a [...] "champion of the peace process" [...] upon his death.|$|E

2500|$|I was {{absolutely}} gobsmacked. I said, “This is horrible. Horrible!” And it’s a very slow, sinking feeling when you’re watching the movie, {{and the first}} scene comes out, and you’re like, “Oh, that’s a really bad scene.” But you say, “Well, that’s okay, the next one’ll be better.” And you somehow try to convince yourself that it’s going to get better… and it just gets worse. And I was like, “Wow. That was crazy.” I mean, I really didn’t see that coming. So at that point, I distanced <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> movie. Now, of course, it has a whole other life {{as a sort of}} inadvertent… satire. No, “satire” isn’t the right word. But it’s inadvertently funny. So it’s found its place. It provides entertainment, though not in the way I think it was originally intended. It was just… maybe the wrong material with the wrong director and the wrong cast.Showgirls was universally derided by film critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 19% based on 48 reviews with the consensus; [...] "Vile, contemptible, garish, and misogynistic -- and that might just be exactly Showgirls' point." [...] Metacritic give the film an average score of 16/100, indicating [...] "Overwhelming dislike. Roger Ebert, following a relatively mild negative review (2 stars out of 4), wrote that Showgirls received [...] "some bad reviews, but it wasn't completely terrible". The film remains heralded as one of cinema's worst.|$|E
2500|$|Zina {{recorded}} in her autobiography {{that when she}} was eighteen she was courted by Henry Bailey Jacobs. During this time, Joseph Smith, also taught her about plural marriage in private conversations; he proposed that she become his spiritual wife on at least three different occasions. Zina declined the proposals out of her respect for Emma Smith and for traditional Christian monogamy, and because such a union would require secrecy. On March 7, 1841, she married Jacobs, believing she had thus avoided future proposals from Smith. Nauvoo mayor John C. Bennett conducted the ceremony. Her journal from the day of the wedding reads: I was Married to Mr. Henry Bailey Jacobs. He had been a missionary preaching the Gospel for some time. His Father Henry Jacobs {{was one of the first}} elders in the Church, faithful and true until the last.Zina become pregnant shortly after her marriage. However, she continued to feel concern that she had rejected God by rejecting Joseph, whom she considered a prophet and God's spokesperson. Later she recorded, [...] "I received a testimony for <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lord of this work, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God before I ever saw him, while I resided in the state of New York, given in answer to prayer. I knew him in his lifetime, and know him to have been a great true man and a servant of God." [...] Smith wrote to her in October 1841 that he had [...] "put it off till an angel with a drawn sword stood by me and told me if I did not establish that principle [...] upon the earth I would lose my position and my life." [...] She and Smith were married on October 27, 1841. [...] Her brother Dimick performed the ceremony. [...] By that time, Joseph was married to five other women, besides his first wife Emma: Fanny Alger, Louisa Beaman, Lucinda Pendleton Morgan, Nancy Marinda Johnson Hyde, and Clarissa Reed Hancock.|$|E
