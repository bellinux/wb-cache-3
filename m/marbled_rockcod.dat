5|$|The diet of the {{macaroni}} penguin {{consists of}} a variety of crustaceans, squid and fish, although the proportions that each makes up vary with locality and season. Krill, particularly Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), account for over 90% of food during breeding season. Cephalopods and small fish such as the <b>marbled</b> <b>rockcod</b> (Notothenia rossii), painted notie (Lepidonotothen larseni), Champsocephalus gunneri, the lanternfish species Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum tenisoni and P. normani become more important during chick-rearing. Like several other penguin species, the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small (10– to 30-mm-diameter) stones; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep-sea diving, or to help grind food, especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans which are a significant part of its diet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>rockcod</b> (Notothenia rossii) is {{a species}} of cod icefish native to the Southern Ocean {{where it can be}} found at depths of from 5 to 350 m. This species can reach a length of 92 cm TL though most are only around 50 cm. The {{greatest}} recorded weight for this species is 10 kg. This is a commercially important species.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe use of low-polarity organic {{solvents}} {{is widespread}} in cleanup/extraction processes {{in order to}} carry compounds of interest, remove interferences and separate phases, among other uses. A large {{number of studies have}} used delipidation to remove excess of lipids to analyse carbon stable isotopes in biological tissues for trophic and behavioural ecology investigations. In this context, the primary aim {{of this study is to}} assess the influence of one delipidation process on the results of total mercury (Hg) analyses and the possible use of delipidated samples from previous analyses, such as for stable isotopes, in Hg level determination. Samples of vegetation (angiosperm, lichens and mosses), invertebrates (krill and limpets), fish (<b>marbled</b> and black <b>rockcod),</b> bird liver and eggs (Antarctic, Gentoo and Adélie penguins, kelp gull, Antarctic tern, cape petrel and giant southern petrel) and pinniped tissues (Weddell seal, crabeater seal, southern elephant seal and Antarctic fur seal) were analysed for Hg before and after delipidation by cyclohexane. The difference between the two measurements ranged individually from − 63 to 136 % (in the moss Sanionia uncinata) and the averages ranged from − 60 to 66 % (in pinniped tissues). The proportion of organic Hg, which presents considerable lipophilicity, but also high affinity for sulfhydryl groups in proteins, might be responsible for such variability. Given the limitations of our study, we think it is safe to say that delipidated samples could not be used to infer total Hg values in non-delipidated ones...|$|R
40|$|Waters around South Georgia are {{amongst the}} most {{productive}} in the Southern Ocean, and support internationally important fisheries. However, there is significant inter-annual variability in fish stocks, and some species have failed to recover from historical overfishing. Dispersal and retention of the planktonic eggs and larvae of marine fish can {{play a key role}} in the maintenance of adult stocks. We use a numerical modelling approach to examine the influence of oceanographic and life-history variability on the dispersal and retention of 2 Antarctic fishes: Champsocephalus gunnari (mackerel icefish) and Notothenia rossii (<b>marbled</b> <b>rockcod).</b> Mean retention of N. rossii larvae was predicted to be 5. 3 %, considerably lower than that of C. gunnari (31. 3 %), a difference related to the longer planktonic period of the former. Such apparent loss of larvae from local recruitment grounds may contribute to the failure of the N. rossii population to recover from its collapse in the 1970 s. However, retention of both species showed high inter-annual variability. Dispersal and retention of C. gunnari were strongly influenced by location of the spawning site, with the greatest contribution to overall retention from spawning sites on the southwest South Georgia shelf. In addition, a consistent feature in C. gunnari was a lack of larval exchange between the proximate South Georgia and Shag Rocks shelves, regions separated by only 240 km. Our findings provide insights into the demographic dynamics and connectivity of C. gunnari and N. rossii populations at South Georgia in relation to prospects for recovery and ongoing responses to environmental variability and change in the region...|$|E
40|$|International audience‘POKER 2006 ', {{a bottom}} trawl fish biomass survey, was {{conducted}} from September to October 2006 {{in the northern}} part of the Kerguelen Plateau (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58. 5. 1). The swept-area method was used in the depth range from 100 to 1 000 m with 207 random stratified stations. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains incomplete as four of the species (D. eleginoides, bigeye grenadier (Macrourus carinatus), Eaton's skate (Bathyraja eatonii) and Kerguelen sandpaper skate (B. irrasa)) extend deeper than 1 000 m, the limit of the POKER 2006 survey. Some shelf and slope species (mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and <b>marbled</b> <b>rockcod</b> (Notothenia rossii)) exhibit low levels of biomass when compared to the results of previous surveys (SKALP surveys, 1987 and 1988). Other species (unicorn icefish (Channichthys rhinoceratus) and grey rockcod (Lepidonotothen squamifrons)) seem to have increased, even doubled, their biomass during the period between the two surveys. In addition to the commercial species, Zanclorhynchus spinifer was abundant on the shelf and Alepocephalus cf. antipodianus was abundant in the deep sea; the data on the latter are new. Data on the geographic and bathymetric distribution of the species provide evidence of geographically very stable species-specific concentrations. Distinct cohorts of some species (D. eleginoides and C. gunnari) were detected in some sectors. The survey has defined the distribution of species, commercial or not, that are important in the ecosystem and are of major interest for the management and conservation of fish populations in the are...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic {{fish species}} possess very low {{metabolic}} rates and poor metabolic plasticity, thus making them extremely vulnerable to changing environmental conditions. Mitochondria {{are a key}} element in shaping whole organism energy turnover and functional capacities. In our study, we compared two nototheniid fish, the Austral black cod (Notothenia angustata, New Zealand) and the Antarctic <b>marbled</b> <b>rockcod</b> (Notothenia rossii, Antarctic Peninsula) for their abilities of metabolic compensation for rising temperature and PCO 2 at the intracellular level. We acclimated N. angustata to control conditions (PCO 2 of 0. 04 kPa) and to an ambient PCO 2 of 0. 2 kPa for 11 days, and kept N. rossii at a PCO 2 of 0. 04 kPa. We assessed permeabilized heart fibre oxygen consumption at various respiratory states (e. g. state III ￼￼complex I/ II, state IV (leak), uncoupled/ ETS capacity, complex IV) in acutely hypercapnic (PCO 2 of 2 kPa, corresponds to intracellular PCO 2 under 0. 2 kPa ambient hypercapnia) vs. normocapnic (PCO 2 of 0. 04 kPa) respiration media. In all respiratory states, acute exposure to the hypercapnic respiration medium resulted in reduced mitochondrial capacities, in the Austral and the Antarctic notothenioids Yet, overall heart fibre respiration was higher in the hypercapnia acclimated N. angustata than in their control group. This suggests that chronic acclimation of the fish to moderately elevated PCO 2 levels might enhance mitochondrial aerobic capacities, involving e. g. changes in enzyme capacities or mitochondrial proliferation. Our data indicate that while acute high PCO 2 levels of 2 kPa reduce mitochondrial oxidative capacities in Austral and Antarctic notothenioids, at least the Austral fish {{seem to be able to}} compensate for these acutely reduced metabolic capacities by hypercapnia acclimation. ...|$|E
