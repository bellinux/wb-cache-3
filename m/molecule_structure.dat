5000|$|In-Plane Switching (IPS): Unlike the {{electrode}} arrangement in traditional TN displays, the two electrodes corresponding to a pixel are {{both on the}} same glass plate and are parallel to each other. The liquid crystal molecules do not form a helical structure and instead are also parallel to each other. In its natural or [...] "off" [...] state, the <b>molecule</b> <b>structure</b> is arranged parallel to the glass plates and electrodes. Because the twisted <b>molecule</b> <b>structure</b> is not used in an IPS display, the angle at which light leaves a pixel is not as restricted, and therefore viewing angles and color reproduction are much improved compared to those of TN displays. However, IPS displays have slower response times. IPS displays also initially suffered from poor contrast ratios but has been significantly improved {{with the development of}} Advanced Super IPS (AS - IPS).|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} the {{benchmark}} for transfection agents has been cationic lipids. Limitations of these competing reagents {{have been reported to}} include: the lack of ability to transfect some cell types, the lack of robust active targeting capabilities, incompatibility with animal models, and toxicity. Dendrimers offer robust covalent construction and extreme control over <b>molecule</b> <b>structure,</b> and therefore size. Together these give compelling advantages compared to existing approaches.|$|E
50|$|All {{properties}} of <b>molecules</b> beyond their <b>structure</b> can be split up into either physico-chemical or pharmacological attributes also called descriptors. On top of that, there exist various artificial and {{more or less}} standardized naming systems for molecules that supply more or less ambiguous names and synonyms. The IUPAC name is usually {{a good choice for}} representing a <b>molecule's</b> <b>structure</b> in a both human-readable and unique string although it becomes unwieldy for larger molecules. Trivial names on the other hand abound with homonyms and synonyms and are therefore a bad choice as a defining database key. While physico-chemical descriptors like molecular weight, (partial) charge, solubility, etc. can mostly be computed directly based on the <b>molecule's</b> <b>structure,</b> pharmacological descriptors can be derived only indirectly using involved multivariate statistics or experimental (screening, bioassay) results. All of those descriptors can for reasons of computational effort be stored along with the molecule's representation and usually are.|$|R

5000|$|The {{higher the}} {{molecule}} weight, {{the stronger the}} winding effect between molecules. As the molecule network becomes larger, a gamma PGA elastic film will form {{on the surface of}} skin. Due to its unique <b>molecule</b> <b>structure,</b> gamma PGA (HM) can absorb and retain skin moisture efficiently and form a silky film on the surface of skin. It can effectively prevent the skin from long-time drying condition, especially in air-conditioned rooms or in cold dry winter. Gamma PGA enhances skin smoothness, reduces wrinkles and improves elasticity of skin.|$|E
50|$|Ethyl carfluzepate {{is mainly}} a {{hypnotic}} drug {{which is a}} benzodiazepine derivative and induces sleep in a strong manner. It is similar to ethyl loflazepate in chemical structure, the other difference being an absence of methylcarbamoyl group. Its also similar in metabolism to this substance, only the methyl-carboxylate group would {{be the difference between}} the main metabolites. Two of the main metabolites must be the 3-hydroxylate or the substance with only a hydrogen atom at the 3-position of the <b>molecule</b> <b>structure.</b> In order to that the resulting main metabolite could probably be ethyl-7-cloro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methylcarbamate)-2-oxo-3H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-hydroxylate (and the 3-OH instead of the 3H metabolite). Its properties are mainly sedative and hypnotic.|$|E
50|$|In the {{hexagonal}} or cubic ice phase {{the oxygen}} ions form a tetrahedral structure with an O-O bond length 2.76 Å (276 pm), while the O-H bond length measures only 0.96 Å (96 pm). Every oxygen (white) ion {{is surrounded by}} four hydrogen ions (black) and each hydrogen ion is surrounded by 2 oxygen ions, as shown in Figure 5. Maintaining the internal H2O <b>molecule</b> <b>structure,</b> the minimum energy position of a proton is not half-way between two adjacent oxygen ions. There are two equivalent positions a hydrogen may occupy on {{the line of the}} O-O bond, a far and a near position. Thus a rule leads to the frustration of positions of the proton for a ground state configuration: for each oxygen two of the neighboring protons must reside in the far position and two of them in the near position, so-called ‘ice rules’. Pauling proposed that the open tetrahedral structure of ice affords many equivalent states satisfying the ice rules.|$|E

5000|$|In {{chemical}} biology and biomolecular engineering, rational design is {{the strategy of}} creating new molecules with a certain functionality, based upon the ability to predict how the <b>molecule's</b> <b>structure</b> will affect its behavior through physical models.

50|$|When {{the liquid}} crystal {{material}} {{is in its}} natural state, light passing through the first filter will be rotated (in terms of polarity) by the twisted <b>molecule</b> <b>structure,</b> which allows the light {{to pass through the}} second filter. When voltage is applied across the electrodes, the liquid crystal structure is untwisted to an extent determined by the amount of voltage. A sufficiently large voltage will cause the molecules to untwist completely, such that the polarity of any light passing through will not be rotated and will instead be perpendicular to the filter polarity. This filter will block the passage of light because of the difference in polarity orientation, and the resulting pixel will be black. The amount of light allowed to pass through at each pixel can be controlled by varying the corresponding voltage accordingly. In a color LCD each pixel consists of red, green, and blue subpixels, which require appropriate color filters in addition to the components mentioned previously. Each subpixel can be controlled individually to display a large range of possible colors for a particular pixel.|$|E
50|$|Dimethyl sulfate, {{known as}} DMS, is a {{chemical}} {{that can be}} used to modify nucleic acids in order to determine secondary structure. DMS modifies certain bases through methylation. One set of methylation products that is used for RNA is the methylation of N1 adenosine and N3 of cytosine which prevents the natural hydrogen bonds to form between bases modified by DMS. This enables modification sites to be detected by RT-PCR, as modified sites cannot be basepaired, which results in the reverse transcriptase to fall off and produce different band sizes. DMS may modify adenines and cytosines that are single stranded, base paired at the end of a helix, or in a base pair next to a GU pair. Detection of these modifications is done by examination of a gel and looking at bands present. One thing of note is that since modification prevents the addition of nucleotides at the modification site each of the bands generated is shifted by one base down on the gel. Nucleotides may be protected from DMS modification by base pairing, tertiary contacts, or protein-RNA interactions. This can be used to begin to develop a model of secondary structure for the RNA <b>molecule.</b> <b>Structure</b> probing by DMS allows for detection of secondary structure changes due to binding of RNA molecules along with detecting changes in tertiary structure.|$|E
50|$|In-silico (see: water models), cyclic water {{clusters}} (H2O)n {{are found}} with n = 3 to 60. Structures of water molecules {{with the highest}} resolution have been demonstrated in the studies of Richard Saykally of Berkeley College of Chemistry. With increasing cluster size the oxygen to oxygen distance is found to decrease which is attributed to so-called cooperative many-body interactions: due {{to a change in}} charge distribution the H-acceptor molecule becomes a better H-donor molecule with each expansion of the water assembly. Many isomeric forms seem to exist for the hexamer: from ring, book, bag, cage, to prism shape with nearly identical energy. Two cage-like isomers exist for heptamers, and octamers are found either cyclic or {{in the shape of a}} cube. Even larger clusters are predicted: the fullerene-like cluster (H2O)28 is called the water buckyball and even for a 280 water molecule monster icosahedral network (with each water molecule coordinate to 4 others) there is found a local energy minimum. The 280 molecule icosahedral structure, which is 3 nm in diameter, consists of icosahedral shells with 280, 100 and 20 molecules (the 100 <b>molecule</b> <b>structure</b> is shown the figure above). There is increased stability with the addition of each shell. A look at the recent scientific literature may reveal good reviews on the studies of water clusters employing ab initio methods. These clusters are also important for studying hydration phenomena at molecular level since they form the basic building blocks of the hydrated clusters. There are theoretical models of water clusters of more than 700 water molecules by Martin Chaplin and Stanislav Zenin. They have not been proven experimentally.|$|E

40|$|Here, {{we present}} the {{algorithm}} and validation for OMEGA, a systematic, knowledge-based conformer generator. The algorithm {{consists of three}} phases: assembly of an initial 3 D structure from a library of fragments; exhaustive enumeration of all rotatable torsions using values drawn from a knowledge-based list of angles, thereby generating a large set of conformations; and sampling of this set by geometric and energy criteria. Validation of conformer generators like OMEGA has often been undertaken by comparing computed conformer sets to experimental molecular conformations from crystallography, usually from the Protein Databank (PDB). Such an approach is fraught with difficulty due to the systematic problems with small <b>molecule</b> <b>structures</b> in the PDB. Methods are presented to identify a diverse set of small <b>molecule</b> <b>structures</b> from cocomplexes in the PDB that has maximal reliability.
