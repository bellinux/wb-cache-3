60|$|I turned {{round in}} <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> {{regarded}} Mabane reproachfully.|$|E
60|$|I {{sprang from}} <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> limped impatiently {{about the room}} with {{considerable}} bitterness in my heart.|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped in}} front of <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> stood looking down at me with an {{expression}} in which I read a contemptuous amazement.|$|E
60|$|I {{rose from}} <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> at once, <b>and</b> he {{followed}} my example, without haste, a little heavily.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} forgotten, then," [...] she said softly. [...] "Come {{and sit in}} <b>my</b> {{favourite}} <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> rest for a few moments. I am sure that you must be tired." ...|$|R
60|$|I was in {{a dilemma}} from which {{there seemed to be}} no escape. Lady Angela had seated herself in <b>my</b> easy <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> was keeping her face averted from me. The Duke stood between us.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I'll lay a {{thousand}} it was!' I shouted, rising in <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> <b>And</b> the company stared, and Lady Pembroke vowed I had gone mad.|$|E
60|$|After {{this last}} {{specimen}} of my host's taste in curiosities, I pursued my investigation no further. I returned to <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> {{waited for the}} truffles.|$|E
60|$|He gave {{a sigh of}} relief, {{sank into}} <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> closed his eyes. I {{regarded}} him with pity. The poor old boy looked a wreck.|$|E
60|$|Cynthia {{was back}} from the hospital, <b>and</b> I placed <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> beside her, <b>and</b> told her of Poirot's wish to visit the dispensary.|$|R
60|$|I felt {{extremely}} sick at heart. “And so I am to drop {{everything and}} vanish,” I said, rising from <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> again. <b>And</b> this time Mrs. Blunt got up, too, with a lofty and inflexible manner but she didn’t dismiss me yet.|$|R
60|$|I {{leaned back}} in <b>my</b> non-rotary {{revolving}} <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> nodded gently, like a mandarin, at my paste-pot.|$|R
60|$|Which was I, a good Christian? or a contemptible fool? I {{went back}} {{once more to}} <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> {{determined}} {{to give him a}} last chance.|$|E
6000|$|I {{lay back}} in <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> stared at him. Was this, then, another suitor of Yvonne de Canaples, and were all men mad with love of her? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will be {{as young}} then as you are, but now I am still old and tired, and you must help me to <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> to my books.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I loll in <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> [...] <b>And</b> {{around me}} I stare [...] With a {{critical}} air, [...] Like a calf at a fair; [...] And, say I, Mrs. Duty, [...] Good-morrow to your beauty, [...] I kiss your sweet shoe-tie, [...] And hope I can suit ye." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could see}} that the poor girl was near crying, <b>and</b> I resumed <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> without {{speaking}} <b>and</b> looked at her (I hope) as mildly as I felt towards her.|$|R
60|$|I {{returned}} to <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> to think, <b>and</b> {{at last he}} fell asleep with {{his face to the}} wall, but even then I stood many times at the door, listening.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the hour}} {{at which we}} usually stopped work I arose from <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> stated {{that that would be}} all for the day. My {{secretary}} looked at me quickly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, turning uneasily in <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> at last {{hitting on}} a bright {{masculine}} expedient, [...] "I'll tell you what must be done. She must get married." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{my heart}} beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I {{rose out of}} <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking wildly at him.|$|E
6000|$|I ran home, {{clutching}} the ten delicious, crisp hundred pounds, and the dear little fifty which {{made up the}} account. I flew through the streets again. I got to my chambers. I bolted the outer doors. I sank back in <b>my</b> great <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> slept. [...] .|$|R
60|$|My {{mother did}} not {{understand}} my games, but my father did. He wore bright-coloured socks and carpet slippers when he was indoors--my mother disliked boots in the house--and he would sit down on <b>my</b> little <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> survey the microcosm {{on the floor with}} admirable understanding and sympathy.|$|R
60|$|He entered without knocking, and I saw at {{once that}} he was in a strange condition. He {{scarcely}} greeted me, but sank into <b>my</b> easy <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> drawing out his pipe began to fill it. Then I saw, too, what I had never seen before. His fingers were shaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most preposterous!" [...] I exclaimed, {{and then}} {{suddenly}} realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> stared at him in blank amazement.|$|E
60|$|I {{rose from}} <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> he from his. Then {{with a little}} {{confidential}} chuckle of laughter, he patted me {{two or three times}} on the chest, finally pushing me back into my chair.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned in}} <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> one {{glance at the}} gentle, comely face and the fair hair {{of the young man}} {{standing}} beside Castelroux was enough to bring me of a sudden to my feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "At present," [...] he announced, [...] "I {{am going}} to reflect. Meekins, <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> to the north window--so. I {{am going to}} sit here," [...] he went on, [...] "and I am going to look across the sea and reflect. A very {{fortunate}} storm, after all, I think, which kept Mr. John P. Dunster from the Harwich boat last night. Leave me, Gerald, for a time. Stand behind <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> Meekins, <b>and</b> see that no one enters." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Quinion lay at {{our house}} that night. After breakfast, the next morning, I had put <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> away, <b>and</b> was going out of the room, when Mr. Murdstone called me back. He then gravely {{repaired}} to another table, where his sister sat herself at her desk. Mr. Quinion, {{with his hands in}} his pockets, stood looking out of window; and I stood looking at them all.|$|R
5000|$|After snow, sunny day! Plum {{blossoms}} scent the airRide my donkey {{past the}} bridge, his bell sounds ding dong.Sounds ding dong! Sounds ding dong! Sounds ding dong! Sounds ding dong!Such lovely flowers beside <b>my</b> <b>chair!</b> I read <b>and</b> play music, such a happy time! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} {{exceedingly}} fine dog of yours, Snarleyow. Snarleyow, where are you? Excuse me for taking precautions, but {{last time he}} put his head under <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> bit me severely, as I dare say you remember." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody {{inside there}} talking secrets," [...] {{observed}} the younger lady. [...] "I {{think it is}} Mr. Shackleby, and I don't like that man. Charley, set down that tray and carry <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> Mrs. Leslie's {{at least a dozen}} yards away." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{need to tell}} me that! I {{had never}} seen one of that kind in all my life, but I {{knew what they were}} and for what purpose they had come. I grasped the elbows of <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> neither spoke nor moved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why then, Flashy," [...] {{continued}} the poor victim, unconsciously warming with his theme: [...] "why then, I'd draw <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> up <b>and</b> call for Betty, the gal wot tends to customers. Betty, my dear, says I, you looks charmin' this mornin'; {{give me a}} nice rasher of bacon and h'eggs, Betty my love; and I wants a pint of h'ale, and three nice h'ot muffins and butter--and a slice of Cheshire; and Betty, I wants--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dropped into}} that Home Restaurant next door this evening," [...] said he. [...] "I don't care who knows it; I like {{a dish of}} some kind of greens {{at this time of the}} year. I ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare looking for {{something}} in that line. When I got below cabbage I turned <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> over <b>and</b> hollered for the proprietor. He told me where you lived." ...|$|R
40|$|Edward Vela. Ph. D., Chair Peter Lopez. Ph. D. iii DEDICATION I {{would like}} to thank Dr. Edward Vela for serving as <b>my</b> thesis <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> Dr. Peter Lopez for serving on the thesis committee.
