5|$|For {{the rest}} of his life, Marmarosa alternated between living with his sister Doris' family and in a veterans' hospital, both in the Pittsburgh area. Some of his friends blamed Marmarosa's family for keeping him in their home because of shame about his <b>mental</b> <b>problems,</b> and {{suggested}} that the family blamed musicians and music for his instability. Marmarosa himself did not explain his withdrawal from performing. Irritated by telephone calls from a fan seeking an interview in 1992, Marmarosa passed on the news that he had died; this led to premature obituaries being published in two British newspapers. He sometimes played piano in the family's basement or for other residents at the hospital. His mother died in 1995, after his father. Marmarosa {{died of a heart attack}} on September 17, 2002, in a veterans' hospital in Pittsburgh. He was survived by his two sisters.|$|E

It remains unclear whether mothers with multiple <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> compared to mothers with fewer or no problems {{are more likely to have}} daughters with multiple <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> during middle childhood (ages 7 to 11). Six waves of maternal and child data from the Pittsburgh Girls Study (n[*]=[*] 2, 451) were used to examine the specificity of effects of maternal psychopathology on child adjustment. Child multiple <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> comprised disruptive behavior, ADHD symptoms, depressed mood, anxiety symptoms and somatic complaints, while maternal multiple <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> consisted of depression, prior conduct problems and somatic complaints. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) was used to examine the prospective relationships between mother’s single and multiple <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> and their daughter’s single and multiple <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> across the elementary school-aged period (ages 7 – 11  years). The results show that multiple <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> in the mothers predicted multiple <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> in the daughters even when earlier <b>mental</b> health <b>problem</b> of the daughters, demographic factors, and childrearing practices were controlled.

This study measures the prevalence and nature of harassment experienced by individuals with <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> and compares them with the general population. Methods : Face to face interviews were conducted by trained interviewers to ascertain experiences of harassment. Interviews were carried out with 112 individuals with <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> and with 104 individuals from the general population. Results: Sixty-one per cent of people with <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> reported experiencing harassment, nearly ten times more frequently {{than those in the}} general population (7 %). Among the people with <b>mental</b> health <b>problems,</b> being female, having higher levels of education, or being unemployed were significantly associated with experiencing harassment. The harassment commonly involved verbal abuse, often made reference to individuals' <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> and was primarily committed by family members. Conclusions: A significantly higher prevalence of harassment was reported among individuals with <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> living in the community than in the general population sample. Mental health professionals should proactively ask their service users about their experiences at home, and educational interventions are recommended, particularly for families of those with <b>mental</b> health <b>problems...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study tested whether {{childhood}} family instability {{is associated}} with <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> during adolescence through continued family instability and/or through a preadolescent onset of <b>mental</b> health <b>problems.</b> This test use data from a prospective population cohort of 2, 230 Dutch adolescents (M age = 11. 09, SD = 0. 56 at the initial assessment). Childhood family instability was associated with both internalizing problems and externalizing problems during late adolescence. The association between childhood family instability and adolescent <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> largely disappeared when controlling for preadolescent onset of <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> but only slightly when controlling for continued family instability during adolescence. These patterns were comparable for both types of <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> but relatively stronger for internalizing problems.

40|$|The {{relation}} between maternal depressive symptoms and children’s <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> {{has been well}} established. However, prior studies have predominantly focused on maternal reports of children’s <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> and on parenting behavior, as a broad and unilateral concept. This cross-sectional study examined specific observed mother–child interaction behaviors through which maternal depressive symptoms are assumed to affect children’s <b>mental</b> health <b>problems.</b> We expected higher rates of maternal depressive symptoms to predict higher rates of children’s <b>mental</b> health <b>problems,</b> and we expected this relation to be mediated by low maternal warmth and high maternal psychological control. The sample consisted of 111 mother–child dyads referred for treatment. The mother–child interaction behaviors were coded according to the observed mother–child interaction tasks. Children’s <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> were assessed using both maternal reports and children’s self-reports. As expected, {{the results showed that}} maternal depressive symptoms were strongly related to maternal reports of children’s internalizing and externalizing <b>mental</b> health <b>problems.</b> Surprisingly, maternal depressive symptoms were unrelated to children’s self-reported depressive symptoms. Furthermore, mother–child interactions did not mediate the {{relation between}} maternal depressive symptoms and child <b>mental</b> health <b>problems.</b> Maternal depressive symptoms were associated with high maternal warmth, and high psychological control was associated with high levels of mother-reported externalizing <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> in children. These results partially replicate previous findings but add to these by using observational methods and multi-informant data. The importance of using a multi-informant and multi-method approach in assessing children’s <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> in clinical practice and research are discussed...|$|R

About one-third were unable to resume their customary work, mainly due to persistent <b>mental</b> <b>problems.</b> In their 1986 study of 26 patients (10 years after successful treatment of hyperthyroidism), Perrild et al. note that four patients had been granted disability pensions on the basis of intellectual dysfunction.

40|$|Objective: In {{the current}} study the {{interaction}} between ethnicity, cannabis use and <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> was examined. Expected was that participants immigrants would report more <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> than their Dutch native peers. Secondly, {{it was expected that}} participants who use or have been using cannabis report more <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> than participants who never used cannabis. Furthermore, we expect that immigrants who use or have been using cannabis experience more <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> than native participants who use or have been using cannabis and immigrants who have never used cannabis. Methods: Participants were 11, 100 Dutch secondary school children aged 10 to 25 years, who all filled out a questionnaire containing the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). This questionnaire assesses psychosocial adjustment of children and adolescents. Ethnicity was determined by country of birth. Cannabis use was divided into three categories, ‘never used cannabis’, ‘used cannabis once in their live’ and ‘used cannabis in the four weeks prior to the study’. Total SDQ score was used as a measure for experiencing <b>mental</b> health <b>problems.</b> Results: As expected, both cannabis use and ethnicity were associated with <b>mental</b> health <b>problems.</b> However, an interaction between cannabis use and ethnicity on <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> was not found. After controlling for social economic status, severe life events, use of hard drugs and alcohol and smoking, ethnicity was no longer associated with <b>mental</b> health <b>problems.</b> The influence of cannabis use remained. Again, no interaction was found. Conclusion: Immigrants status is not an independent risk factor for development of <b>mental</b> health <b>problems.</b> The association for ethnicity with <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> is mediated by severe life events...|$|R
40|$|Justice-involved {{youths are}} more likely to have <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> than peers in the community.

The present study examined the association between childhood trauma and <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> in juvenile justice-involved adolescent males (N = 422), comparing childhood-onset with adolescent-onset offenders. Childhood-onset offenders were more likely than adolescent-onset offenders to report mental health and substance use problems, as well as childhood maltreatment. Via structural equation modeling, we found that childhood trauma predicted <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> in both offender groups. Multigroup analysis revealed a moderation effect of offender group: The association between trauma and <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> was stronger in adolescent-onset offenders than in childhood-onset offenders. Thus, <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> were more prevalent in childhood-onset offenders, but these problems were less well-explained by childhood trauma in childhood-onset than in adolescent-onset offenders.

Data on childhood maltreatment, <b>mental</b> health <b>problems,</b> and aggression were collected by means of self-report measures and structural equation models were used to test mediation models. We found that <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> mediated the link between maltreatment and aggression. Results demonstrated different pathways {{depending on the type}} of aggression examined. The association between childhood maltreatment and reactive aggression was fully mediated by a variety of <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> and for proactive aggression the association was partially mediated by <b>mental</b> health <b>problems.</b> We also found that reactive and proactive aggression partially mediated the association between maltreatment and <b>mental</b> health <b>problems.</b> These findings suggest that a transactional model may best explain the negative effects of childhood trauma on <b>mental</b> health <b>problems</b> and (in particular reactive) aggression. In addition, our findings add to the existing evidence that reactive and proactive aggression have different etiological pathways...|$|R

25|$|Credit for {{the first}} {{psychology}} clinic in the United States typically goes to Lightner Witmer, who established his practice in Philadelphia in 1896. Another modern psychotherapist was Morton Prince. For the most part, {{in the first part}} of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by specialized medical doctors called psychiatrists. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve diagnosis of <b>mental</b> <b>problems.</b> For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy to understand and treat the mentally ill. In this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. The therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and to understand why the patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. An important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is transference, in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.|$|E
