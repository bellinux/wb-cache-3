500|$|There {{could have}} been other women and there {{could have been}} {{children}} on the boat. And we don't do that sort of target, so ... it went. And it was in fact the very man we'd been looking for for three months: Colonel Moerdani of the Indonesian paracommando unit, and he was on the end of <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> and I let him go– but ... you can't blat women and kids.|$|E
2500|$|... "I was a {{young boy}} in the school house when the cry came, Injuns! I jumped to <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> and threw down my {{spelling}} book, and thar it lies." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "For {{the rest}} of the night I was batting hand grenades away with my entrenching tool while firing <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> at them. I must have whacked a dozen grenades that night with my tool. And you know what? I was the world’s worst {{baseball}} player ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lew, <b>my</b> <b>rifle's</b> no good fer that distance. But mebbe yours is. You {{ought to}} know. It's not sense, because there's Simon Girty, and there's Jim, the men we're after. If {{you can hit}} one, you can another. But go ahead, Lew. Plug that cowardly redskin!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{manufacturing}} tolerances are very good, with all parts being interchangeable. (I have been hunting taking the [...]243 and the [...]30-06 {{only to find}} that I had left one of the bolts at home.... I must stress, I have had the head spacing checked on all <b>my</b> <b>rifles</b> - with all bolts - and they are all well within acceptable limits.) ...|$|R
60|$|When {{brought down}} with <b>my</b> {{electric}} <b>rifle</b> and properly roasted, the pterodactyl proved very good eating, particularly the pads of the toes.|$|R
2500|$|As {{darkness}} fell a British infantry {{unit was}} alerted by a {{shot from the}} company's listening post to an enemy attack; [...] "every rifle and machine gun burst out {{as hard as they}} could go all along the line supported by dozens of machine guns tucked away on advantageous slopes behind us, and I pitied 'Jacko' out in that storm, as I banged away with my trusty old rifle I could see the flashes in the long grass of the Turkish weapons and aimed low accordingly. I fired until <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> was almost red–hot, I had to drop it after about fifty rounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opas in {{defending}} Ryan {{put a lot}} of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; [...] "I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired." [...] In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; [...] "Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot." [...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot." [...] Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered my gun again." ...|$|E
2500|$|On hearing {{screams in}} a room, I went up {{a sort of}} tunnel passage and saw an Arab {{in the act of}} cutting off a child's head with a sword. He had already hit him and was having another cut, but on seeing me he tried to aim the stroke at me, but missed; he was {{practically}} on the muzzle of <b>my</b> <b>rifle.</b> I shot him low in the groin. Behind him was a Jewish woman smothered in blood with a man I recognized as a police constable named Issa Sheriff from Jaffa. He was standing over the woman with a dagger in his hand. He saw me and bolted into a room close by and tried to shut me out-shouting in Arabic, [...] "Your Honor, I am a policeman." ... I got into the room and shot him.|$|E
60|$|All hands {{knew the}} stream of lead <b>my</b> {{automatic}} <b>rifle</b> could throw, and Arthur Deacon knew it. He hesitated barely a moment, then obeyed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{never been}} my own man again" [...] said Mat, [...] "since {{you and me}} wished each other good-bye on the sandhills. The lonesome places have got strange to me--and <b>my</b> <b>rifle's</b> heavier in hand than ever I knew it before. There's some part of myself that seems left behind like, between Mary's grave and Mary's child. Must I cross the seas again to find it? Give us hold of your hand, Zack--and take the leavings of me back, along with you." ...|$|R
60|$|Occasionally, for {{the larger}} game animals and the {{gigantic}} beasts of prey, I used <b>my</b> express <b>rifle,</b> {{but for the most}} part the revolver filled all my needs.|$|R
2500|$|Although the Cheyenne and Lakota {{had only}} {{four to six}} people killed, and two to three wounded during the battle, they lost most of their property, and {{in the words of}} the warrior Wooden Leg: [...] "The Cheyennes were {{rendered}} very poor. I had nothing left but the clothing I had on... My eagle wing bone flute, my medicine pipe, <b>my</b> <b>rifle,</b> everything else of mine, were gone." [...] The women and children walked several days to reach the Oglala Sioux village of Crazy Horse farther north near the Little Powder River, where they were given shelter and food. [...] On the way, several Cheyennes froze to death. The army stated that the village consisted of about 104 lodges, including tipis and wikiups, while Cheyenne accounts said the village had about 40-65 tipis, and about 50 other structures. The number of warriors involved in the engagement was from 100 to 250, while there were around 383 United States soldiers and civilians present.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, the {{trenches}} have disappointed me. They are {{a scene of}} tiresome domesticity. They aren't a patch on our quarters in the rear. There isn't the traffic. I've not found a single excuse for firing <b>my</b> <b>rifle.</b> I don't believe I shall ever fire <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> at an enemy--ever....|$|E
60|$|I felt quite self-possessed, however, {{and stood}} beside my comrades with <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> ready and {{my finger on}} the trigger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Prince," [...] I said; [...] "but {{if there}} is need I will protect myself as I did yesterday," [...] and, cocking <b>my</b> double-barrelled <b>rifle,</b> I looked full at Cetewayo.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but I {{can pick}} off {{a dozen of}} them, one after another, with <b>my</b> good <b>rifle,</b> {{and then the rest}} will fly. Grabantak will fall first, and his best men after him." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{have set}} down here, I sprang to <b>my</b> feet, <b>rifle</b> in hand, {{ready for the}} first {{threatening}} movement {{on the part of}} the stranger; but he gave little token of being an enemy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Halt, boys--steady, dismount: take up your {{positions}} quietly. Don't fire till I {{give you}} the word. I shall try <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> first.' ...|$|E
60|$|With {{a natural}} impulse to shoot I raised <b>my</b> <b>rifle,</b> but the cub looked so {{attractive}} and so helpless that I hesitated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hist!" [...] exclaimed Joe, reining up; [...] "hold on, lads. Wild horses! <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> to a pop-gun there's wilder men on t'other side o' them." ...|$|E
60|$|They had {{not taken}} my revolvers or {{ammunition}} away from me {{because they did not}} know what they were; but <b>my</b> heavy <b>rifle</b> I had lost. They simply left it where it had lain beside me.|$|R
60|$|Now, for {{the first}} time, I had an {{opportunity}} to turn my attention toward the girl, who had stood, silent and motionless, behind me as I pumped death into my enemies and hers from <b>my</b> automatic <b>rifle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "My <b>Rifle,</b> <b>My</b> Pony and Me" [...] -- sung by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A bear," [...] thought I, {{and thanked}} the {{instinct}} that had impelled me to cling tenaciously to <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> during {{the moments of}} my awful tumble.|$|E
60|$|That the mutineers {{were getting}} short of food was patent. The Elsinore, sailless, drifted about that morning, {{the sport of}} wind and wave; and the gang put many lines {{overboard}} for the catching of mollyhawks and albatrosses. Oh, I worried the hungry fishers with <b>my</b> <b>rifle.</b> No man could show himself for'ard without having a bullet whop against the iron-work perilously near him. And still they caught birds--not, however, without danger to themselves, and not without numerous losses of birds due to <b>my</b> <b>rifle.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... '"Shtop that blasted noise!" [...] sez O'Hara in the dark, an' pop {{goes the}} room-lamp. I cud hear O'Hara runnin' up an' the rattlin' av <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> in the rack an' the men breathin' heavy as they stud roun' my cot. I cud see O'Hara {{in the light}} av the veranda lamp, an' thin I heard the crack av <b>my</b> <b>rifle.</b> She cried loud, poor darlint, bein' mishandled. Next minut' five men were houldin' me down. [...] "Go easy," [...] I sez; [...] "fwhat's ut all about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ve {{are not a}} {{very large}} party," [...] {{returned}} the professor. [...] "I do not zink I would fear much to face a tiger vid <b>my</b> goot <b>rifle,</b> but I do not relish his choomping on me unavares. Push on, please." ...|$|R
60|$|The useless {{destruction}} {{of any of}} these poor creatures was the farthest idea from my mind. I should have liked to have spoken with them, but I did not care to risk having to use <b>my</b> high-powered <b>rifle</b> upon them other than in the last extremity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye may perhaps doubt {{our power}} to avenge," [...] I went on, heedless of this by-play. [...] "Stay, I will show you. Here, thou dog and slave (addressing Umbopa in a savage tone), give me the magic tube that speaks"; and I tipped a wink towards <b>my</b> express <b>rifle.</b>|$|R
60|$|In a {{twinkling}} I {{had put on}} powder {{horn and}} pouch; looked well to <b>my</b> <b>rifle,</b> {{and was ready to}} follow Simon Kenton in his desperate venture.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{realized}} that I {{had come up}} nearly opposite where Simon Kenton was stationed, and he it was who had fired immediately after <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "The tiger came slowly out of {{the jungle}} {{so that we could}} see him clearly; then he walked toward us. I {{clutched}} <b>my</b> <b>rifle</b> still more tightly.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{remember}} {{the morning of}} the third day, which I knew was to be my last. I remember, rather indistinctly, that in my desperation and delirium I sprang out into the open and began firing <b>my</b> repeating <b>rifle</b> without seeing anybody to fire at. And I remember no more of that fight.|$|R
60|$|We {{traveled}} {{directly toward}} Sari. Stopping {{at the camp}} where I had been captured I recovered <b>my</b> express <b>rifle,</b> for which I was very thankful. I found it lying where I had left it when I had been overpowered in my sleep by the Sagoths who bad captured me and slain my Mezop companions.|$|R
