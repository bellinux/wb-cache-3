40|$|Modern {{history of}} civilization is {{concurrent}} {{to the use}} of brick and its manufacturing. Nowadays <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> is the most widely used technology for brick production. This paper tries to provide an idea of the brick making process in <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln.</b> The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, ANSYS CFX is being used to evaluate kiln performances using gas as its fuel. Simplified geometry was drawn and meshed using appropriate tools of ANSYS CFX. Several pertinent assumptions were made to reduce the complication of the simulation. Turbulence, combustion, radiation and NO models were adopted for simulation of a realistic <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> environment. Simulated temperature profile almost replicates industrial kiln situation as found in existing literature. CFD analysis helps to simulate the temperature profile of the brick kilns, the mass flow fractions of CO 2 and NO emissions at outlet, and also the air velocity profile inside the kiln. The simulated temperature generated in a <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> is found to be between 1300 K and 300 K. CO 2 and NOx volume generated inside the kiln is estimated as 1. 01 m 3 /s and 0. 108 m 3 /s respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> was {{reformed}} {{according to}} energy-saving mode, which was energy utilization diagnosis and analysis and energy-saving reconstruction. First, thermal performance was diagnosed, {{and the basic}} data for energy-saving reconstruction was provided through the test of <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln.</b> Then the main factors of low thermal efficiency was found. Second the thermal balance was calculated in drying and sintering process, which determined the form of waste heat recovery and utilization system. Finally the reconstruction was implemented by three energy-saving technologies. It caused energy-saving rate reached 44 %...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> {{produced}} 70% of the country's {{gas fire}} radiants (white ceramic grills that {{sit in the}} front of many domestic gas fires) in the mid 20th century and was difficult to visualise from the archaeological evidence alone. The digital reconstruction has assisted in understanding how the technology worked. The later design of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> enabled continuous firing thereby minimising delays while waiting for it to cool before loading and unloading. The product was slowly passed through a central chamber using gas to fire it.|$|R
50|$|Brickworks {{began to}} improve sites, {{modernize}} manufacturing processes, {{and the construction}} of <b>tunnel</b> <b>kilns</b> for extruded texture bricks at their Wallgrove site began. Another company, Punchbowl Brick and Pipe Company Pty. Ltd., is purchased. In 1961, Brickworks Limited is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, and a new plant in Wallgrove is opened. In 1965, three <b>tunnel</b> <b>kilns</b> were in full operation at the Wallgrove site. Then in 1965, a second plant in Wallgrove was opened, and additional kilns were built in 1969 to handle the demand for production. (A third plant at Wallgrove follows shortly in 1972). In 1969, Brickworks entered into a cross-holding agreement with Washington H. Soul Pattinson (WHSP).|$|R

In 1945, the first <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> was restored {{and by the}} end of the 1940s four <b>tunnel</b> <b>kilns</b> had been restored. German prisoners of war contributed most of the labour. [...] In addition to <b>tunnel</b> <b>kilns</b> a number of Kiviter-type retorts and the first Galoter-type retort were built in the 1950s. [...] Since 1948, Estonian-produced oil shale gas was used in Leningrad (Saint Petersburg) and in northern Estonia cities as a substitute for natural gas. During the 1950s, unsuccessful tests of oil shale underground gasification were conducted at Kiviõli. [...] In 1946-1952, uranium compounds were extracted from Graptolitic argillite oil shale in Sillamäe. [...] In 1949, the Kohtla-Järve Power Plant - the first power plant in the world using pulverized oil shale at an industrial scale - was commissioned in Estonia. [...] The world's two largest oil shale-fired power stations - Balti Power Plant and Eesti Power Plant (known as the Narva Power Plants) - were opened in 1965 and in 1973.

50|$|In modern brickworks, this {{is usually}} done in a {{continuously}} fired <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln,</b> in which the bricks are fired as they move slowly through the kiln on conveyors, rails, or kiln cars, which achieves a more consistent brick product.

50|$|In April 1946, {{a fire in}} a drying room {{destroyed}} most of {{the pottery}} plant including much of their manufacturing equipment. Vernon quickly rebuilt, but the company suffered another devastating fire in 1947. They rebuilt their manufacturing facility again, taking the opportunity to modernize. The old beehive kilns were replaced with modern <b>tunnel</b> <b>kilns</b> that dramatically increased production capacity.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{history of}} civilization is {{concurrent}} {{to the use}} of brick and its manufacturing. Brick kiln is the most important component in the manufacturing of clay-burnt bricks. Poorly operated brick kilns are considered as the major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission nowadays. Various types of brick kilns are in operation throughout the world. <b>Tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> is the most widely used technology in developed countries as it is highly automated. Other technologies which are quite popular in developing countries are: Hoffman kiln, Vertical Shaft kiln, Fixed Chimney kiln, Zigzag kiln, etc. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, ANSYS CFX is being applied to evaluate performance of <b>Tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> using natural gas as its fuel. The idea of a typical Tunnel kiln layout geometry has been envisaged from local brick industries. The length, width and height of the <b>Tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> geometry are taken as 100 m × 3. 24 m × 1. 48 m. The length and width of the brick stack is taken as 920 mm × 440 mm. With a gap of 400 mm and 100 mm between two brick stacks longitudinally and laterally respectively, a total of 450 (6 × 75) stacks can be accommodated inside the kiln at a time. Brick stack height including the kiln car height is taken as 1. 38 m. There is a clearance of 100 mm between the stack and the kiln roof. To produce certain quality bricks/ceramics, a particular temperature distribution throughout the kiln needs to be maintained. This temperature distribution with respect to the kiln length is known as <b>Tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> curve. To achieve the <b>Tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> curve obtained from industry for ordinary brick type, some design parameters need to be optimized for a given geometry.  Selection of these optimized design parameters are obtained through a series of trial and error runs of the CFD model. The total length of the tunnel can be divided into pre-heating, firing and cooling zones. Green bricks pass through the pre-heating, then firing and finally the cooling zones, while fresh air flows in opposite direction of the brick stack move. It is to be noted that brick industries are very reluctant to disclose any of those technical secrets related to their brick kiln design. In this regard, this design is based on initial guesses of those parameters and slowly come up with best performing scenario with respect to considered Tunnel kiln curve. To achieve the <b>Tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> curve, the design parameters that need to be played around are gas and air flow rates, flow directions, their inlet-outlet number, spacing and placements at different locations of the kiln are considered very crucial. Other important parameters that are varied include brick stack placement with respect to air and gas inlet-outlets, gaps between iv kiln roof and stacks and gaps between two consecutive stacks. To supply adequate air, a large rectangular air inlet with an area of 0. 8 m 2 is placed at the roof of the exit end of the kiln. To maintain the air temperature distribution as given in <b>Tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> curve, one intermediate size air outlet with an area of 0. 4 m 2 and a series of 13 rows × 12 columns small air inlet-outlets (openings) are also placed at the roof of the kiln in the cooling zone. All these heated air has been transferred to dryer to dry the green bricks. A series of 12 rows × 12 columns of gas inlets are placed in the roof of the firing zone. At the entry end of the tunnel, a flue gas outlet with an area of 0. 8 m 2 is placed in the roof.  Due to three dimensional nature of the kiln geometry, the CFD simulation of the whole system would be very time consuming. A close look of the geometry dictates that, a one-sixth slit of the total geometry (100 m × 3. 24   61 × m) containing 1 row × 75 stacks of bricks is enough to simulate the whole geometry of the kiln. This modelled geometry is meshed and mesh independency is checked using ANSYS Mesh. Turbulence, combustion and radiation models are adopted to simulate a realistic <b>Tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> environment using ANSYS CFX Pre.  Several model runs are performed until the simulated temperature distributions obtained closely replicate the <b>Tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> curve of the industry. From these simulations, the optimum Tunnel kiln design is suggested. The resulting CO 2 and NO emissions are also obtained from these simulations. Gas inlet velocity is proposed to be 6 m/s with an inlet diameter of 25 mm.  Gas velocity direction is suggested to be normal to the kiln roof. Air flow direction should be at 14 o with kiln roof towards firing zone. Gaps between brick stacks and the kiln roof should be about 200 mm. To get a uniform distribution of heated gases, positions of the brick stacks are such that on each occasion of its changed position it would be just directly below the inlet jets. Gaps between two consecutive brick stacks should also be reduced to 200 mm instead of the initially assumed 400 mm spacing. Hence additional number of bricks could be accommodated inside the kiln at a time which will result higher production of bricks with the same amount of fuel...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{continued}} to obtain financing {{for a commercial}} continuous formed coke plant. Discussions were held with two steel companies that are interested in producing coke for their use in steel production and foundry operations. Planning for production of 40 tons of foundry formed coke is underway. This coke {{will be used in}} two 20 -ton tests at General Motors` foundries. During this production, it is planned to determine if a <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> {{can be used as a}} coking furnace as an alternative for a rotary hearth. A rotary hearth is about three times more costly than a competitive-sized <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln.</b> Work continued on using Western non-caking coals to produce formed coke. Successful tests were made by using Eastern caking coals and other binders to permit using up to 50 % of the cheaper Western non-caking coals in formed coke production.

40|$|The {{available}} {{technology for}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>kilns</b> in Brazil is practically empirical {{and there is}} a lack of fundamental studies developed as an aid for the design of new kilns or for the retrofit of old ones. Here, a thermal model of a <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> is developed allowing the numerical simulation of kilns and dryers aiming toward a more efficient and less energy consuming design. The model is then systematically applied in the design of a new kiln to be used for firing clay tiles, bricks and similar products, with natural gas and sawdust as fuels. The results include the three-dimensional temperature distribution within the walls, gas and load along the kiln and a complete thermal energy balance including all energy fluxes related to the process. The strategies for kiln design are discussed and the advantages of combining the low cost of the wood sawdust and the ease of adjustment and quality of the natural gas combustion are evidenced...|$|R

In 1947, a pilot Galoter retort was built at the Ilmarine engineering plant in Tallinn. This unit, in operation until 1956, was capable of processing 2.5tonnes of oil shale per day and was used for modelling the next generation of commercial-scale retorts. The first Galoter-type commercial-scale pilot retorts were built at Kiviõli in 1953 and 1963 with capacities of 200 and 500tonnes of oil shale per day, respectively. The first of these retorts closed in 1963 and the second in 1981. The Narva Oil Plant, annexed to the Eesti Power Station and operating two Galoter-type 3,000-tonnes-per day retorts, was commissioned in 1980.
