In 2014, he traveled to the Alberta Tar Sands with the Sierra Club's Michael Brune and Leonardo DiCaprio. In 2015, he traveled to Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge with Brune, Keri Russell, and the leaders of several veterans groups.|$|E
5|$|Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, {{to prevent}} the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds. They will then stay there for {{a matter of months}} until the calf has {{developed}} enough blubber to survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. Until then, the calves will feed on the mother's fatty milk. With the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. Most will travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to Patagonia and western New Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female herds, consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor herds, consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large herds often get divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, the older ones form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a young calf from its <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression {{on the part of the}} males. These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E
50|$|Gentamicin is not {{recommended}} in pregnancy unless the benefits outweigh the risks for the <b>mother.</b> Gentamicin <b>can</b> cross the placenta and several reports of irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children have been seen. Intramuscular injection of gentamicin in <b>mothers</b> <b>can</b> cause muscle weakness in the newborn.|$|R

25|$|A <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> express (produce) her {{milk for}} storage and later use. Expression occurs with massage or a breast pump. It {{can be stored}} in freezer storage bags, {{containers}} made specifically for breastmilk, a supplemental nursing system, or a bottle ready for use. Using someone other than the mother/wet nurse to deliver the bottle maintains the baby's association of nursing with the mother/wet nurse and bottle feeding with other people.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{a lack of}} folic acid, a vitamin B, in {{the diet}} of a <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> cause {{cellular}} neural tube deformities that result in spina bifida. Congenital disorders such as a neural tube deformity (NTD) can be prevented by 72% if the mother consumes 4 milligrams of folic acid before the conception and after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Folic acid, or vitamin B9, aids {{the development of the}} foetal nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Disruption of {{hedgehog}} signaling during embryonic development, through either deleterious mutation or {{consumption of}} teratogens by the gestating <b>mother,</b> <b>can</b> lead to severe developmental abnormalities. Holoprosencephaly, {{the failure of}} the embryonic prosencephalon to divide to form cerebral hemispheres, occurs with a frequency of about 1 in 8,000 live births and about 1 in 200 spontaneous abortions in humans and is commonly linked to mutations in genes involved in the hedgehog pathway, including SHH and PTCH. Cyclopia, one of the most severe defects of holoprosencephaly, results if the pathway inhibitor cyclopamine is consumed by gestating mammals.|$|E
25|$|The newborn {{is hidden}} {{for a week}} after birth, a period much shorter than most other deer. The mother-fawn bond is not very strong, as the two get {{separated}} often, though they can reunite easily as the herds are cohesive. If the fawn dies, the <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> breed once again so as to give birth twice that year. The males continue their growth till seven to eight years. The average lifespan in captivity is nearly 22 years. The longevity in the wild, however, is merely five to ten years.|$|E

He wants Arthur to claim the quarto was found by Sil in an attic in the 1950s, and to verify that nobody else would have a claim to the text (namely, the estates of the printer and publisher, William White and Cuthbert Burby). A.E.H. Phillips reveals that he is dying, and, with Dana and Petra's encouragement, Arthur agrees {{to carry out this}} last request in spite of his lifelong distrust of his father.|$|E
25|$|Mothers will {{communicate}} with their offspring though vocalization, and it has even been shown that a <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> discriminate between the calls of its offspring and the offspring of other females. They exhibit more maternal approach behaviors when hearing the calls of their own offspring, and more experienced mothers show more approach behavior as opposed to new mothers. However, this behavior isn't the same in males, who instead take {{a different approach to}} hearing the calls of their offspring. They will harass the mothers until they go {{to take care of the}} young, but won't go to attend to the young themselves.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} {{have the potential for}} causing serious infection in newborn infants. Unpasteurized milk and cheeses can promote the growth of Listeria bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes can also cause serious infection in an infant and pregnant woman and can be transmitted to her infant in utero or after birth. The infection has the potential of seriously harming or even causing the death of a preterm infant, an infant of low or very low birth weight, or an infant with an immune system defect or a congenital defect of the immune system. The presence of this pathogen can sometimes be determined by the symptoms that appear as a gastrointestinal illness in the mother. The <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> also acquire infection from ingesting food that contains other animal products such as, hot dogs, delicatessen meats, and cheese.|$|E

25|$|Like black widows, {{the female}} S. grossa is 6-10.5mm {{in length and}} dark colored with a round, bulbous abdomen. Typical {{coloration}} ranges from purplish brown to black, with light-colored markings. Unlike black widows, redbacks, and other Latrodectus species, S. grossa {{does not have a}} bright red hourglass pattern or any other bright markings. Like many spiders, the male is sometimes smaller but can many times be nearly as long as the females. It measures 4.1-10.0mm in length and is thinner than the female. The two sexes are colored similarly; however, the sexually mature male almost always has lighter, more reddish-coloured legs than the female. S. grossa spiders may shed up to six times (instars) before reaching maturity. They can go several months without feeding, provided they have access to water. A well-fed female can lay three or more egg sacs each year. Each egg sac typically contains between 40-100 eggs. The <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> often be observed watching her eggs for hours, even days, at a time once the eggs start changing color and grow close to hatching. At normal household temp/humidity, an egg will usually hatch within a month of being laid. The spiderlings are independent from time of hatch.|$|E
500|$|Beatrice's {{life was}} {{overturned}} {{by the death}} of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901. She wrote to the Principal of the University of Glasgow in March, [...] "...you may imagine what the grief is. I, who had hardly ever been separated from my dear <b>mother,</b> <b>can</b> hardly realise what life will be like without her, who was the centre of everything." [...] Beatrice's public appearances continued, but her position at court was diminished. She, unlike her sister Louise, was not close to her brother, now King Edward VII, and {{was not included in the}} King's inner circle. Although their relationship did not break down completely, it was occasionally strained, for example when she accidentally (but noisily) dropped her service book from the royal gallery onto a table of gold plate during his coronation.|$|E
500|$|Mating occurs belly to belly. Dolphins {{have been}} {{observed}} engaging in intercourse when the females are not in their estrous cycles and cannot produce young, suggesting they may mate for pleasure. The gestation period averages 12 months. Births can occur {{at any time of}} year, although peaks occur in warmer months. The young are born in shallow water, sometimes assisted by a (possibly male) [...] "midwife", and usually only a single calf is born. Twins are possible, but rare. Newborn bottlenose dolphins are [...] long and weigh , with Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin infants being generally smaller than common bottlenose dolphin infants. To accelerate nursing, the <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> eject milk from her mammary glands. The calf suckles for 18 months to up to 8 years, and continues to closely associate with its mother for several years after weaning. Females sexually mature at ages 5–13, males at ages 9–14. Females reproduce every two to six years. Georgetown University professor Janet Mann argues the strong personal behavior among male calves is about bond formation and benefits the species in an evolutionary context. She cites studies showing these dolphins as adults are inseparable, and that early bonds aid protection, as well as in locating females.|$|E

2500|$|Thomson {{concedes that}} a third party indeed cannot make the choice to kill either the person being crushed or the child. [...] However, {{this does not mean}} that the person being crushed cannot act in self-defense and attack the child to save his or her own life. [...] To liken this to pregnancy, the <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> be thought to be the house, the fetus the growing-child. [...] In such a case, the mother’s life is being threatened, and the fetus is the one who threatens it. [...] Because for no reason should the mother’s life be threatened, and also for no reason is the fetus {{threatening}} it, both are innocent, and thus no third party can intervene. But, Thomson says, the person threatened can intervene, by which justification a <b>mother</b> <b>can</b> rightfully abort.|$|E
2500|$|For {{what we have}} to keep in mind is {{that the}} mother and the unborn child are not like two tenants in a small house, which has, by unfortunate mistake, been rented to both: the mother owns the house.
