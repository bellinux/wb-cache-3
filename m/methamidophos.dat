40|$|HPLC and HPLC-MS are {{the fastest}} and most {{accurate}} techniques {{for analysis of}} organic phosphorus pesticide (OPP) at the present time. Using these techniques, 14 strains of <b>methamidopho</b> (MAP) degrading-bacteria from the area contaminated with MAP have been identified. The results from HPLC and HPLC-MS analyses showed that the highest degradation rate was 73 % after 7 days. In order to determine what metabolites will be formed after degradation, a key issue that has been neglected for a long time, we used (P- 31) NMR to track the degradation process. The results showed that different strains produced different metabolites. Ten strains were divided into three groups (groups A, B and C) by their metabolic profiling. Strains in group A degraded MAP into phosphor acid by breaking down all P-N, P-O and P-S bonds in 7 days. Strains in groups B and C had only broken down partially P-N and P-S bonds at the same time. Therefore, the bacterial strains in group A had a greater application potential {{than the other two}} groups. In addition, most metal phosphates are unsolvable in water. The analysis of X-ray showed, that the phosphate radicals generated by bacterial degradation induce crystallogenesis of heavy metal salts in water phase and also cause the chemical sedimentation of their crystals. Furthermore, these crystals are hydrogen phosphates. The results suggested that the MAP-degrading bacteria could be used for cleaning up not only the organic phosphorous pesticide contamination but also the phosphorous and heavy metal contamination in water environment simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|A full cDNA {{encoding}} an acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3. 1. 1. 7) was cloned and characterized {{from the}} brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens Stål (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). The complete cDNA (2467 bp) contains a 1938 -bp {{open reading frame}} encoding 646 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of the AChE deduced from the cDNA consists of 30 residues for a putative signal peptide and 616 residues for the mature protein with a predicted molecular weight of 69, 418. The three residues (Ser 242, Glu 371, and His 485) that putatively form the catalytic triad and the six Cys that form intra-subunit disulfide bonds are completely conserved, and 10 out of the 14 aromatic residues lining the active site gorge of the AChE are also conserved. Northern blot analysis of poly(A) + RNA showed an approximately 2. 6 -kb transcript, and Southern blot analysis revealed there likely was just a single copy of this gene in N. lugens. The deduced protein sequence is most similar to AChE of Nephotettix cincticeps with 83 % amino acid identity. Phylogenetic analysis constructed with 45 AChEs from 30 species showed that the deduced N. lugens AChE formed a cluster with the other 8 insect AChE 2 s. Additionally, the hypervariable region and amino acids specific to insect AChE 2 also existed in the AChE of N. lugens. The results revealed that the AChE cDNA cloned in this work belongs to insect AChE 2 subgroup, which is orthologous to Drosophila AChE. Comparison of the AChEs between the susceptible and resistant strains revealed a point mutation, Gly 185 Ser, is likely responsible for the insensitivity of the AChE to <b>methamidopho</b> in the resistant strain...|$|R

40|$|<b>Methamidophos</b> is an {{organophosphate}} pesticide used {{to control}} {{a wide range of}} insects through direct contact and the systemic inhibition of cholinesterase. Target species include aphids, Colorado potato beetle, green peach aphid, leafhopper, leafminer, lygus bug, stink bug, tomato pinworm, and whitefly. It is a restricted use chemical that is currently registered for use on cotton, potatoes, tomatoes, and alfalfa for seed (CA only). The are no registered residential or public health uses for <b>methamidophos.</b> The Agency estimates that 640, 000 pounds of active ingredients are applied nationally on an annual basis. Potatoes are by far the principal site (87 %, followed by tomatoes (8 %), and cotton (5 %). It is of special note that <b>methamidophos</b> is a degradate of another organophosphate pesticide, acephate. In the Environmental Fate and Effects Division (EFED) chapter for acephate it was estimated that, in soil, 0. 77 pounds of <b>methamidophos</b> results from each pound of acephate applied. Estimates for aerobic aquatic conditions were not available. Because Estimted Environmental Concentrations (EECs) and Risk Quotients (RQs) were not determined for <b>methamidophos</b> as a degradate in water, this review will center on the features associated with direct application of <b>methamidophos,</b> and not those features associated with <b>methamidophos</b> from acephate degradation.

40|$|Putative {{long-term}} {{learning and}} memory effects of low-dose {{exposure to the}} cholinesterase inhibitor organophosphate <b>methamidophos</b> (Tamaron®) early in life were studied in two parallel studies in middle-aged rats. <b>Methamidophos</b> was administered via the drinking water to female and male Wistar rats using nominal concentrations of 0 (control), 0. 5, 1. 5 and 4. 5 ppm active ingredient for 16 weeks. Animals were then maintained for a recovery period of about 14 months without treatment. They were tested in the standard and repeated acquisition version of the Moms water escape task in two series of tests starting 33 and 55 weeks after termination of the <b>methamidophos</b> treatment. Functional observations and motor activity measurements preceded each series of testing. Exposure to <b>methamidophos</b> was confirmed by measurement of brain cholinesterase (ChE-B) {{at the end of}} the 16 weeks of treatment in satellite animals. At 4. 5 ppm a biologically relevant reduction in ChE-B activity was observed without clinical signs of intoxication (males: 66 %, females: 64 % of control activity). Mid- and low-dose exposure to <b>methamidophos</b> revealed ChE-B activity of 90 % and 100 % in males and 88 % and 97 % in females, respectively. General examinations of the animals during treatment revealed no clinical signs suggesting cholinergic stimulation. Functional observations and motor activity measurements exhibited no relevant differences between treatment groups and controls. Neither the performance in the standard Morris water escape task that predominantly measures spatial reference memory, nor in the repeated acquisition task in the Morris tank, which predominantly measures spatial working memory, was affected by treatment with <b>methamidophos.</b> A small number of statistically statistically significant differences were noted in the mean performance level between treatment groups, or between treatment by sex groups in both versions of the Morris task.

From postnatal day 60 to 89 (PN 60 to PN 89), one of two concentrations of <b>methamidophos</b> (higher dose: 5. 25 μg/ml; lower dose: 1. 31 μg/ml) or vehicle was administered in the drinking water of male Swiss mice. We evaluated three serotonergic biomarkers during (PN 89) and after (PN 100) the exposure period: 5 HT 1 A receptor binding with [3 H]OH-DPAT, 5 HT 2 receptor binding with [3 H]ketanserin and 5 HT transporter binding with [3 H]paroxetine. <b>Methamidophos</b> elicited robust decreases in binding for all 5 HT markers.

40|$|The use of {{acetylcholinesterase}} (AChE) inhibitors is {{the primary}} therapeutic strategy {{in the treatment of}} Alzheimer's disease. However, these drugs have been reported to have effects beyond the simple stimulation of neuronal acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) by elevated acetylcholine (ACh), interfering directly with the nAChR. Therefore, a pure pharmacological blockade of AChE is not usually obtained. In this study, the patch-clamp technique was utilized {{to determine the effects of}} <b>methamidophos,</b> a pesticide that is considered a selective AChE inhibitor, on nAChRs of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. In spite of the fact that <b>methamidophos</b> has been reported to be devoid of direct nicotinic actions, our main observation was that it selectively and reversibly blocked nAChR responses, without directly affecting the holding current. <b>Methamidophos</b> produced a downward shift in the dose response curve for nicotine; the mechanism accounting for this non-competitive antagonism was open channel block, in view of its voltage dependence. Pre-treatment with vesamicol did not prevent the reduction of nicotine-induced currents, indicating that the effect on nAChRs was independent from the activity of <b>methamidophos</b> as a cholinesterase inhibitor. Our results conclude that <b>methamidophos</b> has a complex blocking action on neuronal nAChRs that is unlinked to the inhibition of AChE. Therefore, it should not be considered a selective AChE inhibitor and part of its toxic effects could reside in an interference with the nicotinic neurotransmission. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The final residue analysis demonstrated that > 50 % of total <b>methamidophos</b> were resulted from the degradation of acephate 7 and 18 days after it was applied on the greenhouse pakchoi, respectively. While in the open-field pakchoi, > 90 % of total <b>methamidophos</b> was found to be the metabolite of acephate...|$|E
40|$|<b>Methamidophos</b> is a {{representative}} organophosphate insecticide. The knowledge of its developmental neurotoxicity is limited, especially for zebrafish {{in the early}} stages of their life. Four hour post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to several environmentally relevant concentrations of <b>methamidophos</b> (0, 25, and 500 μg/L) for up to 72 hpf. Locomotor behavior was then studied in the zebrafish larvae at this timepoint. Acridine orange (AO) staining was carried out in the zebrafish larvae, and the mRNA levels of genes associated with neural development (mbp and syn 2 a) were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The number of escape responders for mechanical stimulation was significantly decreased in exposed groups. AO staining showed noticeable signs of apoptosis mainly in the brain. In addition, the mRNA levels of mbp and syn 2 a were both significantly down-regulated in exposed groups. Our study provides the first evidence that <b>methamidophos</b> exposure can cause developmental neurotoxicity {{in the early stages}} of zebrafish life, which may be caused by the effect of <b>methamidophos</b> on neurodevelopmental genes and the activation of cell apoptosis in the brain...|$|E
40|$|Two {{commonly}} used insecticides, <b>Methamidophos</b> 60 SL @ 1000 ml/ha and Monocrotophos 40 WSC @ 1500 ml/ha were evaluated on Amrasca devastans L. during 1999 on Pusa Swani, Parbhani Kranti, Sabz Pari and Karishma okra varieties. Both insecticides provided effective control of Jassid {{and kept the}} population below economic threshold level up to ten days after insecticidal application. However, <b>Methamidophos</b> 60 SL proved better on Pusa Swani as compared to Monocrotophos 40 WSC, which decreased jassid population on Parbhani Kranti, Sabz Pari and Karishma, respectively...|$|E
