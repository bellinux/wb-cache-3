5|$|In {{the final}} months of 1894, Robey {{returned}} to London to honour {{a contract for}} Augustus Harris at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the details of which are unknown. In September he starred {{in a series of}} stand-up comedy shows that he would perform every September between 1894 and 1899. These short performances, in English seaside resorts including Scarborough and Bournemouth, were designed chiefly to enhance his name among provincial audiences. For the 1895 and 1896 Christmas pantomimes, he appeared in Manchester and Birmingham, respectively, in the title role of Dick Whittington, for which he received favourable reviews and praise from audiences. Despite the show's success, Robey and his co-stars disliked the experience.

40|$|This {{work was}} aimed to {{quantify}} the flow properties of <b>muffin</b> batters by Line Spread Test (LST) and to establish a valid correlation between their line spread distance and viscosity. LST is a quick and inexpensive method for comparing relative viscosities of food slurries or a solid-liquid suspension type of food materials, like <b>muffin</b> batters. The rheological properties of <b>muffin</b> batters formulated using gluten free flours were studied. Five different combinations of rice flour and quinoa flour were studied as gluten free flour combinations. Control <b>muffin</b> batters were formulated using 100 % wheat flour, which is a gluten positive flour. Density, pH, line spread distance and viscosity were measured for all six batter formulations including control. All tests were performed in triplicate and all data were analyzed statistically. In general, gluten free flour reduced the density and increased the acidity of <b>muffin</b> batters. Whereas, line spread distance was increased and viscosity was decreased with replacement of quinoa flour to rice flour in the <b>muffin</b> batters. A valid correlation between line spread distance and viscosity was observed. The inverse of LST in cm/sec was observed {{to be close to}} the viscosity in poise for <b>muffin</b> batters in this stud...|$|R
