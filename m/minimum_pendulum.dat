50|$|The United Kingdom {{has since}} 1971 had {{well-established}} slip resistance standards {{based on the}} pendulum. This test was developed for pedestrian traction by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards in the 1940s and further refined in the UK. It was validated for pedestrian traction in 1971, together with its safety standards, in the UK {{over a period of}} 25 years by 3500 real-world public walking area tests and site accident records. The test is an ASTM standard (E 303), slightly modified for pedestrian traction. The usual safety standard for a level floor is a <b>minimum</b> <b>Pendulum</b> Test Value (PTV) of 36. The pendulum is also the instrument used in the Sustainable Slip Resistance test method, which measures the possible impact of years of use on a potential flooring's slip resistance. The pendulum is also used in the U.S. and elsewhere for determining the slipperiness of roads and airport runways.|$|E
50|$|Standards Australia HB 197:1999 {{as well as}} Standards Australia HB 198:2014 give {{detailed}} recommendations/guidelines of <b>minimum</b> wet <b>Pendulum</b> Test Slip Resistance Values {{for many}} different situations: e.g. external ramps, 54; external walkways and pedestrian crossings, 45; shopping center food courts, 35; and elevator lobbies above external entry level may be 25 or less. There are also barefoot area recommendations based on pendulum tests with a soft rubber slider (TRL rubber also known as Slider 55). The Australian recommendations are presently the worldâ€™s most detailed standards for pedestrian wet slip resistance.|$|R
