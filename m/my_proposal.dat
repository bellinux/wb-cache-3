500|$|When {{planning}} their proposed film Lieutenant Kijé in 1932, the Belgoskino studios of Leningrad asked the expatriate Prokofiev {{to write the}} accompanying music. In some respects Prokofiev was a surprising choice; he was at this stage better known abroad than in the Soviet Union, and had acquired a reputation for dissonance. Moreover, his ballet Le pas d'acier had fared badly at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre in 1929. The composer's first response was to refuse the commission; {{a member of the}} production team recalled that Prokofiev [...] "categorically rejected <b>my</b> <b>proposal.</b> His time was scheduled far into the future, he had never written music for film and he didn't know 'what kind of sauce' to put on it." [...] But, attracted by the story, Prokofiev quickly changed his mind and accepted, seeing this first venture into film music as an opportunity to demonstrate his ability to appeal to a mass Soviet audience.|$|E

[...] That program had its start at the first site of the Museum over the liquor store on Fifth Avenue (2033 Fifth Avenue). [...] It was a loft, a factory {{going out of business}} that had a lot of sewing machines in it. [...] Mel Edwards and I physically cleaned that space out for the Artist-in-Residence program. [...] That was the beginning. [...] I wanted to create a context, namely an Artist-in-Residence program, through which money could be funnelled to artists which would allow them to ponder the kinds of issues and questions that come up in a graduate program." [...] Kinshasa Conwill, former director of the museum, says that the program [...] "has become critical to the museum's identity and its contribution to the larger art arena." ...|$|E
