The arising mixed commercial waste amounts and composition have been considered in the survey. Furthermore, commercial enterprises were interviewed and an industrial sorting trial was performed. The examined waste samples held a substantial share of recyclable materials. The interviews with commercial enterprises showed that many recycleables are already collected separately but there still is a potential for increasing the separate collected amounts. The extent of enforcement will have a substantial impact on commercial enterprises activities in this regard. Concerning the industrial sorting, the quota requirements of the amendment are not met in current practice according to the sorting trial and literature review. The separate collection quote seems to be limited due to economic reasons, the recycling quote in sorting processes may additionally be influenced by quality requirements on output fractions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to present an {{industrial}} application of an optimization tool for the supervisory control of the NOx reduction section. This work does not pretend to address any new technique of NOx reduction but rather to show the results obtained when a comprehensive on-line optimization tool has been successfully applied. The optimization procedure consists of the search of the best working conditions that satisfy the operating and legal constraints, in terms of emission amounts and combustion quality. This procedure adopts a simulation algorithm and data reconciliation tool to verify and improve {{the consistency of the}} calculated values by experimental data. Using such algorithm it is possible to identify all the updated data necessary to optimize the plant's performance. Specifically, the DeNO(x) section optimization, both from an economical and environmental point of view, is strongly related to the estimation of the nitrogen waste mass fraction together with the catalytic reactor efficiency. The results obtained in many case studies show {{that it is possible to}} achieve the desired performance and to reduce the operating costs by defining the optimal operating temperature and the corresponding amount of ammonia required for the catalytic reduction of NOx subject to the emission limits.

A number of sampling campaigns were conducted with the aim of characterising stack gas emission levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) /polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and to evaluate initial specifications of dioxin stack gas emission values below 0. 1 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3. Preliminary results revealed levels between 44 and 111 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 when the gas-cleaning system consisted only of an old electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Decreased levels around 15 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 were observed when the semi-dry scrubber began to operate and the ESP was switched off. Again, remarkable dioxin removal was observed after the installation of the fabric filter and levels around 0. 3 – 0. 4 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 were soon achieved. Nevertheless, the limit of 0. 1 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 was reached by additional injection of activated carbon which helped to lower PCDD/PCDF levels to around 0. 036 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3. The results also demonstrated a significant change in the dioxin distribution present in combustion-derived materials (stack gas emission, bottom ash and solid waste from gas treatment). The major dioxin fraction was found in gaseous matrices before the flue gas control system was upgraded. After this step, the major dioxin fraction content was ob-served in solid waste from gas treatment...|$|E
40|$|In the EU’s waste strategy, {{the order}} for {{sustainable}} waste actions is: reduction, reuse and recycling. Recovery {{has recently been}} added as a fourth action, and it {{is applied to the}} waste types that cannot be reused or recycled. Thus, recovery remains the last option before final landfilling. The annual amount of municipal waste from households in Finland is 2. 5 million tons. Waste collection and utilization is organized relatively well, but still 1. 1 million tons are disposed of to landfill. A recent survey on mixed waste quantity and quality showed that almost 65 % of its content is bio-based. Energy recovery from this waste in combined incineration plants for district heat and electricity (CHP) may serve as an additional measure for greenhouse gas reduction in local communities. Since buildings are responsible for approximately 40 % of energy consumption, it is important to reduce energy consumption. In Finland, due to the long heating season, the energy production method and heat source are extremely important for greenhouse gas reduction. This paper discusses energy recovery from waste in a case study of a new residential area in southern Finland. All the buildings fulfil current Finnish energy requirements and represent typical wooden frame construction with rendering façades. It is assumed that the households will be connected to the local district heat system, in which heat is produced partly in gas-driven heat plants and partly in a <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant.</b> We show that energy recovery from waste should not be underestimated, because it is a valuable means of greenhouse gas reduction, especially in local communities...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{objectives}} of the operation of a <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> is to maximise throughput. However, increasing throughput can intensify the loading on the gas-clean-up system and also cause a violation of operational constraints.

Therefore, a multi-objective strategy is required to optimize plant operation in terms of economic and environmental goals, and operational constraints. This paper develops a supervisory level optimization tool for a <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant,</b> which utilises a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). A MOGA is ideally suited to providing decision support to a human operator because it returns a Pareto-optimal set of solutions; this allows the user to transparently assess the benefits and penalties associated with a range of candidate control decisions. Specifically, the tool enables controllable parameters to be adjusted for maximum throughput, whilst minimising emissions and keeping within operational constraints.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the reactions and reaction mechanisms of fly ash from <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> leading {{to the formation of}} organic compounds, is of great importance for minimization of the emission of these substances. Studying the reaction of toluene with fly ash is a contribution to this. At this reaction in liquid phase (T#<=# 111 C) it could be shown that o-and p-methyldiphenylmethane have been formed. This dimerisation of toluene describes the first step of an oxidation or condensation reaction. For these reaction the rate constant and activation energy have been determined. Formally the reaction corresponds to zero order as often found at photochemical and catalytic reactions of metallic salts. Further following reactions forming oxidation or condensation products of the MDPMs could not be found in liquid phase. Parallel reactions as the chlorination of toluene at temperatures to the boiling point for example have not been observed too. Comprehensive thermodynamic evaluations in the suitable temperature range have shown that the formation of following products is thermodynamically favoured. The different mineral phases of the transitional metals iron and copper are of special interest for chlorination reactions of fly ash. Usually their chlorides are used as chlorinating agents at reactions with fly ash. It could be shown that these metallic salts are not available as water-soluble compounts. After dimerisation further following reactions have been observed in the vapour phase. In the presence of oxygen oxidation products have been formed and condensation products under inert gas atmosphere. At the decomposition of residual carbon of fly ash from 250 C on, the addition of toluene to the vapour phase (synthetic air: 80 % NH_ 2, 20 % O_ 2) increased the formation of chlorinated aromatic compounds. Especially the lower chlorine stages have been preferred at the formation of dioxines and furanes. Thus fly ash is showing a potential of chlorination favouring the formation of organohalogen compounds in a gas-solid-phase reaction in presence of toluene in the vapour phase. For an explanation some theoretical formulations have been discussed. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract Bottom ashes {{obtained}} from a <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant,</b> have shown different pH and lead concentrations in leachate for different lines. In order to explain this behaviour, combustion tests were performed concerning the lines {{and the effect of}} the type of wastes. The BA {{obtained from}} the same waste has shown the same raw chemical composition, but different leachate characteristics for the different lines. The bottom ash from different wastes burned on the same line instead showed very similar leaching behaviour. The results suggest that the quality of leach ate depends on the plant and process conditions (in particular the ash quenching phase) and not on the composition of the waste. During ash quenching, the formation and dissolution of soluble alkalis depends on the washing ratio and on the residence time. A different washing degree leads to a different residual alkalinity in the bottom ash, and consequently to a different value of leachate pH with different metal releases. Therefore, with the practical aim of establishing the best conditions for the final disposal of bottom ash, a careful planning of this phase could be proposed as an alternative to a weathering proces...|$|R

The balanced selection showed that AISI 410 martensitic stainless steel (wrought, hard tempered) is the best candidate with a good combination of corrosion resistance, a relatively low price (0. 83 - 0. 92 e/kg) and a good thermal conductivity (23 - 27 W/m K). Meanwhile, Nitronic 50 /XM- 19 stainless steel is the most promising candidate for long-term selection, as it presents high corrosion resistance with a relatively low price (4. 86 - 5. 14 e/kg) compared to Ni-alloys.

40|$|Abstract: Catalysts {{used for}} {{selective}} catalytic reduction were deactivated for various times in a slipstream from a <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> and then characterized. The activity for NO reduction with NH 3 was measured. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas were determined by N 2 adsorption from which the pore size distributions in the mesopore region were obtained. Micropore areas and volumes were also obtained. The composition of fresh and deactivated catalysts as well as fly ash was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The changes in surface area (8 % decrease in BET surface area over 2311 h) and pore structure were small, while the change in activity was considerable. The apparent pre-exponential factor was 1. 63 × 105 (1 /min) in the most deactivated catalyst, compared to 2. 65 × 106 (1 /min) in the fresh catalyst, i. e. a reduction of 94 %. The apparent activation energy for the fresh catalyst was 40 kJ/mol, decreasing to 27 kJ/mol with increasing deactivation. Characterization showed that catalytic poisoning is mainly due to decreased acidity of the catalyst caused due to increasing amounts of Na and K.
