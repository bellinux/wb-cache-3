40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> {{employer}} to the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees <b>and</b> also <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by both employers and employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employer to the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees <b>and</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find {{the most frequently used}} types of request used by both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers <b>and</b> both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers mostly used the same types of request expressions to both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. However, the writer found various types of request used by both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The result of this research showed that both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, both to their <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. However, both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees used various types of request, both to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employer. Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers <b>and</b> both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees...|$|R

They set up a wind tunnel where <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females.

It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
