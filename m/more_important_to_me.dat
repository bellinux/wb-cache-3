In 1996, Greenglass recanted his sworn {{testimony}} {{in an interview with}} The New York Times reporter Sam Roberts and stated he had lied under oath about the extent of his sister's involvement in the spying plot in order to protect his wife. At the trial, Greenglass had testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed his notes to give to the Russians, though he now intimated that Ruth had done the typing, saying [...] "I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don't remember." [...] Greenglass explained, [...] "My wife is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> than my sister. Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my children."

After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the [...] "PewDiePie" [...] YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios.|$|E

ElBaradei specifically proposed a [...] "double, simultaneous suspension, a time out" [...] as [...] "a confidence-building measure", under which the international sanctions would be suspended and Iran would suspend enrichment. ElBaradei also said, [...] "if I look at it from a weapons perspective there are much <b>more</b> <b>important</b> issues <b>to</b> <b>me</b> than the suspension of enrichment," [...] naming his top priorities as preventing Iran from [...] "going to industrial capacity until the issues are settled"; building confidence, with [...] "full inspection" [...] involving Iranian adoption of the Additional Protocol; and [...] "at all costs" [...] preventing Iran from [...] "moving out of the non-proliferation system".|$|R

I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Greenglass, Ethel Rosenberg's {{brother and}} key {{prosecution}} witness, recanted his testimony about his sister having typed the notes. In 2001 he stated, [...] "I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don't remember."

Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my children." [...] He refused to express any remorse for his decision to betray his sister, saying only that he did not realize that the death penalty would be invoked. He stated, [...] "I would not sacrifice my wife and my children for my sister." [...] In September 2008, hundreds of pages of grand jury transcripts were released. With this release, it was revealed that Ruth Greenglass had irreconcilable differences between her grand jury testimony of August 1950 and the testimony she gave at trial. At the grand jury, Ruth Greenglass was asked, [...] "Didn't you write [...] down {{on a piece of paper}}?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, I wrote [...] down on a piece of paper and [...] took it with him." [...] But at the trial, she testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed up notes about the atomic bomb.|$|E

A week later, Suzuki released her second studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol. 1, which sold 1,063,000 copies and debuted at number one.　Suzuki has said {{of this first}} period of her career {{that she was not}} free to do what she wanted and only followed what she was told, leaving her feeling [...] "pretty disheartened and down, like there was no future.". Suzuki had been writing lyrics from an early age and passing them to her manager and producers. The first song to feature them, with the help of Mitsuko and Tetsuya Komuro, was her tenth Sony single, [...] "Don't Need to Say Good Bye". The lyrics were influenced by events occurring in her personal life at that time, specifically her upcoming high school graduation and she has said [...] "it was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> than sales and chart rankings to know that I had put my thoughts and feelings into what I was singing."　Three months after Infinity Eighteen Vol.1, Suzuki released her twelfth single, [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] in the beginning of April and third studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 at the end of April. [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] sold a total of 234,000 copies reaching number one and Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 sold a total of 427,000 copies reaching number two.

It reached number 1 on the Oricon charts, despite the fact that by this point, Suzuki herself had vanished from the public eye and Sony had taken all of her previous singles and albums off CD shelves.|$|E
2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E

Even when I was a Muslim, I didn't understand why it made me a more spiritual entity, if I did not eat pork. I always felt that the essence of spirituality lies in being a good human and following good, positive principles. The Golden Dragon Chinese restaurant at the Taj, those days, was quite famous for pork delicacies and every time I got a break from shooting, I would rush off to the Golden Dragon. Whenever my friends questioned me about my eating pork, I {{would say that it}} was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be a human being than a racist." ...|$|R
40|$|My {{grandparents}} {{started taking}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> museums when I {{was three years}} old. On that first trip, I began to dance around the museum when I saw Matisse's "Le Danse". That painting produced a direct feeling of uninhibited joy for me at that moment. That type of profound experience during my early childhood proved crucial to my development as an adult. Although I was trained in traditional life drawing and art history my education was very broad. When {{it came time for}} career decisions I chose every possible alternative to art I could imagine. I wanted to make enough money to live as I pleased, until I finally realized that it was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have all of my time to use as I saw fit. In order to live my life to its fullest potential I realized that I cannot sacrifice what is irreplaceable in order to maintain a certain life style. I returned to the study of art after discovering that no other discipline was suited to my particular temperament. It might have been my early exposure to the arts which carried particularly enjoyable memories for me, or the wonderful humanism and constructive support it seemed only my art teachers offered. In any case, it was the only field which allowed me the freedom of expression to explore my own nature in a creative way. Art is often the only academically approved discipline where students are encouraged to explore their ideas without having to follow a set of rules. While most subjects taught in our schools educate people to think in a uniform, linear fashion, art encourages creativity and individuality, the cornerstones of high culture. Art challenges students' creative problem solving abilities, and allows them the freedom to express their uniquely individual concerns. After deciding that I would seek a career as an artist it still remained to be seen how my art would manifest. I had completed many pieces of art, drawings paintings, and sculptures actually numbering in the thousands, however they were done {{within the context of the}} classroom, they could only suggest the glimmer of an individual style. Having not yet fully realized my maturity as an artist, I proceeded to investigate my own personal goals through my experimentation with painting. Instead of picturing a scene in my mind and then trying to capture it in a painting (a process only one step removed from the representation of reality) I simply started to paint, arranging color and form spontaneously as I went, according to what provoked a direct response in me at that moment. I wanted to find out how I could apply the paint to the surface in such a way that the results would carry meaning for me. (See more in text...|$|R

6000|$|I learned {{very much}} and very many things at those dinners, but more {{particularly}} did I become familiarised with the habits of mind of such men as Neal, Crupp, Gane, and {{the one or two}} other New Imperialists who belonged to us. They were nearly all like Bailey Oxford men, though mostly of a younger generation, and they were all mysteriously and inexplicably advocates of Tariff Reform, {{as if it were the}} principal instead of at best a secondary aspect of constructive policy. They seemed obsessed by the idea that streams of trade could be diverted violently so as to link the parts of the Empire by common interests, and they were persuaded, I still think mistakenly, that Tariff Reform would have an immense popular appeal. They were also very keen on military organisation, and with a curious little martinet twist in their minds that boded ill for that side of public liberty. So much against them. But they were disposed to spend money much more generously on education and research of all sorts than our formless host of Liberals seemed likely to do; and they were altogether more accessible than the Young Liberals to bold, constructive ideas affecting the universities and upper classes. The Liberals are abjectly afraid of the universities. I found myself constantly falling into line with these men in our discussions, and more and more hostile to Dayton's sentimentalising evasions of definite schemes and Minns' trust in such things as the [...] "Spirit of our People" [...] and the [...] "General Trend of Progress." [...] It wasn't that I thought them very much righter than their opponents; I believe all definite party [...] "sides" [...] at any time are bound to be about equally right and equally lop-sided; but that I thought I could get more out of them and what was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> more out of myself if I co-operated with them.
