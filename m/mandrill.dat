5|$|Elaine and Guybrush {{return to}} Mêlée Island in Escape from Monkey Island from their lengthy honeymoon {{to find that}} she has been {{declared}} legally dead; as a result the governorship of the Tri-Island Area is up for election. While Elaine and Guybrush work on reversing her legal demise, they discover that the other candidate in the election is actually LeChuck in disguise, but the townspeople, feeling neglected by Elaine's long absence, do not believe her. Guybrush leaves to prevent the Ultimate Insult, a powerful voodoo talisman, from falling into the hands of LeChuck's co-conspirator Ozzie <b>Mandrill.</b> Elaine is defeated in the election and LeChuck becomes governor, while Guybrush is captured and marooned on Monkey Island. On Monkey Island, Guybrush discovers that resident castaway Herman Toothrot is actually Horatio Marley, Elaine's long thought dead grandfather. The two escape Monkey Island and defeat LeChuck and <b>Mandrill.</b> Elaine asks Horatio to take over her position as governor of the Tri-Island Area, and Guybrush and Elaine depart.|$|E

There, he grows into a handsome young lion, while Scar wreaks havoc on the Pride Lands. When Simba is discovered by his childhood friend named Nala, she confronts him, warning him of Scar's tyranny and begging him to return home. Afraid of facing his past, Simba refuses until a wise <b>mandrill</b> named Rafiki leads him to Mufasa's ghost, who convinces him to return home and reclaim his kingdom from Scar.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mandrills</b> {{are mostly}} {{terrestrial}} {{but they are}} more arboreal than baboons and feed {{as high as the}} canopy. When on the ground, <b>mandrills</b> walk by digitigrade quadrupedalism (walking on the toes of all four limbs). When in the trees, they often move by lateral jumps. <b>Mandrills</b> are mostly diurnal, with activities extending from morning to evening. They sleep in trees at a different site each night. <b>Mandrills</b> have been observed using tools; in captivity, <b>mandrills</b> have been observed using sticks to clean themselves.|$|R
40|$|AbstractViral loads were {{investigated}} in SIVmnd- 1 chronically infected <b>mandrills</b> {{and the results}} were compared with those previously observed in other nonpathogenic natural SIV infections. Four naturally and 11 experimentally SIVmnd- 1 -infected <b>mandrills</b> from a semi-free-ranging colony were studied during the chronic phase of infection. Four SIVmnd- 1 -infected wild <b>mandrills</b> were also included for comparison. Twelve uninfected <b>mandrills</b> were used as controls. Viral loads in all chronically infected <b>mandrills</b> ranged from 105 to 9 × 105 copies/ml and antibody titers ranged from 200 to 14, 400 and 200 to 12, 800 for anti-V 3 and anti-gp 36, respectively. There were no differences between groups of wild and captive <b>mandrills.</b> Both parameters were stable during the follow-up, and no clinical signs of immune suppression were observed. Chronic SIVmnd- 1 -infected <b>mandrills</b> presented slight increases in CD 20 + and CD 28 + /CD 8 + cell counts, and a slight decrease in CD 4 + /CD 3 + cell counts. A slight CD 4 + /CD 3 + cell depletion was also observed in old uninfected controls. Similar to other nonpathogenic models of lentiviral infection, these results show a persistent high level of SIVmnd- 1 replication during chronic infection of <b>mandrills,</b> with minimal effects on T cell subpopulations...|$|R

25|$|The zoo {{has also}} pioneered {{the use of}} animal birth control. It {{was the first to}} use a dart gun to implant a slow-release hormone into the thigh of a female giraffe; she is the {{daughter}} of the zoo's bull giraffe, and inbreeding is inadvisable. The zoo uses slow-release hormones to control its chimpanzee and <b>mandrill</b> populations, which are reproducing too quickly for the space they occupy; letting the animals multiply and sending family members to other zoos is unwise, according to veterinarians.|$|E
25|$|Lahore Zoo {{has been}} criticized for not having the level of medical {{facilities}} expected in a modern zoo. Zoo officials reported in April 2005 that three female black-footed gray langurs died due to cold weather the previous winter. In November 2005, a male <b>mandrill</b> and male puma died at the zoo. A female Asian black bear died in mid-February 2006. In September 2006, some animals at the zoo were diagnosed with tuberculosis, which can also be transmitted to humans, but early detection and treatment prevented an outbreak. In January 2009, a female giraffe was attacked by a plains zebra and died soon after due to injuries.|$|E

50|$|Sex {{differences}} in pelage, such as capes of hair, beards, or crests, and skin {{can be found}} in several species among adult primates. Several species (e.g., Lemur macaco, Pithecia pithecia, Alouatta caraya) show an extensive dimorphism in pelage colors or patterning. For example, in <b>mandrills</b> (Mandrillus sphinx), males display extensive red and blue coloration on their face, rump and genitalia as compared to females. Male <b>mandrills</b> also possess a yellow beard, nuchal crest of hair, and pronounced boney paranasal ridges, all of which are absent or vestigial in females. Studies have shown that male color in <b>mandrills</b> serves as a badge of social status in the species.|$|R

500|$|Inafune {{created the}} {{character}} Zero, whom he {{originally intended to}} be the game's main, playable protagonist. [...] "When the X series came out, I really wanted to redesign Mega Man," [...] Inafune explained. [...] "I wanted a totally different Mega Man. I’m a designer, a creator; I wanted something new. I didn’t {{want to use the}} same old Mega Man." [...] Fearing a negative reaction from fans, Zero was ultimately reduced to a role secondary to Mega Man X. The development team additionally wanted the world of Mega Man X to be much more sophisticated than in the first Mega Man series. They wanted to accomplish this with Zero's [...] "hardcore" [...] personality and the game's antagonist Sigma. As stated by Inafune, the original series' villain Dr. Wily had [...] "a side to him you couldn't really hate". Sigma, however, was written as a once-good character suffering an [...] "unforeseen error" [...] that leads him to be completely evil. The game's story went through several changes during development. Two allies of Mega Man X, named RX and RY, appeared in previews for the game, but were later taken out. Mega Man X altered the franchise tradition of having themed boss characters with a [...] "Man" [...] moniker by replacing them with anthropomorphic animal-like androids. The art and pixelization for these eight bosses were divided among three illustrators: Inafune did Storm Eagle and Chill Penguin; Kaji did Spark <b>Mandrill,</b> Launch Octopus, and Sting Chameleon; and Kazunori Tazaki (credited as Ikki) did Flame Mammoth, Armored Armadillo, and Boomer Kuwanger. The team was careful in making the bosses distinct from one another in both stature and coloring. Tatsuya Yoshikawa (credited as Tatsunoko), a fourth artist who had recently been hired by Capcom, was given the task of assisting {{the rest of the team}} by designing, illustrating, and creating the sprites for the game's minor enemies. The musical score for Mega Man X was composed by Capcom's Alph Lyla group. Setsuo Yamamoto (credited as Setsuo) was initially the sole composer assigned to the game, and contributed the vast majority of the soundtrack, but four other composers, Yuki Iwai (credited as Sato), Toshihiko Horiyama (credited as Kirry), Yuko Takehara (credited as Yuko) and Makoto Tomozawa (credited as Tomozou), were brought in late in production to help finish the soundtrack. Iwai and Horiyama would later compose the soundtracks for Mega Man X2 and X4 respectively. The Japanese division of Sony Records published an arranged album featuring ten songs on March 9, 1994. Music using the SNES instrumentals was included as part of the Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6 soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003.|$|E

The SIV viral load was higher in SIV-infected <b>mandrills</b> than in co-infected animals, whereas the STLV- 1 proviral load was higher in co-infected than in mono-infected groups.
