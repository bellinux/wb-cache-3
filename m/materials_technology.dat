2500|$|As {{the second}} orbiter to be constructed, {{and the first}} able to fly into space, Columbia was roughly [...] heavier than {{subsequent}} orbiters such as Endeavour, which were of a slightly different design, and had benefited from advances in <b>materials</b> <b>technology.</b> In part, {{this was due to}} heavier wing and fuselage spars, the weight of early test instrumentation that remained fitted to the avionics suite, and an internal airlock that, originally fitted into the other orbiters, was later removed in favor of an external airlock to facilitate Shuttle/Mir and Shuttle/International Space Station dockings. Due to its weight, Columbia could not have used the planned Centaur-G booster (cancelled after the loss of Challenger). The retention of the internal airlock allowed NASA to use Columbia for the STS-109 Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, along with the Spacehab double module used on STS-107. Due to Columbia's heavier weight, it was less ideal for NASA to use it for missions to the International Space Station, though modifications were made to the Shuttle during its last refit in case the spacecraft was needed for such tasks.|$|E
