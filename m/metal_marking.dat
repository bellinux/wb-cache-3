There would be no rest for me until I had solved the question. I renewed the exhausted batteries and passed the current through the bowl of quicksilver. For sixteen hours I sat watching the <b>metal,</b> <b>marking</b> how it slowly seemed to curdle, to grow firmer, to lose its silvery glitter and to take a dull yellow hue. When I at last picked it up in a forceps, and threw it upon the table, it had lost every characteristic of mercury, and had obviously become another metal. A few simple tests were enough to show me that this other metal was platinum.|$|E

50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>marks</b> {{are dark}} lines, often {{accompanied}} by damage in the glaze, caused by the deposition of metal during the use of metal utensils. The cutlery, or other relatively soft metal, will leave a very thin smear of metal on pottery ware if the glaze is minutely pitted. A glaze may have this defective surface as it leaves the glost kiln, or it may subsequently develop such a surface {{as a result of}} inadequate chemical durability. The fault is also known as cutlery marking.|$|R

The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, appears around 12% higher than in the Sun. It is radiating 141 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 9,350 K, literally giving it a white-hot glow.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a three-dimensional computer modeling technique for alignment system simulation, and some example calculations. The technique {{has been developed}} to address issues of alignment and overlay accuracy for future generation VLSI technology. The analytical basis is a general finite element electromagnetic wave propagation code, EMFlex, that rigorously simulates light scattering from the 3 -D alignment mark. Using the Nikon Laser Step Alignment (LSA) system as a model instrument, the overlay error and signal shape are simulated. Examples of an idealized asymmetric <b>metal</b> <b>mark</b> are studied. Preliminary {{results suggest that the}} rigorous simulations are substantially different from the one dimensional Fresnel approximations that have been used previously. 1...|$|R

In at least one location, just South of where a stream crosses the line, the metal sheath is still visible over the wood of one rail.|$|R
5000|$|Stuck Mojo fuses Southern-based {{heavy metal}} with hip hop influences, and is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} pioneers of rap <b>metal.</b> <b>Mark</b> Jenkins of The Washington Post noted that one of the band's songs may indicate conservative views, while other songs may indicate more uniformly distributed hostility. Jenkins writes that [...] "the song [...] "Crooked Figurehead" [...] does begin with an anti-Clinton rant, which suggests that this Atlanta quartet is the mirror image of leftist agit-metal band Rage Against the Machine. Maybe it's not just the president the Mojos hate, though—maybe it's everyone." [...] The band cites Red Hot Chili Peppers, Run-D.M.C., Faith No More and Black Sabbath as influences.|$|R
