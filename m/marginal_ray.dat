As the scan mirror rotates, rays incident from a plurality of lines in the object plane are selectively directed through the optical system arriving at a common intersection on the back surface of the scanning mirror where the rays are colinearly directed toward a lens and then imaged onto the linear array in the focal plane.

There are few published studies on the anatomical variability of teak wood from East Timor. The wood anatomical characterization and its within-tree variation were studied in three axial and radial positions of trees from an unmanaged pure stand. The wood is semi-ring-porous to ring-porous.

40|$|The {{architecture}} of inflorescence {{refers to the}} spatio-temporal arrangement of flowers on the reproductive branches. Flowering plants have evolved great diversity in such branching systems. Among which, the showy capitulum type inflorescence in the large Compositae (Asteraceae) species {{is regarded as a}} prerequisite factor for their wide spreading around the world. Different from the simple raceme and cyme, capitulum compresses hundreds of individual florets on its receptacle, but overall resembles a single, solitary flower. The ontogeny of capitulum also bears resemblance to a single flower, with regard to the meristem determinacy, floral sequence and histological configurations. Recent molecular studies have revealed that a plant specific transcription factor LEAFY (LFY), is required for both the floral initiation and floral patterning, the two essential steps to form an inflorescence. 			 The thesis elaborates Gerbera hybrida as a model to elucidate functions of the LFY ortholog during the development of inflorescence/flower in a capitulum background. In addition to the conserved functions in regulating floral meristem identity and floral patterning, three specified functions were revealed by transgenic Gerbera with down-regulated expression of GhLFY. Firstly, GhLFY is involved in the regulating the floral initiation of <b>marginal</b> <b>ray</b> florets. Down regulation of GhLFY resulted the <b>marginal</b> <b>ray</b> florets revert into a branching patterm that shown on the capitulum of Calyceraceae, the close relatives of Asteraceae. Secondly, the determinacy of IM is disrupted when GhLFY loses its functions, suggesting that GhLFY may function at both the flower and inflorescence interfaces. Thirdly, different flower types show specific responses to GhLFY down-regulation in floral patterning, indicating that there exist a potential genetic gradient among different flower types. At protein level, the LFY functions are specified by formation of versatile protein complexes with its transcriptional co-regulators. In Gerbera, GhLFY proteins tend to form homodimers and they were also capable to interact with a conserved transcriptional co-regulator, the UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) ortholog GhUFO. Taken advantage of the forward Y 2 H library screening, 6 additional proteins were identified to interact with GhLFY, including several novel potential co-regulators of LFY that has not yet been identified in other species. Additionally, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC) was optimized to verify the GhLFY self-interaction in planta...|$|E
40|$|QC 351 A 7 no. 40 The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} to what extent a constant spectral response can be obtained for wide-passband interference filters used with wide -angle lenses. We investigated the possibility of using the curvature of the lens surfaces to reduce the shift in the filter passband for large field angles and found that locating the filter on the proper surface will considerably reduce the shift of the passband. Specifically, we determined the distribution of angles of incidence for full aperture pencils incident at several field angles on the second and fourth surfaces of the 90 ° Geocon IV, the 90 ° Paxar, and the 125 ° Pleogon. We then calculated the spectral transmittance of each lens when a wide passband interference filter was located on its second or fourth surface. We also calculated the degree of polarization introduced. From the cases considered, we found that the tracing of an upper and lower <b>marginal</b> (rim) <b>ray</b> at maximum field angle is sufficient to determine the suitability of a surface, the criterion being that, the smaller the angle of incidence at the surface, the better. In addition, we found that, with the filter on the second surface of the Paxar, spectral transmittance changes with field angle were negligible and the modulation due to polarization was about 1...|$|R
40|$|Several key {{processes}} in plant development are regulated by TCP transcription factors. CYCLOIDEA-like (CYC-like) TCP domain proteins {{have been shown}} to control flower symmetry in distantly related plant lineages. Gerbera hybrida, a member of one of the largest clades of angiosperms, the sunflower family (Asteraceae), is an interesting model for developmental studies because its elaborate inflorescence comprises different types of flowers that have specialized structures and functions. The morphological differentiation of flower types involves gradual changes in flower size and symmetry that follow the radial organization of the densely packed inflorescence. Differences in the degree of petal fusion further define the distinct shapes of the Gerbera flower types. To study the role of TCP transcription factors during specification of this complex inflorescence organization, we characterized the CYC-like homolog GhCYC 2 from Gerbera. The expression of GhCYC 2 follows a gradient along the radial axis of the inflorescence. GhCYC 2 is expressed in the <b>marginal,</b> bilaterally symmetrical <b>ray</b> flowers but not in the centermost disk flowers, which are nearly radially symmetrical and have significantly less fused petals. Overexpression of GhCYC 2 causes disk flowers to obtain morphologies similar to ray flowers. Both expression patterns and transgenic phenotypes suggest that GhCYC 2 is involved in differentiation among Gerbera flower types, providing the first molecular evidence that CYC-like TCP factors take part in defining the complex inflorescence structure of the Asteraceae, a major determinant of the family's evolutionary success...|$|R

Fish were promptly returned to the laboratory and held in 1, 300 -L recirculating tanks at 21 - 26 °C. After a minimum recovery time of 48 h, individual fish were placed in a 1, 000 -L, Brett-type swim tunnel, {{and their ability to}} maintain station in flowing water by swimming, skimming, or substrate appression was tested by subjecting fish to increasing speeds beginning at 10 cm/s.

Fin ray removal had no significant effect on critical station-holding speed (CSHS).

Measurements used full-beam and laser injection methods at wavelengths between 0. 4 and 0. 8 microns on 17 meter lengths of Polymicro FBP 300 and 400 micron core fiber. Full-beam injection probed input focal-ratios between f/ 3 and f/ 13. 5, while laser injection {{allowed us to}} isolate FRD at discrete injection angles up to 17 degrees (f/ 1. 6 <b>marginal</b> <b>ray).</b> We find (1) FRD effects decrease as grit size decreases, with the largest gains in beam quality occurring at grit sizes above 5 microns; (2) total throughput increases as grit size decreases, reaching 90 % at 790 nm with the finest polishing levels; (3) total throughput is higher at redder wavelengths for coarser polishing grit, indicating surface-scattering as {{the primary source of}} loss. We also quantify the angular dependence of FRD as a function of polishing level.

40|$|Stems of Ipomoea obscura Ker Gawl., {{increase}} in thickness by forming multiple rings of cambia. Stems 5 - 6 mm thick produce parenchymatous derivatives which divide repeatedly to form small arcs of cambium. Several such small arcs initiate simultaneously {{and form a}} ring of small cambial arcs. After {{the formation of a}} few xylem and phloem elements, all these arcs are interconnected by transdifferentiation of parenchyma cells present between the cambial arcs and constitute a complete cambial cylinder. This newly formed cambium is functionally bidirectional: earlier- formed arcs produce xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally, while later-formed segments exclusively produce thin-walled parenchyma cells on either side. Young stems are circular in cross section but as stem thickness increases they become oval to elliptic or lobed and dumbbell-shaped. Xylem rays are mostly uni- or biseriate and thin-walled, but multiseriate rays characteristic for a climbing habit are observed occasionally. In thick stems, the <b>marginal</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma in most of the samples becomes meristematic and develops ray cambia which exclusively produce sieve elements.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the formation of successive rings of cambia in Rivea hypocriteriformis Choisy (Convolvulaceae). The mature stem is composed of four to five rings of xylem alternating with phloem. Successive cambia originate as smaller and larger segments; union and anastomosing of small cambial segments often leads {{to the formation of}} discontinuous rings. In the initial stage of growth, several vascular bundles interconnect to form the first ring of vascular cambium. The cambium remains functional for one complete season and becomes dormant during summer; a new ring of cambium is completed prior to the subsequent monsoon season and sprouting of new leaves. Successive cambia are initiated from the pericyclic parenchyma situated three to four cell layers outside of the protophloem. Functionally, all the successive cambia are bidirectional and produce secondary xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally. The secondary xylem is diffuse-porous, with indistinct growth rings and consisting of wide fibriform vessels, fibre tracheids, and axial and ray parenchyma cells. The xylem rays are uni- to multiseriate and heterocellular. The multiseriate rays contain lignified <b>marginal</b> <b>ray</b> cells and thin-walled, unlignified central cells. The central ray cells also show accumulations of starch and druses. Discrete strands of intraxylary phloem occur at the periphery of the pith, and additional intraxylary phloem develops from adjacent cells as secondary growth progresses.

40|$|Designing an {{adaptive}} optics (AO) system for extremely large telescopes (ELT's) will present new optical engineering challenges. Several of these challenges are {{addressed in this}} work, including first-order design of multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) systems, pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFS's), and laser guide star (LGS) spot elongation. MCAO systems need to be designed in consideration of various constraints, including deformable mirror size and correction height. The y,ȳ method of first-order optical design is a graphical technique that uses a plot with <b>marginal</b> and chief <b>ray</b> heights as coordinates; the optical system is represented as a segmented line. This method is {{shown to be a}} powerful tool in designing MCAO systems. From these analyses, important conclusions about configurations are derived. PWFS's, which offer an alternative to Shack-Hartmann (SH) wavefront sensors (WFS's), are envisioned as the workhorse of layer-oriented adaptive optics. Current approaches use a 4 -faceted glass pyramid to create a WFS analogous to a quad-cell SH WFS. PWFS's and SH WFS's are compared and some newly-considered similarities and PWFS advantages are presented. Techniques to extend PWFS's are offered: First, PWFS's can be extended to more pixels in the image by tiling pyramids contiguously. Second, pyramids, which are difficult to manufacture, can be replaced by less expensive lenslet arrays. An approach is outlined to convert existing SH WFS's to PWFS's for easy evaluation of PWFS's. Also, a demonstration of PWFS's in sensing varying amounts of an aberration is presented. For ELT's, the finite altitude and finite thickness of LGS's means that the LGS will appear elongated from the viewpoint of subapertures not directly under the telescope. Two techniques for dealing with LGS spot elongation in SH WFS's are presented. One method assumes that the laser will be pulsed and uses a segmented micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) to track the LGS light subaperture by subaperture as the light is returned from the upward-propagating laser pulse. A second method can be used if the laser is not pulsed. A lenslet array is described which creates "pixels" which are aligned with the axes of the elongated spot of each subaperture, without requiring special charge-coupled devices (CCD's) ...|$|R

Ghosts can reduce contrast, provide misleading information, and if severe can veil parts of the nominal image. This dissertation develops several methodologies to simulate ghost effects arising from an even number of light reflections between the surfaces of multi-element lens systems. We present an algorithm to generate the ghost layout that is generated by two, four and up to N (even) reflections.

40|$|In several eudicots, {{including}} {{members of}} the Asteraceae family, the CYCLOIDEA (CYC) genes, which belong to the TCP class of transcription factors, are key players for floral symmetry. The sunflower inflorescence is heterogamous (radiate capitulum) with sterile monosymmetric ray flowers located in the outermost whorl of the inflorescence and hermaphrodite polysymmetric disk flowers. In inflorescence of Heliantheae tribe, flower primordia development initiates from the <b>marginal</b> <b>ray</b> flowers while disk flowers develop later in an acropetal fashion in organized parastichies along a number found {{to be one of}} Fibonacci patterns. Mutants for inflorescence morphology can provide information on the role of CYC-like genes in radiate capitulum evolution. The tubular ray flower (turf) mutant of sunflower shows hermaphrodite ray flowers with a nearly polysymmetric tubular-like corolla. Here, we demonstrate that this mutation is caused by the insertion in the TCP motif of a sunflower CYC-like gene (HaCYC 2 c) of non-autonomous transposable element (TE), belonging to the CACTA superfamily of transposons. We named this element Transposable element of turf 1 (Tetu 1). The Tetu 1 insertion changes the reading frame of turf-HaCYC 2 c for the encoded protein and leads to a premature stop codon. Although in Tetu 1 a transposase gene is lacking, our results clearly suggest that it is an active TE. The excision of Tetu 1 restores the wild type phenotype or generates stable mutants. Co-segregation and sequence analysis in progenies of F 2 and self-fertilized plants derived from reversion of turf to wild type clearly identify HaCYC 2 c as a key regulator of ray flowers symmetry. Also, HaCYC 2 c loss-of-function promotes the developmental switch from sterile to hermaphrodite flowers, revealing a novel and unexpected role for a CYC-like gene in the repression of female organs...|$|E
