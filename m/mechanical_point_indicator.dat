The <b>point</b> <b>indicators</b> consist of a light on a black, circular background. A steady white light indicates that the weighted points are set for the train to enter the left-hand line of the two railway lines, while a flashing white light (rarely seen) indicates that the weighted points are set for the train to enter the right-hand line of the two railway lines. Exceptionally, no light illuminated either indicates that the weighted points are incorrectly set for either light-hand or right-hand train movements, or {{that there is some}} power or mechanical failure with the <b>point</b> <b>indicators.</b> These <b>point</b> <b>indicators</b> are normally inactive, only becoming active (illuminating) when a train passes a detection module, located on the track further back from the station than the <b>point</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|R

40|$|Transducers for {{impact force}} and <b>mechanical</b> <b>point</b> {{impedance}} are studied. In {{both cases the}} transducers are based on resistive strain measurement. Two prototypes of impact force transducers based on different concepts of mean strain measurement are developed and tested. The results are satisfactory and show that the suggested concepts are suitable. The transducer for <b>mechanical</b> <b>point</b> impedance is based on strain measurement at two points along a linearly elastic rod which acts as a wave guide for longitudinal waves. One end of the rod is {{in contact with the}} object while the other end is excited by impact. Tests are conducted on attached cylindrical rods as well as on unattached beams. The performance of the transducer is generally good.

In this paper, we focus on the acceleration cycle in the euro area, namely the peaks and troughs of the growth rate which delimitate the slowdown and acceleration phases of the economy. Our aim is twofold: First, we put forward a reference turning point chronology of this cycle on a monthly basis, based on gross domestic product and industrial production index. We consider both euro area aggregate level and country specific cycles for the six main countries of the zone. Second, we {{come up with a new}} turning <b>point</b> <b>indicator,</b> based on business surveys carefully watched by central banks and short-term analysts, in order to follow in real-time the fluctuations of the acceleration cycle.

40|$|In {{order to}} compute a highly {{accurate}} statistical rate constant for the CO 2 + O+ reaction, {{it is necessary}} to first calculate the potential energy of the system at many different geometric configurations. Quantum mechanical calculations are very time-consuming, making it difficult to obtain a sufficient number to allow for accurate interpolation. The number of quantum mechanical calculations required can be significantly reduced by using known relations in classical physics to calculate energy for configurations where the oxygen is relatively far from the CO 2. A chi-squared fit to quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>points</b> is obtained for these configurations, and the resulting parameters are used to generate an equation for the potential energy. This equation, combined with an interpolated set of quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>points</b> to give the potential energy for configurations where the molecules are closer together, allows all configurations to be calculated accurately and efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{effects on}} the {{retrieval}} quality of image restoration and error-correcting codes are investigated from statistical <b>mechanical</b> <b>point</b> of view. We introduce the transverse field as a quantum fluctuation into the Hamiltonian and adjust this to the optimal value so that the overlap takes its maximum. Our main goal is to investigate {{to what extent the}} quality is improved by the quantum fluctuation in comparison with the thermal one. We introduce infinite range spin model as an exactly solvable example and calculate the quality explicitly. At low temperature and small transverse field, we find that the quality is dramatically improved. These analytical results are supported by quantum Monte Carlo simulation in 2 dimension. 1. INTRODUCTION Recently, the problems of information science were investigated from statistical <b>mechanical</b> <b>point</b> of view.

40|$|Hypothesis: Bone {{conduction}} implant (BCI) {{attached with}} a flat surface contact will offer efficient and linear vibration transmission over time. Background: Despite that percutaneous bone conduction devices (PBCD) are successful in treating patients with conductive hearing loss, there are some drawbacks related to the need of a permanent skin penetration. The BCI system is designed {{as an alternative to}} the PBCD because it leaves the skin intact. Methods: BCI dummy implants were installed in 3 sheep skulls in vivo to study the vibration transmission characteristics over time. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>point</b> impedances and vibration transfer response functions of the BCI implants were measured at the time of surgery and after a healing period of 8 months. Results: In 1 sheep both implants healed without complications. In the other 2 sheep, the implants were either partially loose or lost to follow up. In the sheep with stable implants, it was found by the resonance frequency shift of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>point</b> impedance that a firmer integration between the implant and bone tissue as seen in osseointegrated surfaces developed over time. It was also shown that the transcranial vibration transmission remains stable and linear. Providing bone chips in the contact between the implant and the bone did not enhance vibration transmission. The surgical procedure for installing the BCI dummy implants was uneventful. Conclusion: The <b>mechanical</b> <b>point</b> impedances and vibration transfer response functions indicate that the BCI implants integrate and that transmission conditions remain stable over time...|$|R
