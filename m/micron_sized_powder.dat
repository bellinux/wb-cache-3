40|$|In recent years, nanostructured and {{amorphous}} metals {{have become}} more prominent in scientific research. Their unique characteristics and their vastly superior mechanical properties have lead to emerging technical applications however {{the use of these}} materials is only in its infancy. To further growth the industrial applications for these advanced materials, joining processes capable of maintaining the unique aspects of the microstructure are required. Joining of two beveled plates has been accomplished by use of the Cold Spray process. This process uses a converging diverging nozzle to accelerate <b>micron</b> <b>sized</b> <b>powder</b> towards a substrate. The strength of the resulting joint has been compared to freeforms made of powder of the same composition. No significant difference was observed in the mechanical properties between the freeforms and the weldments and examination of the fracture surface showed that the strength of the interface is higher than the strength of the freeform itself. A weld repair experiment has also been performed where the ElectroSpark Deposition process (ESD) has successfully been used to transfer amorphous material from an electrode to an amorphous substrate without crystallizing either material. This result is of crucial importance as it signifies that these extremely expensive and heat sensitive materials can be repaired when in-service wear causes damage. This process, due to its inherently fast cooling rate, has also successfully been used to transform a crystalline AlCoCe alloy into an amorphous deposit atop both amorphous and crystalline substrates...|$|E

40|$|A {{quantitative}} analysis of variations in granule microstructure based upon changes in primary particle size and bed preparation is presented. The granule microstructures are obtained using X-Ray Computed Tomography (XRCT). An algorithm is developed {{to measure the}} number and size of macro-voids (pore space with volume equivalent size {{greater than or equal}} to 30  μm or 3 times the primary particle size). Four size fractions of alumina, ranging in primary particle size from 0. 5  μm to 108  μm, are sieved using three different sieve sizes to create static powder beds from which single-droplet granules are produced. The analysis shows that large macro-voids exist in ultra-fine powders (0. 1 – 10  μm). The macro-voids take up to 7 % of the granule volume and the largest macro-voids are 200 – 700  μm in volume equivalent size. Changing the sieve preparation changes the size and total volume of macro-voids. In contrast, there are very few macro-voids in granules formed from coarser powders.

It was seen that changing the size of bulk silver, the temperature of reaction, the amount of oxygen, the concentration of PVP and its molecular weight all had an important influence in the synthesis of nanoparticles. Different morphologies could be obtained when these parameters were adjusted ranging from spheres to triangles and hexagons. A complex mechanism is proposed: during the first step, bulk silver is oxidized by oxygen in solution, forming {{a thin layer of}} oxidized silver on the surface. Then, PVP acts as a reducing agent at the oxidized surface, where silver becomes Ag⁰ again. At the same time that PVP reduces the oxidized silver back to metallic silver; it coordinates with the silver atoms acting as a protecting agent. That coordination between PVP and silver pulls out the atoms and produces a detachment of silver atoms from the bulk surface.

The magnetoimpedance, MI (change of impedance of a ferromagnet on application of a field) in 3 -layered structures consisting of two magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic conductive layer has been predicted to show high MI. In many cases the experimental values of MI effect are smaller than the theoretical predictions. Therefore, more careful characterization of the samples is a must. Accordingly, the first part of the present research deals with a ferromagnetic resonance, FMR, study of thin films and multilayers containing Fe 20 Ni 80 layered nanocomponents. The second system proposed for ferromagnetic resonance study consists of Co/GdCo multilayers prepared by rf-sputtering.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Micron and nano-phase diamond powders were doped with boron in order to change their various chemical properties. Diamond possesses several technologically important properties including extreme hardness, high electrical resistance, chemical inertness, high thermal conductivity, high electron hole mobilities, and optical transparency. Boron-doping of diamond powders via Thermal Diffusion Process was used in this study. Natural boron contains 80. 1 % ¹¹B and 19. 9 % ¹⁰B. ¹⁰B has large neutron capture cross section with the reaction ¹⁰B(n, [alpha]) ⁷Li. The energy release in the reaction is rather high (2. 71 MeV), facilitating radiation defects in the sample. The introduction of boron atoms also changed the structure and properties of the diamond powder including resistance to oxidation. Following doping with boron, the diamond powders were irradiated by thermal neutrons by fluence values of 3 x 10 ¹⁵, and 4. 3 x 10 ¹⁸ n/cm² at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR). The creation of micro-porous structure in diamond powders for storage of hydrogen is discussed. Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis was used to determine the concentration of boron in the diamond powder. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) were also employed to study the morphology and structure of the diamond particles. Raman spectroscopy showed that glassy and microcrystalline carbon structures were formed on irradiation. A significant amount of boron was diffused into both nano and <b>micron</b> <b>size</b> diamond <b>powders.</b> The boron concentration before and after irradiation suggested that about 35 % ¹⁰B interacted with neutrons. Hydrogen was diffused into both <b>micron</b> and nano <b>size</b> diamond <b>powder</b> before and after boron-doping, and also after irradiation on to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technique for enhancement of hydrogen storage capacity of diamond powders. Hydrogen storage capacity of undoped-nontreated <b>micron</b> <b>size</b> diamond <b>powder</b> was 0. 51 wt% H₂. Hydrogen storage capacity of diamond power when treated in hydrogen plasma was about 1. 47 wt% H₂. Surprisingly hydrogen was not detected in boron-doped, irradiated diamond powders by PGNAA. One of the reasons could be the sample amount since the lower limit of detection of total H₂ by PGNAA is 3. 93 ug/g of sample. The Raman spectrum showed the existence of CH bonds suggesting the presence of hydrogen in the sample...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} drawback for {{the application}} of magnesium wrought alloys is the limited formability of semifinished products that arises from a strong texture formation during thermomechanical treatment. The ability of second phase particles embedded into the metal matrix to alter this texture evolution is of great interest. Therefore, the fabrication of particle modified magnesium alloys (particle content 0. 5 – 1 wt. -%) by gravity die casting has been studied. Five different types of <b>micron</b> <b>sized</b> ceramic <b>powders</b> (AlN, MgB 2, MgO, SiC, and ZrB 2) have been investigated to identify applicable particles for the modification. Agglomeration of the particles is revealed to be the central problem for the fabrication process. The main factors that influence the agglomerate size are the particle size and the intensity of melt stirring. Concerning handling, chemical stability in the Mg-Al-Zn alloy system, settling and wetting in the melt, and formation of the microstructure in most cases, the investigated powders show satisfying properties. However, SiC is chemically unstable in aluminum containing alloys. The high density of ZrB 2 causes large particles to settle subsequent to stirring resulting in an inhomogeneous distribution of the particles over the cast billet...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A vehicle flying at hypersonic speeds, i. e. at speeds greater than Mach 4, {{needs to be able}} to withstand the heat arising from friction and shock waves, which can reach temperatures of up to 3000 oC. The current project focuses on producing thermal protection systems based on ultra high temperature ceramic (UHTC) impregnated carbon-carbon composites. The carbon fibres offer low mass and excellent resistance to thermal shock; their vulnerability is to oxidation above 500 oC. The aim of introducing HfB 2, a UHTC, as a coating on the fibre tows or as particulate reinforcement into the carbon fibre preform, was to improve this property. The objectives of this project were to: i) identify a low temperature synthesis route for group IV diborides, ii) produce a powder fine enough to reduce the difficulties associated with sintering the refractory diborides, iii) develop sol-gel coating of HfB 2 onto carbon fibre tows iv) improve the solid loading of the particulate reinforcement into the carbon fibre preform, which should, in turn, increase the oxidation protection. In order to achieve the above set objectives, fine HfB 2 powder was synthesized through a low temperature sol gel and boro/carbothermal reduction process, using a range of different carbon sources. Study of the formation mechanism of HfB 2 revealed an intermediate boron sub-oxide and/or active boron formation that yielded HfB 2 formation at 1300 oC. At higher temperatures the formation of HfB 2 could be via intermediate HfC formation and/or B 4 C formation. Growth mechanism analysis showed that the nucleated particles possessed screw dislocations which indicated that the formation of HfB 2 was not only through a substitution reaction, but there could have been an element of a precipitation nucleation mechanism that lead to anisotropic growth under certain conditions. The effect of carbon sources during the boro/carbothermal reduction reaction on the size of the final HfB 2 powders was analysed and it was found that a direct relation existed between the size and level of agglomeration of the carbon sources and the resulting HfB 2 powders. A powder phenolic resin source led to the finest <b>powder,</b> with particle <b>sizes</b> in the range 30 to 150 nm. SPS sintering of the powder revealed that 99 % theoretical density could be achieved without the need for sintering aids at 2200 oC. Sol-gel coatings and slurry impregnation of HfB 2 on carbon fibres tows was performed using dip coating and a ‘squeeze–tube’ method respectively. Crack free coatings and non-porous matrix infiltration were successfully achieved. The solid loading of the fine HfB 2 into the carbon fibre preform was carried out through impregnation of a HfB 2 / phenolic resin / acetone slurry using vacuum impregnation. Although the sub-micron Loughborough (LU) powders were expected to improve the solid loading, compared to the commercially available <b>micron</b> <b>sized</b> <b>powders,</b> due to the slurry made from them having a higher viscosity because of the fine particle size, the solids loading achieved was consequently decreased. Optimisation of the rheology of the slurry with LU HfB 2 still requires more work. A comparison of the oxidation and ablation resistance of the Cf-HfB 2 composites prepared with both commercial <b>micron</b> <b>sized</b> HfB 2 <b>powder</b> and Loughborough sub-micron <b>sized</b> HfB 2 <b>powder,</b> each with similar level of solid loading, was carried out using oxyacetylene torch testing. It was found that the composite containing the finer, Loughborough powders suffered a larger erosion volume than the composite with the coarser commercial powders indicating that the former offered worse ablation and oxidation resistance than the latter. A full investigation of the effect of solids loading and particle size, including the option of using mixtures of fine and coarse powders, is still required...|$|R

The impact of the primary particle size (0. 3, 0. 6 and 1 μm) and the added amount of doping agent (0. 065 and 0. 195 vol. %) on the optimized formulation of the suspensions were investigated. The results indicated that the solid content had to be decreased as the primary particle size was reduced. The highest solid content for the suspension of 1 μm powder was 70 % (with 0. 3 wt% dispersant) whereas, it reached to 50 wt% (with 0. 2 wt% dispersant) for the suspension of 0. 3 μm powder. Moreover, it was found that any solid content more than the optimized amount resulted into huge irregular, rod shaped and elongated structures whereas any dispersant amount more than the optimized amount ended into donut-shaped or spherical granules with the blow holes on their external surface.

A <b>micron</b> <b>sized</b> (µ) WC-metal <b>powder</b> (86 % WC 10 % Co 4 % Cr) was coated onto a substrate surface using HVOF thermal spraying, and the coating was heat treated by a CO 2 laser. With the HVOF coating of the powder onto the substrate, the surface hardness of substrate increased approximately 300 % from 399 Hv to 1260 ± 30 Hv, and further increase of approximately 40 % from 1260 ± 30 Hv to 1820 ± 100 Hv by laser heating the coating for 0. 6 s. Porosity of coating decreased {{more than five times}} from 2. 2 ± 0. 3 % to 0. 4 ± 0. 1 % by laser heating. According to the reciprocating sliding test, friction and wear behavior of coating improved by coating for both sliding surface temperature of 25 ºC and 450 ºC. Therefore, the HVOF coating and laser heat treatment of coating are recommended for the durability improvement of turbo shaft materials. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, the {{advantages}} of liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis (LF-FSP) process in producing nanoparticles (NPs) as well as processing the produced NPs to ceramic/polymer nanocomposite films and high density polycrystalline ceramic films are demonstrated. The LF-FSP process aerosolizes alcohol solutions of metalloorganic precursors by oxygen and combusts them at > 1500 °C. The combustion products are rapidly quenched (~ 10 s of ms) to < 400 °C, producing NPs with the same compositions {{as those of the}} precursor solutions. The high specific surface areas of NPs enable formulation of ceramic/polymer/interface(phase) ternary nanocomposites in which the interphase can be the determining factor of the final net properties. In ceramic processing, NPs show increased sinterability and provide access to small average grain sizes with fine control of microstructures, compared to when <b>micron</b> <b>sized</b> <b>powders</b> are used. Therefore, synthesis, processing, and characterization of NPs, NP derived nanocomposites and ceramic monoliths are of great interest. We first compare the LF-FSP to commercial FSP process by producing fumed silica. Combusting spirocyclic alkoxysilanes or Si(OEt) 4 by LF-FSP process produced fumed silica very similar to SiCl 4 derived products. Given LF-FSP approach does not require the containment constraints of the SiCl 4 process and precursors are synthesized from rice hull ash, the reported approach represents a sustainable, green and potentially lower cost alternative. We then show the versatility of NPs in formulating flexible ceramic/polymer nanocomposites (BaTiO 3 /epoxy) with superior properties. Volume fractions of the BaTiO 3 filler and composite film thicknesses were controlled to adjust the net dielectric constant and the capacitance. Measured net dielectric constants further deviated from theory, with increasing solids loadings, due to NP agglomeration. Wound nanocomposite capacitors showed ten times higher capacitance compared to the commercial counterpart. Following series of studies explore the use of flame made NPs in processing Li+ conducting membranes. Systematic doping studies were conducted in the LiTi 2 (PO 4) 3 system to modify the lattice constant, conduction channel width, and sintering behavior by introducing Al 3 + and Si 4 + dopants. Excess Li 2 O content was also adjusted to observe its effect on final microstructures and phase compositions. Improved densification rates were found in Li 1. 7 Al 0. 3 Ti 1. 7 Si 0. 4 P 2. 6 O 12 composition and thin films (52 ± 1 µm) with conductivities of 0. 3 - 0. 5 mS cm- 1 were achieved. Li 6. 25 M 0. 25 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (M = Al 3 +, Ga 3 +) thin films (25 - 28 µm) with conductivities of 0. 2 - 1. 3 mS cm- 1 were also successfully processed using flame made NPs, overcoming processing challenges extant, resulting in significantly reduced energy input required for densification. Heating schedules, sintering atmospheres, and types of substrates were controlled to observe their effect on the sintering behavior. Furthermore, green film thicknesses were found to be a crucial variable determining the final microstructures and phase compositions due to the varying Li 2 O loss rates with change in thicknesses (surface/volume ratios). Using fully decomposed NP mixtures (Li 2 CO 3 /off-stoichiometric La 2 Zr 2 O 7), as obtained by LF-FSP, provides an ideal approach to use high surface/reaction energy and liquid phase sintering to drive densification...|$|R

40|$|Interstitial {{carbides}} and nitrides {{of early}} transition metals in Groups IV-VI exhibit platinum-like behavior {{which makes them}} a promising candidate to replace noble metals {{in a wide variety}} of reactions. Most synthetic methods used to prepare these materials lead to bulk or <b>micron</b> <b>size</b> <b>powder</b> which limits their use in reactions in particular in catalytic applications. Attempts toward the production of transition metal carbide and nitride nanoparticles in a sustainable, simple and cheap manner have been rapidly increasing. In this thesis, a new approach was presented to prepare nano-scale transition metal carbides and nitrides of group IV-VI with a size as small as 3 nm through the reaction of transition metal precursor with mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C 3 N 4) that not only provides confined spaces for nanoparticles formation but also acts as a chemical source of nitrogen and carbon. The produced nanoparticles were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reaction with mass spectroscopy (MS), CHN elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), nitrogen sorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The effects of the reaction temperature, the ratio of the transition metal precursor to the reactive template (mpg-C 3 N 4), and the selection of the carrier gas (Ar, N 2, and NH 3) on the resultant crystal phases and structures were investigated. The results indicated that different tantalum phases with cubic structure, TaN, Ta 2 CN, and TaC, can be formed under a flow of nitrogen by changing the reaction temperatures. Two forms of tantalum nitride, namely TaN and Ta 3 N 5, were selectively formed under N 2 and NH 3 flow, respectively. Significantly, the formation of TaC, Ta 2 CN, and TaN can be controlled by altering the weight ratio of the C 3 N 4 template relative to the Ta precursor at 1573 K under a flow of nitrogen where high C 3 N 4 /Ta precursor ratio generally resulted in high carbide content rather than nitride. In addition, the reactivity of the transition metals of group IV-VI with the reactive template was investigated under a flow of N 2 at different temperatures in the range of 1023 to 1573 K while keeping the weight ratio constant at 1 : 1. The results show that Ti, V, Nb, Ta, and Cr reacted with mpg-C 3 N 4 at 1023 K to form nitride phase with face centered cubic structure. The nitride phase destabilized at higher temperature ≥ 1223 K through the reaction with the remaining carbon residue originated from the decomposition of the template to form carbonitride and carbide phases. Whereas, Mo and W produce a hexagonal structure of carbide irrespective of the applying reaction temperature. The tendency to form transition metal nitrides and carbides at 1023 K was strongly driven by the free energy of formation. The observed trend indicates that the free energy of formation of nitride is relatively lower for group IV and V transition metals, whereas the carbide phase is thermodynamically more favorable for group VI, in particular for Mo and W. The thermal stability of nitride decreases at high temperature due to the evolution of nitrogen gas. The electrocatalytic activities of the produced nanoparticles were tested for hydrogen evolution reaction in acid media and the results demonstrated that molybdenum carbide nanoparticles exhibited the highest HER current with over potential of 100 mV vs. RHE, among the samples prepared in this study. This result is attributed to the sufficiently small particle size (8 nm on average) and accordingly high surface area (308 m 2 g- 1). Also, the graphitized carbon layer with a thickness of 1 nm on its surface formed by this synthesis provides excellent electron pathway to the catalyst which will improve the rate of electron transfer reaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{energetic}} materials Si/Polytetrafluoroethylene/Viton (SiTV) and Al/Polytetrafluoroethylene/Viton (AlTV) have drawn interest recently {{due to the}} increased availability and decreased cost of nano materials. The reactivity of aluminum based {{energetic materials}} is greatly enhanced {{with the use of}} nanometric reactants. Silicon sees order of magnitude increases in burning rate when nano silicon is used in place of <b>micron</b> <b>sized</b> silicon. A broad characterization of the combustion of these composites has been undertaken. Theoretical equilibrium calculations have been performed, as well as characterization of combustion in the instrumented burn tube at various mixture ratios, and pressed pellet burns at different mixture ratios and applied pressures. A comparison of two morphologically different Al materials was also carried out using the instrumented burn tube. ^ Spectroscopic measurements were made of deflagrating SiTV and AlTV pellets. High-speed images were also recorded, and the synchronization of these with the emission spectra provided details the macro scale combustion behavior. Time dependent emission intensity was caused by growing product layers {{on the surface of the}} pellets. Temperatures for each mixture ratio were measured by emission spectroscopy and used as input to three simple combustion models. The Ward, Son, and Brewster model (WSB), the Koch model, and the Williams model were applied to AlTV combustion. The modeling results provided further support of the non constant pressure exponent theory, i. e., that AlTV burns in a transition region between a coupled flame and a condensed phase controlled reaction, resulting in pressure exponents that increase with pressure. ^ <b>Micron</b> <b>sized</b> doped silicon <b>powders</b> were manufactured by ball milling commercially obtained doped silicon wafers. Four powders using different dopants and dopant concentrations were manufactured. These powders were characterized to determine their average particle size, specific surface area, crystalline content, and electrical and thermal properties. The effect of the doping on combustion was investigated by way of pressed pellet burning rate measurements. The burning rate was found to correlate with dopant concentration, regardless of the dopant type. It is proposed that the doping effect can be explained by increased electron mobility or increased lattice defects, both of which are proportional to dopant concentration. ...|$|R
