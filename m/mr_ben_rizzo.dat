6000|$|The {{consequence}} of this almost childish carelessness was that Gibson had always to be accompanied on his long journeys either by a friend or a courier. While <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ben</b> lived, he usually took his brother in charge to some extent; and the relation between them was mutual, for while John Gibson found the sculpture, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ben</b> found the learning, so that Gibson used often to call him [...] "my classical dictionary." [...] In 1847, however, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ben</b> was taken ill. He got a bad cold, and would have no doctor, take no medicine. [...] "I consider Mr. Ben," [...] his brother writes, [...] "as {{one of the most}} amiable of human beings--too good for this world--but he will take no care against colds, and when ill he is a stubborn animal." [...] That summer Gibson went again to England, and when, he came back found <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ben</b> no better. For four years the younger brother lingered on, and in 1851 died suddenly from the effects of a fall in walking. Gibson was thus left quite alone, but for his pupil Miss Hosmer, who became to him more than a daughter.|$|R

And here <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ben</b> Allen, who {{was not at the}} moment {{extraordinarily}} sober, added the word 'Arabella,' in what {{was meant to be a}} whisper, but which was an especially audible and distinct tone of speech which nobody could avoid hearing, if anybody were so disposed.|$|R

The whole party went silent and supperless to bed; and Mr. Pickwick thought, just before he fell asleep, that if he had known Mr. Winkle, senior, had been quite so much of a man of business, it was extremely probable he might never have waited upon him, on such an errand.|$|R
