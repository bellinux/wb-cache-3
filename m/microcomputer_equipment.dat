Examined in this survey research were relationships between the amount of use elementary school principals and their secretaries (n = 189 pairs) make of microcomputers for 36 specific applications organized within four administrative purposes categories [...] record keeping, correspondence and communications, monitoring student progress, and other building management [...] and the principals' perceptions of the actual and ideal importance of 51 administrative tasks organized within six general task area categories [...] instruction and curriculum development, pupil personnel, staff personnel, community-school leadership, financial-physical resources, and additional administrative concerns. Relationships were further analyzed by selected demographic variables. It was found that there was very little heavy use of microcomputers by elementary school principals and their secretaries and very little significance relating principal/secretary microcomputer use and principals' perceptions of task importance. Implications of the study are that more <b>microcomputer</b> <b>equipment</b> should be placed in elementary school offices, additional microcomputer training and support for elementary school principals and their secretaries are needed, <b>microcomputer</b> <b>equipment</b> contributes to restructuring work relationships of elementary school principals and their secretaries, and the placement and utilization of <b>microcomputer</b> <b>equipment</b> in elementary school offices are in their early stages...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} increase in the use of computer based simulation modelling over the last decade. A development that has made a significant contribution to the popularity of the simulation approach is the availability of animation facilities. These facilities are usually part of simulation model development software and often do not require very expensive <b>microcomputer</b> <b>equipment.</b> Animation provides some significant advantages during most phases of a simulation modelling effort but also has some inherent dangers and pitfalls. The purpose of this paper is: to identify and discuss some of the more important advantages and disadvantages of animation, and to provide information about some of the available simulation model development software supporting animation capabilities...|$|E
40|$|JPL {{has been}} leading a {{concentrated}} {{effort to develop}} improved thermoelectric materials for space applications. Thermoelectric generators are an attractive source of electrical energy for space power {{because of lack of}} moving parts and slow degradation of performance. Thermoelectric material is characterized by: Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity. To measure the high temperature thermal conductivity is experimentally very difficult. However, it can be calculated from the specific heat and thermal diffusivity which are easier to measure at high temperatures, especially using the flash method. Data acquisition and analysis for this experiment were automated at JPL using inexpensive <b>microcomputer</b> <b>equipment.</b> This approach is superior to tedious and less accurate manual analysis of data. It is also preferred to previously developed systems utilizing expensive minicomputers or mainframes...|$|E

40|$|Respiratory {{heat loss}} has been {{proposed}} as a mechanism of exercise induced asthma. Whether the predominant stimulus is airway drying or cooling remains unclear. We have measured changes in FEV 1 after isocapnic cold air hyperventilation (CAH) (- 23. 4 degrees (SD 0. 43 degrees) C) and dry ambient air hyperventilation (AAH) (18. 7 degrees (0. 52 degrees) C) in seven asthmatic patients (mean age 31 (SD 9) years and baseline FEV 1 3. 2 (0. 9) 1) and in seven normal subjects (age 28 (6) years and FEV 1 3. 6 (0. 7) 1). The inspired water content in both cases was 0. 3 mg/l air. The rate of respiratory heat exchange per breath was calculated in watts (W) with <b>microcomputer</b> based <b>equipment.</b> Cold air hyperventilation caused a fall in FEV 1 almost twice that of ambient air hyperventilation at each level of ventilation: CAH v AAH (% fall) 8. 0 (5. 1) v 3. 9 (4. 0) at 15 l/min, 11. 6 (7. 8) v 7. 0 (4. 4) at 30 l/min, and 20. 7 (10. 9) v 12. 4 (6. 3) at 60 l/min. Identical latent heat loss (evaporative drying) was imposed on the airway during the two challenges. Sensible heat loss (convective cooling) in cold air hyperventilation was 41 W at 15 l/min, 63 W at 30 l/min, and 114 W at 60 l/min; whereas in ambient air hyperventilation the loss was 6, 13, and 23 W respectively. It is concluded {{that the rate of}} cooling of the upper airway is the predominant stimulus in hyperventilation induced asthma...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{historical}} development of mineral deposits exploitation which has very old history. Several thousands of years hid from us where and when people first began to extract minerals from the interior of the earth. With the development of human society the extraction of minerals has been increasing steadily. Nowadays the growth of extraction is accompanied by the deterioration of mining and geological conditions of mining operations, reducing mineralization in the deposit. As a result of intensive development mineral reserves located near the soil surface have changed significantly. Modern open-casts, open pits, and mines are highly productive and automated production complexes, including very extensive and diverse mining, various industrial buildings and facilities, the system of energy-mechanical equipment, automation and control with the use of <b>microcomputer</b> <b>equipment.</b> The paper describes a number of stages which modern mining in its development had passed and at which innovative breakthrough radically changed the place of the mineral sector in the society, and made the work of miners safer and more productive. For the systemization of {{the historical development of}} coal industry it is important to identify those technological breakthroughs that radically changed the technological and technical conditions of mining...|$|E
