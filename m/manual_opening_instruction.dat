The T3 did not contain many Samara parts however, using the Porsche 959's four-wheel drive system and a 3.6-litre Porsche flat-six. It was developed by French concessionaire Lada-Poch together with NAMI and the Tupolev aircraft factory. In the mid-1980s Lada developed its first ever convertible car on its own, then actually entering production and quickly exported to most European countries, called the Lada Natasha Cabriolet, a four-seater convertible {{that was based on}} the popular Samara 1300/1500 models with a <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> and closing canvas roof.

50|$|A {{polytunnel}} (also {{known as}} a polyhouse, hoop greenhouse or hoophouse, grow tunnel or high tunnel) is a tunnel made of polyethylene, usually semi-circular, square or elongated in shape. The interior heats up because incoming solar radiation from the sun warms plants, soil, and other things inside the building faster than heat can escape the structure. Air warmed by the heat from hot interior surfaces is retained in the building by the roof and wall. Temperature, humidity and ventilation can be controlled by equipment fixed in the polytunnel or by <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> and closing of flaps. Polytunnels are mainly used in temperate regions in similar ways to glass greenhouses and row covers. Besides the passive solar heating that every polytunnel provides, every variation of auxiliary heating (from hothouse heating through minimal heating to unheated houses) is represented in current practice. The nesting of row covers and low tunnels inside high tunnels is also common.|$|R

The mechanical model concerns the entire human skull (bony structure and sutures) as well as the jackscrew device; the latter transforms the <b>manual</b> <b>openings</b> into orthodontic forces usually applied to the two maxillary halves through the first premolars and first permanent molars, which are the support points of the appliance. A sensitivity analysis of an approximate finite element model is performed in order to investigate the influence of the model size, the influence of the degree of sutural ossification by assigning different mechanical properties to the sutures and the influence of bone relaxation concerning the effects of dentofacial orthopaedics. Moreover, a more accurate model including the aforementioned teeth and their periodontal ligament as solid elastic structures was analysed in order to evaluate the orthodontic effects induced. Results refer to the opening pattern and associated stresses/displacements/strains on the cranium, the maxillae and the periodontal ligament. (c) 2006 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The EWDS is an {{electronic}} device designed to recognize, on-line {{and well in}} advance, anomalous process conditions in chemical reactors {{that can lead to}} runaway reactions. The EWDS consists of hardware and software parts: In the hardware part we have: PT resistance thermometers to measure reactor and jacket temperatures; a data acquisition unit; a supply unit that complies with industrial safety standards and a PC equipped with a special data acquisition card. The software part is used to save and elaborate data, to show the results on line and to provide warning and alarm signals. For the bench scale reactor experiments the EWDS performance has been satisfactory. The algorithm, in fact, has detected the runaway events in advance without producing false alarms. For the industrial experiments two different algorithms have been used. Algorithm n. 1 was able to distinguish between runaway and non-runaway situations, because it is mainly focused on the dynamics inside the reactor. Algorithm n. 2, instead, produced false alarms during the <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> of the jacket valve by the operator. The results that I have presented refer to the first versions of the algorithms. In the future {{a new version of the}} EWDS algorithm will be tested. This version uses only the reactor temperature and it does not use derivatives. So the calculation will be simpler compared to the first versions...|$|R
5000|$|MMM {{is caused}} by the {{presence}} of 2M fibers in the muscles of the jaw. 2M fibers are not found elsewhere in the body, but they are close in structure to proteins found on the surface of bacteria. The immune system recognizes these proteins as foreign to the body and attacks them, resulting in inflammation. [...] Diagnosis of MMM is through either biopsy of the temporalis or masseter muscles or the 2M antibody assay, in which blood serum of the possible MMM-dog is reacted with temporalis tissue of a normal dog, or both. False negatives by the 2M antibody assay may be obtained if MMM is end-stage with destruction of type 2M fibers and marked fibrosis. Treatment is usually with corticosteroids such as prednisone, often with decreasing doses for up to 4-6 months, {{and in the case of}} trismus, <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> of the mouth under anesthesia. [...] Feeding very soft or liquid food during this time is usually necessary. The ultimate degree of recovery of jaw function and muscle mass will depend upon the extent of damage to the muscle tissue. Recurrence of MMM may occur. [...] Misdiagnosis of MMM as a retroorbital abscess based on physical examination and finding of trismus leads to inappropriate treatment with antibiotics, which will not impede the progress of MMM.|$|R

40|$|Natural night {{ventilation}} {{is driven}} by wind and stack generated pressures and cools down the exposed building structure at night, in which {{the heat of the}} previous day is accumulated. This passive cooling technique is applied in the low energy police office Schoten (Belgium). Thermal summer comfort in the offices is analysed based on the adaptive temperature limits indicator. Design, operation and performance of natural night ventilation are also evaluated. The design is compared to design guidelines for natural night ventilation. The operation is evaluated by comparing measured opening/closing of the windows to the designed control system. The performance is analysed based on the achieved temperature drop overnight. Measured data of indoor temperatures and opening/closing of windows were collected from the building management system during short periods in the summers of 2009 and 2010. Good thermal summer comfort is noticed during normal and warm summer periods. Only when the maximum outdoor temperature exceeds 30 °C, high indoor temperatures are measured. Too low temperatures in the morning are noticed in some landscaped offices in normal summer periods. This can be solved by raising the set point for indoor temperature. The users have a large impact on the achieved thermal comfort by <b>manual</b> <b>opening</b> and closing of the windows by day. A rather good agreement is found between measured and designed operation of natural ventilation. Daytime activation requirements have to be checked.

It is often described today as a strategic error, since after 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.Qxd4 (5.Bc4 is the Napoleon Gambit) White's queen stands on a central square, and is not developed too early since it cannot be chased away very effectively (5...c5? is a seriously weakening move that blocks Black's king's bishop). Nonetheless, the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (volume 3, 3rd edition 1997, p. 251 n.28, referring to p. 252 line 1) concludes that Black equalises with 5...Ne7 6.Bc4 Nc6 7.Qd5 Qf6 8.0-0 Ne5 9.Be2 c6 10.Qb3 Ng6 11.f4 Bc5+ 12.Kh1 d6.

40|$|Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) {{modeling}} and life prediction strongly depend on oxidation, and therefore require {{a thorough understanding}} of when matrix cracks occur, the extent of cracking for given conditions (time-temperature-environment-stress), and the interactions of matrix cracks with fibers and interfaces. In this work, the evolution of matrix cracks in a melt-infiltrated Silicon Carbide/Silicon Carbide (SiC/SiC) CMC under uniaxial tension was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with digital image correlation (DIC) and <b>manual</b> crack <b>opening</b> displacement (COD) measurements. Strain relaxation due to matrix cracking, the relationship between COD's and applied stress, and damage evolution at stresses below the proportional limit were assessed. Direct experimental observation of strain relaxation adjacent to regions of matrix cracking is presented and discussed.
