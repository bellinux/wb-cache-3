40|$|The {{perturbation}} of fluorescence in both bovine {{and human}} serum albumin caused by chloride, iodide, acrylamide and N-bromosuccinimide was studied under various experimental conditions. Serum albumin fluorescence lifetime changes induced by pH and added solutes were also studied, both in acid solutions and in powders. In general, the two proteins behave similarly. During the N-F transitions, the fluorescence lifetimes and the fluorescences intensities {{decrease in the}} same qualitative manner. Chloride binding enhances the fluorescence intensity, but {{has little or no}} effect on the fluorescence lifetimes. Chloride enhances the human serum albumin fluorescence intensity much more than it enhances that of bovine serum albumin. Iodide and acrylamide quench both the fluorescence intensities and lifetimes. Acrylamide quenching is hardly affected by pH changes, but is sensitive to the protein concentration. In acrylamide quenching, acrylamide molecules are partitioned into the protein matrix, causing both dynamic and static quenching. Iodide quenching is sensitive to pH, with a maximum quenching at pH 4. 0. Iodide quenching decreases with increased ionic strength and with increased protein concentration. The Stern-Volmer plots obtained with iodide as the quencher are downward curving in both proteins. The downward curvature is a result of iodide binding, the main quenching mechanism. Both tryptophans in bovine serum albumin tryptophans and the single human serum albumin tryptophan are very close {{to the surface of the}} protein. The environments of the bovine serum albumin tryptophans are not very different from each other. The fluorescence lifetimes of serum <b>albumin</b> <b>powders</b> separated at pH 6. 0 are very sensitive to hydration, while the lifetimes of powders separated at pH 2. 0 are not. Acrylamide and iodide quench the fluorescence lifetimes of bovine serum <b>albumin</b> <b>powders,</b> even in the driest samples. Quenching is maximum at a hydration approximately equal to that required for monolayer coverage...|$|R
40|$|Joseph F. Foster first {{suggested}} that the model of albumin was a flexible linkage of semiindependent domains (Foster, 1960). The name albumin derives from the early German term albumen, generally indicating proteins. Albumen, on the other hand, derives from the Latin word albus (white) indicating the white part of the cooked egg surrounding the yolk. The protein component of the egg white makes part of a heterogeneous group of proteins, broadly indicated as albumins, including serum <b>albumin,</b> <b>milk</b> <b>albumin</b> and urinary proteins. More specifically, serum albumin {{is a member of}} a family of homologous proteins characterized by distinctive structural features with peculiar ligand binding properties. Members of this family are -fetoprotein (AFP), afamin (AFM; also named -albumin), and vitamin D binding protein (DBP) (Peters, 1996; Fasano et al., 2007). Serum albumin was recognized as the principal component of the blood as early as 1839. It has been a model protein for many years for physiological studies. It is the most abundant soluble protein in the circulatory system comprising of about 52 - 60 % of the total plasma protein content...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Adverse {{reactions}} to food intake have very diverse etiology and symptomatology. Regarding milk, its food allergy {{is presented as}} lactose intolerance, the sugar in milk, or allergy to milk protein. Despite having different symptomatology, confusions among allergic conditions to dairy and its mediators are common. Milk protein allergy originates from protein components present in milk, causing {{reactions to}} either the protein fractions in emulsion (caseins) or in whey (<b>milk</b> <b>albumin).</b> The allergic reaction is type IV mediated by T lymphocytes. The allergic reaction produces severe cellular damage and it triggers physical, mental and emotional symptomatology that may vary in time, intensity and severity. Lactose intolerance is originated by total or partial absence of the enzyme that digests this disaccharide. Lactose intolerance can be primary or congenital and secondary; the former being more rare and severe, the latter being more common. Lactase deficiency can be diagnosed by symptoms associated with cramping and diarrhea. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to conduct a review of available literature on cow&# 8217;s milk protein allergy and lactose intolerance...|$|R
40|$|Murine milk {{contains}} 18 mg ml− 1 serum albumin, {{a concentration}} {{equal to that}} in the serum of the lactating mouse. We examined cellular transport using in vivo methods in the mouse. At steady state the specific activity of 125 I-albumin injected into the blood stream was equal in plasma and whey, confirming that <b>milk</b> <b>albumin</b> is extra-mammary in origin. Fluorescent albumin crossed the gland from basolateral surface to lumen via cytoplasmic vesicles, but was not transported in the apical to basal direction. Albumin was segregated from transferrin at the basal surface of the epithelial cells and did not colocalize with either caveolin- 1 or - 2. Vesicular transport was not disrupted by filipin providing additional evidence that, unlike the vascular endothelium, caveoli are not involved. Cytoplasmic albumin was localized to vesicles containing IgA and transport was disrupted by agents that interfere with clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Together, these findings provide evidence that albumin is transported across the mammary epithelium by the same pathway as immunoglobulin. The possibility that the massive transfer of <b>albumin</b> into mouse <b>milk</b> is mediated by fluid phase transport is considered...|$|R

40|$|Effective use of {{equations}} for calculating estimated glomerular {{filtration rate}} (eGFR) requires reli-able plasma creatinine measure-ments (1). Considerable {{effort has been}} made to standardize calibra-tion (2, 3), but standardization does not correct for analytical in-terferences, such as protein inter-ference in Jaffe creatinine assays. A single-value correction fac-tor is often used to correct for non-specific protein interference in Jaffe assays, but this approach {{does not take into account}} differences in plasma albumin concentrations among samples. Because of the current interest in low creatinine results for calculation of eGFR, we evaluated the validity and clinical impact of using a single compensa-tion value. We determined the depen-dence of creatinine results on albu-min concentration by adding in-creasing amounts of human <b>albumin</b> <b>powder</b> to plasma speci-mens containing low albumin and creatinine concentrations of 50 and 340 mol/L, respectively. We then measured, in triplicate, creat-inine and albumin (by the Roche bromcresol purple method) on a Modular Analytics system that uses a constant 26 mol/L adjust-ment of creatinine results. As ex-pected, the reported creatinine re-sults decreased with decreasing albumin concentrations. We assumed that when protein concentration iswithin the adult ref-erence interval, the Roche factor of 26 mol/L provides reliable com-pensation. Hence, the “true ” creati-nine results of these sampleswere es-timatedat analbuminconcentration of 40 g/L. The differences between these true creatinine results and the measured reportable results are at-tributable to miscompensation at the respective albumin concentra-tions that differed from 40 g/L.

For the SAT, the fasting patient is given a solution of mannitol (M) and lactulose (L) following which the L/M ratio, as an indicator of the selective intestinal permeability, is determined in 5 -hour urine by means of gas chromatography. In cow's milk protein allergy, the L/M ratio showed a statistically significant increase in clinically positive cow's milk provocation results, unlike that in clinically negative results. After pretreatment with cromoglycate this difference decreased to non-significant values. The L/M ratio was increased in active coeliac disease (with villous atrophy), first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients, Crohn's disease, clinically active ulcerative colitis and pancreatic insufficiency. The L/M ratio was not increased in inactive coeliac disease (with normal villi), suspicion of coeliac disease because of short stature, dystrophy and/or aspecific gastrointestinal symptoms with normal villi, and in clinically inactive ulcerative colitis.

In the first experiment aiming at detection of bacteria in plant explants four strains representing genera most often occurring at our survey of plant tissue cultures, and earlier isolated and identified (Bacillus, Methylobacterium, Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas) were streaked on five bacteriological media (NA, King B, K, R 2 A and 523) and on the medium used for plant culture initiation – ½ MS with <b>milk</b> <b>albumin</b> (IM). All strains grew on all media but on K and IM at the slowest rate and on 523 medium at the fastest. The IM medium proved to be useful for immediate bacteria detection at the initial stage of culture. In the second experiment, aiming at characterization of isolates {{on the basis of}} colony growth and morphology 14 strains (Agrobacterium, Bacillus, Curtobacterium, Flavobacterium, Lactobacillus, Methylobacterium – 2 strains Mycobacterium, Paenibacillus, Plantibacterium, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Xanthomonas, and species Serratia marcescens) were streaked on five microbiological media: KB, NBY, YDC, YNA and YPGA. All strains grew on all those media but at different rates. The only exception was the strain of Lactobacillus spp., which did not grow on King B medium. This medium allowed the detection of such characteristic traits as fluorescence (Pseudomonas) and secretion of inclusions (Stenotrophomonas). The third experiment was focussed on assessment of the sensitivity of detection of specific bacteria in pure cultures and in plant tis- sue cultures using standard PCR and BIO-PCR techniques with genus specific primers and 2 methods of DNA isolation. Results showed that the use of Genomic Mini kit enabled an increase of the sensitivity by 100 times as compared to extraction of DNA by boiling. Moreover, the application of BIO-PCR increased sensitivity of detection from 102 to 105  times over the standard PCR.

Subcellular distribution studies demonstrated that the activity {{was associated with the}} outer membrane fraction of the bacterium. In addition, the protease was secreted by the bacterium when grown in liquid culture. The enzyme activity was measured by hydrolysis of azocasein and biotinylated casein and exhibited optimal caseinolytic activity at pH 8. 0 (37 degrees C). The activity was inhibited by EDTA, 1, 10 -phenanthroline, phosphoramidon, pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylic acid, and 8 -hydroxyquinoline- 5 -sulfonic acid (HQSA). Inhibition by HQSA was reversed by zinc, whereas inhibition due to EDTA was reversed by excess calcium, thus indicating that the enzyme was a zinc-dependent, calcium-stabilized endoproteinase. Furthermore, titration with Zn 2 + of a desalted, active-site zinc-chelated preparation of the protease demonstrated that Zn 2 + was essential for activity. Leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, E- 64, pepstatin A, dithiothreitol, and 2 -mercaptoethanol had no effect on enzymatic activity. Addition of Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + to the incubation medium resulted in approximately a twofold stimulation of the azocaseinolytic activity of the enzyme.

The powders were prepared by spray-drying using PTH, sugars, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and/or albumin. They presented an average primary particle diameter of 4. 5 microm and tap density of 0. 06 g/cm(3), a mass median aerodynamic diameter between 3. 9 and 5. 9 microm, and reached up to 98 % emitted dose and up to 61 % fine particle fraction in the multi-stage liquid impinger using a Spinhaler inhaler device. Varying the airflow rate from 30 to 100 L/min had limited influence on the aerodynamic behavior of the aerosols. The absolute PTH bioavailability was 21 % after intratracheal administration of the powder formed of PTH/albumin/lactose/dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and 18 % after subcutaneous injection in rats. Equilibrium dialysis revealed a 78 % binding of PTH to albumin and the withdrawal of <b>albumin</b> from the <b>powder</b> increased absolute bioavailability after inhalation from 21 to 34 %. No acute inflammation appeared in the lung up to 48 h after a single inhalation.

40|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for quantifiable detection of specific antibodies in warm-blooded animals, {{but it has not}} been accepted for detection of fish antibodies because of its low reproducibility, which {{is due in part to}} high background optical density (OD) measurements. In the present study, we report that the high background of a fish antibody- detection ELISA resulted from non-specific adsorption of fish immunoglobulin M (IgM) to blocking reagents on the ELISA plate wells. Four fish sera (from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, masu salmon O. masou, Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus and koi Cyprinus carpio) were poured into ELISA plate wells pre-blocked with several blocking reagents (skim milk, soybean <b>milk,</b> bovine serum <b>albumin,</b> fetal bovine serum, gelatin and Roche BlockingReagent®) and then washed out in order to measure the remaining fish IgM on the ELISA plate wells. Significant amounts of fish IgMs (OD absorbance at 492 nm: 0. 3 to 1. 1) remained on the ELISA plate wells with no antigenic protein except blocking reagents. The amount of remaining fish IgMs on the ELISA plate wells decreased significantly following treatment of fish sera with skim milk. However, the specific immuno-reactivity of fish IgM was not reduced by such treatment. Thus, we conclude that treatment of fish sera with skim milk is useful in reducing the high background OD often observed in fish IgM detection ELISA...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and validate a colorimetric assay to measure caprine serum albumin (CSA) concentrations in milk. The principle of the say was based on the binding of albumin to bromocresol green (BCG) dye at pH 4. 0. The absorption of the dye-albumin complex was determined spectrophotometrically at 640 nm. A linear relationship existed between CSA concentrations (0. 01 to 8. 0 mg/ml) and absorbance values. Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation for the proposed assay were 2. 6 % and 12 % respectively. Recovery from milk samples spiked with albumins was 89. 15 % ± 7. 6 %. The developed assay was validated using 126 milk samples collected from lactating Saanen goats at various stages of lactation`. Caprine serum <b>albumin</b> concentrations in <b>milk</b> ranged between 0. 31 and 0. 52 mg/ml. The concentrations of CSA were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) at the beginning of lactation, declined rapidly and remained relatively stable in mature <b>milk.</b> Caprine serum <b>albumin</b> correlated positively (p < 0. 05) with milk somatic cell counts, total solids, protein, fat and whey and correlated negatively (p < 0. 05) with milk lactose and casein concentrations. It was concluded that the proposed BCG dye-binding method is easy to perform, rapid, sensitive, reliable and can be used to determine CSA concentrations in milk collected from goats under different physiological conditions. </span...|$|R

Between 19 and 28 wk of being fed the albumin diet, 12 rats died of bacterial cystitis and pyelonephritis. In addition, 2 more rats from the same dietary group developed peritonitis after ovariohysterectomy. Examination of the 44 rats fed the albumin diet that completed the 34 -wk experiment revealed pyelonephritis in 68 %, cystitis in 66 %, urolithiasis in 27 %, and nephrolithiasis in 5 %. Squamous metaplasia of the transitional epithelium was present in all 44 rats, although other epithelia were histologically normal. Vitamin A deficiency was diagnosed after analyses of blood and liver samples. Analysis of the vitamin premix revealed approximately 25 % of the expected amount of vitamin A. Because the milk powder contained sufficient vitamin A, deficiency did not occur in rats fed the milk powder diet. The major consequences of vitamin A deficiency in the rats were squamous metaplasia, bacterial infection, and calculus formation within the urinary tract. This report illustrates the importance of careful formulation and storage of vitamin premixes used in experimental diets.

40|$|This {{laboratory}} {{has been}} attempting to obtain further informa-tion concerning {{the cause of}} a peculiar paralysis 1, 2 of nu-tritional origin involving the legs and feet of chicks. In con-tinuing the study of this paralysis it was decided to purify the casein used not only to obtain a more uniform product in re-spect to growth-promoting characteristics but also to determine whether this might not be a means of increasing the amount of paralysis. Commercial casein was therefore extracted with 0. 2 per cent acetic-acid solution for 6 days. This acetic-acid solution was changed twice every 24 hours. On the seventh day the casein was washed four times with tap water and finally dried over a steam radiator under a stream of air. It was also decided to study egg <b>albumin,</b> Merck's impalpable <b>powder,</b> with the thought that this material might be deficient in the anti-paralytic factor, although reported rich in vitamin GP. White Leghorn chicks of the Cornell strain were used in this experiment. These were selected for size and vitality approxi-mately 24 hours after hatching, divided into 7 lots of 25 chicks each, and individually weighed into the experiment. These chicks were each weighed weekly thereafter at which time obser-vations were made of any signs of nutritional disturbances. A weekly record of feed consumption was also made.

40|$|Pollen {{substitute}} diets are {{a valuable}} resource for maintaining strong and health honey bee colonies. Specific diets {{may be useful in}} one region or country and inadequate or economically unviable in others. We compared two artificial protein diets that had been formulated from locally-available ingredients in Brazil with bee bread and a non-protein sucrose diet. Groups of 100 newly-emerged, adult workers of Africanized honey bees in Brazil and European honey bees in the USA were confined in small cages and fed on one of four diets for seven days. The artificial diets included a high protein diet made of soy <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> and <b>albumin,</b> and a lower protein level diet consisting of soy milk powder, brewer’s yeast and rice bran. The initial protein levels in newly emerged bees were approximately 18 - 21 μg/μL hemolymph. After feeding on the diets for seven days, the protein levels in the hemolymph were similar among the protein diet groups (~ 37 - 49 μg/μL after seven days), although Africanized bees acquired higher protein levels, increasing 145 and 100 % on diets D 1 and D 2, respectively, versus 83 and 60 % in the European bees. All the protein diets resulted in significantly higher levels of protein than sucrose solution alone. In the field, the two pollen substitute diets were tested during periods of low pollen availability in the field in two regions of Brazil. Food consumption, population development, colony weight, and honey production were evaluated to determine the impact of the diets on colony strength parameters. The colonies fed artificial diets had a significant improvement in all parameters, while control colonies dwindled during the dearth period. We conclude that these two artificial protein diets have good potential as pollen substitutes during dearth periods and that Africanized bees more efficiently utilize artificial protein diets than do European honey bees.

40|$|Background: Tuberculosis (TB) {{is world}} health problem which still needs attention. Recently, Indonesia ranks {{the third in}} TB {{prevalence}} after India and China. Research revealed that albumin decreases significantly in TB patients, {{due to lack of}} nutritious intakes such as low-calorie intake, anorexia, increased catabolism, enteropathy and acute protein reaction. Low albumin was associated with increased IL- 1 β and cytokines inflammation in TB patient. Albumin had a very important role in the body and white egg known as a good quality source of protein. Objective: To assess the effect of white egg supplementation in TB patient towards the level of albumin and the level of IL- 1 β. Method: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 75 patient selected for the study and divided to 37 patient as the study group and 38 as a control group. Both groups received high energy high protein diet, while the study group received, additionally, an oral egg white-based on formula calculation Baxter for 14 days. Control group received, additionally, an extra soybean curd and mungbean <b>powder.</b> <b>Albumin</b> and IL- 1 β were checked before and after the intervention. Data is analyzed by using Mann-Whitney. Results: Research results show that average albumin pre-intervention in the study group was 2. 82 g/dL and control group was 2. 85 g/dL. Average albumin difference in the study group was 3. 47 g/dL and control group was 2. 81 g/dL. Bivariate analysis results show significant of increasing albumin between study group and control group (p< 0. 05). Research results show average IL- 1 β pre-intervention difference in study group (0. 9 pg/mL) and control group (0. 67 pg/mL). The average IL- 1 β difference in the study group was - 0. 39 pg/mL and control group was 0. 76 pg/mL.

40|$|Coconut milk (CM) {{containing}} {{coconut oil}} {{extracted from the}} endosperm (meat) of coconut fruit is not stable and undergoes a rapid separation into a creaming layer {{at the top and}} a serum phase at the bottom. In this study, coconut milk was separated into coconut cream (CC) and coconut skim milk (CSM). The ability of proteins in CM, CC and CSM to form and stabilise oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions containing coconut oil was investigated. The unstable nature of coconut oil droplets in CM was found to be due to types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of oil droplets, which were predominantly 11 S globulins, known to be hydrophobic and salt soluble proteins. The oil droplets stabilised by 11 S globulins in CM and CC were larger in size and highly flocculated, probably due to hydrophobic interaction, thus resulting in rapid creaming and phase separation, compared to those stabilised by proteins (e. g. water-soluble albumins) in CSM. Smaller droplet size with less droplet flocculation and slower phase separation was obtained when emulsions were prepared with a predominance of proteins present in CSM. The CSM-based emulsions were relatively more stable but they were only able to provide short-term stability against phase separation. The results suggest that the ability of proteins (both globulins and albumins) in CM to stabilise the emulsion oil droplets was not high because these proteins did not seem to posses the ability to provide steric and electrostatic stabilisation to the emulsion droplets stabilised by them. An addition of small molecule surfactants, particularly a water-soluble surfactant of Tween 80, induced the formation of smaller droplets in the CM- and CSM-based emulsions, thereby improving their emulsion stability to a certain extent. However, the addition of oil-soluble small molecule surfactants (e. g. mono- and diglycerides and/or partially unsaturated mono- and diglycerides) in the absence of Tween 80 caused a significant increase in droplet size of emulsions prepared from CSM. In contrast, this phenomenon was not observed in emulsions made from CM. The formation and properties of coconut milk ice creams differing in the concentration of CSM proteins, as well as ratios of solid fat-to-liquid oil (blends of coconut oil and sunflower oil) were also investigated. The differences in those variables were found to have a significant influence on the properties and stability (particle size, flow properties, droplet flocculation) of ice cream mixes as well as the characteristics of ice creams, such as overrun, melt resistance and shape retention. Several instrumental analyses, including size measurement, flow behaviour and small-deformation oscillatory tests, showed the presence of an agglomerated structural network in ice creams based on CSM containing oil blends as well as in ice creams based on dairy milk. From the findings, the agglomerated fat structural network in the CSM-based ice creams containing the suitable solid fat content at 68 % could change ice creams with a slow melting rate and the more ability to retain their shape during melting compared with those of the dairy milk-based ice cream and ice creams made directly from CM. Overall the results suggest that coconut milk proteins do not possess the properties of proteins suitable for making very small droplets as well as stable emulsions against phase separation, particularly 11 S globulins that are one of the major constituent proteins in coconut <b>milk.</b> However, <b>albumins,</b> which are the predominant proteins in coconut skim milk, may be suitable for use as the surface-active proteins for making smaller emulsion droplets in coconut oil-in-water emulsions, but their concentration needs to be increased for use probably by membrane filtration or freeze drying after removal of some carbohydrates from coconut skim milk...|$|R
