40|$|The {{synchronization}} {{between two}} electrical motors (master and slave) is studied. To reduce {{the costs of}} the master}slave combination, the slave motor is mounted with a very low-resolution encoder (one pulse per revolution). Since the position measurements are asynchronous in time, standard control and analysis techniques are not applicable. Two methods are proposed to deal with these cheap, low-resolution encoders: the hybrid and the asynchronous control scheme. The presented controllers are successfully tested on a real industrial master-multi-slave system as is used for <b>mailing</b> <b>machines.</b> (1999 Elsevier Science ‚td. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|Starting about 1985, Eastern offered [...] "Moonlight Specials", with {{passenger}} seats on overnight flights scheduled for cargo from thirty freight companies. The flights, which operated between midnight and 7 am, served 18 {{cities in the}} United States connecting mainly to Houston (IAH). Eric Schmitt of The New York Times said that the services were [...] "a hybrid of late-night, red-eye flights and the barebones People Express approach to service." [...] The holds of the aircraft were reserved for cargo such as express <b>mail,</b> <b>machine</b> tool parts, and textiles. Because of this, the airline allowed each passenger to take up to two carry-on bags. The airline charged $10 for each checked bag, which was shipped standby. The airline charged between 50 cents and $3 for beverages and snacks. Bunny Duck, an Eastern flight attendant quoted in The New York Times, said that the passengers on the special flights were [...] "a cross section of families, college kids, illegal aliens and weirdos from L.A.".|$|R

50|$|Australia Post prefers {{envelopes}} sold in Australia to {{have four}} {{boxes in the}} bottom {{right corner of the}} front of the envelope. Entering the postcode in these boxes or squares, which Australia Post calls postcode squares, enables Australia Post to use optical character recognition (OCR) software in its <b>mail</b> sorting <b>machines</b> to automatically and more quickly sort mail into postcodes, which also embeds routing information. Postcode squares were introduced in June 1990.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the utilisation of embedded sensors {{for the development}} of intelligent <b>mail</b> processing <b>machines.</b> Low-cost Infrared imagers are used to monitor the health of machines. The machines are linked through the Internet, via standard protocols, to maintenance centres where the embedded intelligence is linked with remote surveillance and autonomous agents for predicting and requesting maintenance. The results described in this paper demonstrate that utilising embedded mechatronic systems with IT components leads to greater flexibility and higher machine intelligence for remote diagnostic system...|$|R
50|$|KIS {{consists}} of two distinct types of modules which {{interact with each other}} (typically across a network) to provide the service. One module is a user agent module that runs on the KIS <b>mail</b> host <b>machine.</b> The second module is a remote server module (possibly on a different machine) that interrogates various database services across the network and provides the results to the user agent module in a uniform fashion. Interactions between the two modules can be via messages between Knowbots or by actual movement of Knowbots.|$|R
50|$|Until 1968, mail in Sweden was sorted only {{according}} to geographic location, {{which meant that}} postal workers had to learn all mail centers in Sweden, and what particular mail trains served those places. In 1967, {{it was decided that}} postcodes would be introduced in Sweden as of May 12, 1968. Since then, the postcode system has been essentially the same, but a slight reform was carried out during the mid-1990s as all remaining mail terminals were equipped with automatic <b>mail</b> sorting <b>machines.</b> In 2008, Sweden was divided into more than 16,100 postcode areas.|$|R
50|$|When {{this was}} {{considered}} {{in combination with}} the ever-increasing volume of not-yet-written <b>mail,</b> the <b>machine</b> was taken out of service and smashed up by a senior postman (despite being told that its destruction could result in the end of the universe). The remains are still installed {{in the basement of the}} Post Office; as they are still hazardous, there is no obvious means of removing them. It was a prominent feature of the Post Office in Going Postal; one of Moist von Lipwig's predecessors was accidentally killed by it, and Moist himself used it to kill Mr. Gryle, a feral banshee.|$|R
50|$|User barbox!user would {{generally}} publish their UUCP {{email address}} {{in a form}} such as …!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user. This directs people to route their <b>mail</b> to <b>machine</b> bigsite (presumably a well-known and well-connected machine accessible to everybody) and from there through the machine foovax to the account of user user on barbox. Publishing a full path would be pointless, {{because it would be}} different, depending on where the sender was. (e.g. Ann at one site may have to send via path gway!tcol!canty!uoh!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user, whereas from somewhere else, Bill has to send via the path pdp10!router22!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user). Many users would suggest multiple routes from various large well-known sites, providing even better and perhaps faster connection service from the mail sender.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>mail</b> sorting <b>machine</b> was {{eventually}} broken up for scrap, it was highly influential outside of Canada. Lewis' original suggestion that {{some sort of}} invisible or see-through ink be used to store routing information on the front face of the letters is now practically universal, as is the basic workflow of the address being converted to bar code form as soon as possible by typists and then sent into automated machinery for actual sorting. Use of bar-coded ZIP codes printed directly at the sending point when using postage meters became mandatory in the U.S. in 1973. During the 1960s the use of optical character readers replaced typists for letters with typewritten addresses, and in the 1990s, handwritten ones as well.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- We {{develop a}} neural-network {{architecture}} for recognizing handwritten Bangla digits and {{its application to}} automatic <b>mail</b> sorting <b>machine</b> for Bangladesh Postal system is presented. The system consists of preprocessing, classification and implementation. Preprocessing is fully automated for envelops with a postcode frame. Otherwise, a human operator has to manually select the block if the numerals of postcode are in the destination address region. Neural network with one hidden layer is trained using backpropagation algorithm for classification. We also discuss implementing the system in a real-world mail sorting system. The performance of the network on single digits is 92. 2 % recognition, 6 % substitution and 1. 8 % rejection. The system is a hybrid of image processing, segmentation and neural network classification...|$|R

50|$|Harold Petts (Spike Milligan) is a {{conscientious}} village postman who receives a promotion that takes him to London, {{to be trained}} at London's busiest post office. However, after his first day {{in the big city}} he is soon in trouble. In the main sorting office he succeeds in beating the new <b>mail</b> sorting <b>machine</b> at pigeonholing letters for delivery (the machine blows up in the process). As a result he is placed safely out of the way in the parcels department, but sorts parcels at such speed that he puts everyone else in the department out of work. This leads him to a meeting with the staff psychiatrist, and then to Jean (Barbara Shelley), an ambitious art student, and the pair find themselves the main suspects in a mail theft ring, with the police and post office officials hot on their heels.|$|R
50|$|A user's mailbox can be {{accessed}} in two dedicated ways. The Post Office Protocol (POP) allows the user to download messages {{one at a time}} and only deletes them from the server after they have been successfully saved on local storage. It is possible to leave messages on the server to permit another client to access them. However, there is no provision for flagging a specific message as seen, answered, or forwarded, thus POP is not convenient for users who access the same <b>mail</b> from different <b>machines.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method of recognising hand-written postcodes using the Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network, {{a relatively new}} architecture of the neural network family. It has the capability to process in parallel {{as well as the}} ability to learn and make decisions. The image of the specially formatted envelopes are captured by a frame grabber and processed by an image processing software called WiT. Pre-processing consists of region of interest (ROI) identification, noise reduction, image centring and size normalisation. Feature extraction is used {{to reduce the size of}} the input to the neural network and yet retaining the information of the image. The Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network performs recognition of the digit. With proper training of the network, it can be shown that the Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is capable to recognise the hand-written postcodes for automatic mail sorting. A prototype <b>mail</b> sorting <b>machine</b> has been successfully designed and developed at CAIRO, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia...|$|R
