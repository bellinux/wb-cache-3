Since further filming was to take place during the hurricane season, and it was not possible to get insurance, the crew was forced to move to elsewhere. Though the state of Florida offered a US$450,000 subsidy, the Dexter crew relocated to Los Angeles. Executive producer Sara Colleton explained that the filming crew tried to create a different version of Miami in Los Angeles, that differed from the [...] "glossy look" [...] Miami has in [...] and Miami Vice. [...] "Dexter" [...] was shot in HD; cinematographer Romeo Tirone said he experienced some difficulties because HD [...] "sees everything." [...] As opposed to Dexter's [...] "disturbing" [...] environment, Tirone tried to give Rita's home a [...] "warmer, safer, happier place" [...] with [...] "a dark side to it," [...] doing so by letting more light come through the windows. Editor Elena Maganini was contacted by episode director Michael Cuesta after he saw her previous work with director John McNaughton; Maganini had previously worked on a serial killer movie entitled [...] Michael Cuesta said that when he met Elena he [...] "...thought she had great instincts, was relaxed and didn’t pretend to know exactly who this character was.

Smith recorded: [...] "The next morning I {{went to see}} elder Rigdon, and found him crazy, and his head highly inflamed, for they had dragged him by his heels, and those too, so high from the earth he could not raise his head from the rough frozen surface, which lascerated it exceedingly; {{and when he saw}} me he called to his wife to bring him his razor. She asked him what he wanted of it? and he replied to kill me. Sister Rigdon left the room, and he asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> his razor.

2500|$|Willa Holland portrays Kaitlin Cooper (season 4, {{recurring}} season 1, 3). The {{role was}} originally played by Shailene Woodley in a recurring role during Season 1. Kaitlin {{spends much of}} the series at boarding school before returning on a recurring basis in season 3 (now played by Holland) and finally becoming a regular character in season 4. The daughter of Jimmy Cooper and Julie Cooper-Nichol and sister to Marissa Cooper, her personality is more similar to her mother's rather than her father's, and she is portrayed as a regular pot smoker and occasional dealer. Holland observed that [...] "no one can control her" [...] but that her arc in Season 4 finds the character maturing.

2500|$|... "Qué Quieres Tú De Mí" [...] is an {{acoustic}} guitar ballad which Queen {{covered in a}} minor-key; it features traditional Afro-Latin American influences. It was originally written in 1964 by Brazilian composers Evaldo Gouveia and Jair Amorim as [...] "Que Queres Tu De Mim" [...] for Brazilian singer Altemar Dutra. [...] "Que Lloren" [...] features minor key tonality, bowed strings, a string ensemble and elements of techno music. The song's lyrics show a woman's view of romance and belittles the stereotype that men shouldn't show emotions. The mid-tempo [...] "Sentimientos", {{is a blend of}} reggaetón and bachata music known as bachaton or bachateo, a musical movement in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico which combines bachata melodies and reggaeton style beats, lyrics, rapping, and disc jockeying. It features minor key tonality, mixed acoustic and electric instrumentation, bowed strings, a string ensemble, and ambient synthesizers. Ivy Queen indicated that the song emphasized human connection over material things, stating that [...] "What I wanted to say in the song is that material things have never been important to me.... I look for genuine feelings, honesty, the things that come from the heart, because the material things I can get." [...] In another interview, she identified the song as the one that best represented her at that time, explaining, [...] "if you think you can only conquer me if you're famous, rich and have an expensive car, you're wrong, because I'm a woman who needs affection, someone to open the door for <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> me flowers and sing to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Elijah's {{confrontation}} with Ahab, God {{tells him to}} flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook Chorath, east of the Jordan, where he will be fed by ravens. When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living {{in the town of}} Zarephath in Phoenicia. When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, “Do not be afraid ... For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.” She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true. God gave her [...] "manna" [...] from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land. Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, [...] "You have come to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!" [...] Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated. 1 Kings 17:22 relates how God [...] "listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived." [...] This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This non-Israelite widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society.

2500|$|... "Sentimientos", {{the title}} track, {{was written by}} Ivy Queen herself. The song was {{recorded}} at Marroneo Studios in Bayamón, Puerto Rico along with [...] "Indecisiones" [...] and [...] "En Que Fallamos" [...] from the album. It was produced by the Puerto Rican reggaetón producer and long time collaborator Rafi Mercenario, who also has produced some of her biggest hits including [...] "Cuéntale" [...] and [...] "Libertad" [...] among others.

2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she would ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing.
