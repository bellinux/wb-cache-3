25|$|Jeffress quickly {{planned the}} {{analysis}} operation, invented {{and built the}} complex analysis hardware, analyzed the data, and published the results, all {{in a matter of}} a few months. Almost overnight, Jeffress had established his reputation as an expert in <b>mine</b> <b>hunting,</b> a reputation that was to grow steadily over the next two decades.|$|E
25|$|This initial work, {{together}} with subsequent similar evaluations, led Jeffress {{to the development}} of a mine-hunting technique known as clustering. He first used data collected at sea to develop the technique, he then proceeded to use numerical models (which involved random number theory), and finally developed a theoretical model (in closed analytical form). The Navy readily accepted his work and requested that he write the tactical doctrine on clustering. This document, {{together with}} other reports he wrote, remained the standard works on <b>mine</b> <b>hunting</b> and were still to be found on every mine-hunting craft in the US Fleet at Jeffress' death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we {{know about}} that," [...] {{returned}} Paul. [...] "Many a man has lost the chance of his life by advertising his knowledge too broadly. Others would gain a clew of a <b>mine,</b> <b>hunt</b> it up, {{and put in a}} claim before the original discoverer knew what was up." ...|$|R

50|$|Environmental {{preservation}} in the United States {{and other}} parts of the world, including Australia, is viewed as the setting aside of natural resources to prevent damage caused by contact with humans or by certain human activities, such as logging, <b>mining,</b> <b>hunting,</b> and fishing, often to replace them with new human activities such as tourism and recreation. Regulations and laws may be enacted for the preservation of natural resources.|$|R
2500|$|One of Jeffress' {{memorials}} {{recalled that}} Jeffress was considered remarkable at DRL {{because he was}} able to pursue his university teaching, do his fundamental research in psychoacoustics, and do his applied work in <b>mine</b> <b>hunting</b> all at the same time—and be successful at all three. The same memorial notes that Jeffress managed to get funding at DRL from the Navy in a unique way: [...] "Jeffress' basic research in psychoacoustics at DRL was sponsored by the Navy's Bureau of Ships, an agency that normally deals with the development and procurement of hardware, while much of his applied work in <b>mine</b> <b>hunting</b> was funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), whose charter is to sponsor fundamental research." ...|$|E
5000|$|In June 1984, HM-14 took {{delivery}} of the AN/AQS-14 <b>Mine</b> <b>Hunting</b> Sonar and established the Fleet’s first operational airborne <b>mine</b> <b>hunting</b> capability. This new asset was put {{to use in the}} Red Sea during Operation Intense Look while the squadron conducted split-site operations, with {{the main body of the}} squadron deploying on [...] and Detachment One operating out of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{at the end}} of 19th {{century in}} Canada, the arrival of the train and the {{construction}} of forest roads in the hinterland allowed better access to wilderness. In the 20th century, airplanes, snowmobiles and other all-terrain vehicles were other ways to remote and difficult to reach water bodies. Consequently, forestry and <b>mining,</b> <b>hunting,</b> fishing, and other recreational and tourism activities (excursions, boating, vacationing...) were able to grow in these wilds.|$|R
50|$|The IUCN Red List {{states that}} the red ruffed lemur is {{critically}} endangered. Logging, burning of habitat, cyclones, <b>mining,</b> <b>hunting,</b> and the illegal pet trade are primary threats. They also have natural predators such as large snakes, eagles, and the fossa. The creation of the Masoala National Park in 1997 has helped protect this species, but many red ruffed lemurs do not live within the park's boundaries, and are still at high risk.|$|R
5|$|There was {{considerable}} local {{opposition to the}} Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy {{would be unable to}} thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that <b>mining,</b> <b>hunting,</b> and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.|$|R

5000|$|Operation [...] "Jabber"In 1986 {{the unit}} served and {{distinguished}} {{itself as a}} part of 54 Battalion, in Sector 10 as well as in Angola taking part in Operation [...] "Jabber". It operated independently during the 3-month stint as a <b>mine</b> <b>hunting</b> unit as well as lifting caches, sometimes going on long range <b>mine</b> <b>hunting</b> missions without traditional infantry protection. A contact was recorded between the Para Sappers and SWAPO during such a long range mission where their retaliatory mortar fire caused the enemy to flee.|$|E
5000|$|The {{watershed}} of Rausch Creek {{is situated}} in the southwestern part of Schuylkill County. The watershed can be accessed by taking Interstate 81 to US Route 209 and US Route 209 to State Route 4011. Most of the watershed of the creek is contained within the subwatersheds of the tributaries East Branch Rausch Creek and West Branch Rausch Creek. The watershed {{has been described as}} having [...] "rugged contours", reducing the viability of development, but is suitable for <b>mining,</b> <b>hunting,</b> and lumbering.|$|R
50|$|Threats include illegal <b>mining,</b> fishing, <b>hunting</b> and farming.As of 2000 a {{total of}} 10288 ha had been deforested.This had risen to 24571 ha by 2014.|$|R
50|$|Cultural forces {{intentionally}} or unintentionally, have {{an influence}} upon the landscape. Cultural landscapes are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of invasive species, extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, <b>mining,</b> <b>hunting,</b> natural landscaping, farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include public parks, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.|$|R
50|$|The Styrsö {{class is}} a Swedish mine {{countermeasures}} vessel built from glass fiber. Among its intended missions are mine detection, <b>mine</b> <b>hunting</b> and patrolling. The ships are named after islands from four different archipelagos of Sweden.|$|E
50|$|The ships {{mission was}} to clear harbor, coastal, and ocean waters of acoustic, {{magnetic}} and pressure/contact type mines utilizing reconnaissance, classification and neutralization tactics. Exceptionally low magnetic and acoustic signatures protect the ship against detonations during <b>mine</b> <b>hunting</b> operations.|$|E

50|$|The {{cause of}} the feud was the {{ambition}} of Nassau to curtail or take away the rights (including <b>mining,</b> <b>hunting,</b> and customs rights) and possessions (forests and ore mines in the Schelderwald) of the local aristocracy. The Landgraves of Thuringia and later of Hesse supported the local nobility. The leading figures of the lower nobility against Nassau were the Lords of Dernbach. Parallel with this conflict, Count Henry II was also fighting a vendetta against the Knight of Wilnsdorf in the Siegerland, who soon allied himself with the Dernbachers.|$|R
5000|$|He was re-elected in the 1981 provincial election. Pope was {{promoted}} to Minister of Natural Resources on April 10, 1981. [...] He served in this position {{for the remainder of}} the Davis administration's time in office. Responding to a report on the state of the province's provincial park system, Pope promised to significantly increase the number of parks. However, he refused to prohibit <b>mining,</b> <b>hunting</b> and fishing within park grounds. In 1982, after a dispute over wild rice harvesting on Mud Lake, Pope ruled that traditional native harvesting rights would be upheld and that the ministry would not allow commercial harvesting to proceed.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{includes}} five mini-games. The only mini-game {{available at}} the beginning of the game is [...] "Soniclash", in which players try to knock their opponents off the fighting arena to gather points. In Tails' Fly and Get, players fly around and try to collect more rings than their opponents. Knuckles' <b>Mine</b> <b>Hunt</b> is a single-player game based on the computer game Minesweeper. In Amy's Treasure Island, players move around and search for emeralds, and in Shadow's Speed Demon (which is relatively similar to the stage [...] "Radical Highway" [...] on Sonic Adventure 2), the players race against each other.|$|R
50|$|The Landsort {{class is}} {{equipped}} for mine sweeping with both conventional mechanical sweeping gear {{as well as}} electric and acoustic sweep systems. <b>Mine</b> <b>hunting</b> capability is provided by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) from Saab Underwater Systems, such as the Double Eagle.|$|E

50|$|Aggressive class minesweepers used AN/SQQ-14 <b>mine</b> <b>hunting</b> sonar {{to locate}} moored or bottom mines. They used {{electromagnetic}} cables {{to set off}} mines or other cables to cut their mooring lines, and various magnetic and acoustical devices to set off mines. Toward {{the end of their}} use, the class also employed remote submersibles like Super Sea Rover to locate mines.|$|E
50|$|Mediatized houses {{generally}} possessed greater rights {{than other}} houses. Whilst they lost sovereignty and certain rights (such as legislation, taxation, final jurisdiction, {{and control over}} policing and conscription) over their territories, they still often retained their private estates and feudal rights, which may have included rights over forestry, fishing, <b>mining,</b> <b>hunting,</b> jurisdiction over policing, and lower jurisdiction over civil and criminal court cases. Mediatised Houses also possessed the right to settle anywhere within the German Confederation. The Congress of Vienna specified that the Mediatised Houses were recognised as the first vassals in their respective states, and were equal in rank to the ruling houses. However the Congress of Vienna did not specify which houses were considered mediatised.|$|R
