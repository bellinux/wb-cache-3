50|$|<b>Mephenoxalone</b> (trade names Dorsiflex, Moderamin, Control-OM) is {{a muscle}} relaxant and mild anxiolytic. It {{inhibits}} neuron transmission, relaxing skeletal muscles by inhibiting the reflex arc. As {{the effect of}} muscle relaxation, <b>mephenoxalone</b> affects mental condition, and is also a treatment for nervousness and anxiety.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mephenoxalone</b> is a mild {{central nervous}} system {{depressant}} with activity resembling that of meprobamate. Since its introduction in 1961 <b>mephenoxalone</b> has been used as an anxiolytic and as a muscle relaxant, although the latter effect is weak. Preliminary studies on the absorption and disposition of <b>mephenoxalone</b> have been conducted in beagle dogs but no pharmacokinetic data from human studies have been reported, except for a single study in which the biotransformation products present in human urine were identified. Methods presently available for the determination of <b>mephenoxalone</b> in biological fluids lack the sensitivity, specificity and precision required for detailed pharmacokinetic studies. In this study, a rapid, sensitive, precise reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection at 200 nm was employed for the determination of <b>mephenoxalone</b> in biological fluids. Serum and urine samples were prepared for chromatographic analysis using simple liquid-liquid extraction techniques. The application of the assay to pharmacokinetic studies in humans is presented. After administration of a single oral dose of 400 mg <b>mephenoxalone</b> dispersed in 150 ml water to six young, healthy volunteers, the compound was rapidly absorbed with the peak concentration of 8 Î¼g/ml occurring after about 1 hour. The elimination half-life was approximately 3 hours. The drug was extensively metabolized with only about 1 percent of the administered dose being excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours. The bioavailability of a newly developed mephenoxalone-containing tablet was also investigated. The drug was absorbed more rapidly from the tablet than from the dispersed dose. This was attributed to a shorter in vivo dissolution time on the basis of in vitro tests, but this effect is not expected to be clinically significant. In addition, two human urinary metabolites of <b>mephenoxalone</b> were identified as unconjugated hydroxylated derivatives using thermospray HPLC-mass spectrometry. The plasma protein-binding properties of <b>mephenoxalone</b> were also investigated...|$|E
