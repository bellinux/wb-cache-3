The objectives {{of this study}} were to describe the population pharmacokinetics of rifapentine and 25 -desacetyl rifapentine in fasting and fed states. Thirty-five male healthy volunteers were enrolled in an open-label, randomized, sequential, five-way crossover study. Participants received a single 900 -mg dose of rifapentine after meals with high fat (<b>meal</b> A), <b>bulk</b> and low fat (<b>meal</b> B), <b>bulk</b> and high fat (meal C), high fluid and low fat (meal D), or 200 ml of water (meal E). Venous blood samples were collected over 72 h after each rifapentine dose, and plasma was analyzed for rifapentine and 25 -desacetyl rifapentine using high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed-effect modeling using NONMEM. Compared with the fasting state, meal A had the greatest effect on rifapentine oral bioavailability, increasing it by 86 %. Meals B, C, and D resulted in 33 %, 46 %, and 49 % increases in rifapentine oral bioavailability, respectively. Similar trends were observed for 25 -desacetyl rifapentine.

Because the effects of the wet solids properties such as consolidation behavior, water permeability and viscosity on the material discharge have not been investigated yet, existing design procedures employ the principles of Jenike for dry bulk materials to describe the stress fields in a surge bin during initial filling and discharge.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} interest in large-scale industrial use of lignocellulosic plant biomass as an alternative biofuel replacement of fossil fuels (coal) in power plant boilers. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a perennial energy crop {{has been one of}} the favorable feedstocks considered as a dedicated energy crop in existing systems. However, the physical and flow properties of switchgrass particulates differ from coal due to its inherent low bulk density, high aspect ratio and fibrous nature. Because of the very different characteristics of switchgrass compared to most bulk solids of rigid-plastic nature, the fundamental flow mechanics differ as well. This makes it difficult or impossible to feed switchgrass into utility boilers using existing handling equipment such as hoppers designed for coal. Thorough hopper design studies for irregular-shaped particulates such as switchgrass do not exist; this provided a need to investigate fundamental material properties of switchgrass particulates and their effect on the flow mechanics in hoppers under gravity discharge. ^ Relationships between particle and bulk properties of switchgrass ground to geometric mean sizes (dwg) of 0. 98, 0. 70 and 0. 34 mm by hammer milling through screen sizes, 6. 4, 3. 2 and 1. 6 mm, respectively, were evaluated. Particle size distribution decreased with size reduction indicating a smaller, more uniform particle size. Bulk density and particle density increased with size reduction indicating a less compressible bulk solid and improved handling. Particle shape (image analysis) suggested that the needle-shaped nature of switchgrass particles is an inherent characteristic that causes poor flowabilty and size reduction does not influence the shape of switchgrass particles. ^ Flow properties determined by shear testing provided relationships between compression and material strength. A comparison of flow properties to physical properties showed strong influences of particle size, particle size distribution and bulk density on the unconfined yield strength (UYS) and cohesion. Flow index values classified ground switchgrass of 0. 98 mm dwg as a cohesive poor-flowing material. Improved flow was suggested when switchgrass was ground through screen sizes smaller than 6. 4 mm, that is for dwg of 0. 70 and 0. 34 mm, respectively. ^ Dr. Andrew Jenike 2 Ì 7 s (1964) hopper design principles were applied to the ground switchgrass material. Observed discharge openings through experimental hopper tests agreed quite well with calculated results of Jenike 2 Ì 7 s method. A larger discharge opening was required for larger particle size and a less dense switchgrass bulk. Modeling of the hopper flow factor for Jenike 2 Ì 7 s approach and experimental hopper testing suggested that the hopper half angle, particle-particle friction (effective angle of internal friction) and particle-wall friction (wall-friction angle) were significant factors affecting hopper design for switchgrass biomass. Comparing results of an established hopper design to actual observations allowed the hopper design to be evaluated for effects of changes induced by particle size reduction on <b>bulk</b> solid <b>hopper</b> design. ^ The results from this dissertation work provided a fundamental understanding of material properties that comprise the flow mechanics in hoppers as well as design.

40|$|Abstract Background Rye {{products}} {{have been demonstrated}} to lower the acute insulin demand, induce a low and prolonged blood glucose response (high Glycemic Profile, GP) and reduce subclinical inflammation. These products may therefore contribute to a lowered risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardio vascular disease. The objective of the present paper was to evaluate the mechanism for a reduced postprandial insulin demand with rye products, and to explore possible appetite regulating properties. Methods 10 healthy subjects were served breakfast meals (50 g of available starch) with endosperm- or whole grain rye breads, with and without lactic acid, boiled whole grain rye- (RK) or wheat (WK) kernels, or white wheat bread reference (WWB) in random order in a cross-over design. Plasma concentrations of glucose, ghrelin, serum insulin, free fatty acids, adiponectin, breath hydrogen excretion (H 2), and subjective satiety was evaluated during the postprandial phase. 270 min after the breakfast, an ad lib lunch buffet was served and the voluntary energy intake (EI) was registered. Results All rye products and WK induced lower insulinemic indices (II) than WWB. A lower incremental insulin peak following breakfast correlated with a lower EI at lunch (r = 0. 38). A low II was related to improved satiety in the early postprandial phase (fullness AUC 0 - 60 min, r = - 0. 36). RK induced a higher GP compared to WWB and WK. A higher GP was related to a lowered desire to eat before lunch (AUC 210 - 270) and to a lower concentration of ghrelin in the late postprandial phase after breakfast (270 min), r = - 0. 29 and - 0. 29), which in turn was related to a lower voluntary EI (r = 0. 43 and 0. 33). The RK breakfast improved satiety in the early postprandial phase (0 - 60 min) compared to WWB, and induced a lower EI at lunch (- 16 %). A high content of indigestible carbohydrates in the breakfast products was related to improved satiety (0 - 60 min, r = 0. 68 for fullness), and a higher breath H 2 in the late postprandial phase (120 - 270 and 270 - 390 min, r = 0. 46 and 0. 70). High H 2 (AUC 120 - 270 min) also correlated with lower EI (r = - 0. 34). Conclusions Rye products, rich in indigestible carbohydrates, induce colonic fermentation already post the breakfast meal, and lowers acute insulin responses. A high excretion of breath H 2 also correlated with a higher GP. Especially, rye kernels induced a high GP which {{was associated with a}} 16 % lowering of energy intake at a subsequent lunch <b>meal.</b> The <b>bulking</b> effect of rye fiber, colonically derived fermentation metabolites, a high GP and a low insulin response possibly all contributes to the benefits on glucose- and appetite regulation seen in an acute and semi-acute perspective. </p...|$|R
40|$|Palm kernel meal (PKM) and {{copra meal}} (CM) {{are derived from}} the nuts of palm trees and are {{available}} in large quantities in many tropical countries. These potential feedstuffs are not widely used either for animal production or other purposes. Due to their high fibre contents, imbalanced amino acids, Maillard products (due to heat damage during drying and oil extraction processes) and their susceptibility to mould attack, these by-products have been regarded as low quality feedstuffs. However, if their value could be improved so that their inclusion in animal feeds resulted in good production, {{there would be a}} large number of benefits. A total of ten experiments have been conducted {{to improve the quality of}} these ingredients in broiler diets. There are two main scenarios for improving their use as feedstuffs, namely, by addition of exogenous enzymes and nutrients which are deficient and by manipulation of the physical characteristics of the ingredients. This project investigated the physical characteristics (bulk density and water holding capacity) and feeding value of PKM and CM by feeding the pure PKM and CM plus additional vitamins and minerals in poultry diets. Improvement of the quality of PKM was mainly based on nutritional manipulation by considering the digestible amino acids of the diet and adding enzymes. To increase the feeding value of copra meal, physical treatments were proposed, along with using exogenous enzymes and formulating diets based on digestible amino acid. The physical treatments applied in this study were pelleting, crumbling, soaking and finely grinding the diets. Parameters measured were growth rate, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, feed digestibility, apparent metabolizable energy (AME) of the diet, passage rate, jejunal viscosity, gut dimensions and digesta weight. The results of the experiments using palm kernel <b>meal</b> showed that <b>bulk</b> density and water holding capacity were 0. 57 g/cm 3 and 2. 93 g water/g feed respectively. These values are close to the values of conventional feedstuffs tested in this study. Accordingly, PKM is neither bulky nor watery when soaked. Therefore, feed intake was not affected by PKM. Palm kernel meal contains 13. 6 % protein with high arginine content, being 19. 2 mg/g. Ileal digestibilities of crude protein, arginine, lysine and methionine in PKM were 53. 6, 81. 9, 57. 2 and 71. 5 % respectively. Palm kernel meal could be used up to 40 %, provided that energy and amino acids are balanced. Body weights of birds fed diets containing up to 40 % PKM in the diet were similar to the body weight of birds fed corn-soy diets. Feed digestibility was low in PKM based diets, due to the high dietary fibre, causing birds to consume large amounts of feed to gain optimal growth. Jejunal digesta viscosity of birds fed PKM based diets was low compared with those of birds fed a corn soy diet. The use of enzymes did not improve the birdsÂ production significantly. However, feed digestibility and AME of the diet were increased when enzymes were added to the diet. Analysis of CM indicated that is bulk density and water holding capacity were much less and much greater respectively than values for conventional feedstuffs, being about 0. 49 g/cm 3 for bulk density and 4. 14 g water/g feed for water holding capacity. Copra meal contains 21. 7 % crude protein with high arginine content (30. 5 mg/g) but low in lysine (5. 5 mg/g). Ileal digestibility of crude protein, arginine, lysine and methionine were 63. 1, 85. 6, 51. 3 and 71. 1 % respectively. The use of CM in the diet lowered feed digestibility and AME of the diet. The birds fed CM based diets consumed more water and less feed than did birds fed corn-soy (CS) diets. The use of enzymes did not improve the growth rate of birds in the starter period but they did increase it to a similar level compared to birds fed the CS diet when the birds were kept for six or more weeks. Soaking the diet gave similar results to the addition of enzymes. However, fine grinding either CM or the whole diet decreased the performance of birds. Significant improvement in the growth rate of birds was made when either CM or the diet was pelleted and fed as crumbles but not when the pelleted material was finely ground. Measurement of gut response of birds consuming CM showed that gizzard weight was increased when the birds were fed the unmodified CM or pelleted CM but not when fed fine ground, soaked or enzyme supplemented CM diets. However, the birds fed the CM based diet had heavier intestines than those of birds fed the CS diet. No doubt due to their larger body size, the beak size was bigger in birds fed larger feed particle sizes. There was a significant correlation between the size of the feed particles eaten by the birds and the width of the beak. The birds tended to prefer a feed particles size of 40 % of the width of the beak. Larger feed particle sizes travelled down the digestive tract faster than finer feed particle sizes thus increasing feed intake and hence growth rate. In conclusion, there was no deleterious effect in using up to 40 % PKM in the diet provided that the diet was balanced, particularly in digestible amino acids and energy. Enzyme supplementation increased the digestibility of PKM based diets. Even if CM based diets were balanced, the use of enzymes, soaking the diets or pelleting the CM diet was needed to improve the feeding value of CM...|$|R
