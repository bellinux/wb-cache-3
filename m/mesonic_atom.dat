40|$|Quantum – {{mechanical}} {{problem on}} electron motion in Coulomb field plays the fundamental {{role in the}} modern physics, because solution of this problem provides the most realistic model of atomic structure. In nowadays the model of meson atom is of the same importance. Indeed, the mesoatom is unstable, hence the study of interaction of mesons with atomic nuclei can provide the valuable information {{on the nature of}} hadronic interactions and structure of atomic nucleus. The mesoatoms arise in the process of scattering of the negatively charged pions in matter. The pions captured by the target atoms populate initially the highly excited atomic orbits and then go down to 2 p and 1 s atomic states via cascade of radiative transitions. As far as the meson mass exceeds the electron mass for the two orders of magnitude then the <b>mesonic</b> <b>atom</b> orbit radius is much smaller than the radius of electron atom orbits. For example, the radius of the lowest mesonic orbits becomes comparable with the atomic nucleus size in the case of nucleus charge 12 Z [1]. As a result, for meson in 2 p state the probability to annihilate on atomic nucleus is higher than the probability to decay radiatively in 2 1 p s transition. In the atoms with the nucleus charge 40 Z the radiative transitions disappear before the cascade reaches the 2 p state. In the case of atoms with more heavy nuclei even the 3 d states can not often be occupied. Thus the study of the cascade x-ray spectra o...|$|E
40|$|Positronium Chemistry {{focuses on}} the methodologies, reactions, processes, and transformations {{involved}} in positronium chemistry. The publication first offers information on positrons and positronium and experimental methods, including <b>mesonic</b> <b>atoms,</b> angular correlation measurements, annihilation spectra, and statistical errors in delayed coincidence measurements. The text then ponders on positrons in gases and solids. The manuscript {{takes a look at}} the theoretical chemistry of positronium and positronium chemistry in gases. Topics include quenching, annihilation spectrum, delayed coincidenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} {{concerning the}} region of the nucleus in which the capture of K- mesons in K <b>mesonic</b> <b>atoms</b> predominantly occurs is re-examined in the light of a recent criticism. It is concluded that capture in the extreme peripheral region where the nuclear density is of the order of 5 per cent of the the central density and the existence of a neutron halo in heavy nuclei remain the most probable interpretation of the available data. © 1969.

40|$|The finite size {{effects and}} {{relativistic}} corrections in pionic and kaonic hydrogen are evaluated by generalizing the Breit equation for a spin- 0 - spin- 1 / 2 amplitude with {{the inclusion of}} the hadron electromagnetic form factors. The agreement of the relativistic corrections to the energies of the <b>mesonic</b> <b>atoms</b> with other methods used to evaluate them is not exact, but reasonably good. The precision values of the energy shifts due to the strong interaction, extracted from data, are however subject to the hadronic form factor uncertainties. Comment: 11 pages Late...|$|R
40|$|DEAR kaonic {{hydrogen}} data. The calculations {{are performed}} using chiral SU(3) e®ective ¯eld theory {{in combination with}} non-perturbative schemes based on coupled channels. Several variants of such approaches are compared with experimental data and the di®erences in the results are discussed. Coulomb and isospin-breaking e®ects {{turn out to be}} important and are both taken into account. The pole structure of the ¤(1405) -resonance close to the KN threshold is critically examined.
