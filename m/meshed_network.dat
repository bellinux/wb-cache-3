50|$|Along with Camillo Golgi, {{he was a}} major {{proponent of}} the reticular theory that the brain's nervous system {{consisted}} of processes of contiguous cells fused to create a massive <b>meshed</b> <b>network.</b> Gerlach summed up his theory by stating:the finest divisions of the protoplasmic processes ultimately {{take part in the}} formation of the fine nerve fibre network which I consider to be an essential constituent of the gray matter of the spinal cord. The divisions are none other than the beginnings of this nerve fibre net. The cells of the gray matter are therefore doubly connected by means the nerve process which becomes the axis fibre and through the finest branches of the protoplasmic processes which become a part of the fine nerve fibre net of the gray matter. The reticular theory predominated until the 1890s when Ramon y Cajal brought forth his neuron doctrine of synaptic junctions, which in essence replaced the reticular theory.|$|E

50|$|DMSs access {{real-time}} data and provide all {{information on a}} single console at the control centre in an integrated manner. Their development varied across different geographic territories. In the USA, for example, DMSs typically grew by takingOutage Management Systems to the next level, automating the complete sequences and providing an end to end, integrated view of the entire distribution spectrum. In the UK, by contrast, the much denser and more <b>meshed</b> <b>network</b> topologies, combined with stronger Health & Safety regulation, had led to early centralisation of high-voltage switching operations, initially using paper records and schematic diagrams printed onto large wallboards which were 'dressed' with magnetic symbols to show the current running states. There, DMSs grew initially from SCADA systems as these were expanded to allow these centralised control and safety management procedures to be managed electronically. These DMSs required even more detailed component/connectivity models and schematics than those needed by early OMSs as every possible isolation and earthing point on the networks had to be included. In territories such as the UK, therefore, the network component/connectivity models were usually developed in the DMS first, whereas in the USA these were generally built in the GIS.|$|E
