Later, Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) invite everyone to a dinner party at the home of Andy's band-mate Burly (Andrew Burlinson), where Andy is living. Ben (Adam Scott) tells Leslie (Amy Poehler) that his boss in Indianapolis wants him back on the road, but he has also been offered a job to work under Chris (Rob Lowe) in Pawnee. Although Leslie wants Ben to stay, she is hesitant to say so outright, disappointing him and leaving him conflicted over which job to take.|$|E

25|$|Playing a full 82 {{games in}} 2003–04, Smyth tallied 59 points (23 goals and 36 assists) {{to lead the}} Oilers in scoring for the second {{straight}} year. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Smyth spent the season inactive. As NHL play resumed the next year, he approached career-high totals with 36 goals and 66 points. With several young players emerging on the team's roster, Smyth ranked fourth in team scoring, behind Aleš Hemský, Shawn Horcoff and Jarret Stoll. His 19 power play goals came within one of the team record he previously set in his second year with the Oilers. Although Edmonton entered the 2006 playoffs as the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference, Smyth helped the team on a run to the Stanley Cup Finals with 16 points in 24 post-season games. During the second round against the San Jose Sharks, he was hit in the <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> puck {{as a result of a}} clearing attempt from defensive teammate Chris Pronger. After losing three teeth and needing stitches, Smyth returned in the third period and went on to set up Shawn Horcoff's game-winning goal in triple-overtime. The win reduced San Jose's series lead to 2–1, helping the Oilers eventually advance to the Conference Finals in six games. After eliminating the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the third round, the Oilers were ultimately defeated in seven games by the Carolina Hurricanes in the Finals.|$|E

500|$|In January 1913, Blair left Beebe for Reno {{with the}} {{intention}} of divorcing him, since at this time in history it was easier to obtain a divorce in Reno than in most other areas of the United States. The divorce was granted on August 29, 1913, after Blair had spent the minimum requirement of six months as a resident in Reno. Obtaining a divorce in Reno required a person to demonstrate that their spouse had committed either adultery or extreme cruelty; Blair's complaint accused Beebe of the latter, claiming that during the pheasant expedition he had threatened to commit suicide by [...] "throwing himself in the river, shooting himself through the roof of the <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> revolver, and by cutting his throat with a razor." [...] Beebe made very little effort to contest the divorce, and did not appear in court to offer any testimony. Although newspapers at the time reported Blair's accusations uncritically, with headlines such as [...] "Naturalist was cruel", modern biographers consider it more likely that Blair resorted to hyperbole {{in order to make a}} case for divorce. A week after her divorce from Beebe, Blair was remarried to their next-door neighbor Robin Niles, suggesting that the true reason for the divorce may have been cuckoldry. On the other hand, some biographers have suggested that Beebe suffered a nervous breakdown during the expedition, and that he may have contributed his own part to Blair's alienation.|$|E

[...] In the Allmusic review, critic Heather Phares wrote, [...] "...Yellowcard expands on its expected sound. Songs like the title track, 'Rough Landing, Holly,' and 'Down on My Head' are tightly crafted, state-of-the-art examples of shiny, earnest punk-pop that sounds sunny even when it's sad". Tony Pascarella of AbsolutePunk.net noted that [...] "we see flashes of the 'old' band on 'Rough Landing, Holly', but it’s not nearly widespread enough for my liking (although the song is possibly the best one on the new album)." [...] Bart Gottula of The Clarion commented that the song [...] "is probably one of the best songs" [...] off Lights and Sounds and concluded that it was because of its [...] "effective use of every instrument, a soulful blend of guitar, and excellent lyrics." ...|$|E
