These silvery-coloured fish have a single dorsal fin, which is soft, without spines. They have no lateral line and have a protruding lower jaw. Their size varies between subspecies: the Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) is small, 14 to 18cm; the proper Atlantic herring (C. h. harengus) can grow to about 46cm (18in) and weigh up 700 g (1.5lb); and Pacific herring grow to about 38cm (15in).|$|E

50|$|The shads are pelagic (open water) {{schooling}} fish, {{of which}} many are anadromous or even landlocked. Several species are of commercial importance, e.g. in the genus Alosa (river herrings), Brevoortia (<b>menhadens),</b> and Hilsa.|$|E
50|$|<b>Menhaden</b> are flat, have soft flesh, and {{a deeply}} forked tail. They rarely exceed 15 in in length, {{and have a}} varied weight range. Gulf <b>menhaden</b> and Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> are small oily-fleshed fish, bright silver, and {{characterized}} {{by a series of}} smaller spots behind the main, Humeral spot. They tend to have larger scales than Yellowfin <b>menhaden</b> and Finescale <b>menhaden.</b> In addition, Yellowfin <b>menhaden</b> tail rays are a bright yellow in contrast to those of the Atlantic <b>menhaden.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gulf <b>menhaden</b> are filter feeders, {{meaning that}} they collect food by {{filtering}} water through modifications of the branchial apparatus (gill or branchial arches and gill rakers). Like Atlantic <b>menhaden,</b> Gulf menhaden’s diet depends {{on the size of}} their gill rakers, which change as <b>menhaden</b> age. Larval gulf <b>menhaden</b> feed primary on zooplankton because the rakers are not well developed. The juveniles, which generally correspond to when they are under the age of 1, Gulf <b>menhaden</b> feed more on phytoplankton. As they age and their gill rakers fully developed, <b>menhaden</b> shift their diet to primarily consume phytoplankton.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Atlantic <b>menhaden,</b> {{compared}} to gulf <b>menhaden,</b> exhibit a life history pattern {{that appears to}} be adapted to a more unpredictable reproductive environment. From experiments on laboratory-reared eggs and larvae, Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> have larger eggs with larger yolk volume. They are larger at hatching, utilize their yolk faster, begin feeding at an earlier age, and are larger at onset of feeding. Egg size and the rate of morphogenesis from hatching to first feeding appeared to influence future larval size. When given ample food and reared at moderate (20 °C) to high (24 °C) temperatures, Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> were larger than gulf <b>menhaden</b> at 10 -days past first feeding even though growth of both larvae was similar. As Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> undergo their first apparent transformation at a relatively smaller size, they will spend relatively less time in the earliest life history stage. A synthesis of published adult life histories also indicated that Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> life histories are adapted to a more unpredictable reproductive environment. They have a larger maximum body size and are larger than gulf <b>menhaden</b> at any specific age. They are older than gulf <b>menhaden</b> at the onset of sexual maturity, but have a longer reproductive span. Stock-recruitment models indicated that variations in environmental factors {{play a major role in}} determining the number of Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> recruits, whereas environmental factors play a lesser role in gulf <b>menhaden</b> recruitment. Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> populations, unlike gulf <b>menhaden,</b> exhibit density-dependent growth suggesting that food resources for pre-recruit Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> may be limiting when numbers are high. Exploitation of Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> populations has resulted in a truncation of the population's age structure. This has resulted in: a contraction of spawning in time and space; a truncation of their reproductive span, thus altering the net reproductive rate; a loss in fecundity, as fecundity is age-specific; and if egg size is related to age of fish, a modification of the egg size distribution within the population. Overexploitation of gulf <b>menhaden</b> resulting in alteration of life history traits could have serious consequences because the reproductive span of this <b>menhaden</b> is so brief...|$|R

50|$|Clupeidae is {{a family}} of ray-finned fishes, comprising, for instance, the herrings, shads, sardines, hilsa, and <b>menhadens.</b> The {{clupeids}} include {{many of the most}} important food fishes in the world, and are also commonly caught for production of fish oil and fish meal. Many members of the family have a body protected with shiny cycloid scales (very smooth and uniform scales), a single dorsal fin, with a fusiform body for quick, evasive swimming and pursuit of prey composed of small planktonic animals. Due to their small size, and position in the lower trophic level of many marine food webs, the levels of methylmercury they bioaccumulate are very low, reducing the risk of mercury poisoning when consumed.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary {{associations}} {{among the}} four North American species of <b>menhadens</b> (Brevoortia spp.) have not been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, classifications separating the four species into small-scaled and large-scaled groups were evaluated by using DNA data, and genetic associations within these groups were explored. Specifically, data from the nuclear genome (microsatellites) and the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA sequences) were used to elicit patterns of recent and historical evolutionary associations. Nuclear DNA data indicated limited contemporary gene flow among the species, and also indicated higher relatedness within the small-scaled and large-scaled <b>menhadens</b> than between these groups. Mitochondrial DNA sequences of the large-scaled <b>menhadens</b> indicated the presence of two ancestral lineages, one of which contained members of both species. This result may indicate genetic diver-gence (reproductive isolation) followed by secondary contact (hybridization) between these species. In contrast, a single ancestral lineage indicated incomplete genetic divergence between the small-scaled menhaden.

5000|$|The Gulf <b>menhaden</b> (Brevoortia patronus) {{is a small}} marine filter-feeding fish {{belonging}} to the family Clupeidae.

40|$|Although <b>menhaden,</b> Brevoortia spp., {{represent}} 23. 5 {{percent of}} United States commercial fishery landings, they represent only about 2. 6 {{percent of the}} total landed value of fishery products.

40|$|Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> (Brevoortia tyrannus), through landings, {{support one}} of the largest {{commercial}} fisheries in the United States. Recent consolidation of the once coast-wide reduction fishery to waters within and around Chesapeake Bay has raised concerns over the possibility of the loss of unique genetic variation resulting from concentrated fishing pressure. To address this question, we surveyed variation at the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene region and seven nuclear microsatellite loci to evaluate stock structure of Atlantic <b>menhaden.</b> Samples were collected from up to three cohorts of Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> at four geographic locations along the U. S. Atlantic coast in 2006 and 2007, and from the closely related Gulf <b>menhaden</b> (B. patronus) in the Gulf of Mexico. Genetic divergence between Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> and Gulf <b>menhaden,</b> based on the COI gene region sequences and microsatellite loci, was more characteristic of conspecific populations than separate species. Hierarchical analyses of molecular variance indicated a homogeneous distribution of genetic variation within Atlantic <b>menhaden.</b> No significant variation was found between young-of-the-year <b>menhaden</b> (YOY) collected early and late in the season within Chesapeake Bay, between young-of-the-year and yearling <b>menhaden</b> collected in the Chesapeake Bay during the same year, between YOY and yearling <b>menhaden</b> taken in Chesapeake Bay in successive years, or among combined YOY and yearling Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> collected in both years from the four geographic locations.

40|$|Four {{recognized}} {{species of}} menhaden, Brevoortia spp., occur in North American marine waters: Atlantic menhaden, B. tyrannus; Gulf menhaden, B. patronus; yellowfin menhaden. B. smithi; and finescale menhaden, B. gunteri. Three of the menhaden species {{are known to}} form two hybrid types. Members of the genus range from coastal waters of Veracruz, Mex., to Nova Scotia, Can. Atlantic and Gulf menhaden are extremely abundant within their respective ranges and support extensive purse-seine reduction (to fish meal and oil) fisheries. All menhaden species are estuarine dependent through late larval and juvenile stages. Depending on species and location within the range, spawning may occur within bays and sounds to a substantial distance offshore. Menhaden {{are considered to be}} filter-feeding, planktivorous omnivores as juveniles and adults. Menhaden eggs, immature developmental stages, and adults are potential prey for a large and diverse number of predators. North American <b>menhadens,</b> including two hybrids, are hosts for the parasitic isopod, Olencira praegustator, and the parasitic copepod, Lemaeenicus radiatus. Although the data are quite variable, a dome-shaped Ricker function is frequently used to describe the spawner-recruitment relationship for Atlantic and Gulf menhaden. Each of these species is treated as a single stock with respect to exploitation by the purse-seine reduction fishery. Estimates of instantaneous natural (other) mortality rates are O. 45 for Atlantic menhaden and 1. 1 for Gulf menhaden...|$|E
50|$|According to James Kirkley of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), {{there are}} two {{established}} commercial fisheries for <b>menhaden.</b> The first {{is known as a}} reduction fishery.

40|$|PREFACE: Four {{species of}} <b>menhaden,</b> Brevoortia spp., are found along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States. The Atlantic <b>menhaden,</b> B. tyrannus, is found from Nova Scotia, Can., to West Palm Beach, Fla.; the yellowfin <b>menhaden,</b> B. smithi, is found from Cape Lookout, N. C., to the Mississippi River Delta, La.;the Gulf <b>menhaden,</b> B. patronus, is found from Cape Sable, Fla., to Veracruz, Mex.; and the finescale <b>menhaden,</b> B. gunteri, is found from the Mississippi River Delta, La., to Campeche, Mex. <b>Menhaden</b> are {{euryhaline}} species that inhabit coastal and inland tidal waters. Spawning occurs principally at sea (in northern areas some spawning occurs in bays and sounds). Eggs hatch at {{sea and the}} larvae are moved to estuaries by ocean currents where they metamorphose and develop as juveniles...|$|R
5000|$|The Gulf <b>menhaden</b> {{fishery is}} one of the largest in the United States. In 2013, the fishery {{supported}} four of the nation’s top ten ports by volume of landings. [...] Gulf <b>menhaden</b> are harvested primarily for fish meal and fish oil based products. A much smaller number of <b>menhaden</b> are caught for use as bait. In addition to being one of the largest fisheries in the US, the Gulf <b>menhaden</b> fishery has also been recognized internationally for its sustainability.|$|R
40|$|Gravid Atlantic <b>menhaden,</b> Brevoortia tyrannus, are {{available}} along the central coast of North Carolina {{during the fall}} and are harvested by the purse-seine fleet from the port of Beaufort. Virtually all of the catch, sexually immature fish included, is reduces to fish meal, fish oil, and fish solubles; however, minor quantities of roe from ripening female <b>menhaden</b> are extracted for local consupmtion. Routine and selective port sampling information was used to characterize the seasonal and biostatistical nautre of the roe <b>menhaden</b> catches at Beaufort. Fishermen recognize two size classes of roe Atlantic menhaden: "forerunners," which are usually the smallest and earliest adult <b>menhaden</b> encountered in the Fall Fishery, and "mammy shad," which are the largest <b>menhaden</b> harvested and produce the greatest roe yields. Roe is extracted from femal fish at various points along the reduction process stream and by several techniques. Vessel cremen and factory personnel extract <b>menhaden</b> roe for personal and local consumption. Undetermined quantities of <b>menhaden</b> roe are channeled into local retail seafood markets. Wholesale prices are about $ 20 per gallon of roe, while retail prices are about $ 5 per pound. Carteret County, North Carolina, is probably the only area on the U. S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts where <b>menhaden</b> roe is sold in retail seafood markets. The potential of extracting <b>menhaden</b> roe for foreign markets is discusse...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the change}} in striped bass {{population}} many have begun to cite the commercial harvesting of <b>menhaden</b> as the reasoning behind the shift. Several claims state that <b>menhaden</b> are a key staple in the striped bass diet. However, other studies see the striped bass as an opportunistic feeder {{with a variety of}} aquatic creatures that it consumes and therefore does not completely rely on the <b>menhaden.</b> In fact, <b>menhaden</b> has been represented as low as 8% of the striped bass diet.|$|R
50|$|Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> are filter feeders, {{meaning that}} they collect food by {{filtering}} water through modifications of the branchial apparatus (gill arches and gill rakers). Atlantic menhaden’s diet depends {{on the size of}} their gill rakers, which change as <b>menhaden</b> age. When the rakers are smaller, which generally correspond to when they are under the age of 1, Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> feed primarily on phytoplankton. As they age and their gill rakers grow larger, <b>menhaden</b> shift their diet to primarily consume zooplankton.|$|R
5000|$|The Gulf <b>menhaden</b> occurs {{throughout}} the Gulf of Mexico, but its distribution is patchy. The center of {{distribution of the}} species {{appears to be the}} northwest/northcentral Gulf, particularly in Louisiana and Texas where populations are very large and numerous. In the southern Gulf of Mexico the range of Gulf <b>menhaden</b> overlaps that of the closely related finescale <b>menhaden</b> (Brevoortia gunteri), and there is evidence for resource partitioning (a process whereby closely related species occurring in close proximity results in subtle differences in ecological niches) between these species. [...] In the eastern Gulf, the range of Gulf <b>menhaden</b> overlaps that of the yellowfin <b>menhaden</b> (Brevoortia smithi), and hybridization between these species has been demonstrated using morphological [...] and DNA evidence. [...] Gulf <b>menhaden</b> also may have a presence on the southern Atlantic coast of Florida, although this finding is based primarily upon DNA evidence.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Menhaden</b> {{travel in}} large, slow-moving, and tightly-packed schools with open mouths. Filter feeders {{typically}} take into their open mouths [...] "materials {{in the same}} proportions as they occur in ambient waters". <b>Menhaden</b> have two main sources of food: phytoplankton and zooplankton. A menhaden’s diet varies considerably {{over the course of}} its lifetime, and is directly related to its size. The smallest <b>menhaden,</b> typically those under one year old, eat primarily phytoplankton. After that age, adult <b>menhaden</b> gradually shift to a diet comprised almost exclusively of zooplankton.|$|R
50|$|<b>Menhaden</b> have {{historically}} {{been used as a}} fertilizer for crops. It is likely that <b>menhaden</b> is the fish that Squanto taught the Pilgrims to bury alongside freshly planted seeds as fertilizer. Other uses for <b>menhaden</b> include: feed for animals, bait for fish, oil for human consumption, oil for manufacturing purposes and oil as a fuel source.|$|R
