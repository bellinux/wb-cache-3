500|$|Dinklage has {{a form of}} dwarfism, achondroplasia, {{which affects}} bone growth. As a result, he is [...] tall, with a typical-sized head and torso but short limbs. While Dinklage has come to accept his condition, he {{sometimes}} found it challenging when growing up. In 2003, he {{said that when he}} was younger he was often angry and bitter about his condition, but as he got older, he realized that he [...] "just ha {{to have a sense of}} humor", to know [...] "that it's not your problem. It's theirs." [...] When asked in 2012 whether he saw himself as [...] "a spokesman for the rights of little people", Dinklage responded: [...] "I don't know what I would say. Everyone's different. Every person <b>my</b> <b>size</b> has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I'm seemingly okay with it, I can't preach how to be okay with it." [...] Dinklage has been viewed as a role model for people sharing his condition.|$|E
500|$|Dinklage {{found his}} {{breakthrough}} playing Finbar McBride, {{who is a}} quiet, withdrawn, unmarried man in the 2003 Tom McCarthy-directed film The Station Agent. According to co-star Bobby Cannavale, the film took three years to make and was not at first written with Dinklage in mind, Cannavale said McCarthy [...] "set out {{to tell a story}} about a guy who was a train enthusiast who had chosen to isolate himself from the world", but when McCarthy actually started [...] "putting pen to paper" [...] for the screenplay he decided to write the role for him. Speaking about the role, Dinklage noted that usually [...] "roles written for someone <b>my</b> <b>size</b> are a little flat"—often either comical or [...] "sort of Lord of the Rings" [...] type characters filled with wisdom; further: [...] "They're not sexual, they're not romantic" [...] and [...] "they're not flawed". What attracted him to the character McCarthy had written was that it was not one of the stereotypical roles people with dwarfism play; rather, McBride has [...] "romantic feelings" [...] as well as [...] "anger and ... flaws". The role earned him the Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor nominations. In the New York Observer, reviewer Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Dinklage projects both size and intelligence in the fascinating reticence of his face." [...] Besides being Dinklage's highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Station Agent was modestly successful at the box office, earning over $8 million against its small budget.|$|E
500|$|Alan Simpson, the co-writer of Hancock, enjoyed {{writing for}} Jacques, {{and thought that}} she was [...] "almost like a fella in terms of playing comedy; you didn't write for her {{thinking}} she's a woman so we've got to write the feminine point of view. That made it easier for us". Neville Phillips thought she was a [...] "complete revelation", adding [...] "although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she had a way of playing comedy that put me in mind of the great Beatrice Lillie... a subtle, sophisticated actress". Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: [...] "She was such a great comedienne... everyone wanted her but the movers and shakers of entertainment didn't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady". Guy Pearce, writing in the Daily Express, noted that [...] "she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing 'the fattie'." [...] The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been [...] "unimaginatively cast as the 'fat person'" [...] in ITMA, while in Sykes, her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes [...] "hardly ever made jokes about <b>my</b> <b>size</b> which was a refreshing change". Gray considers that [...] "although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight".|$|E

He usually {{did not respond to}} their taunts. Weise said, [...] "Because of <b>my</b> <b>size</b> and appearance people don't give me as much trouble as they would if I looked weak." [...] Several students remember Weise as being non-violent. In addition, a family member said that students were aware of the suicide of Weise's father and his mother's being confined to a nursing home while he attended the high school.|$|E
2500|$|Kinard was {{selected}} by the Brooklyn Dodgers {{in the third round}} (18th overall pick) of the 1938 NFL Draft. He made $1,974 as a rookie, a sum that Kinard recalled [...] "was a lot of money back then." [...] Even in 1938, Kinard was small for a lineman at 210 pounds, but he noted: [...] "I had enough ability to offset <b>my</b> <b>size.</b> And my speed was a lot better than any of the linemen." [...] He was a two-way player known for making [...] "crushing blocks" [...] on offense and as as [...] "smothering, dominant tackler" [...] who made [...] "stops all over the field" [...] on defense.|$|E

[...] A close friend, a younger boy who lived in her building, burned to death in her presence after an accident. In 1919, Bow enrolled in Bay Ridge High School for Girls. [...] "I wore sweaters and old skirts...didn't want to be treated like a girl...there was one boy who had always been my pal... he kissed me... I wasn't sore. I didn't get indignant. I was horrified and hurt." ...|$|E

2500|$|At 5 feet, 11inches, and 185 pounds, Doll {{was small}} for a {{professional}} football player. [...] In a 1954 profile on Doll, a reporter noted, [...] "Don, who's built like a bank clerk, piano tuner, soda jerk, errand boy or -- egad -- even a sports writer doesn't look any more like a pro gridder than your cousin Joe." [...] Doll explained how he handled the disparity in size with the players he was required to tackle: [...] "I just throw a shoulder into 'em and hit 'em low. [...] If they are over two tons I aim for their shoelaces. [...] If they're medium sized (around boxcar weight) I hit for the thighs. [...] I'll admit I do not drive 'em back but I stop 'em where they are. ... <b>My</b> <b>size</b> is no detriment in football. [...] I rate as the No. 1 asset the 'desire' to tackle. [...] And I've plenty of that desire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{engaged in}} a feud with Don Frye during {{his career in the}} Pride Fighting Championships, whose {{background}} was Don Frye's trash talking. In 1999, Alicia Webb (also known as Ryan Shamrock) dated Ken Shamrock until early 2003. Frye made comments to the effect that Shamrock cheated on and divorced his wife to date a young girl (Alicia Webb was 19 and Ken Shamrock was 35 when they started dating). Frye also joked that Ken's (at the time) estranged father Bob and brother Frank would be in Frye's corner for the fight. Ken Shamrock was enraged by Frye's trash talk, causing a feud between Shamrock and Frye. Since then, Frye has stated that he only resorted to personal trash talk to make Ken want to fight him. Frye said: [...] "I saw Ken Shamrock whoop him (Dan Severn) at UFC 6 and I thought, [...] "That's a guy I gotta fight. Anybody who can whoop Dan Severn like that has gotta be a man and I want to test <b>my</b> <b>size</b> against his size. I had the chance to talk trash and they gave me the fight; I crossed the line. I wasn't professional about it, but Ken was and after the fight, we shook hands and went our separate ways." ...|$|E
