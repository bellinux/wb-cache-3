50|$|Atlas E and F {{used the}} <b>MA-3</b> {{propulsion}} system {{which had a}} separate gas generator for all three engines, unlike the Atlas D where one gas generator drove both booster turbopumps. In addition, they used pyrotechnic cartridges for rapid starting and the gas generators and pumps were mounted on each booster engine instead of being placed in the central thrust section. Total thrust of the <b>MA-3</b> was 375,000 pounds.|$|E
50|$|EMER K is a {{designation}} for two completely unrelated {{assault rifles}} currently {{in use in}} Burma as the EMER K-1 and EMER K-3. The EMER K-1 is a 5.56×45mm NATO bullpup rifle. EMERK <b>MA-3</b> is letest bullpup model, {{believed to be a}} copy of Chinese QBZ-97.|$|E
5000|$|Mercury-Atlas 3 (<b>MA-3)</b> was an {{unmanned}} spaceflight of the Mercury program. It {{was launched}} unmanned on April 25, 1961 at 16:15 UTC, from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Mercury capsule contained a robotic [...] "mechanical astronaut". Mercury spacecraft No. 8 and Atlas No. 8 100-D {{were used in}} the mission.|$|E
50|$|The Nashua River Wild and Scenic River Study Act was {{introduced}} into the United States House of Representatives on January 23, 2013 by Rep. Niki Tsongas (D, <b>MA-3).</b> It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. It was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-166 on July 22, 2013.|$|E
50|$|Central {{to these}} efforts was the {{development}} of the Abort Sensing and Implementation System (ASIS), which would detect malfunctions in the Atlas's various components and trigger a launch abort if necessary. Added redundancy was built in; if ASIS itself failed, the loss of power would also trigger an abort. The system was tested on a few Atlas ICBM flights prior to Mercury-Atlas 1 in July 1960, where it was operated open-loop (<b>MA-3</b> in April 1961 would be the first closed-loop flight).|$|E
50|$|During {{preparations}} for launch, a seal {{on the number}} B2 engine of the <b>MA-3</b> booster section of the Atlas was replaced. Sealant from this seeped into three coolant holes, plugging them. Four seconds after liftoff, the engine overheated and burned through its gas generator, severing an oxidiser line. Within {{seven and a half}} seconds of launch the engine lost thrust, causing the rocket to pitch out of control. It was destroyed by range safety, with debris landing within 150 m of the launch pad, less than twenty seconds after liftoff.|$|E
50|$|There were {{a series}} of delays getting the Atlas and Mercury capsule ready, because the postflight {{findings}} from <b>MA-3</b> had necessitated extensive modifications to the booster. Vehicle 88D did not undergo its factory rollout inspection until June 30 and delivery to the Cape waited until July 15. Moreover, the flight {{was not going to}} use Mercury capsule #9 as planned, but instead capsule #8, which had been recovered from the MA3 launch and refurbished. Capsule #8 was also the last of the older models with small port windows, no landing bag, and a heavy locking mechanism on the hatch.|$|E
5000|$|Spacecraft #9 had {{originally}} been intended to fly on MA-4, but Spacecraft #8 was used instead after having been recycled from the failed <b>MA-3</b> launch. #9 was {{the second of the}} [...] "Mark II" [...] Mercury capsules with a larger square window and explosive bolt hatch, while the older [...] "Mark I" [...] capsule had small port windows and a heavy locking mechanism. Gus Grissom's flight on MR-4 had used a Mark II capsule, but it was necessary to test it on a proper orbital mission to ensure that the large window could handle the much higher heat of reentry there.|$|E
5000|$|The global average {{temperature}} in the mid-Pliocene (3.3 <b>Ma-3</b> Ma) was 2-3 °C higher than today, global sea level 25m higher [...] and the northern hemisphere ice sheet was ephemeral {{before the onset of}} extensive glaciation over Greenland that occurred in the late Pliocene around 3 Ma.The formation of an Arctic ice cap is signaled by an abrupt shift in oxygen isotope ratios and ice-rafted cobbles in the North Atlantic and North Pacific ocean beds. Mid-latitude glaciation was probably underway {{before the end of the}} epoch. The global cooling that occurred during the Pliocene may have spurred on the disappearance of forests and the spread of grasslands and savannas.|$|E
5000|$|At first solely {{referred}} to as the infamous [...] "Space Bounty Hunter," [...] it is later discovered that he is a creation of Mechadoc. He has no feelings or compassion, and will {{do whatever it takes to}} reach his goal. He uses the lightning bomb and balloon bomb, similar to the missing Mighty. Max's body was destroyed in episode 51, but he manages to write his data into Zero before Zero begins the lethal hit, hence taking control of his body. Max's spirit was destroyed by Shirobon's ruse bomb, saving the fatally wounded Zero. There are five other units based on this unit. They are Zero (Zero) (MA-0), <b>MA-3</b> (...) , MA-5 (...) , MA-7 (...) and MA-9 (...) ...|$|E
50|$|Investigation of {{telemetry}} data quickly {{narrowed the}} cause of the failure to a fault somewhere in the guidance system, but the exact nature of it could not be determined. It appeared that the missile programmer either shut off completely shortly after liftoff or suffered a power outage, restarted, and then failed to execute the pitch and roll sequence. Two months after the <b>MA-3</b> flight, the Atlas's programmer was discovered buried in mud on a beach not far from the launch pad and examined. The exact cause of the failure was not determined with certainty, however several possible causes were proposed, including contamination of pins in the programmer or a transient voltage that had caused the programmer to reset itself. The programmer on the whole was found to have several serious design flaws that required correction.|$|E
50|$|After MA-1 was {{destroyed}} in-flight {{due to a}} structural failure, NASA began requesting that Convair deliver Atlases with thicker skin. Atlas 10D (as well as its backup vehicle 20D which was later used for the first Atlas-Able flight), the booster used for the Big Joe test in September 1959, had sported thick skin and verified that this was needed for the heavy Mercury capsule. Atlas 100D {{would be the first}} thick-skinned booster delivered while in the meantime, MA-2's booster (67D) which was still a thin-skinned model, had to be equipped with a steel reinforcement band at the interface between the capsule and the booster. Under original plans, Atlas 77D was to have been the booster used for <b>MA-3.</b> It received its factory rollout inspection in September 1960, but shortly afterwards, the postflight findings for MA-1 came out which led to the thin-skinned 77D being recalled and replaced by 100D.|$|E
50|$|At this time, NASA {{was getting}} {{increasingly}} {{frustrated with the}} Atlas's poor launch record. Of four Mercury-Atlas flights so far, two (MA-1 and <b>MA-3)</b> had been total failures. One (Big Joe) had been a partial success and the otherwise completely successful MA-2 had experienced propellant slosh problems. In addition, the Atlas had not performed well in unmanned programs either as three Atlas-Able lunar probe launches in 1959 - 60 had all failed. The Air Force was also experiencing problems with military launches as a MIDAS early warning satellite and a SAMOS photoreconnaissance satellite launched with AtlasAgenas both failed to orbit during 1960. Only {{a few days before}} the flight of MA4 in September 1961, an AtlasAgena carrying a SAMOS satellite fell back on the launch pad at Vandenberg AFB, producing a spectacular explosion. Atlas ICBM tests at this time were still routinely failing as well.|$|E
50|$|These {{incidents}} {{produced a}} series of confrontations between NASA and Convair, the builders of the Atlas. As August 1961 ended, there had been 14 Atlas space launches (SCORE, Big Joe, the three Atlas-Able flights, Midas 1-3, Samos 1-2, Mercury-Atlas 1, Mercury-Atlas 2, Mercury-Atlas 3, and Ranger 1). Of these, eight were total losses and one had been a partial failure, yielding a 30% success rate. Convair argued {{that many of the}} failed Atlas space launches were due to faults of the upper stages or payload rather than the Atlas itself and on this point were correct. Only Big Joe and <b>MA-3</b> could be directly blamed on a malfunction of the Atlas and the former's problems still did not preclude the mission from carrying out most of its goals. In any case, Atlas was hardly alone in reliability issues; the other workhorse of the US space program, Thor, had a launch record that was scarcely better.|$|E
5000|$|Douglas further refined {{the design}} by {{choosing}} bolted tank bulkheads (as {{opposed to the}} initially suggested welded ones) and a tapered fuel tank for improved aerodynamics. The engine was developed as a direct descendant of the Atlas <b>MA-3</b> booster engine. Changes involved removal of one thrust chamber and a rerouting of the plumbing to allow the engine to fit within the smaller Thor thrust section. Engine tests were being performed as of March 1956. The first engineering model engine was available in June, followed by the first flight engine in September. Engine development was complicated by serious turbopump problems. Early Thor engines suffered from [...] "bearing walking", a phenomenon that occurred at high altitude as the air thinned, causing the lubricant oil in the pump to foam and push the bearings out of their sockets. When this happened, the turbopump would shut down, terminating engine thrust. The initial Thor tests in 1957 used {{an early version of}} the Rocketdyne LR-79 engine with a conical thrust chamber and 135,000 pounds of thrust. By early 1958, this had been replaced by an improved model with a bell-shaped thrust chamber and 150,000 pounds of thrust. The fully developed Thor IRBM had 162,000 pounds of thrust.|$|E
50|$|So far, the Atlas F {{test program}} had gone well {{and nobody was}} {{prepared}} for the upcoming disaster on April 9, 1962 when Missile 11F exploded only one second after liftoff from LC-11. Subsequent investigation found that the sustainer LOX turbopump exploded due to the impeller blades rubbing against the metal casing and causing a spark that ignited the LOX. This failure mode also occurred in two static firing tests of the <b>MA-3</b> engines, and it led to a plastic liner being added to the turbopump casing. Testing now began at Vandenberg AFB and Missile 15F flew successfully from 576-E on August 1. Nine days later, Missile 57F launched from OSTF-1 and failed to perform its roll maneuver. The pitch sequence was executed properly, {{but the lack of}} the roll program prevented the missile from attaining the correct trajectory and it was blown up by Range Safety 67 seconds into the launch. An electrical short in the programmer was found to be the cause, although the specific failure point was not determined. The roll signal had been extremely weak and barely enough to have any effect, as a consequence the missile's flight path was about 53° {{to the right of the}} planned trajectory. The next test launch took place from the now-repaired LC-11 at the Cape two days later and all subsequent R&D flights went without a hitch except for 13F on November 14 which experienced a thrust section fire at liftoff that led to sustainer shutdown. The booster engines retained attitude control until BECO, at which point the absence of sustainer thrust resulted in immediate missile tumbling and loss of the mission. The cause of the thrust section fire was unknown, however a fuel leak was suspected. The next launch, Missile 21F, successfully concluded the R&D phase of the Atlas F program.|$|E
