Configuration effects were assessed for lift improvement devices, lift/cruise nozzle rails, nozzle perimeter plates, and alternate nose fan exit hubs. Tests were conducted at four model heights (H/D = 0. 95, 1. 53, 3. 06 and 6. 45, where D {{is the average}} nozzle exit diameter equal to 0. 997 m.) Results are presented and discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In 1969, John {{along with}} Paul Shockey started Condor Industries and began {{manufacturing}} self-propelled, telescoping hydraulic ariel 'cherry-picker' style lifts, {{primarily for the}} aircraft maintenance industry [...] In 1973, Condor Industries was renamed JLG Industries (JLG for John L. Grove). With innovative products and designs, such as <b>mounting</b> <b>lifts</b> on track-driven frames, locating the crane operators cab on the turret, less expensive truck mounted cranes, and 'scissors' lifts, JLG Industries had over 700 employees and 30 million in sales by the late 1970s. JLG became in 2006 part of Oshkosh Corporation.|$|R

50|$|The Mi-X1 is {{designed}} to have a take-off weight of just 10 tons, seat 25 passengers and fly to 1,500 km. It has one main rotor and a rear <b>mount</b> <b>lift</b> rotor. The helicopter’s single main rotor means {{that in order to}} travel at high speeds it will have to overcome the retreating blade stall (RBS). This phenomenon occurs at airspeeds of some 300 km/h, and leads to vibrations that may ultimately destroy the rotor. Mil’s solution to fighting the onset of the RBS is to offload the rotor {{with the help of the}} proprietary Stall Local Elimination System (SLES). According to Mil Chief Designer Nikolay Pavlenko, the designers have already agreed to test SLES at Russia’s TsAGI Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute.|$|R

50|$|Rockwell International built, {{and then}} abandoned, the Rockwell XFV-12 {{supersonic}} fighter which had an unusual wing which opened up like window blinds {{to create an}} ejector pump for vertical flight. It never generated enough lift {{to get off the}} ground despite developing 20,000 lbf of thrust. The French had a nominally Mach 2 Dassault Mirage IIIV fitted with no less than 8 lift engines that flew (and crashed), but did not have enough space for fuel or payload for combat missions. The German EWR VJ 101 used swiveling engines mounted on the wingtips with fuselage <b>mounted</b> <b>lift</b> engines, and the VJ 101C X1 reached supersonic flight (Mach 1.08) on 29 July 1964. The supersonic Hawker Siddeley P.1154, which competed with the Mirage IIIV for use in NATO, was cancelled even as the aircraft were being built.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mount</b> Martin cane <b>lift</b> {{is one of}} a {{group of}} lifts in the Mackay region, one of Queensland's oldest and most {{productive}} sugar cane growing areas. Historically, sugar has been one of the State's most important agricultural commodities. The lifts are important in demonstrating the evolution of the industry in that they provide evidence of how harvested cane was transported before the introduction of mechanical chopper harvesters. Sugar cane was originally harvested and transported to mills as whole stalks. The lifts were used to hoist bundles of stalks into tram or train wagons. They became redundant after the universal adoption of chopper harvesters from the 1960s. The <b>Mount</b> Martin <b>lift</b> dates to before 1939.|$|R
5000|$|At the Paris Air Show in 1963, the Fw 260 {{design was}} joined by {{a model of the}} Fw 300, a short-haul variant of the Fw 260.

5000|$|In 1962, Lockheed {{built the}} XV-4 Hummingbird for the U.S. Army. It sought to [...] "augment" [...] {{available}} thrust by injecting the engine exhaust into an ejector pump in the fuselage. First flying vertically in 1963, it suffered a fatal crash in 1964. It was converted into the XV-4B Hummingbird for the U.S. Air Force as a testbed for separate, vertically <b>mounted</b> <b>lift</b> engines, {{similar to those}} used in the Yak-38 Forger. That plane flew and later crashed in 1969. The Ryan XV-5 Vertifan, which was also built for the U.S. Army {{at the same time as}} the Hummingbird, experimented with gas-driven lift fans. That plane used fans in the nose and each wing, covered by doors which resembled half garbage can lids when raised. However, it crashed twice, and proved to generate a disappointing amount of lift, and was difficult to transition to horizontal flight.|$|R

40|$|Nonplanar {{wing tip}} <b>mounted</b> <b>lifting</b> {{surfaces}} reduce lift induced drag substantially. Winglets, which are small, nearly vertical, winglike surfaces, are {{an example of}} these devices. To achieve reduction in lift induced drag, winglets produce significant side forces. Consequently, these surfaces can seriously affect airplane lateral directional aerodynamic characteristics. Therefore, the effects of nonplanar wing tip mounted surfaces on the lateral directional stability and control of low speed general aviation airplanes were studied. The study consists of a theoretical and an experimental, in flight investigation. The experimental investigation involves flight tests of winglets on an agricultural airplane. Results of these tests demonstrate the significant influence of winglets on airplane lateral directional aerodynamic characteristics. It is shown that good correlations exist between experimental data and theoretically predicted results. In addition, a lifting surface method was used to perform a parametric study {{of the effects of}} various winglet parameters on lateral directional stability derivatives of general aviation type wings...|$|R
5000|$|Two further tilt bridges {{are known}} to exist in Belgium, both {{constructed}} in 2011. The Scheepsdalebrug (Scheepsdalebridge) in Brugge and the Sint-Annabrug over the river Dender in Aalst. The former combines the working mechanisms of a rolling lift bascule bridge and a tilt bridge: the bridge is <b>mounted</b> on two <b>lifting</b> arms which roll along racks, positioned parallel to the navigable way, tilting up the bridge leaf providing a clearance for passing ships. The latter is <b>mounted</b> on two <b>lifting</b> arms which are connected to fixed pivot points a few feet downstream from the bridge leaf.|$|R

The depiction is labelled variously as Ravana <b>Lifting</b> <b>Mount</b> Kailash or Ravana Shaking Mount Kailash. According to Hindu scriptures, Ravana once tried to <b>lift</b> <b>Mount</b> Kailash, but Shiva pushed the mountain into place and trapped Ravana beneath it. For a thousand years, the imprisoned Ravana sang hymns in praise of Shiva, who finally blessed him and granted him an invincible sword or a powerful linga (Shiva's aniconic symbol) to worship.|$|R

Let the reader imagine himself for a moment withdrawn from the sounds and motion of the living world, and sent forth alone into this wild and wasted plain. The earth yields and crumbles beneath his foot, tread he never so lightly, for its substance is white, hollow, and carious, like the dusty wreck of the bones of men. The long knotted grass waves and tosses feebly in the evening wind, and the shadows of its motion shake feverishly along the banks of ruin that lift themselves to the sunlight. Hillocks of mouldering earth heave around him, as if the dead beneath were struggling in their sleep. Scattered blocks of black stone, four-square remnants of mighty edifices, not one left upon another, lie upon them to keep them down. A dull purple poisonous haze stretches level along the desert, veiling its spectral wrecks of massy ruins, on whose rents the red light rests, like dying fire on defiled altars; the blue ridge of the Alban <b>Mount</b> <b>lifts</b> itself against a solemn space of green, clear, quiet sky. Watch-towers of dark clouds stand steadfastly along the promontories of the Apennines.
