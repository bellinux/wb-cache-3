50|$|The {{role of a}} flux {{in joining}} {{processes}} is typically dual: dissolving of the oxides on the metal surface, which facilitates wetting by molten metal, and acting as an oxygen barrier by coating the hot surface, preventing its oxidation. In some applications <b>molten</b> <b>flux</b> {{also serves as a}} heat transfer medium, facilitating heating of the joint by the soldering tool or molten solder.|$|E
50|$|While {{molten solder}} has low {{tendency}} {{to adhere to}} organic materials, molten fluxes, especially of the resin/rosin type, adhere well to fingers. A mass of hot sticky flux can transfer more heat to skin and cause more serious burns than a comparable particle of non-adhering molten metal, which can be quickly shaken off. In this regard, <b>molten</b> <b>flux</b> is similar to molten hot glue.|$|E
50|$|The flux starts {{depositing}} on {{the joint}} to be welded. Since the flux when cold is non-conductor of electricity, the arc may be struck either by touching the electrode {{with the work}} piece or by placing steel wool between electrode and job before switching on the welding current or by using a high frequency unit. In all cases the arc is struck under a cover of flux. Flux otherwise is an insulator but once it melts due to heat of the arc, it becomes highly conductive and hence the current flow is maintained between the electrode and the workpiece through the <b>molten</b> <b>flux.</b> The upper portion of the flux, in contact with atmosphere, which is visible remains granular (unchanged) and can be reused. The lower, melted flux becomes slag, which is waste material and must be removed after welding.|$|E

Solid oxide membrane (SOM) based electrolysis process is an innovative technology that has been demonstrated to successfully produce many energy-intensive metals directly from their oxides in an efficient, economical and environmentally sound way. During the SOM electrolysis process, an oxygen-ion-conducting SOM tube made of ytteria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) separates the pre-selected <b>molten</b> <b>flux</b> with dissolved metal oxide from the inert anode assembly inside the YSZ tube.
