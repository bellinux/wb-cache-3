40|$|The Thatcher and Reagan administrations led a {{shift towards}} more market {{oriented}} regulation of {{economies in the}} Anglo-American countries, including efforts to reduce the power of organized labor. In this paper, we examine the development of employment and labor law in six Anglo-American countries (the U. S., Canada, the U. K., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand) from the Thatcher/Reagan era to the present. At {{the outset of the}} Thatcher/Reagan era, the employment and labor law systems in these countries could be divided into three pairings: the Wagner Act model based industrial relations systems of the United States and Canada; the voluntarist system of collective bargaining and strong unions in the United Kingdom and Ireland; and the highly centralized, legalistic Award systems of Australia and New Zealand. Indeed, such a historical perspective contradicts the idea {{that there has been a}} longstanding Anglo-American model of liberal market economic ordering as has sometimes been suggested, e. g. in the varieties of capitalism literature. However, looking at the current state of the employment relations systems in these six countries, we argue that there has been growing convergence in two major areas. There has been a convergence in the area of labour rights toward private ordering of employment relations and away from the idea of work and employment being a matter subject to public ordering. By private ordering, we mean the idea that work and employment terms and conditions are primarily determined at the level of the individual organization, whether through collective bargaining between unions and employers at the organizational level, through individual negotiations, or through unilateral employer establishment of the terms and conditions of employment. The shift away from public ordering of work and employment is most dramatic in the cases of Australia and New Zealand, where the publicly established system of centralized Awards has given way to organizational level ordering of employment relations through workplace or individual level agreements. In the United Kingdom, the shift to greater private ordering is most evident in the breakdown of <b>multi-employer</b> collective <b>bargaining,</b> the weakening of industry wide standards enforced by strong unions, and the growth of nonunion representation at the enterprise level. By contrast, the much lesser degree of change in the labour rights area in North America reflects the historical situation that the Wagner Act model was from the outset a model built around the idea of private ordering. When we turn to the area of employment rights, we also see a convergence across the six Anglo-American countries toward a model in which the role of employment law is to establish a basket of minimum standards that are built into the employment relationship, which can then be improved upon by the parties. Within these general trends, we do see some variation in the degree of convergence on these models of labour and employment rights regulation across the Anglo-American countries. The strongest degree of similarity in adoption of the private ordering in labour rights and the minimum standards basket in employment rights is found in four of the countries: Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and, with recent legislative changes, Australia. Each of these countries has adopted labour laws that favour organizational level economic ordering, but with reasonably substantial protections of trade union organizing and bargaining rights, and a set of minimum employment standards that includes similar sets of minimum wage, basic leave entitlements and unfair dismissal protections. The first outlier in this study is Ireland. The Irish employment relations system stands out as the only one that has continued to have a significant degree of central coordination and public ordering of employment relations. Although there is substantial coordination at the central level, at the organizational level, the Irish system resembles the other Anglo-American countries much more closely, suggesting that it has the potential to evolve in a similar direction. The other outlier is the United States. Structurally its system is similar to the other Anglo-American countries in emphasizing private ordering in labour law and the role of employment law as being to establish a minimum basket of basic standards. However, where the United States diverges from the other countries is that its system has involved a general favouring of the interests of employers over those of employees and organized labour in the implementation of the model...|$|R

40|$|Base sur une {{recherche}} réalisée en 1983, cet article examine les facteurs économiques, institutionnels, juridiques et technologiques qui ont favorise le développement du travail à domicile dans l'industrie du vêtement au Québec. Il propose des moyens pour contrôler ce type de travail. Based on a 1983 study, {{this article}} examines the economic, institutional, legislative and technological factors which have allowed homework to develop in the garment industry in Quebec. It proposes ways in which it could be brought under control. Historically, it can be shown that homework has disappeared and reappeared in the garment and textile industries at periodic intervals as a function firstly of the evolution of technology and secondly of the general economic climate which determines the availability of cheap, docile manpower for this kind of work. For example, the specialized, high-speed machines now used for men's garments make it unprofitable to use homework in this sector. For women's garments, on the other hand, the great variety of styles, each produced in relatively short series, makes use of an ordinary sewing machine in the home competitive with factory-based techniques. We estimate that, in 1981, there were some 30 000 homeworkers in the garment industry in Quebec, mainly in the women's and children's clothing sectors, and that the development of homework is responsible for {{a significant portion of the}} decline in measured employment observed in these sectors since 1974. Present legislation is ineffective in controlling homework. The unstable nature of the clothing market, attributable in large measure to the absence of a long-term, overall policy on imports, has made entrepreneurs extremely hesitant to invest in modem machinery. It has also led them to seek cost-cutting measures of any kind including the use of homeworkers at below-standard wages and working conditions. The result has been not only a significant decline in the rate of unionization from 55. 8 % in 1976 to 45. 6 % in 1983 in the women's clothing sector but also an erosion of the competitive capacity of the industry by moving it into the lower-quality section of the market. Unlike other jurisdiction, Quebec has the Collective Agreement Decrees Actin addition to minimum standards legislation and the Labour Codewhich provides for collective bargaining. The Collective Agreement Decrees Actpermits the Minister of Labour to extend certain terms of an existing collective contract to the whole of an industry (regionally or provincially). Of the 53 decrees existing in 1981, nine applied to the garment industry. Because a decree can be adapted to the particular conditions in an industry and because it requires the direct participation of unions and employers, the authors of this article are of the opinion that it offers the best possibility for controlling and eventually eliminating homework in the garment industry. Along with a coherent policy on imports and support to investment and technological innovation, it would be possible to give this industry a new lease on life. A first requirement would be to rationalize the existing decrees in the garment industry by reducing the number from nine, some of which cover only a few hundred employees, and by bringing the uncovered sectors of the industry into one of the new larger jurisdictions. A second requirement would be to protect jobs of employees who file a complaint and to increase fines to a level sufficient to deter violations of the law. However, the main reform necessary would be to extend the powers and rights of unions in the sectors covered by a decree. The clothing industry already constructed on the few existing experiences with voluntary multi-employer negotiations in Quebec. It would, therefore, be an ideal place in which to experiment with a new formula for <b>multi-employer</b> certification and <b>bargaining.</b> Under such a formula, if the majority of employees in a given industry are unionized, then the union would be recognized as the exclusive bargaining agent and the contract, in its entirety, would apply to ail workers in the sector. A certification election would be held on request if the union already represented at least 25 % of employees. Under the new regime, the joint committee, which now administers a decree, would continue to administer the latter, to inspect workplaces and to carry out any other mandates, such as the policing of homework, which the two parties might decide to give it. It would also serve as a natural place for economic concertation. Homework will not disappear overnight at the stroke of a pen. The solutions proposed here would allow this objective to be achieved progressively by taking into consideration the particular characteristics of the industry and the need to encourage long-term investments...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis thesis {{proposes to}} show that <b>multi-employer</b> <b>bargaining</b> offers a device for {{promoting}} uniformity and stability in labor relations, greatly lessening industrial strife and contributing materially to peaceful and mutually beneficial labor relations. Certain methods, arbitrary in choice, were employed. In making selections for purposes of illustration and analysis the criteria stressed were: (1) a sufficiently long period of experience with these selections, and (2) a wide variation in the economic circumstances and experiences with these choices so that instructive analysis could be made. After {{the discussion of the}} problem and its validation, followed the definition and description of <b>multi-employer</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreements. Here the basic types of bargaining agreements such as industry-wide, regional, and local agreements indicate a wide variety of possibilities. Along with the more conventional type we have similar agreements not quite as sharply classified but similar enough to be discussed. The estimate of coverage indicates approximately four million workers in all types of industry ranging from manufacturing to service industries. In a review of the growth of <b>multi-employer</b> <b>bargaining</b> which began approximately in the 1870 's, chaotic and disorderly conditions preceded the inception of this type of bargaining. In certain industries such as the glass bottle, the stove industry, the hosiery industry and in the coal mining and railroad industries <b>multi-employer</b> <b>bargaining</b> faced seemingly insurmountable obstacles. These obstacles included the problems of technological innovation, employment of child labor, and cutthroat competition. Yet, this bargaining technique made a major contribution in bringing peaceful and orderly labor relations to these industries. There are problems encountered in administering multi-employer agreements. These problems have certain varying effects on wages, prices, distribution of the labor force and technological innovation. These effects are different due to the various types of uniformity utilized in the agreements. However, once these administrative difficulties are overcome, the problem of making multi-employer agreements workable will be no more difficult than the problem that piece rate systems presented, years ago. In evaluating <b>multi-employer</b> <b>bargaining,</b> advantages and disadvantages must be taken into consideration and in turn criticized in the light of certain selected criteria. The advantages of equalization of bargaining power, elimination of competition based on wage exploitation, and uniform concerted action have firm foundation. Equally strong are the criticisms that multi-employer bar gaining is monopolistic, wipes out geographical wage differentials while ignoring local variations in economic and social factors, and finally causes the strike incidence and scope to increase, creating harm to the public interest. It can be observed that despite all the conflicting viewpoints, once management is able to equate its bargaining power with labor, which has the initial advantage, stable and orderly industrial relations will be the result. In the light of the investigation certain issues might be pointed out. <b>Multi-employer</b> <b>bargaining</b> seems to be a necessary stage of organization in labor relations. It appears that {{it is more important to}} utilize this bargaining technique rather than fighting it. The potentialities offered seem to be able to reward management as well as labor. The overall point of view indicates that the success of this type of bargaining depends on whether management and labor see in it a working proposition, and are able to envision the idea that a community of interest exists between them which makes conflict more wasteful than cooperation. Multi-employer bargain can accomplish this cooperation but cannot be expected to do the job all by itself...|$|E
