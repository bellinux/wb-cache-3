40|$|The dense plasma focus (DPF) is {{a classic}} Z-pinch plasma device that has been studied for decades as a {{radiation}} source. The formation of the <b>m</b> = <b>0</b> plasma <b>instability</b> during the compression phase {{is linked to the}} generation of high-energy charged particle beams, which, when operated in deuterium, lead to beam-target fusion reactions and the generation of neutron yield. In this paper, we present a technique of seeding the <b>m</b> = <b>0</b> <b>instability</b> by employing a hollow in the anode. As the plasma sheath moves along the anode's hollow structure, a low density perturbation is formed and this creates a non-uniform plasma column which is highly unstable. Dynamics of the low density perturbation and preferential seeding of the <b>m</b> = <b>0</b> <b>instability</b> were studied in detail with fully kinetic plasma simulations performed in the Large Scale Plasma particle-in-cell code as well as with a simple snowplow model. The simulations showed that by employing an anode geometry with appropriate inner hollow radius, the neutron yield of the DPF is significantly improved and low-yield shots are eliminated.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the linear stability of z-pinch plasmas with equilibria that contain axial sheared flow based on the linearized MHD equations and 2 D MHD simulations using the MHRDR code is presented. The study begins with a linearized set of equations that permit evaluation {{of the effect of}} sheared flow on the <b>m</b> = <b>0</b> sausage <b>instability,</b> with the Hall term included in the model. The problem is then treated numerically following the development in time of an initial perturbation. The numerical results as a function of sheared flow and Hall term are reported. The linear stage of instability development is also compared with the 2 D MHRDR simulation results. Linear theory solutions for the growth rate appear to be in good agreement with the MHRDR simulation results. Theory and computations have examined several possible z-pinch stabilization techniques, including axial sheared flow [1 - 4]. With sheared axial flow included in the equilibrium it is found that substantial stabilization of internal modes is possible for some equilibrium profiles. The guiding principle is to take the z-pinch system away from th...|$|R
40|$|Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF) {{efforts are}} based on {{calculations}} showing that {{the addition of a}} closed magnetic field reduces the driver pressure and rise time requirements for inertial confinement fusion by reducing thermal conductivity. Instabilities that result in convective bulk transport at the Alphen time scale are of particular concern since they are much faster than the implosion time. Such instabilities may occur during compression due to, for example, an increase in the plasma-magnetic pressure ratio {beta} or, {{in the case of a}} rotating plasma, spin-up due to angular momentum conservation. Details depend on the magnetic field topology and compression geometry. A hard core z pinch with purely azimuthal magnetic field can theoretically be made that relaxes into a wall supported diffuse profile satisfying the Kadomtsev criterion for the stability of <b>m</b> = <b>0</b> modes, which is theoretically preserved during cylindrical outer wall compression. The center conductor radius and current must also be large enough to keep the {beta} below stability limits to stabilize modes with <b>m</b> > <b>0.</b> The stability of <b>m</b> > <b>0</b> modes actually improves during compression. A disadvantage of this geometry, though, is plasma contact with the solid boundaries. In addition to the risk of high Z impurity contamination during the (turbulent) relaxation process, contact thereafter can cause plasma pressure near the outer surface to drop, violating the Kadomtsev criterion locally. The resultant <b>m</b> = <b>0</b> <b>instability</b> can then convect impurities inward. Also, the center conductor (which is not part of the Kadomtsev profile) can go <b>m</b> = <b>0</b> unstable, convecting impurities outward. One way to mitigate impurity convection is to instead use a Woltjer-Taylor minimum magnetic energy configuration (spheromak). The sheared magnetic field inhibits convection, and the need for the center conductor is eliminated. The plasma, however, would likely still have to be wall supported due to unfavorable {beta} scaling during quasispherical (3 -D) compression otherwise. Use of a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) substantially resolves the wall contact issue, but at the cost of introducing a new (rotational) instability. An FRC has an open magnetic field outside a separatrix which effectively diverts wall material. However, FRC particles diffusing across the separatrix have a preferred angular momentum, causing the FRC within to counter-rotate in response. When the FRC's rotational-diamagnetic drift frequency ratio {alpha} reaches a critical value of order unity, the FRC undergoes a rotational instability that results in rapid particle loss. The instability is exacerbated by cylindrical compression since {beta} {approx} R{sup - 2 / 5 } during this phase, assuming angular momentum conservation. A multipole magnetic field frozen into the solid liner during compression may stabilize this mode directly and/or by impeding spin-up without significantly perturbing the implosion's azimuthal symmetry...|$|R
40|$|The current renewed {{interest}} in the dense linear z-pinch is {{due in large part}} to a recent Los Alamos Study which concluded that a z- pinch based reactor could produce 4. 4 KJ of fusion energy per pulse for the modest input of 140 kJ per pulse, if a straight pinch could be maintained for 2 {mu}sec. Early attempts to achieve suitable high density z-pinches were of the implosion type which produced hollow pressure profiles that quickly resulted in disruptive <b>m</b> = <b>0</b> <b>instabilities.</b> These instabilities are not found in the gas embedded pinch in which an initially small diameter plasma is kept in radial equilibrium by following a prescribed current waveform. Unfortunately, these pinches are prone to a rapid accretion of the surrounding gas during the early stages of formation. Our approach is to form the pinch inside small diameter quartz capillaries filled with neutral hydrogen. This fixes the line density. By driving currents through the pinch at a rate that exceeds that necessary for radial equilibrium, we expect the pinch to contract away from the walls and be subject to compressional, as well as ohmic heating. This contraction will, of course, produce a plasma between the pinch and the capillary wall, but we anticipate this ``corona`` will be kept at a low temperature (i. e., high resistance) by radiation and hence shunt only a small fraction of the pinch current. We also expect negligible impurities in the pinch as the classical mixing time will be much longer than the pinch duration at the densities (10 {sup 21 }- 10 {sup 22 } ions/cm{sup 3 }) and magnetic fields (1 - 10 MG) involved. However, we do expect the presence of the dense corona to reduce the growth rate of the m = 1 instability. Our results demonstrate that a z-pinch can be formed inside a capillary, but our limited current rise rates and peak current have limited our test abilities. Planned improvements in electrical equipment should yield successful testing results...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate this heterogeneity and to identify predictors of improved survival. Results : Ninety-four of 345 patients undergoing esophageal resection at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 1985 and 1994 had stage II carcinomas; 70 stage IIA (24 T 2 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0</b> and 46 T 3 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0)</b> and 24 stage IIB (9 T 1 N 1 <b>M</b> <b>0</b> and 15 T 2 N 1 <b>M</b> <b>0).</b> Pathologic stage and T and N status were the only identifiable predictors of survival. Stage IIA survival was significantly better than stage IIB (p = 0. 01). T 2 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0</b> survival was not different from T 1 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0</b> survival (p = 0. 83).

For both cT 1 c- 2 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0</b> and cT 3 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0</b> patients, the downstaging rate was significantly higher in the NHT group than in the SA group (p＜ 0. 01).

40|$|AbstractObjective: The TNM staging {{system of}} lung cancer is widely used {{as a guide for}} {{estimating}} prognosis and selecting treatment modality. In 1997, the International Union Against Cancer and the American Joint Committee on Cancer have adopted a revised stage grouping for lung cancer. However, the validity of the new stage grouping has not been fully established. We investigated the prognoses of patients who had resection of non–small-cell lung cancer to confirm the validity of the revised classification. Methods: A total of 1310 patients with non–small-cell lung cancer underwent complete resection and pathologic staging of the disease in our hospitals from 1980 through 1993. A pulmonary resection was performed with a systematic nodal dissection. The survivals were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method on the basis of overall deaths, and the survival curves were compared by log rank test. Results: There were significant differences in survival between patients with T 1 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0</b> and T 2 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0</b> disease and between those with T 1 N 1 <b>M</b> <b>0</b> and T 2 N 1 <b>M</b> <b>0</b> disease. However, {{there was no significant difference}} between patients with T 2 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0</b> disease and those with T 1 N 1 <b>M</b> <b>0</b> disease. No significant difference in survival was observed among patients with T 2 N 1 <b>M</b> <b>0,</b> T 3 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0,</b> and T 3 N 1 <b>M</b> <b>0</b> cancer. Patients with different invaded organs of T 3 subdivision (pleura, chest wall, pericardium, or diaphragm) had a different prognosis. There was no significant difference between patients with T 3 N 2 <b>M</b> <b>0</b> disease and those with stage IIIB disease. Conclusions: We supported most of the revision, such as dividing stage I, dividing stage II, and putting T 3 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0</b> to stage IIB. Furthermore, we found some candidates for a subsequent revision, such as putting T 3 N 1 <b>M</b> <b>0</b> to stage IIB, putting T 2 N <b>0</b> <b>M</b> <b>0</b> and T 1 N 1 <b>M</b> <b>0</b> together, regarding diaphragm invasion as T 4, and putting T 3 N 2 <b>M</b> <b>0</b> to stage IIIB.
