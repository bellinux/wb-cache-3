25|$|Approximately 20% of autistic {{children}} have <b>megalencephaly</b> {{making it the}} most common physical characteristic of autism. Patients that present both <b>megalencephaly</b> and autistic characteristics usually also show signs of hyperactivity as a major symptom. However, there is no definitive evidence that autism is the primary cause/result of <b>megalencephaly.</b> This is because <b>megalencephaly</b> has also been described in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia or Alzheimers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Megalencephaly</b> (or macrencephaly, {{abbreviated}} MEG) is {{a growth}} development disorder {{in which the}} brain is abnormally large. It {{is characterized by a}} brain with an average weight that is 2.5 standard deviations above the mean of the general population. <b>Megalencephaly</b> is usually diagnosed at birth and is confirmed with an MRI. A mutation in the PI3K-AKT pathway {{is believed to be the}} primary cause of brain proliferation and ultimately the root cause of <b>megalencephaly.</b> This mutation has produced a classification of brain overdevelopment that consists of two syndromes including, megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polydactyly-polymicrogyria-hydrocephalus (MPPH). Approximately 1 out of 50 children (2%) are said to have the characteristics of <b>megalencephaly</b> in the general population. There are several neuropsychiatric disorders linked with <b>megalencephaly,</b> however, studies have shown that autism is the most prevalent association with the malformation of MEG. Although no treatment currently exists for <b>megalencephaly,</b> management methods are focused at reducing deficits linked with autism. Most recent research is targeted at creating inhibitors to reduce the mutational pathway that causes <b>megalencephaly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Approximately one out {{of every}} 50 (2%) {{children}} in the general population are said to have <b>megalencephaly.</b> Additionally, it is said that <b>megalencephaly</b> affects 3–4 times more males than females.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that <b>megalencephaly</b> was discovered in 1972. Prior to diagnoses that used MRI scanning {{as a way to}} confirm brain overgrowth, cases of <b>megalencephaly</b> were diagnosed by autopsy in which the physical brain was measured and weighed.|$|E
25|$|One {{impact of}} <b>megalencephaly</b> is the {{complete}} lack of motor development. One medical study assessed three patients presenting <b>megalencephaly</b> who showed severely impaired motor and speech development as well as distinct facial abnormalities including skull bossing, a low nasal bridge and large eyes.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of <b>megalencephaly</b> {{has changed}} over the years, however, with the {{development}} of more advanced equipment, physicians have been able to confirm the disorder with better accuracy. Usually, a physical exam is first performed when characteristics of <b>megalencephaly</b> have appeared. This typically occurs at birth or during early child development. A physician will then take head measurements {{in order to determine the}} circumference. This is known as the head circumference. Then a family background will be recorded in order to determine if there has been a history of <b>megalencephaly</b> in the family.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{extremely}} high association between <b>megalencephaly</b> and autism.|$|E
25|$|If a {{diagnosis}} of <b>megalencephaly</b> is confirmed, the child is referred to a specialist who focuses on managing the symptoms and improving lifestyle. Since <b>megalencephaly</b> is usually presented with autism, the goal of treatment is to improve deficiencies associated with autistic causes. Additionally, since each patient has unique symptoms, {{there is no one}} specific treatment method and therefore is heavily reliant on symptoms associated with an individual.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a strong}} {{correlation}} of epilepsy and <b>megalencephaly</b> and this can aid doctors in their diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Future {{research}} is targeted at further understanding mutations {{and how they}} lead to MCAP and MPPH sydnromes. The majority of studies of <b>megalencephaly</b> have included mice who present brain abnormalities and overgrowth. The {{next step is to}} move to clinical trials involving humans {{in order to determine the}} exact genetic mutation causing the sequences. Additionally, scientists and pharmaceutical companies have begun to show interest in mutation inhibition and designing preventative methods to eliminate the underlying cause of <b>megalencephaly</b> altogether.|$|E
25|$|Those {{individuals}} that are classified with macrocephaly, or general head overgrowth, {{are said to}} have <b>megalencephaly</b> at a rate of 10–30% of the time.|$|E
25|$|Since most {{children}} with <b>megalencephaly</b> also have autism, {{the goal of}} treatment for MEG is focused on managing the signs and symptoms associated with autism.|$|E
25|$|A {{person with}} {{macrocephaly}} {{does not necessarily}} indicate that <b>megalencephaly</b> is also present. Large skulls usually exhibit no neurodevelopment conditions at all, meaning most individuals with macrocephaly are healthy.|$|E
25|$|Since, {{hemimegalencephaly}} {{is associated}} with severe seizures, hemiparesis and mental retardation, {{the result is a}} poor prognosis. In most cases, those diagnosed with this type of <b>megalencephaly</b> usually do not survive through adulthood.|$|E
25|$|A {{neurological}} exam {{will then}} be performed using the technology of an MRI machine in order to confirm the diagnosis of <b>megalencephaly.</b> These imaging tests give detailed information regarding brain size, volume asymmetry and other irregular developments linked with MCAP, MPPH and hemimegalencephaly.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the nervous}} system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, meningocele, meningomyelocele, encephalocele and anencephaly. Other congenital anomalies {{of the nervous}} system include the Arnold-Chiari malformation, the Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, microencephaly, <b>megalencephaly,</b> lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, holoprosencephaly, and agenesis of the corpus callosum.|$|E
25|$|Although {{very little}} is still known as to the direct cause of <b>megalencephaly,</b> recent studies have begun to provide early {{indications}} of possible sources for its formation. Recent {{research has shown that}} there is a strong link between genetic pathways that cause brain develop and mutations in that pathway that result in brain overgrowth.|$|E
25|$|Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) {{is one of}} the {{two major}} syndromes {{contributing}} to <b>megalencephaly.</b> Typically MCAP and MPPH can be distinguished by somatic features. In differentiation to MCAP, MPPH lacks consistent somatic features other than postaxial polydactly. Furthermore, brain and body development is normally symmetric in the majority of patients that appear to have MPPH symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{mutations}} in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT (also known as protein kinase B) pathway have been identified in MCAP and MPPH. This pathway has proven to {{be an integral part of}} brain growth and development and is an area of interest to many researchers who study the cause of <b>megalencephaly.</b> Mutations in this pathway have been shown to cause a gain of function in the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. This cellular pathway is critical in the regulation of diverse cell functions including, cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and most importantly in regards to <b>megalencephaly,</b> brain development. AKT is a crucial signaling molecule part of the PI3K pathway and is also involved in many cellular functions. These functions include, brain development, synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment. Loss of function in AKT can cause microcephaly in humans while inactivation of the pathway can cause hemimegalencephaly. There are also several cancers that have been shown to be linked with mutations in the AKT pathway, including melanoma and lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|Megalencephaly-capillary (MCAP) {{is one of}} the {{two major}} syndromes of <b>megalencephaly.</b> Typically, MCAP and MPPH can be {{distinguished}} by somatic features. MCAP includes many characteristics that are observed at birth including: cutaneous vascular malformations, especially capillary malformations of the face and cutis marmorata, polydactyly, connective tissue dysplasia, and focal or segmental body overgrowth. Furthermore, MCAP can occasionally be linked with asymmetric brain overgrowth (hemimegalencephaly) as well as segmental overgrowth of the body (hemihypertrophy).|$|E
25|$|Pur-alpha (purα) is a sequence-specific {{single-stranded}} DNA and RNA-binding protein. Studies {{have shown}} that the protein is primarily active during early development and is believed to have a role in brain enlargement. Although the exact function is still controversial, it is believed that pur-alpha is responsible for neuronal proliferation during neurogenesis as well as the maturation of dendrites. Thus, pur-alpha is also considered a potential root cause of <b>megalencephaly</b> and brain overgrowth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prognosis}} of <b>megalencephaly</b> depends {{heavily on}} the underlying cause and associated neurological disorders. Because the majority of <b>megalencephaly</b> cases are linked with autism, the prognosis {{is equivalent to the}} corresponding condition.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{currently}} no specific treatment for <b>megalencephaly,</b> however periodic head measurements may be assessed {{to determine the}} rate of brain growth.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{there are}} very few {{treatment}} methods focused on managing <b>megalencephaly,</b> future research is targeted at inhibiting mutation of the pathway. However, this next step could be met with several complications as understanding the underlying mechanism of the mutation is a difficult task. The genetic coding that initiates a single mutation is sporadic and patterns are hard to detect in many cases.|$|E
