50|$|The {{recordings}} made by Gulam Yazdani {{indicated the}} existence of 21 vertical shafts or air vents. But there are about 27 visible vertical shafts or air vents inclusive of branch gallery. A number of vertical shafts have been closed for one or other reasons. The some of the air vents are provided with <b>masonry</b> <b>lining</b> (historically without any mortar) and 2 ft high parapet (parapet is mostly modern entity). The average dimension of the air vent is 4 m2. Lack of maintenance, thick vegetation growth, and run-off erosion has led to collapse of parapets.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{refractory}} <b>masonry</b> <b>lining</b> {{of industrial}} furnaces the compressibility of mortars {{is critical for}} the thermo-mechanical integrity of the structure. Compressive stress-strain behaviour of refractory mortars has been measured during drying at room temperature and in the service temperaturerange of 300 - 1400 ◦C. The results have been explained using fractographic analysis and distinct element method computer modelling. The mortarfailure {{has been shown to}} occur due to formation of shear bands of micro-cracks. The propagation of cracks preferably follows the shortest pathbetween larger pores and is influenced by grain cohesion and interlocking. Tests with mortars featuring calcium aluminate cement, mono aluminiumphosphate, water glass and bentonite clay binders have indicated that besides increasing the cohesion between the grains the binder reduces theinternal friction that promotes higher compressibility. It has been found that the mortar with clay has the highest compressibility. The mortar withcement shows the most stable behaviour...|$|E

Almost 85 % {{of the underground}} assets administrated by the Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP) are masonry made and some parts of it are more than 100 years old. Knowing the present structural state of these tunnels is a key priority to the RATP, {{in order to ensure}} the continuity of the metro service and also to model and predict the effects of some proposed engineering works in the tunnel itself or in its vicinity (for example, a new building on the surface, excavations near the tunnel or a new adjacent tunnel) that might compromise the safety of the existing structure. Searching to broaden the knowledge of the behaviour of the masonry tunnels, we aim to develop a specific model for the <b>masonry</b> <b>lining</b> which will be implemented in the finite element code CESAR-LCPC. An analytical homogenization technique will be utilized along with a damage model, as a means to describe the evolution of the properties of the vault. Damage is applied locally to each component of the masonry, described by means of an isotropic law, and an appropriate technique linking the micro and macro levels simulates the global anisotropic behaviour across the vault. Geometrical considerations are taken into account to assess the directions of the anisotropy. The goal is to identify potential cracking areas in the tunnel as well as its deformation resulting from a given load case. La plupart des tunnels du métro de Paris comportent une voute en maçonnerie. Près de 85 % des ouvrages du patrimoine géré par la RATP est constitué de maçonnerie et certains de ces ouvrages ont plus de 100 ans. La connaissance de leur état structurel actuel est une priorité pour la RATP, pour assurer la continuité du service et pour prédire les effets de travaux projetés à proximité des tunnels qui pourraient compromettre leur stabilité. Pour élargir la connaissance sur le comportement de la maçonnerie, nous avons entrepris de développer un modèle spécifique dans le code de calcul CESAR-LCPC. Une technique d'homogénéisation sera utilisée en combinaison avec un modèle d'endommagement, pour décrire l'évolution des propriétés de la voute. L'endommagement est évalué localement pour chaque composant (considéré comme isotrope), et une technique appropriée de changement d'échelle permet de simuler le comportement global anisotrope de la voute. Le but est d'identifier les zones de fissuration potentielle et les déformations résultant d'un chargement donné...|$|E

50|$|In {{preparation}} for the ritual, {{a large part of}} the center of the penultimate stage of Structure 4 was removed to accommodate the construction of a <b>masonry</b> <b>lined</b> shaft, where later the sacrificial deposits would be made. Since the construction fill of Structure 4 is composed of loosely laid, large boulders, a large excavation was necessary to safely construct the shaft. This preparatory excavation was dug immediately outside of the superstructural building of Structure 4-2nd and reached a depth of 4.3 meters with a north-south dimension of 4.6 meters. On the eastern side a retaining wall was built to secure the excavation from wall collapse. The western limit of the prehistoric excavation is still being investigated.|$|R

5000|$|The {{architecture}} is an integration of styles and architects. Typically for urban palaces, it is a square building organized around a courtyard, with four façades of <b>masonry</b> walls <b>lined</b> with sandstone blocks {{and decorated with}} traditional quoins at the corners. The lower level was begun by Francisco de la Riva Ladrón de Guevara around 1728 and is principally built in the Baroque style. [...] The upper floor began in 1744 by the architect Pedro Antonio Menéndez de Ambás and is distinguished by the Neo-Classical style, articulated with Ionic columns and rusticated blocks at the corners. The building has dual entryways—one {{from the side of}} Valdecarzana Palace on San Juan Street and the other from Porlier Square. Both entrances led to massive staircases heading upwards.|$|R

The former main line from Greenisland Junction was singled and joined the new Main Line at a new connection, Mossley Junction, {{to the east of}} Mossley station. The old main line became known as the [...] "Back Line". The ruling gradient on the Loop Line was 1 in 75 which could only be achieved by excavating and lowering a section of the existing Main Line near Mossley station. The new lines were carried over Valentine's Glen on imposing ferro-concrete viaducts. The smaller of these curved to the east from Bleach Green Junction as a burrowing junction passing under a skew span of the larger Main Line viaduct which curved westwards. The old <b>masonry</b> Main <b>Line</b> viaduct was retained to carry what had become the up Larne Line.|$|R

40|$|Reinforced masonry {{has been}} subject to {{research}} and investigation in Spain for over 20 years now. This paper presents a new contribution within the AllWall System, {{referred to as the}} Halfen-Allwall support (Pi-Bracket). This support being regularly spaced every 6 m to form a "braced arch" effect and provide reinforced <b>masonry.</b> This <b>line</b> of investigation has been made possible through the industrial development of a new patented invention under the trade name Halfen-AllWall Pi-Brackets in combination with Murfor brickwork reinforcement. This combination provides a new way of supporting external walls at fixed points coinciding with the verticals of the structural supports. The system prevents the loading of slabs which, in addition to providing great economy in construction, inhibits cracking due to structural deformation at the support base of the wall and also allows the continuation of insulation and ventilation throughout the cavity. Three tests of the Pi-Brackets have been made in Germany and other three 6 m span walls on the Pi-Brackets, have been tested in Instituto Eduardo Torroja (Madrid).

40|$|Many shaft collapses {{are related}} to the {{deterioration}} and failure of the <b>masonry</b> shaft <b>lining</b> materials. In modern mine shaft, concrete is widely used to provide support. To analyse shafts stability, the properties of the lining need to be well defined. The behaviour of masonry and concrete can be considerably affected by long-term exposure to harsh mine water. This paper presents a study which focuses on the weathering effects of mine water on lining materials (brick, mortar, and concrete). To reproduce the weathering process, samples were placed into solutions of potable water, artificial mine water, and a more aggressive mine-water solution for just less than one year. Four phases of laboratory tests were conducted throughout the time period to assess the degradation of mechanical properties of the lining materials. Particular attention is given to the degradation of material strength and stiffness. Results indicate that the harsh acidic mine water has pronounced detrimental effects on the strength and stiffness of mortar. The weathering process is shown to have the most significant effect on the stiffness of concrete and mortar.

40|$|The {{collapse}} of historic mine shafts {{is a major}} public safety risk in the UK. Many shaft collapses {{are related to the}} deterioration and failure of the <b>masonry</b> shaft <b>lining</b> materials, typically made from brickwork (constituting brick and mortar). In modern mine shaft construction, concrete is widely used to provide support. To analyse shafts for stability, the properties of the lining need to be well defined. The behaviour of both masonry and concrete can be considerably affected by long-term exposure to a harsh mine water environment. This paper presents a study which focuses on the weathering effects of mine water on lining materials (brick, mortar, and concrete). The influence of harsh environmental conditions and time are particularly examined. To reproduce the weathering process in the lab, samples were placed into solutions of potable water, an artificial mine water, and a more aggressive mine- water solution for just under one year. Four phases of laboratory tests were conducted throughout the time period in order to assess the degradation of mechanical properties of the three materials. Particular attention is given to the degradation of material strength and stiffness, which have important implications to mine shaft stability analysis. Results indicate that the mechanical properties of brick do not degrade significantly, but that the harsh acidic mine water has pronounced detrimental effects on the strength and stiffness of mortar. The weathering process is shown to have the most significant effect on the stiffness of concrete and mortar, which has direct implications to predictions of shaft lining and ground displacements over time. It is also shown that the use of mass loss as an index for evaluation of mechanical properties may not be appropriate...|$|R
50|$|From Coast Guard web site:This {{lighthouse}} {{is situated}} on the highest peak of the southeast Farallon. It was built in 1855 in the busy days which followed the gold rush when clipper ships and other sailing vessels were sailing in to San Francisco in large numbers. That there was need for a light on these dangerous rocks is evident when clippers like the Golden City which sailed from New York in 1852 reported that she was detained 5 days off the Farallons in fog. Stone {{for the construction of}} the lighthouse was quarried on the island and inside this <b>masonry</b> was a <b>lining</b> of brick. The extremely sharp slopes of the island and the jagged nature of the rock were serious obstacles to construction work. The bricks used in the tower were carried up the rock in bundles of four and five on the backs of men. After the completion of the tower a mule was kept on the island for years to carry supplies between the various parts of the station. At one time this mule was the oldest inhabitant. A number of years ago the gathering of birds’ eggs, which were sold on the San Francisco market, was carried on here extensively and seals were also hunted commercially. These practices were finally terminated by the Federal Government. The Farallon Light Station was equipped with a radiobeacon as well as with a powerful light and fog signal.|$|R
5000|$|Kenilworth {{was built}} on land that was {{originally}} part of the 1831 grant to Thomas Barker and Alexander Macleay. Both men built houses on their land and Macleay's Elizabeth Bay House still survives. Barker's house, Rosyln Hall, was designed by Ambrose Hallen but was demolished in 1937. The Roslyn Hall estate was subdivided into seven lots in 1860 and Roslyn Street was created. Around 1869, Kenilworth was built for Henry Williams and the 1882 Rates Assessment described it [...] "as being of two floors with twelve rooms of stone with a shingle roof." [...] The two storey sandstone Victorian Gothic style building has a high pitched eternity slate roof with stone gables. it has timber framed double hung sash windows with pointed upper panes. The main entrance faces Roslyn Street to the south west.The north eastern facade has a single storey timber verandah on a sandstone columned under croft and would originally have had views of Rushcutters Bay. This lower colonnade has now been glazed. A later two-storey extension to the south east is built in rendered <b>masonry</b> with coursing <b>lines</b> and a castellated parapet and flat roof. Kenilworth remained {{in the hands of}} its original family until 1944 when it was sold after the death of Henry Williams youngest daughter, Ethel, and her husband Arthur H. Friend. St Luke's Hospital purchased the property for expansion. Since that time the upper two levels of the interior have remained relatively intact with original timber detailing but the basement has been altered and refurbished for it role as hospital offices.
