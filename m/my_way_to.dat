I wanted to be a writer on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> being a director. Directors were already my heroes. Kurosawa, number of Italian directors... Movies from England, France, Sweden, Italy. Poland... One wanted a chance to tell stories in an open, loose, not constricted Hollywood kind of way. At the same time you wanted to work in Hollywood... I was tremendously interested in genre films. Wanted to work within genre films.|$|E

In an interview in 2014, Heinz Prüller recalled Rindt speaking about Indianapolis in 1967: [...] "In Indianapolis, I always feel like I am on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> my own funeral."

[...] However, Yankovic's next album, Even Worse, would resurrect his career and become his best-selling album at the time; the experience led Yankovic to realize that [...] "careers have peaks and valleys, and whenever I go through the rough times, another peak might be right around the corner." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1981, Paul Di'Anno was demonstrating {{increasingly}} self-destructive behaviour, particularly {{through his}} drug usage, about which Di'Anno comments, [...] "it wasn't just that I was snorting {{a bit of}} coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the end of it.

A bit of a {{resistance}} movement was created; the Green Mountain Boys even threatened to destroy the jail and might have done so if not for Lyon's urging peaceful resistance. While in jail, Lyon won election to the Sixth Congress by nearly doubling the votes of his closest adversary, 4,576 to 2,444.

500|$|According to Idolator and Gerrick Kennedy {{from the}} Los Angeles Times, [...] "On the Floor" [...] is {{reminiscent}} of Lopez's single, [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999). Kennedy elaborated on the comparisons, stating that [...] "listeners haven't heard this dance-electro-pop side of Lopez since 1999... much of her back catalog flirts with more gritty urban-pop sounds." [...] Editors for the New York Daily News made some comparisons between [...] "On the Floor" [...] and another RedOne production, Kat DeLuna's 2010 single, [...] "Party O'Clock". DeLuna's song contains the lyrics [...] "Party in Ibiza, Party in New York/All the way to Africa/Love in the Caribbean/On <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Vegas" [...] whereas Lopez sings the nearly identical line, [...] "Brazil, Morocco/London to Ibiza/Straight to L.A.

500|$|... "Between You and Me" [...] {{is built}} around {{acoustic}} strumming and synthesized drums, courtesy of Scott Williamson. The song begins with acoustic strumming in the key of G major. The song then moves into the key of E major during the verses. [...] "Between You and Me" [...] features a chorus {{that is in the}} key of G major; in addition, the chorus is composed of [...] "boyish lead vocals", [...] "sweet harmonies", and [...] "whirling organs". During the verses, Michael Tait, Kevin Max, and Toby McKeehan take turns singing lead. The second chorus is followed by a melodic breakdown featuring minimalistic guitar and whispered vocals. The song then repeats the line [...] "It's <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> freedom" [...] and [...] "I've got something to say" [...] until the end.|$|E
500|$|The album's first song, [...] "I Worship You" [...] was {{described}} as [...] "falling somewhere between adult contemporary and rock", and utilizes acoustic guitars and synthesizers. [...] "Here Am I" [...] relates the story {{of people who are}} not being reached by Christians, and [...] "challenges the listener {{to go out into the}} world and stand up for their King". [...] "On <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> You" [...] is a worship song, requesting [...] "wisdom, purity, and humility in our pursuit of holiness". [...] "How Great is Your Love" [...] incorporates both string and electronic instruments; Millard's vocals in the song utilize [...] "effect–laden delays". [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] is a ballad, opening with just piano before building to include drums and guitar. Lyrically, it asks what it will be like in Heaven, standing before God.|$|E
500|$|Reservoir Dogs was, {{according}} to Tarantino, influenced by Stanley Kubrick's The Killing. Tarantino said: [...] "I didn't {{go out of}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do a rip-off of The Killing, but I did {{think of it as}} my [...] "Killing," [...] my take on that kind of heist movie." [...] The film's plot was suggested by the 1952 film Kansas City Confidential. Additionally, Joseph H. Lewis's 1955 film The Big Combo and Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django inspired the scene where a police officer is tortured in a chair. Tarantino has denied that he plagiarized with Reservoir Dogs and instead said that he does homages. Having the main characters named after colors (Mr. Pink, White, Brown, etc.) was first seen in the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The film also contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam's 1987 film City on Fire.|$|E

500|$|American {{pop singer}} Nick Jonas sang an {{acoustic}} {{version of the}} song in July during his concert at the Westfield Century City in Los Angeles. Before the performance Jonas announced: [...] "Do you guys mind if I play a couple of songs I like from pop radio right now? Would that be OK? The only problem is, I don't know all the words. So if you know them, sing along." [...] After watching the performance online, Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words [...] "Swoon! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory. On <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> press conference in Taichung, listening to it. So dreamy! X." [...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|E
500|$|Ballo's father {{subsequently}} wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's suicide. He decided not to give interviews to the press about his ordeal until the book was published. He {{wanted to be able to}} tell the story and impact of his daughter's death, on his own terms. Titled, Kaja: 1988–2008, the book explores the sequence of events that led to his daughter's death, from her time studying French in Nice. Her early history of psychiatric treatment is discussed in the book. He recounts the difficulties in getting information about his daughter's death from government authorities. According to the author, there was a slow response in receiving help from the Foreign Ministry of Norway. In an interview with Politiken, he explained the motivation for writing the book: [...] "After the funeral I felt I had to do something relating to grief. This was <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> process the grief. The second issue was that I needed to transcribe the account to later tell my little daughter Oda." [...] He also said, [...] "I wanted to contribute to greater openness about suicide." [...] He acknowledged, [...] "Losing a child means that life is turned upside down. I believe that grief becomes heavier if you do not share it with anyone." [...] The book was written with input from other family members.|$|E
500|$|In February 1926, Churchill's {{political}} colleague Sir Samuel Hoare {{described a}} visit {{in a letter}} to the press baron Lord Beaverbrook; [...] "I have never seen Winston before in the role of landed proprietor,... the engineering works on which he is engaged consist of making a series of ponds in a valley and Winston appeared to be a great deal more interested in them than in anything else in the world". In January 1928, James Lees-Milne stayed as a guest of Churchill's son Randolph. He described an evening after dinner; [...] "We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the Battle of Jutland was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing cigar smoke across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke". On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his Chartwell Bulletins, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill's deepening interest in painting; [...] "Sickert arrived on Friday night and we worked very hard at various paintings... I am really thrilled... I see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> paint far better pictures than I ever thought possible before".|$|E
