5|$|As {{the storm}} system moved eastward toward the Ohio, Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on April 27, a very {{powerful}} 80–100 knot mid-level jet stream moved into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, behind the trough, creating strong wind shear, with a low pressure center <b>moving</b> <b>quickly</b> northeastward across those areas on the 27th. On the afternoon of April 27, CAPE values were estimated {{to be in the}} range of 2000–3000 J/kg across Louisiana and southern Mississippi, with the moderate instability moving northeastward across the southern Tennessee Valley; in addition, temperatures across the southeastern United States ranged from the 70s°F (mid-20s°C) to the lower 90s°F (near 35°C). Helicity levels ranged from 450–600 m2/s2, which were supportive for significant tornadic activity and strong to violent long-track tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|On August20, 2015, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave over western Africa, near the Atlantic shore. The disorganized system emerged over the Atlantic Ocean several hundred {{miles southeast of}} the Cape Verde Islands the following day. <b>Moving</b> <b>quickly</b> west, the system bypassed the Cape Verde Islands to the south on August22, but remained largely disorganized. A sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on August23, though a well-defined circulation did not consolidate. Organization of the low improved throughout the day as environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis. The trough acquired gale-force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 18:00UTC. The formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone; accordingly, the system was classified as Tropical Storm Erika, the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Upon its designation, Erika was situated roughly 1,035mi (1,665km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The storm maintained a brisk westward trajectory, steered by a subtropical ridge to the north.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} of Africa. Moving westward, the disturbance gradually organized until July10, at which point convection became more concentrated, and it is estimated Tropical Depression Five formed in the central tropical Atlantic that evening. Late on July11, it strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Emily. Initially forecast to strengthen rapidly and move west-northwest through the Greater Antilles, Emily instead moved almost due west toward the Windward Islands, remaining a moderate tropical storm. The storm languished while <b>moving</b> <b>quickly</b> west, and struggled with maintaining its form. Contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind, Hurricane Dennis had made portions of the Caribbean Sea warmer, and therefore more favorable for tropical cyclone development. Late on July13, Emily strengthened rapidly and reached hurricane strength while passing Tobago and entering the eastern Caribbean. On July14, Emily made landfall in northern Grenada with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E

5|$|On June8, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa, <b>moving</b> <b>quickly</b> westward without development. During the evening hours of June15, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a large area of disturbed weather in association with {{a tropical}} wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. That day, a low pressure area developed just north of Panama. Drifting west-northwest, environmental conditions were expected to be favorable for organization, but the system moved over eastern Nicaragua on June16. Despite moving over land, the circulation and convection became better organized, and after it emerged over open waters, the system developed into Tropical Depression Two at 1200UTC on June17 about 25mi (45km) north-northwest of La Ceiba, Honduras. Located about 60mi (95km) east of Monkey River Town, Belize, the depression was not expected to undergo significant strengthening. Failing to intensify, the depression made landfall in southern Belize near Big Creek late on June17 with winds estimated at 35mph (55km/h). Despite a waning structure, the NHC noted that if the system emerged into the Bay of Campeche, re-development and intensification was plausible.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} quickly weakened as it progressed inland {{and moved}} over Lake Okeechobee, although the large size {{allowed it to}} maintain hurricane status for several more days. Late on September17, the hurricane recurved to the northeast and passed near Jacksonville early {{the next day with}} winds of 75mph (120km/h). At 08:00UTC on September18, the storm once again reached open waters. Later that day, the hurricane restrengthened slightly over open waters, making a second United States landfall near Edisto Island, South Carolina, at 19:00UTC with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Accelerating northeastward, the system quickly weakened into a tropical storm over North Carolina. On September19, the storm evolved into an extratropical cyclone, although it restrengthened slightly to hurricane status. The cyclone turned to the north-northwest, <b>moving</b> <b>quickly</b> through the eastern United States. On September21, the former hurricane dissipated over Ontario, having merged with another disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Sarah, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Openg, was a {{powerful}} typhoon that caused extensive damage along an erratic path across the Western Pacific in September 1989. Originating from a disturbance within a monsoon trough in early September, Sarah was first classified as a tropical depression near the Mariana Islands on September5. <b>Moving</b> <b>quickly</b> westward, the depression soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Sarah. On September8, the storm abruptly turned southward and temporarily attained typhoon status. Following a series of interactions with secondary areas of low pressure, the storm turned northward the following day. By September11, Sarah entered a region favoring development and underwent a period of explosive intensification. At {{the end of this}} phase, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category4equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The typhoon subsequently weakened rapidly and made two landfalls in Taiwan by September12. After moving over the Taiwan Strait, Sarah made its final landfall in Eastern China on September13 before dissipating the following day.|$|E

5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not stalk but {{displays}} by <b>moving</b> <b>quickly</b> and smoothly, and displays at 4 to 27centimetres away. It raises its legs, its body sways from side to side, and the palps are lowered below the chelicerae ("fangs"). This {{is very different from}} the stalking it uses when encountering another salticid of a different species, despite receiving the same visual stimulus, the sight of the other's large anterior-median eyes. Although P. fimbriata is influenced by pheromones much more than is usual among salticids, visual cues alone are enough to start displays and distinguish members of the same species from other salticids, even if neither partner moves. The spindly, fringed legs of Portia species may identify members of the same species, as well as concealing these spiders from other salticid species.|$|E
5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not use cryptic {{stalking}} but displays by <b>moving</b> <b>quickly</b> and smoothly. In P. fimbriata from Queensland, contests between males usually are very brief and do no damage. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and the victor may evict a loser and then eat the loser's eggs – but victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losing female. If a P. fimbriata male from Queensland displays to a female, she may run away or she may charge at him. If the pair reach agreement after this, they will copulate if she is mature, and if she is sub-adult he will cohabit in her nest until she finishes moulting, and then they copulate. P. fimbriata typically copulates much quicker than other jumping spiders. Unlike in other Portia species, females of P. fimbriata do not eat their mates during courting, nor during or after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} examples of horses being ridden in warfare were horse-mounted archers or spear-throwers, dating to the reigns of the Assyrian rulers Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III. However, these riders sat far back on their horses, a precarious position for <b>moving</b> <b>quickly,</b> and the horses were held by a handler on the ground, keeping the archer free to use the bow. Thus, these archers were more a type of mounted infantry than true cavalry. The Assyrians developed cavalry in response to invasions by nomadic people from the north, such as the Cimmerians, who entered Asia Minor in the 8th century BC and took over parts of Urartu {{during the reign of}} Sargon II, approximately 721 BC. Mounted warriors such as the Scythians also had an influence on the region in the 7th century BC. By the reign of Ashurbanipal in 669 BC, the Assyrians had learned to sit forward on their horses in the classic riding position still seen today and could be said to be true light cavalry. The ancient Greeks used both light horse scouts and heavy cavalry, although not extensively, possibly due to the cost of keeping horses.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was <b>moving</b> <b>quickly</b> to the east-northeast, {{due to a}} deepening mid-level low south of the Canadian Maritimes. It maintained good upper-level outflow, and its track over the gulf stream allowed for steady strengthening. Early on July 15, convection increased over the center and developed an organized rainband southwest of the center; as a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Arthur. After continuing to steadily intensify, Arthur attained peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) early on July 16 about 490miles (790km) south-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Upon reaching peak intensity, the convection had become well-organized over the center despite westerly wind shear. Subsequently, the center became separated from the area of deepest convection, and Arthur maintained its peak intensity as it began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. The storm turned northward around the larger mid-level low, and by July 17 Arthur completed extratropical transition. Shortly thereafter, the extratropical remnants crossed eastern Newfoundland. On July 19, the remnants of Arthur turned to a southeast drift between Newfoundland and Greenland, and by {{late in the day}} its winds decreased to below gale force.|$|E
