Content management systems are usually involved with digital rights management in order to control user access and digital rights. In this step, the read-only structures of digital rights management systems force some limitations on content management, as they do not allow authors to change protected content in their life cycle. Creating new content using managed (protected) content is also an issue that gets protected contents out of <b>management</b> <b>controlling</b> systems.

Definition change mostly reflected a scope transformation during this system development. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate evolution of <b>Management</b> <b>Controlling</b> Framework, to compare different approaches and discuss outcomes, to propose future development directions based on historical background. It presents a historical revision of different trends of <b>management</b> <b>controlling</b> systems in organisations, according to four indicators: scope, outcome, tools and contradictions. Johnson and Kaplan (1987) suggestion was taken as the starting point of current investigation, as it significantly affected viewpoint change and further behaviour. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic literature review of publications in public sector, management and accounting journals since 1990 was conducted with the aim to answer the research questions: 1. How <b>Management</b> <b>Controlling</b> Framework are described? 2. What are the main characteristics of MCF? 3. How scope of <b>Management</b> <b>Controlling</b> Framework changed over time. 4. What are the main contradictions? Data analysis was performed using Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS, TRIZ), and a special part of this theory — ‘Laws of (technical) systems evolution’ (LTSE). Findings – Overall, the results confirm that <b>Management</b> <b>Controlling</b> Framework (MCF) can be described and trended through Laws of (technical) systems evolution. These findings provide the following insights for future research such as solve contradictions: 1. Overview, but not overload (detalization problem). 2.

Beside it is to analyze whether the accountability accounting as a <b>management</b> <b>controlling</b> had been precisely based on the theory that concerns to the conditions of the firm and how about the theories can solve the problems existing in the firm. The analysis is done by comparing to the basic concept that is requirement to form and retain accountability accounting, that is: organization structure that states clearly about authority and accountability of each management level, Cost Budgeting that is arranged for each of manajement level, cost accounting system that is to be concerned to organization structure, cost reporting system to the management who was accountability. While if it is related to the <b>management</b> <b>controlling</b> so it is also analyzed to the process of <b>management</b> <b>controlling</b> in the firm. From the analysis it shows that the firm has not been fully in applying the concept of the basic of accountability accounting and {{has not been able to}} do the process of <b>management</b> <b>controlling</b> precisely.

Currently, changes in the market are seen to affect companies' internal needs to modify their <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems which different consultancy companies have recognized as well. The meaning of the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system design and coordination should be studied more in organizations. This study examines the relationship between <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system design and coordination and how they affect <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system functioning in a manufacturing company. The theoretical part adapts Tessier and Otley's (2012) research {{of the meaning of}} the design in the employee perception of the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system. <b>Management</b> <b>control</b> system elements, the use of controls, and the role and objective of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> have been selected as factors affecting <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system design. The coordination process of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems has been studied less and therefore Ghoshal and Nohria's (1989) theory of coordination mechanisms is used in this thesis. The focus is on the formalization of the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system and its impact on internal transparency, global transparency, flexibility and repair. This study provides insights in the relationship between <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system design and coordination and brings forward success factors and main challenges in the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems formalization. Practical constructivism was selected as an ontological approach to the study and it was conducted as a qualitative single case study.

Analysis was conducted through content analysis which was directed by more abstract descriptive analysis strategy. The most remarkable findings concluded that the MCS elements design, the objective of control and the use of controls are inter-related subjects in the MCS design, and without common coordination different controls do not work together harmoniously as a package and do not support common goal achievement.
