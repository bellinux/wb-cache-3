40|$|Four {{different}} {{methods have been}} used to apportion the seats in the United States House of Representatives among the states following the decennial census. The current method, the method of equal proportions, has been used for each census since 1940. In 1991, {{for the first time in}} U. S. history, the constitutionality of an apportionment method was challenged in court, by Montana and Massachusetts in separate cases. Montana proposed two methods as alternatives to equal proportions, the methods of harmonic means and smallest divisors, while Massachusetts proposed the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> <b>fractions.</b> On March 31, 1992, in a unanimous decision, the U. S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of equal proportions. This author wrote the declarations on the mathematical and statistical issues used by the defense in these cases. The declarations in the Massachusetts case contain several new theoretical and empirical results. This paper discusses the technical issues in these cases together with a brief history of the apportionment problem. bias, divisor methods, equal proportions, optimality, pairwise tests, U.

40|$|Introduction Sulfated {{zirconia}} (SZ) is {{an attractive}} catalyst for low temperature butane isomerization [1]. Its activity can be improved by 1 – 2 orders of magnitude through addition of promoters such as iron or manganese in cationic form [2, 3]. The state of these promoters has been characterized, and depending on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> preparation, a <b>major</b> <b>fraction</b> is found to form a solid solution with zirconia [4]. It has been proposed that promoters facilitate reaction initiation via oxidative dehydrogenation to butenes, which may be converted into the reaction carriers, viz. carbenium ions. Only indirect evidence such as better activity after activation in oxidizing than in inert atmosphere has been presented [5]. Reaction profiles recorded under moderate reaction conditions (e. g. 323 K, 1 kPa n-butane) show an induction period and zero conversion in the extrapolation to zero time on stream. Either the catalyst becomes active only in the feed, or intermediates accumulate on the surface. We have focused on manganese as a promoter and have used in situ diffuse reflectance IR spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to reveal the effects of activation or regeneration in inert gas or O 2, and to monitor the events during the induction period.

Proteolytic changes of white brined cheese were monitored by three parameters, the total protein, the water soluble proteins {{and the degree of}} proteolysis, whereas the change <b>of</b> <b>major</b> casein <b>fractions</b> was followed by electrophoresis in reducing conditions.

The review suggest low to moderate bioaccumulation and toxicity of metals in drill cuttings to marine organisms. The experimental work was performed in a standard test set-up at Solbergstrand Marine Research Station. The test determines enrichment ratios in exposed vs control organisms.

All other elements (Al, Li, Fe, Zn, Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, Cr and Ni) showed no significant uptake and ratios within the range 0, 6 - 1, 5.

The stem of E. alata was extracted by different solvents.

Thin layer chromatographic separation of active constituents in acetonitrile extracts revealed the presence of seven fractions. All fractions showed antimicrobial activities with four fractions having a potent inhibitory effect. Two fractions out of the four were successfully identified using mass spectrophotometer analysis.
