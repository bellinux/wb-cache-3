50|$|Vallonia gracilicosta, {{common name}} the <b>multirib</b> {{vallonia}} or multiribbed vallonia, is {{a species of}} very small, air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Valloniidae.|$|E
40|$|Structural {{design and}} {{maintainability}} criteria were established {{and used as}} a guideline for evaluating a variety of configurations and materials {{for each of the}} major subcomponents. From this array of subcomponent designs, several aileron assemblies were formulated and analyzed. The selected design is a <b>multirib</b> configuration with sheet skin covers mechanically fastened to channel section ribs and spars. Qualitative analysis of currently available composite material systems led to the selection of three candidate materials on which comparative structural tests were conducted to measure the effects of environment and impact damage on mechanical property retention. In addition, each system was evaluated for producibility characteristics. From these tests, Thornel 300 / 5208 unidirectional tape was selected for the front spar and covers, and Thornel 300 fabric/ 5208 was chosen for the ribs...|$|E
40|$|With the DC- 10 carbon-epoxy rudder, the Douglas Aircraft Company {{achieved}} one of {{the greatest}} percentage weight savings associated with composite structures. Apart from minor damage from lightning strikes, the 15 rudders put into service have experienced virtually trouble-free operation for about a decade. This paper explains why a <b>multirib,</b> postbuckled skin design was used for the DC- 10 composite rudder, how it was justified, and how it would have compared with more conventional sandwich design concepts. Special attention is devoted to the reasons why, for such postbuckled designs, it is better to allow the skin to wrinkle and unload itself than to reinforce it and make it resist buckling until some higher load level is attained. With minor changes in the manufacturing technique, this design concept is ideal for the control surfaces on many aircraft. The paper includes suggestions on how to make even better composite control surfaces in the future...|$|E
40|$|<b>Multiribbed</b> {{serpentine}} belt drive systems are widely adopted in accessory drive automo- tive applications {{due to the}} better performances relative to the flat or V-belt drives. Nevertheless, they can generate unwanted noise and vibration which may affect the correct functionality and the fatigue life of the belt and of the other components of the transmission. The aim of the paper is to analyze {{the effect of the}} shear deflection in the rubber layer between the pulley and the belt fibers on the rotational dynamic behavior of the transmission. To this end the Firbank's model has been extended to cover the case of small amplitude vibrations about mean rotational speeds. The model evidences that the shear deflection can be accounted for by an elastic term reacting to the torsional oscil- lations in series with a viscous term that dominates at constant speed. In addition, the axial deformation of the belt spans are taken into account. The numerical model has been validated by the comparison with the experimental results obtained on an accessory drive transmission including two pulleys and an automatic tensioner. The results show that the first rotational modes of the system are dominated by the shear deflection of the bel...|$|R
40|$|Design and {{evaluation}} of alternate concepts for the major subcomponents of the advanced composite aileron (ACA) was completed. From this array of subcomponents, aileron assemblies were formulated and evaluated. Based on these analyses a <b>multirib</b> assembly with graphite tape/syntactic core covers, a graphite tape front spar, and a graphite fabric rib was selected for development. A weight savings of 29. 1 percent (40. 8 pounds per aileron) is predicted. Engineering cost analyses indicate that the production cost of the ACA will be 7. 3 percent less than the current aluminum aileron. Fabrication, machining, and testing of the material evaluation specimens for the resin screening program was completed. The test results lead to the selection of Narmco 5208 resin for the ACA. Other activities completed include: the detailed design of the ACA, construction of a three dimensional finite element model for structural analysis, and formulation of detail plans for material verification and process development...|$|E
