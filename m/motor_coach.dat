5|$|On 14 March 1980, {{an empty}} stock train {{comprising}} five Hastings Unit vehicles derailed at Appledore due to excessive speed through {{a set of}} points. The driver was killed. A <b>motor</b> <b>coach</b> was consequently withdrawn from service due to extensive damage.|$|E
5|$|The first buses {{operated}} by GO Transit, a suburban {{variant of the}} GM New Look bus, were unveiled at Queen's Park on August 11, 1970, about a month before commencing operations on its expanded services east, west and north of Toronto. Operated by Gray Coach, a pilot program to test them was conducted in Pickering before they entered service on 8 September 1970. Later buses included a combination of single-door, suburban-type transit buses built by Orion Bus Industries and New Flyer, and single-level highway coaches built by Prevost Car and <b>Motor</b> <b>Coach</b> Industries (MCI, now a subsidiary of New Flyer).|$|E
50|$|The first <b>motor</b> <b>coaches</b> were {{acquired}} by operators of those horse-drawn vehicles. W. C. Standerwick of Blackpool, England acquired its first motor charabanc in 1911, and Royal Blue from Bournemouth acquired its first motor charabanc in 1913. <b>Motor</b> <b>coaches</b> were initially {{used only for}} excursions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>coaches</b> {{can replace}} {{locomotives}} {{at the head}} of local passenger or freight trains. Especially electrified narrow gauge lines on the European continent often saw this form of operation. Many of these railways closed down, many others changed to electric multiple units. But a few lines in Switzerland, Italy and Austria still work with train consists hauled by <b>motor</b> <b>coaches.</b> It can be expected that the Bernina line of Rhaetian Railway will continue {{for a long time to}} be operated with <b>motor</b> <b>coaches</b> pulling passenger and freight trains.|$|R

5|$|The canal {{was absorbed}} by the British Waterways Board in 1962. The Conservators carried out an annual {{inspection}} in 1965, the first since 1947, but had to use a <b>motor</b> <b>coach</b> {{for most of the}} journey, as the locks were unusable. With the passing of the Transport Act 1968, the canal was classified as a remainder waterway – little more than a drainage channel. Only essential maintenance to keep it safe was to be carried out. Soon afterwards, part of the cutting wall between West Street and Albert Street collapsed, and although the bed of the canal was cleared to ensure water could reach the dock, the towpath remained blocked for another nine years. Bridgwater Docks, which had been used by a small amount of coastal shipping, were finally closed in 1971: the connection at the docks was stopped up, and the British Waterways Board were granted permission to cease maintaining the canal for navigation.|$|E
5|$|After the January 11 congressional hearing, Ross delayed {{enforcement}} of the FEPC directive to await {{the outcome of the}} upcoming union elections. The PRTEU contract with the PTC was expiring on February 11, 1944 and a union election was called for March 14, 1944. Apart from PRTEU, which was still staunchly opposed to promotions of black employees, there were two other unions competing for the right to represent PTC workers: the Transport Workers Union (TWU), which was a Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) affiliate, and the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway and <b>Motor</b> <b>Coach</b> Employees of America, an American Federation of Labor (AFL) affiliate. The TWU said that it would allow promotions of black employees while the Amalgamated Association stayed silent on the matter. The PRTEU leadership tried to campaign on the race issue during the union elections, but the topic was overshadowed by other issues, such as the details of a new contract with the PTC. After a bitter campaign, the TWU won the union elections, receiving more votes than both of the other unions combined. At the time of the elections many white workers perceived the contract issue to be more important, where the TWU was promising more attractive terms, and they did not consider promotions of black employees a realistic possibility. Despite the TWU victory, animosities from white workers towards the black employees remained and were largely unabated. The negotiations between the TWU and the PTC on a new contract dragged on, {{and in the absence of}} a contract the company continued to resist implementing the FEPC directives.|$|E
5|$|Live BBC {{television}} coverage at 08:15 {{the following morning}} showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five carriages, were the worst affected, and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition. The leading carriage, a driving <b>motor</b> <b>coach,</b> had headed down the embankment, and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side {{at the foot of}} the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment. All the partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the carriages. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver, who had stayed at the controls (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} units contained only passenger accommodation, {{and formed}} {{the bulk of}} the fleet. They were unusual in that all four traction motors were mounted on one non-driving <b>motor</b> <b>coach.</b> Units consisted of two driving trailers, sandwiching the non-driving <b>motor</b> <b>coach</b> and an intermediate trailer.|$|E

25|$|When new, {{the units}} were {{initially}} numbered {{in the range}} 001-091, but were later renumbered to 303 001-091 when TOPS was introduced. Each unit consisted of 3-cars coupled together in a semi-permanent formation, and up to four sets could be operated in multiple to form up to a 12-car formation. Although 6-car formations were frequently operated, 9-car formations were operated occasionally. 12-car formations were usually only seen {{as a result of}} train failures or ECS workings to the depots at Shields Road or Hyndland. The two outer carriages of each unit were driving trailers, with an intermediate <b>motor</b> <b>coach</b> containing the motor bogies and electrical equipment. Units operated from the standard 25 kV alternating current (AC) overhead power lines system, with power collection via a Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph on the <b>motor</b> <b>coach.</b> The technical description of the formation is DTSO+MBSO+BDTSO. Individual vehicle numbers are shown below.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1920s, the {{railroad}} instituted {{a number of}} named, limited-stop trains, some carrying deluxe dining and parlor/observation cars.

25|$|Due to {{the arrival}} of the 44 EM/ET sets, {{withdrawals}} of the D/DM class units began in November 1981 with the scrapping of pioneering set DM 55 and trailer D 2007 (DM 1 and D 101). Further scrappings until July 1983 when the last two sets of 1942 stock were withdrawn for scrapping, while the 1936 stock had all been withdrawn and scrapped by April of that year. Only one of the 1946 sets had been withdrawn - <b>motor</b> <b>coach</b> DM 13 had been withdrawn and scrapped in April 1978 after being involved in an accident.|$|E
25|$|Lufthansa {{started a}} service to Kjeller Airport {{during the summer of}} 1936 as a {{tentative}} solution while their seaplane was being overhauled. They there put a seventeen-passenger Junkers Ju 52 into the service to London, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Amsterdam. The service was especially popular with travelers to London, as {{they did not have to}} transfer at Copenhagen, and the route saw a typical ten to twelve passengers for each of the daily departures. Ground transport was carried out by <b>motor</b> <b>coach,</b> which used twenty-five minutes from Oslo. This was about the same as the ferry used to Gressholmen Airport. Regular services started on 1 June 1938 and lasted until 10 October. The following year the route was transferred to the newly opened Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Lufthansa also carried out a trial flight with a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 on 13 August 1938.|$|E
