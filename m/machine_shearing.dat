50|$|Sheep {{from other}} {{stations}} {{were sent to}} be sheared at Jondaryan woolshed. In the 1873 season, 24,000 sheep shorn were from other properties. In 1891 <b>machine</b> <b>shearing</b> was brought in at Jondaryan {{and the number of}} stands reduced to 36.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} {{mulesing}} was invented, crutching {{was done with}} blade shears. In Australia, these have been almost universally replaced with <b>machine</b> <b>shears.</b> Hand shears were being used when Mules inadvertently carried out the procedure during crutching. Mulesing would not inadvertently occur using modern <b>machine</b> <b>shears.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... "The moment {{concrete}} posts came in, header harvesters came in, <b>machine</b> <b>shearing</b> came in, father couldn't change or adapt or somehow {{be part of}} that. So what {{had been there for}} years and years on a seasonal basis just disappeared in a year or two".|$|E
50|$|Around 17million of SA 29million sheep {{are still}} blade shorn today. This {{is due to}} the {{relative}} expense of <b>machine</b> <b>shearing</b> compared to blade shearing. Blade shearing is mostly cheaper as a blade shearers equipment in SA is only valued at around R2,000 compared to a shearing machine which costs around R15,000.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{commercial}} blade shearers in New Zealand and South Africa use {{a similar}} style of shearing {{to the traditional}} Bowen method (...) used in <b>machine</b> <b>shearing.</b> The main differences are that in blade shearing the shearer takes less wool on {{the first leg of}} the sheep and they shear around the body of the sheep more than along the sheep.|$|E
50|$|Hair {{clippers}} are specialized implements used to cut human head hair. They work on {{the same}} principle as scissors, but are distinct from scissors themselves and razors. Similar but heavier-duty implements are used to shear sheep, but are called handpieces or <b>machine</b> <b>shears.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mechanical {{workshop}} {{is equipped}} with heavy duty lathe, milling machine, vertical drilling machine, welding units, sheet bending <b>machine,</b> <b>shears</b> in addition to hand tools, accessories and measuring instruments. The department has fabricated sample cells, metallic and non-metallic elements for sample handling/preparation, acrylic column stands, fume hoods, and an acid distillation unit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>shears,</b> {{known as}} handpieces, {{operate in a}} similar manner to human hair {{clippers}} in that a power-driven toothed blade, known as a cutter, is driven {{back and forth over the}} surface of a comb and the wool is cut from the animal. The original <b>machine</b> <b>shears</b> were powered by a fixed hand-crank linked to the handpiece by a shaft with only two universal joints, which afforded a very limited range of motion. Later models have more joints to allow easier positioning of the handpiece on the animal. Electric motors on each stand have generally replaced overhead gear for driving the handpieces. The jointed arm is replaced in many instances with a flexible shaft. Smaller motors allowed the production of shears in which the motor is in the handpiece; these are generally not used by professional shearers as the weight of the motor and the heat generated by it becomes bothersome with long use.|$|R

The newly crowned World <b>Machine</b> <b>Shearing</b> champion is Paul Avery from New Zealand. New Zealand also won the team event, and the traditional blade-shears World Champion is Ziewilelle Hans from South Africa. A record 29 countries competed at the 2008 event. The next World Championship {{will be held at the}} Royal Welsh Show, Llanelwedd, Wales in July, 2010.|$|E
50|$|In the UK {{there is}} still a small number of sheep blade shorn each year. Most of the sheep shorn are in Scotland or in rougher parts of the country where sheep have either been mustered late or they don't have the {{resources}} for <b>machine</b> <b>shearing.</b> Many people still also use blade shears for trimming or dagging their sheep. In saying this {{there are a lot of}} people in the UK who know how to blade shear but most would shear only a few sheep per year.|$|E
50|$|Henry Salter (1907-1997) MBE won {{the first}} {{organised}} shearing contest at Pyramid Hill in 1934 and in 1953 was a <b>machine</b> <b>shearing</b> champion. He continued to use blade shears until he was well into his 80s. In 1946 Salter organised the first Australian shearing school at Kerang, Victoria. During the next 26 years he taught 6,557 students the art of shearing. In 1968 Henry Salter was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the wool industry.|$|E
50|$|On 10 October 1892, Jackie Howe set {{a record}} of 321 sheep shorn in 7 hours and 40 minutes, using blade shears. He had {{previously}} set a weekly aggregate record of 1,437 sheep over a total working week of 44 hours and 30 minutes.While Howe's weekly aggregate record remained until at least 2005, his daily record tally was broken using <b>machine</b> <b>shears</b> by Ted Reick in 1950.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the Kamat-Riley (K-R) event-based Monte Carlo {{simulation}} method {{was used for}} reliability analysis of longwall <b>shearer</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>Shearer</b> <b>machine</b> consists of six subsystems; water, haulage, electrical, hydraulic, cutting arms and cable systems in a series network configuration. A shearer in the Tabas coal mine was selected as case study and its all failure data were collected and used for reliability analysis of subsystems. With negligible assumption of time to repair, a flowchart was built for programming the simulation process. The Matlab mathematical programming software was used for reliability simulation process. Finally the reliability plot of longwall <b>shearer</b> <b>machine</b> was achieved and upper and lower bound reliability were calculated. The results illustrate that the reliability of <b>shearer</b> <b>machine</b> reduces to zero {{in a period of}} 100 h. There is a 50 % chance that the shearer will not fail for the first 12 h of operation. Validerad; 2013; 20130815 (behzad...|$|R
50|$|Shearing {{is said to}} be one of {{the oldest}} occupations, as people needed fiber to make garments. Originally sheep and other animals were shorn using sharp glass or metal taking tufts of fiber at a time to harvest the fiber but slowly man adapted scissor-like blades to make the job easier. <b>Machine</b> <b>{{shearing}}</b> was invented in the early 1880s and slowly took over as the main form of shearing, but there is still a place for blade shearing in certain environments and also as a sport.|$|E
5000|$|Receiving good falls of rain, 16.5 in by June, in 1923, {{the land}} {{contained}} excellent feed and lambing was heavy. A new <b>machine</b> <b>shearing</b> shed and quarters were constructed using {{materials from the}} schooner Geraldton that were landed in May. [...] Fire broke out at the station early in November but was quickly brought under control with only minimal damage occurring. Later the same year over 9,000 sheep were shorn and 215 bales of wool were produced by a shearing team of seven men {{over the course of}} three weeks, this was a record clip for the station. The wool was collected by the Geraldton and shipped to Perth.|$|E
5000|$|Today large {{flocks of}} sheep are mustered, {{inspected}} and possibly treated for parasites such as lice before shearing can start. then shorn by professional shearing teams working eight-hour days, {{most often in}} spring, by <b>machine</b> <b>shearing.</b> These contract-teams consist of shearers, shed hands and a cook (in the more isolated areas). Their working hours and wages are regulated by industry awards. A working day starts at 7:30 am and the day is divided into four “runs” of two hours each. “Smoko” breaks are a half hour each and a lunch break is taken at midday for one hour. Most shearers are paid on a piece-rate per sheep. Shearers who “tally” more than 200 sheep per day are known as “gun shearers”. Typical mass shearing of sheep today follows a well-defined workflow: ...|$|E

50|$|Howe {{was born}} at Killarney near Warwick, Queensland. On 10 October 1892, Howe shore 321 sheep in seven hours and 40 minutes at Alice Downs station, near Blackall, Queensland. This was a faster tally than any other shearer had {{achieved}} before. In the week beforehand, Howe also set the weekly record, shearing 1,437 sheep in 44 hours and 30 minutes. Howe's daily record was beaten by Ted Reick in 1950, but Reick was using <b>machine</b> <b>shears,</b> while Howe's hand shears {{were little more than}} scissors. Howe's weekly record stands unbeaten as of 2005.|$|R
5000|$|The machine {{works by}} [...] "shearing" [...] coal from a {{longwall}} coal face {{as it moved}} along the face. The shear drum is around 0.5 metres in diameter and the machine travels on an armoured conveyor with a prop-free front. The <b>machine</b> <b>shears</b> going one way and the coal at the front is deflected by a plough onto the conveyor. On the machine's return it knocks {{the rest of the}} coal onto the conveyor. The Shearer was usually used on seams thicker than a metre and produced small coal suitable for power stations.|$|R
50|$|In New Zealand, {{there are}} still {{approximately}} 40 commercial blade shearers who work between July and October each year. Between these shearers, 400,000 sheep are shorn each year in New Zealand, mostly in Otago and the Canterbury high country. Blade shearers in New Zealand usually travel to sheds in groups of 5 or 6 shearers and usually live on the station during shearing. Often they will stay on the station {{for up to a}} week shearing around 1000 sheep per day. Most of the sheep that are blade shorn in New Zealand are fine wooled Merino. The main reason sheep are still blade shorn in New Zealand is due to the harsh climate at the time of shearing. Blade shearing leaves a thicker cover of wool on the sheep after shearing giving it more protection from storms and also the wool grows back faster after blade shearing than <b>machine</b> <b>shearing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tumbler {{screening}} machines have higher output per meter square of screening {{than the other}} vibratory {{screening machines}}. It requires lower power, consumption at different speeds at different levels and sorting at each level. It has a lower maintenance and is compact. It has a disadvantage of blocking of the mesh in case of batch sieving if the particles are fed immediately inside the machine barrel. Hence, the feeding rate shouldn't be very high. Another disadvantage of tumbler screening technique {{is that it would}} not be effective for higher particle sizes, which range from six inches to +20 mesh.If a number of tumbler screening machines are operated in parallel in a building without building statics configured accordingly, dynamic residual forces can generate resonance in vibration which in worst case can eventually lead to connection elements to the screening <b>machine</b> <b>shearing</b> off.Particle - particle and machine boundary collisions in the tumbling motion of the rotating structure will dissipate kinetic energy due to normal and frictional contact losses.|$|E
50|$|The Golden Shears International Shearing and Woolhandling Championships is the World's {{most prestigious}} sheep {{shearing}} event.It {{was founded in}} Masterton, New Zealand, and has been held in the town's War Memorial Stadium each March since 1961.It initially comprised competition in three shearing classes, including the Open championship, {{which is the most}} revered of all single shearing titles worldwide. In the final, sometimes referred to as shearing's equivalent of the Wimbledon Open in tennis, six shearers each shear 20 second-shear sheep, for which the fastest time was 15min 27.4sec, shorn in 2003. But the competition is about more than just the fastest time, and the winner is decided on time and quality penalty points, the winner being the shearer with the lowest score.Other events have expanded the programme over the years, with competition now held in five shearing classes, four woolhandling classes and three woolpressing classes, along with other events.The McSkimming Memorial Triple Crown final was added to the programme in 1973, and in various sponsorship guises has become the unofficial New Zealand multiwools national championship. Currently known as the PGG Wrightson National Circuit, it is shorn in five qualifying stages in which points are accrued for shearing finewooled merino sheep, fullwooled strongwool sheep, coarse-wooled Corriedales, lambs and second-shear sheep. In the final, six competitors shear three of each type.The Golden Shears in Masterton spawned Golden Shears championships in other countries, including the United Kingdom, where a Golden Shears of Great Britain was held at the Royal Bath and West Show, and Australia, which became involved in an annual home-and-away transtasman test series, staged alternately at Masterton, and at Euroa, Vic. Suspended for some years after industrial disturbances in Australia, the Australian legs of the series are now held at differing venues in conjunction with the Australisan national championships.While <b>machine</b> <b>shearing</b> contests have been held at least since 1902, when an event was held at the Hawke's Bay A and P Show, Hastings, New Zealand, the Golden Shears is credited with the spread of shearing as a world-wide sport, including a Golden Shears World Championships, held first in England in 1977.Despite the advent of a World Championships every 2-4 years, the Golden Shears in Masterton every year remains the mecca for sheep shearers worldwide, and entries in all classes have in peak years exceeded 600.|$|E
