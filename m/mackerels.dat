5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, <b>mackerels,</b> and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark {{give it an}} enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony fishes (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, greeneyes, lanternfishes, bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake <b>mackerels,</b> deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes {{a wide variety of}} other animals, including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and whales. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony fishes are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males {{are more likely to have}} full stomachs than females for unknown reasons.|$|E

5|$|Mangalorean cuisine {{is largely}} {{influenced}} by South Indian cuisine, with several cuisines being {{unique to the}} diverse communities of the region. Coconut and curry leaves are common ingredients to most Mangalorean curry, as are ginger, garlic and chili. Well-known Mangalorean dishes include Kori Rotti, Neer dosa, Pundi, Patrode, Mangalore Buns, Mangalore bajji, Macaroon etc. Mangalorean Cuisine is also known for Fish and chicken dishes like Bangude Pulimunchi (spicy sour silver-grey <b>mackerels),</b> Boothai Gasi (Sardine Semi-Gravy), Anjal fry, Mangalorean Chicken Sukka, Kori rotti, Chicken Ghee Roast etc. Since Mangalore is a coastal city, fish forms the staple diet of most people. The Konkani Hindu community's specialties include Daali thoy, Bibbe-upkari (cashew based), Val val, Avnas ambe sasam, Kadgi chakko, Paagila podi, and Chane gashi. Mangalorean Catholics' Sanna-Dukra Maas (Sanna—idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas—Pork), Pork Bafat, Sorpotel and the Mutton Biryani of the Beary Muslims are well-known dishes. Pickles such as Happala, Sandige and Puli munchi are unique to Mangalore. Shendi (toddy), a country liquor prepared from coconut flower sap, is popular. Vegetarian cuisine in Mangalore, also known as Udupi cuisine, is known throughout the state and region.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking {{only a fraction of}} a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack <b>mackerels.</b> Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E
25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} has been {{included}} in several phylogenetic analyses of the Carangidae, with each study suggesting slightly different relationships. All studies confirmed its placement in the subfamily Caranginae, a monophyletic grouping including the trevallies, jacks, scads and horse <b>mackerels.</b> The first of these studies by Soko Gushiken was based on morphological characteristics and found the species {{was part of a}} monophyletic clade of the scads and horse <b>mackerels</b> with Atule, Selar, Trachurus and Decapterus, being most closely related to Atule. A 1987 analysis of genetic divergence amongst the scads and horse <b>mackerels</b> using isozyme electrophoresis indicated the species was most closely related to Selar, forming a monophyletic clade with Trachurus, but being more distant from Decapterus. Two studies in 2002 and 2007 of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences generally agreed that Selaroides was most closely related to Selar (depending on analysis type), however both indicated a closer relationship to the deeper bodied genera such as Caranx and Hemicaranx than to the scads of Trachurus and Decapterus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mackerel</b> {{range in}} size from small forage fish to larger game fish. Coastal <b>mackerel</b> tend to be small.

25|$|Yellowtail {{amberjack}} {{can form}} packs of 7-15 individuals that maneuver in U-shaped formations {{to cut away}} {{the tail end of}} prey shoals (jack <b>mackerels</b> or Cortez grunts) and herd the downsized shoal next to seawalls where they proceed to capture the prey.|$|E
25|$|Jacks, amberjacks, pompanos, horse mackerel, scads, leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack <b>mackerels</b> in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack <b>mackerels</b> are an important inshore commercial species.|$|E

25|$|The Malabar {{trevally}} {{was first}} scientifically described by German ichthyologists Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider {{in the massive}} 1801 volume of Systema Ichthyologiae iconibus cx illustratum, a book which is the taxonomic authority of many fish species. The species was first published under the name Scomber malabaricus, implying the species was related closely to the true <b>mackerels.</b> This {{was found to be}} incorrect, and the species was first transferred to Caranx, another genus of jack, and finally to Carangoides by Williams and Venkataramani in 1978, remaining there since. The species was also completely redescribed twice in its history, the first time by Williams in 1958 under the name Carangoides rectipinnus, and again in 1974 by Kotthaus, who named the species Carangoides rhomboides. These two names are considered junior synonyms under the ICZN rules for classification and therefore are discarded.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by the naturalist Peter Forsskål in 1775 based on the holotype specimen taken from {{the waters of the}} Red Sea. He named the species Scomber fulvoguttatus relating the species to the true <b>mackerels</b> as during this period the family Carangidae had yet to be established. The species was later transferred to Caranx and then to Carangoides, where it has remained. The species was independently renamed a number of times, the first as Tarrum emburyi by Gilbert Percy Whitley, a name which was commonly used and later transferred into Caranx and Carangoides. Some 15 years later, Whitley again assigned the fish to a new species and genus name, Ferdauia claeszooni, but this genus was soon synonymised with Carangoides, and this name, as well as Tarrum emburyi, was shown to be a junior synonym of Carangoides fulvoguttatus. The common name 'tarrum' is still used in Australia for the fish, but is also widely misapplied to similar species.|$|E
25|$|The {{bar jack}} was first scientifically {{described}} {{under the name}} Somber ruber by Marcus Bloch, in 1793 based on a specimen taken from {{the east coast of}} America, which was designated to be the holotype. Caranx is derived from the French word, carangue, or a fish from the Caribbean, while ruber (sometimes incorrectly spelled rubber) is Latin for red. Bloch attributed the species to the <b>mackerels</b> of the genus Scomber, a common practice during this period as the genus Caranx and subsequent family Carangidae were not created until 1801 by Bernard Germain de Lacépède. The species has been variably placed in either Carangoides or Caranx since 1801, with the status of the species still somewhat ambiguous. A recent study of the molecular systematics of the Carangidae using mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences strongly supported placement in the genus Caranx, with C. ruber being most closely related to Caranx bartholomaei, itself still often classified under Carangoides. Both C. ruber and C. bartholomaei were strongly related to other well known members of Caranx, and only distantly related to any other species of Carangoides.|$|E

25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is a {{moderately}} large fish, growing {{to a maximum}} recorded length of 80cm and a weight of 4 kg, however is more common between 30 and 40cm length. It is rare at lengths greater than 80cm. The species is often considered to have a rather unusual body form, having features superficially similar to tunas, <b>mackerels</b> and other carangids. The body is elongate and subcylindrical, becoming highly compressed toward the tail and caudal fin, with a marked median keel on the caudal peduncle. The dorsal and ventral profiles of the fish are nearly evenly , with the two profiles intersecting at the pointed snout. There are two separate dorsal fins; the first consisting of 8 moderately high spines and the second of a single spine followed by 18 to 20 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two anteriorally detached spines followed by a single spine attached to 16 or 17 soft rays. In both the dorsal and anal fins, the posterior 7-10 rays are detached and form a series of diagnostic finlets. The pectoral fin is strongly falcate (scythe shaped), and extends beyond {{the origin of the}} second dorsal fin. The lateral line is strongly arched over a short length anteriorly, with the intersection of the curved and straight sections vertically below the fourth or fifth spine of the first dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line has 21 to 29 scales, while the straight section has 51 to 59 very large scutes. The breast is devoid of scales in a triangular patch to about one-third the distance to the pectoral fin base. The eye has a well-developed adipose eyelid which nearly completely covers the eye. The upper jaw contains small villiform teeth, with some outer teeth moderately enlarged, while the lower jaw has a single row of small teeth. There are 26 to 32 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae.|$|E
