40|$|This paper {{describes}} three {{versions of}} an expert system for <b>marine</b> liability <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting.</b> The first version, built on a PC, {{was the result of}} a series of knowledge engineering sessions with an underwriter of an insurance company. The prototype was accurate, but it asked too many marginally relevant questions, without regard to the time and business constraints of the user. The second version was developed to address this concern. It initially asked only a subset of the relevant questions to arrive at a premium. If the premium was too high, the prototype attempted to reduce it by performing a sensitivity analysis on the results of the first round. This analysis was driven by meta-rules. The third version was built on a lisp machine using a graphical expert system-building tool. The graphical approach and greater flexibility of the tool provided the user with an overview of the domain and permitted him to have more control over the data. Any implementation {{of an expert}} system for <b>marine</b> liability <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> should incorporate the lessons learned from each of the three versions of the prototype. In addition, sensitivity analysis and a graphical interface could be useful for expert system domains other than <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting...</b>|$|R
5000|$|From 1879, he was {{the manager}} of the Thames & Mersey <b>Marine</b> <b>Insurance</b> company's <b>underwriting</b> agency in San Francisco. The company had opened its office there in 1876, trading under the name [...] "Messrs. Cross & Co". The early history of the office was chequered, for the agency was held by three representatives in three years. Greer Harrison was the last and most {{successful}} of these, building a large and profitable portfolio. During one period of twelve months in the ’eighties, the [...] "Thames & Mersey" [...] insured every shipload of wheat that sailed out of San Francisco without loss. The profit on this alone equalled the whole of the company dividend that year. During this time he resided at 806 Stockton Street, San Francisco. William Greer Harrison retired after 27 years as the senior official of the [...] "Thames & Mersey" [...] on the Pacific Coast of North America, and was succeeded by Louis Rosenthal, who was in turn destined to represent the company there for 34 years.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Marine</b> <b>Insurance</b> Act includes, as a schedule, a {{standard}} policy (known as the [...] "SG form"), which parties were {{at liberty to}} use if they wished. Because each term in the policy had been tested through at least two centuries of judicial precedent, the policy was extremely thorough. However, it was also expressed in rather archaic terms. In 1991, the London market produced a new standard policy wording known as the MAR 91 form using the Institute Clauses. The MAR form is simply a general statement of insurance; the Institute Clauses are used to set out the detail of the insurance cover. In practice, the policy document usually consists of the MAR form used as a cover, with the Clauses stapled to the inside. Typically, each clause will be stamped, with the stamp overlapping both onto the inside cover and to other clauses; this practice is used to avoid the substitution or removal of clauses.because <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> is typically <b>underwritten</b> on a subscription basis, the MAR form begins: We, the Underwriters, agree to bind ourselves each for his own part and not one for another .... In legal terms, liability under the policy is several and not joint, i.e., the underwriters are all liable together, but only for their share or proportion of the risk. If one underwriter should default, the remainder are not liable to pick {{his share of the}} claim. Typically, <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> is split between the vessels and the cargo. Insurance of the vessels is generally known as [...] "Hull and Machinery" [...] (H&M). A more restricted form of cover is [...] "Total Loss Only" [...] (TLO), generally used as a reinsurance, which only covers the total loss of the vessel and not any partial loss. Cover may be on either a [...] "voyage" [...] or [...] "time" [...] basis. The [...] "voyage" [...] basis covers transit between the ports set out in the policy; the [...] "time" [...] basis covers a period, typically one year, and is more common.|$|R
50|$|The GLBA’s {{amendment}} to the Bank Holding Company Act to permit banks to affiliate with <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> companies was a new power. Under a 1982 {{amendment to}} the Bank Holding Company Act bank affiliates had been prohibited from underwriting most forms of insurance. Because the GLBA permitted banks to affiliate with insurance underwriters, Citigroup was able to retain ownership of the Travelers <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> business. Overall, however, commentators viewed the GLBA “as ratifying and extending changes {{that had already been}} made, rather than as revolutionary.” At least one commentator found the entire GLBA “unnecessary” for banks and suggested the OCC had the authority to grant national banks all the <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> powers permitted to affiliates through the GLBA.|$|R

50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>insurance</b> {{contracts}} may {{be divided}} into hull insurance or cargo insurance.

50|$|The GLBA {{permitted}} Citigroup {{to retain}} the Travelers property, casualty, and life <b>insurance</b> <b>underwriting</b> businesses beyond the five-year “divestiture” period the Federal Reserve Board could have permitted under the pre-GLBA form of the BHCA. Before that five-year period elapsed, however, Citigroup spun off the Travelers property and casualty insurance business to Citigroup’s shareholders. In 2005 Citigroup sold to Metropolitan Life the Travelers life insurance business.
