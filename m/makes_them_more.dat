5|$|Any form {{of muscle}} damage of {{sufficient}} severity can cause rhabdomyolysis. Multiple causes can be present simultaneously in one person. Some have an underlying muscle condition, usually hereditary in nature, that <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> prone to rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{have converged}} to take {{advantage}} of similar birds. Flowers compete for pollinators, and adaptations reduce unfavourable effects of this competition. The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects.|$|E
5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E

25|$|In modern sets, a {{semiconductor}} diode {{is used for}} the detector, which is much more reliable than a cat's whisker detector and requires no adjustments. Germanium diodes (or sometimes Schottky diodes) are used instead of silicon diodes, because their lower forward voltage drop (roughly 0.3V compared to 0.6V) <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> sensitive.|$|E
25|$|Myelin {{prevents}} ions {{from entering}} or leaving the axon along myelinated segments. As a general rule, myelination increases the conduction velocity of action potentials and <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> energy-efficient. Whether saltatory or not, the mean conduction velocity {{of an action}} potential ranges from 1meter per second (m/s) to over 100m/s, and, in general, increases with axonal diameter.|$|E
25|$|Mafiosi {{generally}} do not involve themselves {{in the management of}} the businesses they protect or arbitrate.

25|$|The main {{benefit of}} {{collecting}} bonsai specimens is that collected materials can be mature, and will display the natural marks {{and forms of}} age, which <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> suitable for bonsai development than the young plants obtained through nurseries. Low cost is another potential benefit, with a tree harvest license often being more economical than purchase of nursery trees. Some of the difficulties of collecting include finding suitable specimens, getting permission to remove them, and the challenges of keeping a mature tree alive while transplanting it to a bonsai pot.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to the development of relatively large sea caves. The nature of the zone of weakness itself is surely a factor, although difficult to quantify. A more readily observed factor is the situation of the cave’s entrance relative to prevailing sea conditions. At Santa Cruz Island, the largest caves face into the prevailing northwest swell conditions—a factor which also <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> difficult to survey. Caves in well-protected bays sheltered from prevailing seas and winds tend to be smaller, as are caves in areas where the seas tend to be calmer.|$|E
25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> expensive.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} classes of vehicles that serve different purposes. Off-road vehicles perform better in rough environments, while racing cars perform better on tracks {{or on the}} street. Jets are fast, but usually need a runway to land. Helicopters can land almost anywhere and are much easier to control in the air, but are slower. While previous Grand Theft Auto games {{had only a few}} aircraft that were difficult to access and fly, San Andreas has eleven fixed-wing aircraft and nine helicopters and <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> integral in the game's missions. There is also the ability to skydive from aircraft, using a parachute. Several boats were added, while some were highly modified.|$|E
25|$|Spiders fluoresce under UV {{light and}} possess a huge {{diversity}} of fluorophores. Remarkably, spiders {{are the only}} known group in which fluorescence is “taxonomically widespread, variably expressed, evolutionarily labile, and probably under selection and potentially of ecological importance for intraspecific and interspecific signaling.” A study by Andrews et al. (2007) reveals that fluorescence has evolved multiple times across spider taxa, with novel fluorophores evolving during spider diversification. In some spiders, ultraviolet cues are important for predator-prey interactions, intraspecific communication, and camouflaging with matching fluorescent flowers. Differing ecological contexts could favor inhibition or enhancement of fluorescence expression, depending upon whether fluorescence helps spiders be cryptic or <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> conspicuous to predators. Therefore, natural selection could be acting on expression of fluorescence across spider species.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, {{there were}} 50 GMs (USSR: 19, Yugoslavia: 7, USA: 5, Argentina: 4, West Germany: 2, France: 2, Sweden: 1, Czechoslovakia: 1, Hungary: 1, Austria: 1, Belgium: 1, Denmark: 1, Netherlands: 1, Poland: 1). In 1972, there were 88 GMs with 33 {{representing}} the USSR. The current FIDE ratings list includes over 1000 Grandmasters. Nigel Short was rated the third {{best player in}} the world in 1989 with a rating of 2650; in the 21st century such a rating would only be good enough for a player to reach the top 100 or so, with the third {{best player in the}} world usually rated around 2800. Other minor factors come into play: there are more tournaments worldwide and cheaper air travel <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> accessible to globe-trotting chess professionals, who include many players from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe whose movements are no longer restricted as they were before the 1990s. Additionally, players can make norms in tournaments that would have been previously considered too short for norms, making norms easier to get and allowing for more norm tournaments to be held.|$|E
