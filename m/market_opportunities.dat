Its {{goal is to}} create a structure for design in the company, bridging the gap between objectives set through strategic {{design management}} and the implementation of design on the operational level. It defines how design is organised within the company. This includes the use of a central body to coordinate different design projects and activities. It deals with defining activities, developing design skills and competencies, managing processes, systems and procedures, assigning of roles and responsibilities, developing innovative products and service concepts, and finding new <b>market</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Outcomes of tactical design management are related {{to the creation of a}} structure for design within the company, to build internal resources and competencies for the implementation of design. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this function: tactical design manager, design director, design & innovation manager, brand design manager, new product development (NPD) manager, visual identity manager, and others.|$|E

25|$|Starbucks and Kraft Foods {{entered into}} a {{partnership}} in 1998 to sell Starbucks products in the Mondelez grocery stores owned by the latter. Starbucks claimed that Kraft did not sufficiently promote its products and offered Kraft US$750 million to terminate the agreement; however, Kraft declined the offer, but Starbucks proceeded with the termination anyway. Starbucks wanted to terminate the agreement because at the time, single coffee packs were beginning to become popular. In their agreement, Starbucks was confined to selling packs that only worked in Kraft's Tassimo machines. Starbucks didn't want to fall behind in the <b>market</b> <b>opportunities</b> for k cups. In mid-November 2013, an arbitrator ordered Starbucks to pay a fine of US$2.8 billion to Kraft spin-off Mondelez International for its premature unilateral termination of the agreement.|$|E
25|$|Eero Saarinen and his Detroit-based firm were {{commissioned}} in 1955 {{to design the}} TWA Flight Center. Saarinen, who projected a high patronage for the terminal, conceived the terminal to speed up processes. At the same time, the bird-shaped, emblematic construction featured a harmoniously coordinated interior and references to TWA’s corporate identity and thus served to convey the company’s image. Saarinen planned {{the appearance of the}} building from a purely formal perspective mainly to exploit <b>market</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Thus, the TWA Terminal represents an entirely different approach than the thin concrete shells constructed at the same time. The terminal was built to span a space with a minimum of material. Saarinen, who was known as an indefatigable architect, indicated to his client that he needed more time, then took another year to resolve the design. The airline, with the support of Saarinen’s wife Aline, exploited the new market opportunity to carry out a most successful marketing campaign starting with the building's first public presentation on November 12, 1957. The completed terminal was dedicated May 28, 1962, the same year that Saarinen won the AIA Gold Medal posthumously, having died in 1961.|$|E

30|$|Some {{immigrant}} born globals rely on co-ethnic {{networks that}} allow them to exploit their ethnic knowledge based on the <b>market</b> <b>opportunity</b> in the adopted host market. The possibility of support from the co-ethnic networks and of <b>market</b> <b>opportunity</b> often situated in the co-ethnic networks encourages the born globals that rely on sourcing in their ethnic home country and marketing in their adopted host country. Other immigrant born globals rely on non-ethnic networks in the adopted host market and firm-specific knowledge about the overseas market, to cater to the <b>market</b> <b>opportunity</b> back in their ethnic home country market. Entrepreneurial mindset helps break out of the ethnic networks, by exploring beyond the ethnic linkages, and distinctive firm-specific knowledge helps convince non-ethnic networks to associate for factors other than ethnic solidarity or sympathy. Such immigrant born globals tend to have constrained growth, unless they break out from their ethnic networks.|$|R

2500|$|India {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{exporters}} of beef. Though some states of India impose various types of prohibition on beef prompted by religious aspects that are fueled by Caste And Religion based Politics. Hindu religious scripts do not condemn consumption of beef and experts conclude so. [...] In 2017, a rule against the slaughter of cattle and the eating of beef was signed into law by presidential assent as a modified version of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. Though the original act permits the humane slaughter of animals for food. Existing meat export policy in India prohibits the export of beef (meat of cow, oxen and calf). Bone in meat, carcass, half carcass of buffalo is also prohibited and is not permitted to be exported. Only the boneless meat of buffalo, meat of goat and sheep and birds is permitted for export. In 2017 India sought a total [...] "beef ban" [...] and Australian market analysts predicted that with the total ban of beef product export from India there would be <b>market</b> <b>opportunities</b> for leather traders and meat producers.

2500|$|Social {{media can}} be a useful source of market {{information}} {{and a way to}} hear customer perspectives. Blogs, content communities, and forums are platforms where individuals share their reviews and recommendations of brands, products, and services. Businesses are able to tap and analyze the customer voices and feedback generated in social media for marketing purposes; in this sense the social media is a relatively inexpensive source of market intelligence which can be used by marketers and managers to track and respond to consumer-identified problems and detect <b>market</b> <b>opportunities.</b> For example, the Internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 [...] "bend test" [...] which showed that the coveted phone could be bent by hand pressure. The so-called [...] "bend gate" [...] controversy created confusion amongst customers who had waited months for the launch of the latest rendition of the iPhone. However, Apple promptly issued a statement saying that the problem was extremely rare and that the company had taken several steps to make the mobile device's case stronger and robust. Unlike traditional market research methods such as surveys, focus groups, and data mining which are time-consuming and costly, and which take weeks or even months to analyze, marketers can use social media to obtain 'live' or [...] "real time" [...] information about consumer behavior and viewpoints on a company's brand or products. This can be useful in the highly dynamic, competitive, fast-paced and global marketplace of the 2010s.|$|E
2500|$|While {{a limited}} company is {{deemed to be}} a legal person {{separate}} from its shareholders and employees, {{as a matter of}} fact a company can only act through its employees, from the board of directors down. So there must be rules to attribute rights and duties to a company from its actors. This usually matters because an aggrieved third party will want to sue whoever has money to pay for breach of an obligation, and companies rather than their employees often have more money. Up until reforms in 2006 this area used to be complicated significantly by the requirement on companies to specify an objects clause for their business, for instance [...] "to make and sell, or lend on hire, railway-carriages". If companies acted outside their objects, for instance by giving a loan to build railways in Belgium, any such contracts were said to be ultra vires and consequently void. This is what happened in the early case of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co Ltd v Riche. The policy was thought to protect shareholders and creditors, whose investments or credit would not be used for an unanticipated purpose. However, it soon became clear that the ultra vires rule restricted the flexibility of businesses to expand to meet <b>market</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Void contracts might unexpectedly and arbitrarily hinder business. So companies began to draft ever longer objects clauses, often adding an extra provision stating all objects must be construed as fully separate, or the company's objects include anything directors feel is reasonably incidental to the business. Now the 2006 Act states that companies are deemed to have unlimited objects, unless they opt for restrictions. The 2006 reforms have also clarified the legal position that if a company does have limited objects, an ultra vires act will cause the directors to have breached a duty to follow the constitution under section 171. So a shareholder who disagreed with an action outside the company's objects must sue directors for any loss. Contracts remain valid and third parties will be unaffected by this alone.|$|E

Additionally, <b>marketing</b> <b>opportunities</b> related to RFID usage have been argued to exist. Despite this, limited research has focused on RFID in a marketing context which constitutes the research gap for this study.   A literature review on the subject area yielded an overview of the existing literature within the field. The literature review identified a research gap that constitutes the purpose of this study. The purpose is to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of Radio Frequency IDentification technology and whether it enhances retailers’ <b>marketing</b> <b>opportunities.</b> The study was of a qualitative nature and was conducted through a multiple case study. Data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with four companies. An archival analysis was performed in addition to the interviews. The interview data reveals that RFID technology adoption still has barriers to overcome, especially in regards to the identified <b>marketing</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Based on the conclusions of this study recommendations for managerial implications were formed. The findings of the study were able to support previous research stating that the main challenge for RFID adoption is the cost of the equipment. However, the previously identified <b>marketing</b> <b>opportunities</b> were not fully supported by the interviewed companies, thus, this area of research needs to be developed further. ...|$|R
