40|$|This study {{examines}} the relative economics of electric vehicle {{operation in the}} context of current electricity rates in specific utility service territories. The authors examined 14 utility territories offering electric vehicle (EV) rates, focusing on California but also including other regions of the United States. The consumer costs of EV charging were examined in comparison with gasoline price data, geographic location, and during three highly variable gasoline price periods of July 2008, January 2009, and July 2009. In a switch from a conventional 23 <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> <b>gallon</b> (10. 2 liters/ 100 kilometers) vehicle to a 300 watt-hours/mile electric vehicle driven 10, 000 miles (16, 100 km) per year, the study finds that savings in fuel costs ranged from approximately $ 100 US to $ 1, 800 US annually, with considerable geographic variation and with higher-end values mostly in Summer 2008 when gasoline prices were relatively high. Charging off-peak instead of during peak periods saves an average of only a few hundred dollars US per year, rendering the incentive to charge off-peak a relatively small one except perhaps during some summer months when the on-peak prices are especially high. Gasoline price variances have a larger effect and switching from a low fuel economy conventional vehicle to the reference EV (compared with a switch from an already efficient vehicle) presents the highest savings level. The West and Midwest are generally the most favorable regions for EV economics, when EV charging rates and gasoline prices are considered together. UCD-ITS-RR- 10 - 06, Civil Engineering...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a research study using {{one year of}} driving data obtained from plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) located in Sacramento and San Francisco, California to determine the effectiveness of incorporating geographic information into vehicle performance algorithms. Sacramento and San Francisco were chosen because {{of the availability of}} high resolution (1 / 9 arc second) digital elevation data. First, I present a method for obtaining instantaneous road slope, given a latitude and longitude, and introduce its use into common driving intensity algorithms. I show that for trips characterized by > 40 m of net elevation change (from key on to key off), the use of instantaneous road slope significantly changes the results of driving intensity calculations. For trips exhibiting elevation loss, algorithms ignoring road slope overestimated driving intensity by as much as 211 Wh/mile, while for trips exhibiting elevation gain these algorithms underestimated driving intensity by as much as 333 Wh/mile. Second, I describe and test an algorithm that incorporates vehicle route type into computations of city and highway fuel economy. Route type was determined by intersecting trip GPS points with ESRI StreetMap road types and assigning each trip as either city or highway route type according to whichever road type comprised the largest distance traveled. The fuel economy results produced by the geographic classification were compared to the fuel economy results produced by algorithms that assign route type based on average speed or driving style. Most results were within 1 <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> <b>gallon</b> ({approx} 3 %) of one another; the largest difference was 1. 4 miles per gallon for charge depleting highway trips.

40|$|Government {{policies}} increasingly promote ethanol {{and other}} biofuels for security, air quality, and climate benefits. One chapter of this dissertation develops {{a model that}} links the distribution of preferences for ethanol to aggregate price responses and then estimates the model using data from {{a large number of}} retail ethanol stations. Ethanol demand is sensitive to relative fuel prices with a mean elasticity 2. 5 [...] 3. 0. The estimates imply that preferences for ethanol are heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, as previous literature assumes. Accounting for this heterogeneity cuts the estimated cost of a minimum market share standard for ethanol in half, because households with strong preferences do not require large subsidies to choose ethanol over gasoline. Similar intuition likely applies for policies designed to promote other "green" substitutes, such as electricity from renewable sources. Even so, the cost of the ethanol standard exceeds benefits by a wide margin, implying that the policy is harmful. Researchers should focus on marginal households when assessing the impact of policy, because assuming mean preferences can generate misleading results. Another chapter of this dissertation analyzes the market for flexible-fuel vehicles. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations feature a "loophole" that credits gasoline-ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles with far better mileage than they actually achieve. Empirical evidence shows that firms affected by CAFE standards produce flexible-fuel vehicles to exploit this loophole and that marginal consumers do not value flexible-fuel capacity. Under these and other conditions an automaker will equate the marginal cost of improving mileage using flexible-fuel vehicles with the marginal cost of improving mileage through other means. This insight implies that one can infer the marginal cost of complying with CAFE standards for automakers that produce flexible-fuel vehicles. Based on this approach, the estimated cost of tightening CAFE standards by one <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> <b>gallon</b> is at most $ 10 [...] $ 20 in lost profit per vehicle for domestic automakers, assuming incremental production costs of $ 100 [...] $ 200 for flexible-fuel vehicles.

40|$|For {{the past}} twenty years, energy and {{environmental}} analysts in the U. S. have been searching for ways to improve urban air quality and make the country less vulnerable to supply and price volatility in the world oil market. To improve urban air quality, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency {{and a number of}} state air-quality agencies favor controls on emissions of non-methane hydrocarbons, which are one of the main contributors to ozone formation, and which are emitted along the entire fuel production-and-use chain, from drilling for oil through oil refining and gasoline marketing, to vehicle tailpipe emissions. To reduce oil consumption, some analysts and policy makers have suggested that the fuel economy of motor vehicles be increased substantially. These policies [...] to control emissions in order to improve air quality, and to increase fuel economy in order to reduce oil consumption [...] have always been considered separately in the U. S. In this paper we connect emission reduction policy with fuel-economy-improvement policy. We also examine a related issue: Does the side benefit of lower emissions due to improved fuel economy mean that fuel economy standards should be set even higher? Typically, when analysts estimate how high fuel economy standards should be, they compare the extra costs of efficiency-improving technology (including perhaps such things as reduced safety and performance) with the benefits of reduced fuel consumption. Such cost-benefit analyses have indicated an "optimal" level of fuel economy (where benefits balance costs) of between 30 and 40 mpg, depending on assumptions and methods. However, the analyses done to date have not counted the potential reduction in emissions as a benefit of improved fuel economy. We do so here, by assuming that the value of a ton of emissions eliminated by higher fuel economy is equal to the cost of controlling (eliminating) that ton by traditional control means. We find that adding the value of emission reductions to the benefit side of the cost-benefit analysis justifies raising fuel economy standards by an additional one <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> <b>gallon</b> only. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} {{of meeting the}} Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards of 2025 has led to major developments in thetransportation sector, among which is the attempt to utilize clean energy sources. To date, use of solar energy as an auxiliary source ofon-board fuel has not been extensively investigated. This paper is the first study at undertaking a comprehensive analysis of using solarenergy on-board by means of photovoltaic (PV) technologies to enhance automotive fuel economies, extend driving ranges, reducegreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and ensure better economic value of internal combustion engine (ICE) -based vehicles to meet CAFEstandards though 2025. This paper details and compares various aspects of hybrid solar electric vehicles with conventional ICE vehicles. Different driving locations, vehicle sizes, various driving patterns and different cost scenarios are used {{in order to enhance}} the currentunderstanding of the applicability and effectiveness of using on-board PV modules in individual automobiles and ensure an accuraterepresentation of driving conditions in all U. S states at any time. These times and location-dependent results obtained over a year show anincrease in the combined <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> <b>gallon</b> (MPG) at noon in the range of 2. 9 - 9. 5 % for a vehicle similar to a Tesla S, and a significantincrease in the range of 10. 7 - 42. 2 % for lightweight and aerodynamic efficient vehicles. In addition, by adding on-board PVs to cover lessthan 50 % of the projected horizontal surface area of a typical mid-size vehicle (e. g., Toyota Camry or Nissan Leaf), up to 50 % of totaldaily miles traveled by an average U. S. person could be driven by solar energy. Also, the return on investment (ROI) of adding PVson-board with ICE vehicle over its lifetime shows only negative values when the price of gasoline remains below $ 4. 0 per gallon and thevehicle is driven in low-solar energy area (e. g., Boston, MA). The same ROI is more than 250 % if the vehicle is driven in high-solarenergy area (e. g., Arizona), even if the gasoline price remains low. For future price scenarios, this ROI is much higher - nearly 10 times theinvestment cost under some scenarios, with the assumption of an eventual decline in battery costs.
