500|$|Training {{conditions}} {{aboard the}} ship {{were less than}} ideal throughout the voyage. Rough seas for parts of the journey hampered training and contributed to widespread seasickness. Although the long distance runners were able to practice by making multiple circuits of the ship, the sprinters and hurdlers were provided only a [...] cork track—two-thirds {{the length of the}} shortest track event at the games—on which to practice. Javelins were tethered by rope and aimed by their throwers at the sea, and, when thrown, would often come down in unexpected locations. The only facility for swimmers was a canvas saltwater tank set up on the lower deck; the tank split when filled for the first time. Even after it was repaired, the best the swimmers could do was to practice strokes while tied to the corner of the tank with a rope, and divers, with no other facilities available, were allocated just a few minutes a day in the tank. Conditions on the ship contributed to several injuries to athletes. During foggy weather, American decathlete Everett Ellis fell on the slippery deck, suffering a bad sprain, and shot putter Pat McDonald sprained his thumb while tossing a <b>medicine</b> <b>ball</b> on the pitching deck.|$|E

2500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} he {{was drafted}} into the Phillies organization, Buchanan drew {{comparisons}} to Kyle Kendrick, a pitcher who possesses similar attributes, specifically that they are built similarly in terms of height and weight, and that they both are reliable groundball pitchers. Also similar to Kendrick, many fans and others have overlooked Buchanan during his minor league tenure; he did not receive any interview requests during the Reading Phillies' media day in 2012, despite being one of the team's top starting pitchers. An article in The Times Herald asserted, [...] "Most of what gets Buchanan overlooked are the things that get his pitching compared to Kendrick’s: He isn’t overpowering, but he uses a sinker and control on the corners to coax ground balls and keep his team in games. That capability has earned Kendrick 153 starts and 64 wins over the last seven seasons with the Phillies, not to mention a $7.7 million deal in 2014 as he approaches free agency." [...] Buchanan also possesses a strong work ethic – instead of talking to the media or celebrating with teammates after throwing seven scoreless innings and striking out nine, he completed a 45-minute <b>medicine</b> <b>ball</b> workout. In addition to the aforementioned sinker, he throws a slider and a changeup.|$|E

Diminuendo--Psyche using the <b>medicine</b> <b>ball.</b> Presto--Psyche doing road work. Forte--The night of the fight. And then things began to move to a climax. With the fiddles working themselves to the bone and the piano bounding under its persecutor's blows, Lady Wetherby ducked, side-stepped, rushed, and sprang, moving her arms in a manner that may have been classical Greek, but to the untrained eye looked much more like the last round of some open-air bout.|$|E
5000|$|The last {{event was}} a [...] "chipper," [...] a workout {{involving}} multiple exercises done sequentially without returning (as in [...] "chipping away" [...] {{at the number}} of repetitions) for the fastest time.

Once completed, they performed 25 sit-ups with the <b>medicine</b> <b>ball</b> on a glute-hamstring developer (GHD), a piece of equipment where the feet lock in and the sit-up is performed at a greater range of motion. The chipper was finished with a hill sprint while carrying the <b>medicine</b> <b>ball.</b> The men used a 30-pound <b>medicine</b> <b>ball</b> and the women used a 20-pound <b>medicine</b> <b>ball.</b> Brent Fikowski and Annie Thorisdottir won the event.|$|E
