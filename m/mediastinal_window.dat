40|$|Our {{objective}} was to analyze the peripheral pulmonary arteries using thin-collimation multi-slice spiral CT. Twenty consecutive patients underwent enhanced-spiral multi-slice CT using 1 -mm collimation. Two observers analyzed the pulmonary arteries by consensus on a workstation. Each artery was identified on axial and 3 D shaded-surface display reconstruction images. Each subsegmental artery was measured at a <b>mediastinal</b> <b>window</b> setting and compared with anatomical classifications. The location and branching of every subsegmental artery was recorded. The number of well-visualized sub-subsegmental arteries at a <b>mediastinal</b> <b>window</b> setting was compared with those visualized at a lung window setting. Of 800 subsegmental arteries, 769 (96 %) were correctly visualized and 123 accessory subsegmental arteries were identified using the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>window</b> setting. One thousand ninety-two of 2019 sub-subsegmental arteries (54 %) identified using the lung window setting were correctly visualized using the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>window</b> setting.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} clarify {{that the size of}} the lung {{adenocarcinoma}} evaluated using <b>mediastinal</b> <b>window</b> on computed tomography is an important and useful modality for predicting invasiveness, lymph node metastasis and prognosis in small adenocarcinoma. Methods: We evaluated 176 patients with small lung adenocarcinomas (diameter, 1 – 3 cm) who underwent standard surgical resection. Tumours were examined using computed tomography with thin section conditions (1. 25 mm thick on high-resolution computed tomography) with tumour dimensions evaluated under two settings: lung window and <b>mediastinal</b> <b>window.</b> We also determined the patient age, gender, preoperative nodal status, tumour size, tumour disappearance ratio, preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels and pathological status (lymphatic vessel, vascular vessel or pleural invasion). Recurrence-free survival was used for prognosis. Results: Lung window, <b>mediastinal</b> <b>window,</b> tumour disappearance ratio and preoperative nodal status were significant predictive factors for recurrence-free survival in univariate analyses. Areas under the receiver operator curves for recurrence were 0. 76, 0. 73 and 0. 65 for <b>mediastinal</b> <b>window,</b> tumour disappearance ratio and lung window, respectively.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} a gradient-based segmentation method for GTV delineation on FDG-PET in NSCLC through surgical specimen, in comparison with threshold-based approaches and CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients with stage I-II NSCLC were prospectively enrolled. Before lobectomy, all patients underwent contrast enhanced CT and gated FDG-PET. Next, the surgical specimen was removed, inflated with gelatin, frozen and sliced. The digitized slices were used to reconstruct the 3 D macroscopic specimen. GTVs were manually delineated on the macroscopic specimen and on CT images. GTVs were automatically segmented on PET images using a gradient-based method, a source to background ratio method and fixed threshold values at 40 % and 50 % of SUV(max). All images were finally registered. Analyses of raw volumes and logarithmic differences between GTVs and GTV(macro) were performed on all patients and on a subgroup excluding the poorly defined tumors. A matching analysis between the different GTVs was also conducted using Dice's similarity index. RESULTS: Considering all patients, both lung and <b>mediastinal</b> <b>windowed</b> CT overestimated the macroscopy, while FDG-PET provided closer values. Among various PET segmentation methods, the gradient-based technique best estimated the true tumor volume. When analysis was restricted to well defined tumors without lung fibrosis or atelectasis, the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>windowed</b> CT accurately assessed the macroscopic specimen. Finally, the matching analysis did not reveal significant difference between the different imaging modalities. CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET improved the GTV definition in NSCLC including when the primary tumor was surrounded by modifications of the lung parenchyma. In this context, the gradient-based method outperformed the threshold-based ones in terms of accuracy and robustness. In other cases, the conventional <b>mediastinal</b> <b>windowed</b> CT remained appropriate...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} software in segmenting ground-glass and solid components of subsolid nodules in pulmonary adenocarcinomas. METHOD: Seventy-three pulmonary adenocarcinomas manifesting as subsolid nodules were included. Two radiologists measured the maximal axial diameter of the ground-glass components on lung windows {{and that of the}} solid components on lung and <b>mediastinal</b> <b>windows.</b> Nodules were segmented using software by applying five (- 850 HU to - 650 HU) and nine (- 130 HU to - 500 HU) attenuation thresholds. We compared the manual and software measurements of ground-glass and solid components with pathology measurements of tumour and invasive components. RESULTS: Segmentation of ground-glass components at a threshold of - 750 HU yielded mean differences of + 0. 06 mm (p = 0. 83, 95 % limits of agreement, 4. 51 to 4. 67) and - 2. 32 mm (p < 0. 001, - 8. 27 to 3. 63) when compared with pathology and manual measurements, respectively. For solid components, mean differences between the software (at - 350 HU) and pathology measurements and between the manual (lung and <b>mediastinal</b> <b>windows)</b> and pathology measurements were - 0. 12 mm (p = 0. 74, - 5. 73 to 5. 55]), 0. 15 mm (p = 0. 73, - 6. 92 to 7. 22), and - 1. 14 mm (p < 0. 001, - 7. 93 to 5. 64), respectively. CONCLUSION: Software segmentation of ground-glass and solid components in subsolid nodules showed no significant difference with pathology. KEY POINTS: * Software can effectively segment ground-glass and solid components in subsolid nodules. * Software measurements show no significant difference with pathology measurements. * Manual measurements are more accurate on lung <b>windows</b> than on <b>mediastinal</b> <b>windows...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether semiautomatic volumetric software can differentiate part-solid from nonsolid pulmonary nodules and aid quantification {{of the solid}} component. Methods As per reference standard, 115 nodules were differentiated into nonsolid and part-solid by two radiologists; disagreements were adjudicated by a third radiologist. The diameters of solid components were measured manually. Semiautomatic volumetric measurements were used to identify and quantify a possible solid component, using different Hounsfield unit (HU) thresholds. The measurements were compared with the reference standard and manual measurements. Results The reference standard detected a solid component in 86 nodules. Diagnosis of a solid component by semiautomatic software depended on the threshold chosen. A threshold of - 300 HU resulted in the detection of a solid component in 75 nodules with good sensitivity (90 %) and specificity (88 %). At a threshold of - 130 HU, semiautomatic measurements of {{the diameter of the}} solid component (mean 2. 4 mm, SD 2. 7 mm) were comparable to manual measurements at the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>window</b> setting (mean 2. 3 mm, SD 2. 5 mm [p= 0. 63]).

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{measurement}} variability of subsolid nodules (SSNs) in follow-up situations and {{to compare the}} degree of variability between measurement metrics. Two same-day repeat-CT scans of 69 patients (24 men and 45 women) with 69 SSNs were randomly assigned as initial or follow-up scans and were read by the same (situation 1) or different readers (situation 2). SSN size and solid portion size were measured in both situations. Measurement variability was calculated and coefficients of variation were used for comparisons. Measurement variability for the longest and average diameter of SSNs was ± 1. 3 mm (± 13. 0 %) and ± 1. 3 mm (± 14. 4 %) in situation 1, and ± 2. 2 mm (± 21. 0 %) and ± 2. 1 mm (± 21. 3 %) in situation 2, respectively. For solid portion, measurement variability on lung and mediastinal windows was ± 1. 2 mm (± 27. 1 %) and ± 0. 8 mm (± 24. 0 %) in situation 1, and ± 3. 7 mm (± 61. 0 %) and ± 1. 5 mm (± 47. 3 %) in situation 2, respectively.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveDifferentiation of bronchioloalveolar {{carcinoma}} {{from other}} subtypes of lung adenocarcinomas {{is important in}} the preoperative assessment of patients. We examined the biologic aggressiveness of small-sized adenocarcinomas according to the pathologically defined bronchioloalveolar carcinoma degree and its correlation with computed tomography findings. In addition, we attempted to predict which patients were suitable for a lesser resection. MethodsOf 424 consecutive patients who underwent operation for primary lung cancer in the last 3 years, 114 with a histopathologically proven adenocarcinoma 3 cm or less in diameter underwent complete removal of the primary tumor. We examined the characteristics of patients classified into 3 groups based on the proportion of the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma component: 0 % to 20 % (n = 40), 21 % to 50 % (n = 38), and 51 % to 100 % (n = 36). We also investigated the correlation of the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma component with computed tomography findings such as ground-glass opacity (defined as a hazy increase on the lung window) and tumor shadow disappearance rate (defined as the ratio of the tumor area of the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>window</b> to that of the lung window). ResultsMale gender (P =. 0001), advanced pathologic stage (P =. 001), larger size of the tumor (P =. 004), nodal involvement (P =. 04), pleural invasion (P =. 0003), lymphatic invasion (P =. 002), and vascular invasion (P =. 0002) were observed more often among patients with a smaller proportion of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. A positive and significant correlation was found between the rate of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma component and ground-glass opacity (R 2 = 0. 488, P <. 0001) and tumor shadow disappearance rate (R 2 = 0. 727, P <. 0001). As an independent predictor of nodal status, tumor shadow disappearance rate (P =. 015) and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma component (P =. 015), as well as tumor size, were significantly valuable, although ground-glass opacity proportion (P =. 086) was marginally informative. ConclusionsSmall-sized adenocarcinomas with a greater ratio of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma component showed less aggressive behavior. Both tumor shadow disappearance rate and ground-glass opacity ratios, which are obtained preoperatively, were well associated with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ratios, which are determined postoperatively. Furthermore, tumor shadow disappearance rate had a stronger impact as a predictor of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma component. Preoperative assessment of tumor shadow disappearance rate may be useful to identify patients requiring a less extensive pulmonary resection...|$|E

Mycobacterium simiae is a rare cause of NTM pulmonary infection. Herein, we aimed to evaluate and compare the computed tomography (CT) scan findings of M. simiae infection in lungs. For this reason, thirty-four patients (n= 34) with M. simiae lung infection were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnosis was confirmed by American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines and CT scans were reviewed in both lung and <b>mediastinal</b> <b>windows.</b> The average age of patients was 63 ± 14. 54 years and 52. 9 % were male. The majority of patients had cough (91. 2 %) and sputum production (76. 5 %). Clinically, 41. 2 % of patients had previous history of TB (14 / 34), 38. 2 % had cardiac diseases (13 / 34), and 35. 3 % had diabetes mellitus (12 / 34). The most common CT findings in our study were nodular lesions (100 %) and bronchiectasis (85. 29 %). Regarding the severity, grade I bronchiectasis was the most prevalent.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: It is {{not clear}} whether lymphadenectomy has {{therapeutic}} benefit in non–small cell lung cancer management. To avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomy, we attempted to identify clinical or radiologic predictors of pathologic N 0 disease in patients with peripheral adenocarcinoma. Methods: From August 1992 through April 1997, 269 consecutive patients with peripheral adenocarcinoma who underwent major lung resection and systematic lymph node dissection were enrolled in this study. We reviewed their contrast-enhancement computed tomographic scans and recorded the maximum dimension of tumors both on pulmonary (pDmax) and on <b>mediastinal</b> (mDmax) <b>window</b> setting images, the largest dimension perpendicular to the maximum axis on both pulmonary (pDperp) and <b>mediastinal</b> (mDperp) <b>window</b> setting images, and the size of all detectable hilar-mediastinal lymph nodes. We defined a new radiologic parameter, tumor shadow disappearance rate (TDR), which is calculated with the following formula: TDR = 1 − (mDmax × mDperp) /(pDmax × pDperp). Results: In multivariable analysis a lower serum carcinoembryonic antigen level and a higher tumor shadow disappearance rate were significant predictors of pathologic N 0 disease. Lymph node size on computed tomographic scanning was not a significant predictor. Among 59 patients with a normal preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level and a tumor shadow disappearance rate of 0. 8 or more, 58 (98 %) patients had pathologic N 0 disease, and the other patient had pathologic N 1 disease. Conclusions: Mediastinal lymph node involvement was not found in patients with a normal preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen level and a tumor shadow disappearance rate 0. 8 or more.
