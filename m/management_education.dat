40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] PU for CHE, 1999 This study {{investigated}} management {{development as a}} task of school managers by focusing on: • {{the need for a}} new <b>education</b> <b>management</b> development approach in South African schools; • the nature and scope of management development; • the international and national perspectives on the <b>education</b> <b>management</b> development practice; • current <b>education</b> <b>management</b> development activities in Gauteng schools; and • an <b>education</b> <b>management</b> development model for Gauteng schools. The literature study exposed the need for a new <b>education</b> <b>management</b> development approach in South African schools, the nature, scope and major aspects of management development. Furthermore, management development approaches, techniques and methods as well as guidelines for a new holistic approach are described. The investigation into the <b>education</b> <b>management</b> development practice for school managers exposed advanced levels in this regard in the UK and USA. Malaysia, Zimbabwe and Namibia are engaged in customising effective programmes for school managers. South Africa is focusing on a holistic approach, with a significant step taken being, the establishment of the National Institute for <b>Education</b> <b>Management</b> Development. The empirical study consisted of a structured questionnaire distributed to a sample population of I 08 school principals, 80 deputy principals and 210 heads of departments to investigate their management development needs, experiences and activities. Main findings revealed a lack of training for school <b>management,</b> uncoordinated <b>education</b> <b>management</b> development programmes, with existing ones being reactions to crisis situations, and ill-defined management roles for school managers. School principals seem solely responsible for school management, thus exposing a need for a school-based management development approach. The management development model developed for Gauteng schools focuses on whole-school development, recognises the participatory management vision of the new education system, includes stakeholder involvement in <b>education</b> <b>management</b> development and provides school managers with a model that employs the ODE Quality Assurance Framework. The major recommendations flowing from this study include customising <b>education</b> <b>management</b> linguistics for South Africa, defining job descriptions for school managers, preparing and inducing school managers, setting <b>education</b> <b>management</b> qualifications for <b>education</b> <b>management</b> posts and institutionalising the National Institute for <b>Education</b> <b>Management</b> Development.
