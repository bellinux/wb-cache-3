25|$|Because the M2 tidal {{constituent}} dominates in most locations, {{the stage}} or {{phase of a}} tide, denoted by the time in hours after high water, is a useful concept. Tidal stage is also measured in degrees, with 360° per tidal cycle. Lines of constant tidal phase are called cotidal lines, which are analogous to contour lines of constant altitude on topographical maps. High water is reached simultaneously along the cotidal lines extending from the coast out into the ocean, and cotidal lines (and hence tidal phases) advance along the coast.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Outcrop {{exposures}} and high-resolution subcrop data {{allow the}} description and mapping of four stratigraphic discontinuities in the fully nonmarine strata of the Campanian–Maastrichtian Wapiti Formation (Western Interior foreland basin, Alberta, Canada). This framework defines four unconformity-bounded depositional sequences (A–D), based on sequence stratigraphic methodology, well-log patterns, and facies analysis. In ascending order, sequence A records {{the transition from}} the underlying marine facies of the Puskwaskau Formation into the Wapiti fluvial facies, and consists of strongly progradational and aggradational stacking patterns. Sequences B and C show a similar pattern of basal amalgamated channel-fill deposits that grade upwards into floodplain-dominated strata. Finally, sequence D is dominated by channelized sediments and extensive overbank facies. An aggradational stacking pattern suggests deposition under high-accommodation conditions. <b>Maximum</b> <b>flooding</b> surfaces are interpreted within fine-grained deposits in the upper portions of sequences C and D. They are tied to regionally extensive coals that accumulated more than 250 km away from the coeval shoreline. This study provides new evidence that major coal seams may represent the extension of marine <b>maximum</b> <b>flooding</b> surfaces into the downstream-controlled fluvial realm. Furthermore, the new stratigraphic framework of subaerial unconformities and <b>maximum</b> <b>flooding</b> surfaces provides the means of subdividing the previously undifferentiated fully nonmarine Wapiti Formation into depositional sequences and component systems tracts...|$|R

Specifically, within each depositional sequence, three distinct and identical events of morphological change occur, involving ammonoids belonging to different groups.

40|$|Biological {{principles}} {{suggest that}} recorded species diversity should increase as sampled area and habitat diversity increase. However, {{the interactions between}} Earth system drivers of these physical quantities, their representation in the preserved rock record, and fossil species counts are debated. We tracked marine bedrock area, lithofacies diversity, and echinoid species diversity through an 80 m. y. sea-level cycle, as recorded in the Cretaceous of the United Kingdom, to test these relationships. Relative completeness of the rock record rises during transgression but drops rapidly at <b>maximum</b> <b>flooding</b> and continues to fall during highstand. Lithofacies diversity peaks during transgression but drops sharply as <b>maximum</b> <b>flooding</b> is reached, whereas bedrock area peaks at <b>maximum</b> <b>flooding</b> then declines progressively through the highstand interval {{as a result of}} post-Cretaceous erosion. Both bedrock area and number of lithofacies units correlate with species diversity, but species diversity is predicted best by the two combined. There are no simple relationships between bedrock area and lithofacies diversity or the original area of marine sediments and range of habitats that once existed; these variables are strongly shaped by stratigraphic architecture. While the geological record left by a major sea-level cycle accurately captures the biological evolution of local communities, it is incomplete and systematically biased in its coverage of environments and communities. Erosional truncation of sediment packages and species ranges in the later stages of sea-level cycles explains the reported asymmetric relationship between macroevolution and macrostratigraphy. © 2012 Geological Society of America...|$|R

40|$|The graptolitic Early Ordovician {{succession}} of the Mount Hunneberg locality, southern Sweden, shows {{the response of}} graptolite faunas to sea-level changes. The exposed interval consists of intercalated car-bonates and shales at the base, grading into pure black shales in its central and upper part. This facies trend records a deepening of the depositional environment due to an overall sea-level rise. The Mount Hunneberg graptolite fauna is dominated by nearshore, shallow-marine forms found in most layers throughout the succession. Deeper-water pandemic species occur only rarely together with shallow-water graptolites but are dominant at four distinct traceable levels at Mount Hunneberg. This change in graptolite faunal composition is interpreted to indicate sea-level fluctuations. With rising sea level, shallow-water endemics and pandemics migrated landward, and deeper-water pandemic graptolites became increasingly frequent on the shelf. During {{the peak of the}} transgression, deep-water forms dominated. With falling sea level, shallow-water forms again ap-peared and replaced the deep-water graptolites. The four levels with deep-water graptolites at Mount Hunneberg are, therefore, inter-preted to represent <b>maximum</b> <b>flooding</b> surfaces. This study demon-strates that changes in the faunal composition of such planktic organisms as graptolites provide a promising tool for recognizing <b>maximum</b> <b>flooding</b> surfaces.
