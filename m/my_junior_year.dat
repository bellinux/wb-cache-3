40|$|A {{student from}} The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Fremantle Campus {{could be just}} a few years away from {{achieving}} her dream of representing Australia in water polo at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Cathryn Earl, 19, recently returned from a four-day training camp in Sydney as part of an Australian water polo team comprising athletes born in 1993. She is currently training in a bid to be selected for her team which will take part in world championships to be held in Hungary or The Netherlands next year. In the meantime, Ms Earl has her sights set on making a squad of 13 for a series of games in Europe this August. The trip will complete a busy year for the Bachelor of Sport and Recreation Management/Commerce student who competed for a team called ‘The Barbarians’ against the best water polo players from China, Brazil and USA at the January Pan Pacific Championships in Melbourne. Ms Earl hopes to use these unique experiences as a launching pad for possible selection in the Australian water polo squad for the 2016 Olympic Games. “I began playing water polo when I was around eight-years-old because I was a capable swimmer and my two older sisters were playing the sport,” Ms Earl said. “As I got older, I started to really enjoy the competitive and social aspects of the sport which led me to participate in State teams throughout <b>my</b> <b>junior</b> <b>years.</b> ” Juggling study at Notre Dame with water polo training and competition commitments has not been without its challenges, says Ms Earl. Depending on the time of year, training can include pool sessions most mornings and afternoons, plus several hours in the gym. She said Notre Dame had given her the confidence to pursue her sporting dreams as well as maintain her commitment to strive for academic excellence in the Fremantle School of Business. Ms Earl’s efforts were acknowledged at the Business Awards for 2012 as the recipient of the WA Sports Federation Prize in Sport and Recreation Management. It is awarded to the highest achieving first year School of Business student who has performed well and made a significant contribution to the community in the unit Sport and Recreation Industry Practicum. “One important skill I have learnt along the way has been the ability to incorporate the challenges of work, university, schooling, water polo training and social life into my daily calendar,” Ms Earl said. “These skills have developed over the years as there are many important people within the Notre Dame and water polo communities who have helped me and will continue to improve my career. ” Shelley Robinson: Tel (08) 9433 0610; Mob 0408 959 138 Leigh Dawson: Tel (08) 9433 0569; Mob 0405 441 09...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Ducci map is {{considered}} applied to vectors in Rn. It is shown that for certain starting vectors of odd length, the corresponding sequence of iterates asymptotically approaches a periodic vector, but never becomes periodic itself. On the other hand, for any starting vectors not of this type, it is {{shown that the}} corresponding Ducci sequence becomes eventually periodic. A simple method for determining if a given vector is of this certain type is presented. In this way, the asymptotic behavior of all Ducci sequences of vectors in Rn, n odd, is characterized. The map is then applied to the specific case of R 3. It is shown that in this case, the Ducci sequences of vectors of the aforementioned type approach the zero vector only.
