Non-essential staff and tourists were evacuated from the small resort islands of South <b>Molle</b> Island and Long islands. in the Whitsundays to shelters located on larger islands. A state of emergency was also declared for several coastal areas. On 8 March, an estimated 1,000 tourists were evacuated from Fraser Island and more evacuations also took place on Lady Elliot Island and Heron Island.

500|$|Most of the {{accommodation}} cabins {{were destroyed}} on South <b>Molle</b> Island, {{where a woman}} {{in one of the}} structures was killed and her partner severely injured. Damage on South <b>Molle</b> amounted to $500,000. On Hayman Island, the winds unroofed most cabins and other buildings, accounting for an estimated $1 million in damage. Long Island was subjected to Ada's left-front quadrant—the most intense part of the storm—and the Palm Bay Resort there was devastated, with only a few huts remaining. However, another resort on the western side of the island escaped relatively unscathed. The biggest resort in the Whitsundays at the time, on Daydream Island, was destroyed, requiring $400,000 to rebuild. About 150 tourists sought shelter in part of a recreation hall, which was the only major portion of a building left intact on Daydream. Nearly every building on Hook Island was lost, and four men remained sheltered there for a week after the storm. Farther south, rough seas broke apart a [...] stone jetty at Brampton Island in the Cumberland Group.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} enhance the {{knowledge}} of shale objectives from Vaca Muerta and Los <b>Molles</b> Formations in the Neuquén Basin, Argentina, chemostratigraphic and mud gas carbon isotope analyses were performed in two wells from Agua del Cajón and Salitral oilfields (ADC- 1016 and NqSa- 1148). Geochemical data show restricted levels in both cases to perforate and produce. In ADC- 1016 well, Lower Los <b>Molles</b> Formation looks like the most suitable play to be produced. At El Salitral oilfield (NqSa- 1148), the best remarkable Vaca Muerta-Quintuco objectives are associated with authigenic elements, in limited horizons. Enhancement of the Quintuco reservoir by deep circulating fluids (thermobaric reservoir) is suggested. Carbon isotope analysis reveals complex processes that affected the gas composition. Addition of microbial methane, biodegradation of ethane-propane and mixing of gases has been recognized. Isotope reversals and presumed water reforming of hydrocarbons have been registered associated with overpressure for Lower Los <b>Molles</b> Formation in the ADC- 1016 well, which is pointed out as the most promising shale play in the area. Vaca Muerta gases at Agua del Cajon ADC- 1016 well {{are associated with the}} homonymous source. El Salitral 1148 well shows that primary isotope composition in gases from Vaca Muerta shale play and Quintuco reservoir could be associated with a Lower Los <b>Molles</b> source, an aloctonous charge related with the main structures of the area...|$|R

500|$|In the islands, about 400 workers {{rushed to}} repair the resorts before peak tourism season; by mid-May, about 100 holiday cabins had been rebuilt and 20 boats {{restored}} to service. Hayman and Daydream islands reopened to guests in June and August 1970, respectively. South <b>Molle</b> Island changed ownership multiple times during the 1970s as it struggled to reattain its pre-Ada success, {{and many of the}} other resort islands were also sold as their owners were unable to meet the cost of renovations. The destruction of resorts in the Whitsundays triggered a sharp decline in Australian tourism revenue.

500|$|Battarrea phalloides may {{be found}} growing solitary to {{scattered}} on dry, sandy hedgebanks (raised or mounded boundary feature, often topped by a hedgerow), sometimes growing amongst elm suckers. It is a relatively rare species, but may be locally abundant in some locations.

The mushroom has been associated with the quick-growing evergreen tree Schinus <b>molle,</b> as well as Lycium brevipes, Solanum hindsianum, Salicornia subterminalis, Atriplex linearis, Quercus agrifolia and Opuntia species, in coastal dunes. The largest fruit bodies were found on floodplains with halophilic (i.e., thriving in high-salt conditions) vegetation. In Belgium, specimens were found on sandy soil under dead elderflower bushes.|$|E
