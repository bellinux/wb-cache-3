40|$|<b>Masonry</b> <b>infills</b> {{represent}} one of {{the prevailing}} types of non-structural elements in buildings of both Western and Eastern modern architecture. Recent seismic events have provided evidence that damage on <b>masonry</b> <b>infills</b> can lead not only to large economic losses but also to significant injuries and even fatalities. The estimation of damage of such elements and the corresponding consequences within the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework, requires reliable fragility curves. Although {{there is an important}} body of work on testing <b>masonry</b> <b>infills,</b> there is very limited work that has led to the definition of fragility functions. This contribution presents drift-based fragility functions developed for inplane loaded <b>masonry</b> <b>infills,</b> derived from a comprehensive experimental dataset gathered from current literature, comprising 152 specimens of infilled RC or steel frames tested under lateral cyclic loading, with different types of masonry blocks. Three key damage states associated with the structural performance and reparability of infill walls have been defined. In particular, four sources of uncertainty are evaluated: specimen-to-specimen, finite-sample, measured mortar compression strength and prism compression strength, presence of openings. The fragility curves developed in the present study are very useful for estimating damage and expected earthquake-induced economic losses for infilled buildings, by employing recently proposed methodologies based on aggregating the estimated damage at the component level for a specific structure...|$|R

The model was tested using experimental work done by Benjamin and Fiorato. It was then applied to four buildings surveyed in Bingöl, Turkey, following the May 1, 2003 earthquake.

Using a database compiled from research done to date on reinforced concrete frames with <b>masonry</b> <b>infills,</b> and on <b>masonry</b> panels, these damage states correspond to a specific drift range, which was used to compare the damage found in the buildings, and the drift level calculated when using the model. From these results, it is apparent that in earthquake zones where <b>masonry</b> <b>infilled</b> reinforced concrete frames are common, it is possible to accurately model the response of structures to a given ground motion by including the <b>masonry</b> <b>infills</b> with and without openings, creating a simple check of the deflection, and thus damage state expected in a building. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Numerous modern seismic codes {{including}} Eurocode 8 provide {{rules to}} avoid pos-sible adverse {{impact of the}} presence of <b>masonry</b> <b>infills</b> in concrete buildings or unbraced steel or composite structures. These adverse effects include damage of columns in contact with strong infills, reduction of the clear column height because of partial contact with masonry along height, planwise and heightwise irregularity. However, codes emphasize on the design of new structures, while little information is provided on modeling of <b>masonry</b> <b>infills.</b> Con-versely, when the seismic upgrading of existing structures is performed with those methods that have received wider application in engineering practice, i. e., strengthening of columns and beams with reinforced concrete (RC) jackets or Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRPs), con-struction of additional RC shear walls and construction of diagonal steel elements, any bene-ficial effect of <b>masonry</b> <b>infills</b> is usually ignored. The present research examines the effectiveness of strengthening existing RC frames with the application of FRP sheets on their brick-infill walls.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of <b>masonry</b> <b>infills</b> to the seismic resistance of existing reinforced concrete structures is significant, both before {{separation of the}} infill from the surrounding frame occurs and during large cycles of imposed deformations near collapse.

40|$|In many seismic areas, reinforced-concrete {{frames are}} filled with <b>masonry</b> <b>infill</b> walls.

In most cases, the <b>masonry</b> <b>infill</b> is excluded from the design process because it is considered a non-structural element. However, excluding them can have significant negative consequences. A properly modeled and designed reinforced-concrete frame with infill can significantly affect the strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation of the frame structure. In fact, a <b>masonry</b> <b>infill</b> combined with a relatively flexible reinforced-concrete frame certainly takes part in the resistance to horizontal actions. To investigate this issue, we modeled the behavior of frame structures with masonry infills in three ways: First, we used a linear seismic method of equivalent horizontal forces, applied to six models with different heights, modeling the <b>masonry</b> <b>infill</b> with “shell” finite elements. Second, we performed the same analysis with a “link” element as a compressive strut.

Such effects may be in many cases the cause of unexpected brittle collapse mechanisms which compromise the safety of the entire structure. In this paper by means of a double (micromodeling and macromodeling) procedure regarding RC meshes infilled with hollow brick masonry, a parametric study is provided defining a connection between local shear forces in critical frame regions and axial force on diagonal pin jointed strut.

40|$|Past {{research}} and practice has shown that <b>masonry</b> <b>infilling</b> of non-seismically designed reinforced concrete frames is a decisive parameter for their seismic response and more so {{during the early stages}} of deformation. It seems, therefore, that there would be much to gain if strength and deformation capacity of <b>masonry</b> <b>infilling</b> could be enhanced, modifying its character towards that of a structural element than the current non-structural one. To that end, a research effort, part of which is reported in this paper, was undertake investigating the possibility of converting <b>masonry</b> <b>infilling</b> to a reliable structural element employing innovative composite materials. A three-storey, RC plane frame – representing a scaled portion of a prototype existing structure – was constructed and <b>infilled</b> with <b>masonry</b> to serve as control specimen. The structure, tested under cyclic lateral loading up to failure, showed a stable response at the early stages of loading, with early cracking in masonry which accelerated during the subsequent loading cycles up to the initiation of shear cracking at the top end of one of the ground floor columns. Test results support the possibility of developing an alternative route for strengthening masonry-infilled frames: that of turning the infill to an actual structural element. This may be accomplished through the enhancement of strength and deformation capacity of the infills via suitably anchored, externally-bonded reinforcement and the provision of appropriate measures to guarantee relative monolithicity at frame-infill interface, provided that steps to exclude damage in the surrounding frame members (mainly the columns) are taken in advance. ...|$|R
