40|$|The article {{assesses the}} {{material}} footprints of households {{living on a}} minimum amount of social benefits in Finland and discusses the consequences in terms of ecological and social sustainability. The data were collected using interviews and a questionnaire on the consumption patterns of 18 single households. The results are compared to a study on households with varying income levels, to average consumption patterns and to decent <b>minimum</b> <b>reference</b> budgets. The low-income households have lower material footprints than average {{and most of the}} material footprints are below the socially sustainable level of consumption, which is based on decent <b>minimum</b> <b>reference</b> budgets. However, the amount of resources used by most of the households studied here is still at least double that required for ecological sustainability. The simultaneous existence of both deprivation and overconsumption requires measures from both politicians and companies to make consumption sustainable. For example, both adequate housing and economic mobility need to be addressed. Measures to improve the social sustainability of low-income households should target reducing the material footprints of more affluent households. Furthermore, the concept of what constitutes a decent life should be understood more universally than on the basis of standards of material consumption...|$|R

Thus, aimed to apply the SWAT model, version 2005, to simulate (i) the minimum and maximum annual daily streamflows associated to different return times, (ii) <b>minimum</b> <b>reference</b> streamflows for water rights, and (iii) scenarios of changes in soil use.

Gas sensors are identified as emerging measuring devices for “indicative measurements” regulated in the Air Quality Directive. Compared to reference measurements, gas sensors would allow air pollution monitoring at a lower cost. The Directive allows using indicative measurements without restriction in the zones where the upper assessment threshold (UAT) is not exceeded while they permit a reduction of 50 % of the <b>minimum</b> <b>reference</b> measurements where the UAT is exceeded.

50|$|An example {{crowbar circuit}} {{is shown to}} the right. This {{particular}} circuit uses an LM431 adjustable zener regulator to control {{the gate of the}} TRIAC. The resistor divider of R1 and R2 provide the reference voltage for the LM431. The divider is set so that during normal operating conditions, the voltage across R2 is slightly lower than VREF of the LM431. Since this voltage is below the <b>minimum</b> <b>reference</b> voltage of the LM431, it remains off and very little current is conducted through the zener and cathode resistor. If the cathode resistor is sized accordingly, very little voltage will be dropped across it and the TRIAC gate terminal will be essentially at the same potential as MT1, keeping the TRIAC off. If the supply voltage increases, the voltage across R2 will exceed VREF and the zener will begin to regulate voltage, drawing more current through it. The voltage at the gate terminal will be pulled down to VZ (the zener voltage), exceeding the gate trigger voltage of the TRIAC and latching it on.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} the paper {{concerns}} a consistent formulation of the classical Signorini's theory regarding the frictionless unilateral contact problem between two elastic bodies in the hypothesis of small displacements and strains. A variational approach, employed within the symmetric Boundary Element Method, leads to an algebraic formulation based on nodal quantities. The contact problem is decomposed into two sub-problems: one is purely elastic, and the other pertains to the unilateral contact condition alone. Following this methodology, the contact problem, faced with symmetric BEM, is characterized by symmetry and sign definiteness of the coefficient matrix, thus admitting a unique solution. The solution of the frictionless unilateral contact problem can be obtained - through a step-by-step analysis utilizing generalized quantities as check elements in the zones of potential contact or detachment. Indeed, the detachment or the contact phenomenon may happen when the weighted traction or the weighted displacement {{is greater than the}} weighted cohesion or weighted <b>minimum</b> <b>reference</b> gap, respectively; - through a quadratic programming problem based on the minimum of the total potential energy.

Thus, the aim of this work was to calibrate and validate in a daily time scale, the SWAT model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) to the watershed of the Galo creek, located in Espírito Santo State. To conduct the study we used georeferenced maps of relief, soil type and use, in addition to historical daily time series of basin climate and flow. In modeling were used time series corresponding to the periods Jan 1, 1995 to Dec 31, 2000 and Jan 1, 2001 to Dec 20, 2003 for calibration and validation, respectively. Model performance evaluation was done using the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E NS) and the percentage of bias (P BIAS).

40|$|This book {{presents}} a systematic {{approach to a}} solution theory for linear partial differential equations developed in a Hilbert space setting based on a Sobolev Lattice structure, a simple extension of the well established notion of a chain (or scale) of Hilbert spaces. The focus on a Hilbert space (rather than an apparently more general Banach space) setting is not a severe constraint, but rather a highly adaptable and suitable approach providing a more transparent framework for presenting the main issues {{in the development of}} a solution theory for partial differential equations. In contrast to other texts on partial differential equations which consider either specific types of partial differential equations or apply a collection of tools for solving a variety of partial differential equations, this book takes a more global point of view by focussing on the issues involved in determining the appropriate functional analytic setting in which a solution theory can naturally be developed. Applications to many areas of mathematical physics are presented. The book aims to be largely self-contained.

40|$|Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) aims at {{studying}} weakly scattering and absorbing biological specimens with subwavelength accuracy {{without any}} external staining mechanisms. Use of a reference beam {{at an angle}} {{is one of the}} necessary criteria for recording of high resolution holograms in most of the interferometric methods used for quantitative phase imaging. The spatial separation of the dc and twin images is decided by the reference beam angle and Fourier-filtered reconstructed image will have a very poor resolution if hologram is recorded below a <b>minimum</b> <b>reference</b> angle condition. However, it is always inconvenient to have a large reference beam angle while performing high resolution microscopy of live cells and biological specimens with nanometric features. In this paper, we treat reconstruction of digital holographic microscopy images as a constrained optimization problem with smoothness constraint in order to recover only complex object field in hologram plane even with overlapping dc and twin image terms. We solve this optimization problem by gradient descent approach iteratively and the smoothness constraint is implemented by spatial averaging with appropriate size. This approach will give excellent high resolution image recovery compared to Fourier filtering while keeping a very small reference angle. We demonstrate this approach on digital holographic microscopy of live cells by recovering the quantitative phase of live cells from a hologram recorded with nearly zero reference angle...|$|R
