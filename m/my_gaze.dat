2500|$|There {{was in the}} {{laboratory}} a large tank of good-sized turtles being used experimentally to test the claims of a commercially minded enthusiast who wanted to market a turtle vaccine to immunize humans against tuberculosis. [...] On rather a dull afternoon <b>my</b> <b>gaze</b> somehow wandered to this turtle cage and I thought what fun {{it would be to}} organize a turtle race, whip up some betting and try to make some money. [...] I sold the idea to other members of the class and soon we had chalk lanes mapped out on the floor, a turtle with a number on its back assigned to each member, and were down on our knees, snapping our fingers, and exhorting our respective turtles to hurry up and win the race.|$|E
2500|$|Utilisation: Any {{utilisation}} {{leads to}} increasing trance depth. All utilisation should proceed as {{a continuation of}} extension of the initial procedure. Much can be done nonverbally; for example, if any subjects are just looking blankly at me, I may slowly shift <b>my</b> <b>gaze</b> downward, causing them {{to look at their}} hand, which I touch and say [...] "look at this spot.". This intensifies the trance state. Then, whether the subjects are looking at you or at their hand or just staring blankly, you can use your left hand to touch their elevated right hand from above or the side - so long as you merely give the suggestion of downward movement. Occasionally a downward nudge or push is required. If a strong push or nudge is required, check for anaesthesia.|$|E

2500|$|Since Ganga had {{descended from}} heaven to earth, {{she is also}} the vehicle of ascent, from earth to heaven. As the Triloka-patha-gamini, (Skt. triloka= [...] "three worlds", patha = [...] "road", gamini = [...] "one who travels") of the Hindu tradition, she flows in heaven, earth, and the netherworld, and, consequently, is a [...] "tirtha," [...] or {{crossing}} point of all beings, the living {{as well as the}} dead. It {{is for this reason that}} the story of the avatarana is told at Shraddha ceremonies for the deceased in Hinduism, and Ganges water is used in Vedic rituals after death. Among all hymns devoted to the Ganges, there are none more popular than the ones expressing the worshipers wish to breathe his last surrounded by her waters. The Gangashtakam expresses this longing fervently: O Mother! ... Necklace adorning the worlds! [...] Banner rising to heaven! [...] I ask that I may leave of this body on your banks, Drinking your water, rolling in your waves, [...] Remembering your name, bestowing <b>my</b> <b>gaze</b> upon you.|$|E
6000|$|And never I {{turned my}} head, alack, [...] While these things met <b>my</b> <b>gaze</b> [...] Through the pane's drop-drenched glaze, To see the more {{behind my back}} [...] . O never I turned, but let, alack, [...] These less things hold <b>my</b> <b>gaze!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} the two men, and they {{returned}} <b>my</b> <b>gaze</b> with interest.|$|E
60|$|I {{assisted}} Mademoiselle to mount, and she passively suffered {{me to do}} {{her this}} office, having no word for me, and keeping her face averted from <b>my</b> earnest <b>gaze.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Batterbury was {{punctual}} to the moment. He gave a gasp {{of relief}} when he beheld me, full of life, with my palette on <b>my</b> thumb, <b>gazing</b> fondly on <b>my</b> new canvas.|$|R
60|$|I sat up even straighter than <b>my</b> companion, and <b>gazed</b> steadfastly at him.|$|R
60|$|I {{regarded}} Captain Kirby {{for a while}} without speaking, and {{he seemed}} more than ever troubled at <b>my</b> <b>gaze.</b>|$|E

6000|$|R.C. {{was not in}} sight. The steep curved neck of slope {{seemed all}} rocks, all trees, all brush. Then I heard a wild hoarse bawl and a loud {{crashing}} of brush. <b>My</b> <b>gaze</b> swerved to an open spot. A patch of manzanita seemed to blur round a big bear, standing up, fighting the branches, threshing and growling. But where was R.C.? Fearfully <b>my</b> <b>gaze</b> peered near and all around this wounded bear. [...] "Hey there!" [...] I yelled with all my might.|$|E
5000|$|LONG yearnings had <b>my</b> soul to <b>gaze</b> upon Fair Italy with {{atmosphere}} of fire; ...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} I said nothing, and then I exclaimed, in tones which made <b>my</b> {{companion}} <b>gaze</b> very earnestly at me: [...] "I must go to her immediately! I must take these papers! She must know everything!" ...|$|R
60|$|Miss West, {{swathed in}} a woollen dressing-gown, her eyes heavy still with sleep, her hair glorious {{and for the}} once ungroomed, {{clinging}} in the doorway that gave entrance on the main cabin, met <b>my</b> startled <b>gaze</b> with an equally startled gaze.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned to}} her. I set my hand lightly upon her arm; I let <b>my</b> <b>gaze</b> {{encounter}} the upward glance of her eyes--blue as forget-me-nots.|$|E
60|$|He looked wearily away. Nevertheless <b>my</b> <b>gaze</b> disquieted him. He turned uneasily; he rose, {{waved his}} wings {{as if for}} flight, poised, then settled defiantly down again.|$|E
60|$|I {{surveyed}} {{the walls of}} the Bay. Cliff on cliff, slide on slide, jumble, crag, and ruin, baffled <b>my</b> <b>gaze.</b> But I finally picked out a path.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{we shall}} be on our guard after this." [...] She {{corrected}} herself and said, [...] "I shall always be looking out for you now," [...] and she certainly showed herself conscious in the bridling glance that met <b>my</b> keen <b>gaze.</b>|$|R
60|$|How {{short a time}} still {{remained}} to us! I took out <b>my</b> watch and <b>gazed</b> at it hopelessly.|$|R

60|$|In {{the midst}} of <b>my</b> <b>gazing</b> there came a shock that knocked the tiller out of my hand. Euphemia sprang {{to her feet and}} screamed; there were screams and shouts {{on the other side of}} the sail, which seemed to be {{wrapping}} itself about some object I could not see. In an instant another mast beside our own appeared above the main-sail, and then a man with a red face jumped on the forward deck. With a quick, determined air, and without saying a word, or seeming to care for my permission, he proceeded to lower our sail; then he stepped up on top of the cabin, and looking down at me, inquired what in thunder I was trying to do.|$|R
60|$|I {{describe}} his entrance {{as it appeared}} at a glance, for I did not study it or absorb any of its details. <b>My</b> horrified <b>gaze</b> was held by a figure that rode on his right hand, a queenly woman with a beautiful pale countenance and a lazy, insolent smile.|$|R
6000|$|An angel {{stood and}} met <b>my</b> <b>gaze,</b> [...] Through the low doorway of my tent; [...] The tent is struck, the vision stays;-- [...] I only know she came and went.|$|E

6000|$|It was grey dawn, and I {{could see}} things pretty distinctly; {{but the only}} living object that met <b>my</b> <b>gaze</b> was Peterkin, who stood with my rifle in his hand {{laughing}} heartily! ...|$|E
60|$|For {{this reason}} I came {{quite close to}} the cause of the {{disturbance}} before the scene broke upon <b>my</b> horrified <b>gaze.</b> As I topped a great boulder I saw the herd of plant men surrounding a little group of perhaps five or six green men and women of Barsoom.|$|R
60|$|My head swam round. It was {{all like}} a dream to me. I held my {{forehead}} with <b>my</b> hands, and <b>gazed</b> blankly at the Inspector.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can see nothing,' I answered, shading <b>my</b> {{eyes and}} <b>gazing</b> down the tree-sprinkled valley which rose slowly in green uplands to the grassy Blackdown hills.|$|R
