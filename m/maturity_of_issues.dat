40|$|The author {{documents}} the precise costs of debt and equity issuance, both domestically and internationally, for firms in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. Costs include investment banking and legal fees, regulatory and exchange listing costs, rating agency fees, and expenditures for marketing and publishing. Her {{findings suggest that}} Brazilian firms face similar costs in issuing debt locally or abroad, whereas domestic equity issuance is nearly twice as expensive as debt. While the Chilean domestic corporate debt market is well developed by emerging market standards (size {{of the market and}} <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues),</b> Chilean firms can issue debt more cheaply internationally than at home. In addition, while equity financing is cheaper in Chile from a transaction cost perspective, over the past decade most firms have used bonds rather than shares to raise capital. This financing trend is true in all three countries. Finally, Mexican firms can issue debt at the lowest costs of the three, but face the highest equity issuing costs. In addition to documenting these features, the author sheds light on how the investor base in these countries plays a strong role in influencing the ability of firms to access domestic capital markets.

40|$|This article {{examines}} empirically the effect firm reputation {{has on the}} determinants <b>of</b> debt <b>maturity.</b> Utilizing data from European primary bond market between 1999 and 2005, I find that reputation is a determinant <b>of</b> the <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> newly <b>issued</b> debt, where firms of high or low reputation issue short-term debt and firms <b>of</b> mediocre reputation <b>issue</b> long-term debt.

40|$|We {{argue that}} time {{variation}} in the <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> corporate debt arises because firms behave as macro liquidity providers, absorbing the supply shocks associated with changes in the <b>maturity</b> structure <b>of</b> government debt. We document that when the government funds itself with more short-term debt, firms fill the resulting gap by issuing more long-term debt, and vice versa. This type of liquidity provision is undertaken more aggressively: (1) when the ratio of government debt to total debt is higher and (2) by firms with stronger balance sheets. Our theory sheds new light on market timing phenomena in corporate finance more generally. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL year-to-year {{variation in the}} average <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> corporate debt <b>issues.</b> For example, using Flow of Funds data from the Federal Reserve, which cover all forms of borrowing, including both public and private, we estimate that in 1999, 24. 7 % of nonfinancial corporate debt issues were “long term”—defined as having a <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> 1 year or more.

This research examines differences in value across nontimers and timers, where timers are defined as firms that follow either a naive strategy of choosing long-term debt when the term premium is low or a strategy from Baker et al.

It also documents that the timing strategies do not increase firm value and do not affect announcement effects of long-term debt offerings. The results suggest that corporate debt markets are efficient and well integrated with equity markets. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} optimal government debt maturity {{in which the government}} cannot issue state-contingent bonds and the government cannot commit to fiscal policy. In contrast to an environment with full commitment, there is a tradeoff between the cost of funding and the benefit of hedging. Borrowing long term provides the government with a hedging benefit since the value of outstanding government liabilities declines when shortterm interest rates rise. However, borrowing long term lowers fiscal discipline for future governments unable to commit to policy, which leads to higher future short-term interest rates. Therefore, lack of commitment ex post increases the government’s cost of borrowing long term ex ante. A consequence of this tradeoff is that the slope of the yield curve is increasing in the <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> newly <b>issued</b> debt. Our main theoretical result is that, {{as in the case of}} full commitment, the optimal <b>maturity</b> structure <b>of</b> government debt is tilted to the long end, but it is more flat than in case of full commitment. Our quantitative analysis shows that, in contrast to debt positions under full commitment—which involve a short-term asset position and a long-term debt position, both extremely large relative to GDP—debt positions under lack of commitment are positive at all maturities, much smaller relative to GDP, and have a nearly flat maturity...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the interest rate and the <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> newly <b>issued</b> bonds provides information on the debt dynamics of an economy {{as well as on}} the sustainability of its debt. Such information is crucial especially for countries that have debt-rollover concerns due to financial stress and/or macroeconomic instability. This study investigates the {{relationship between}} treasury auction maturity, which also dictates the debt maturity, and auction interest rates. When the Turkish treasury auction data from 1988 to 2004 are analysed, a reciprocal linkage between auction interest rates and maturities can be observed, especially for the 1995 – 2000 period, when there were chronic high inflation, high political uncertainty, high public deficits and unsuccessful attempts at stabilisation. This suggests that under an adverse shock, the Treasury decreases the auction maturity in order not to increase interest rates too much. A change in this reciprocal relationship is also reported for the post- 2001 era, which is characterised by decreasing inflation, higher political stability, lower public deficits and successful stabilisation attempts. *All the views expressed in this paper belong to the authors and do not represent those of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey or its staff.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays that study the relationship between distress and credit and the role this relationship has in determining corporate investment and economic activity. The first essay studies the supply of credit during the recent financial crisis. It shows that distress in the banking sector led to bank credit rationing, which a portion of nonfinancial borrowers palliated by migrating to the public market for credit. The overall reduction in credit, however, {{was followed by a}} severe drop in corporate investment, which in time led to a fall in the levels of aggregate production. The second essay examines how distress in the banking sector affects credit supply in two separate events: the credit crunch of early 1990 s and the financial crisis of late 2000 s. While the former is broadly thought of as a relatively mild crisis when compared with the latter, the fall in bank credit that they carried is comparable by certain measures. Government intervention, the paper argues, accounts for the comparatively short duration of and fast recovery from the second crisis. The third essay investigates the role of aggregate economic distress on the <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> debt, which ultimately affects investment in long-term assets. The paper predicts and shows that increases in the aggregate distress lead lenders to prefer shorter maturities. This effect can be empirically observed in changes in <b>maturity</b> <b>of</b> new debt <b>issues.</b> Moreover, it is strong enough to modify the temporary financial structure of nonfinancial corporations...|$|R

Finally, we find evidence that the security level (our proxy for the recovery rate) is inversely related to the at issue time to maturity.

Maturity models identify organizational strengths and weaknesses in addition to providing benchmarking information. Project management maturity models are important assessment tools for the profession. Companies assess their organizational performance and identify their weaknesses and strengths in terms of their needs and objectives and also characteristics of the models. The important issue here is that construction companies can assess their organizational performance by a comprehensive and useful model. This can help them compare their situation with other companies by using the same model. There are many maturity models like OPM 3, P-CMM, CMMI, OPMMM, TMM, P 3 M 3, SPICE, BPMM, FAAiCMM, (PM) 2, Kerzner’s Project Management Maturity Model, Ibbs and Kwak Maturity Model, RMMM, TMM, etc. The aim {{of this study is to}} find out the best maturity model for using in construction companies.

Ultimately, all such measures need to be nested within a larger, more preventative policy context.
