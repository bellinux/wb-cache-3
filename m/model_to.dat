50|$|Scientific {{modelling}} is {{a scientific}} activity, {{the aim of}} which is to make a particular part or feature of the world easier to understand, define, quantify, visualize, or simulate by referencing it to existing and usually commonly accepted knowledge. It requires selecting and identifying relevant aspects of a situation in the real world and then using different types of models for different aims, such as conceptual <b>models</b> <b>to</b> better understand, operational <b>models</b> <b>to</b> operationalize, mathematical <b>models</b> <b>to</b> quantify, and graphical <b>models</b> <b>to</b> visualize the subject. Modelling is an essential and inseparable part of many scientific disciplines, each of which have their own ideas about specific types of modelling.|$|R
