Helicopter net-gunning was used to capture all bighorns, which were processed, marked, and translocated following state agency (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife [Foster 2005], Wyoming Game and Fish Department [WGFD] Chapter 10 – 1535 and Chapter 33 – 750 permits) approved protocols, and complied with guidelines published by the American Society of Mammalogists (ASM; Sikes and Gannon 2011).

40|$|Type I interferons (IFNs) are potent {{inducers}} of the first-line {{defense against}} pathogens. Their activity {{leads to the}} up- and downregulation {{of a large number}} of genes with various effects on the immune system, including direct effects on the pathogens. Due to the strong response evoked by IFN signaling, the IFN pathway is tightly regulated by IFN stimulated genes to avoid detrimental effects of long-term exposure. If the IFN signaling pathway is not regulated properly, or for other reasons constantly activated, it can lead to interferonopathies and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). Indeed, many therapeutics targeting the IFN pathway are currently in clinical trials. In contrast, type I IFNs are used to treat certain types of cancer, virus infections and multiple sclerosis. The complex role of type I IFN signaling in disease is not well understood and need further characterization for better therapeutic inventions. The aim of this thesis was to identify genes that are regulated by type I IFNs and investigate their role in the immune system. To do this, we quantified the expression of interferon-regulated genes in sorted immune cells from patients with primary SS, and from individuals treated with IFN b. Using global gene expression analysis on PBMCs as well as qPCR on sorted cells, we could identify several genes that were differentially regulated by type I IFNs in different immune cell populations. Among them were TRIM 21 that was upregulated in T cells and B cells, BAFF that was upregulated in T cells, monocytes and neutrophils and miR- 150 - 5 p that was selectively downregulated in monocytes. The downregulated expression of miR- 150 - 5 p consequently led to an increased expression of its target c-Myb. In addition, monocytes from patients with SLE displayed an increase in c-Myb target genes. When investigating the regulation of BAFF and TRIM 21, we found that both were regulated by members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. Specifically, both were upregulated by IRF 1 and IRF 2, and downregulated by IRF 4 and IRF 8. To further investigate the role of TRIM 21 in the immune system, we generated Trim 21 -/- mice. These mice were prone to granulocyte infiltrations and developed symptoms of autoimmune disease after being triggered by <b>metal</b> <b>ear</b> <b>tags.</b> We found that TRIM 21 negatively regulates the immune response by ubiquitinating IRFs, and that naïve Trim 21 -/- mice control the development of eosinophils in the bone marrow...|$|R

Four identification methods (treatments) were compared: T 1 : <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> in one <b>ear</b> and ear button in the other ear (eabu); T 2 : <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> and iron brand on the right leg (eaib); T 3 : <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> in one <b>ear</b> and tattoo on the other ear (eata); and T 4 : <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> in one <b>ear</b> and electronic <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> (eael) on the other. Each treatment was applied to 60 Nelore animals, totaling 240 animals, divided equally into three life stages (calves, young cattle, adult cattle). The study had two phases: implementation (phase 1) and reading and transfer of identification numbers to an electronic database (phase 2).

In consultation with representatives of pig farmers, breeding institutions, traders, slaughterhouses and governments a list of requirements for the combined <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> has been set up. After initial interest for prototyping nine manufacturers have been visited and the requirements were discussed. Ultimately, six of the manufacturers produced a total of 13 prototypes for testing. Prototypes were subjected to a visual test and a test in two different slaughterhouses. Only four of the 13 prototypes met the established slaughterhouse criteria (loss rate < 5 %). These four were then tested on three pig farms. The infections, irritations and inflammation depend on husbandry conditions and the type of <b>ear</b> <b>tag.</b> The on farm loss rate of <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> prototypes was less than 2 %. The readability of the combined <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> on the farms is not problematic. Retagging after loss was possible for one person using the existing hole but resulted in slight discomfort for the animal. During transport of the animals there were no losses. In the following slaughterhouse test no physical losses occurred. However, the functional loss rate in the slaughterhouse was above 5 %. Practical implementation of the combined <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> was studied by interviews with several stakeholders. Focus in the interviews was on the regulations, the attachment of the combined <b>ear</b> <b>tags,</b> the process of transporting pigs to the slaughterhouse, including transport, assembly and export, the need to renumber pigs, the service of the slaughterhouses for blood sampling, and the I&R in relation to the needed documentation and forms during transport. From the interviews it becomes clear that implementation in practice needs numerous reattachments and renumbering of <b>ear</b> <b>tags.</b> This leads to slight discomfort to the animals and increased labour for the farmers. This retagging has negative influence on the reliability of the data and on the guarantees of food safety.

Besides the low-frequency radio-frequency identification, an ultra-high-frequency <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> is a possibility for electronic animal identification.

40|$|AbstractElectronic animal {{identification}} {{is an important}} technology in modern animal husbandry providing great benefits. Low-frequency applications are state-of-the-art within the radio frequency identification of animals. Quasi-simultaneous detection of several animals and reading of the transponders over longer distances is impossible with low-frequency systems. Ultra-high-frequency (UHF) applications are suitable for this purpose. However, UHF systems have disadvantages through their susceptibility to metallic surfaces and liquids. Thus, the reflection and absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the animals' environment is often problematic. Consequently, an adjustment of the transponder <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> regarding mechanical stability and functionality close to water (ear tissue) is necessary. In this project, targeted adjustments and a further development of UHF transponder <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> concerning the resonance frequency were made. Three trials with cattle and two trials with pigs were performed in this study. Cattle were driven through a reader gate for ten rounds and six different types of transponder <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> designed in-house were tested. The influence of the environment (indoor vs. outdoor), reader orientation at the gate (sideways vs. above) and output power of the readers (1. 0 vs. 0. 5 W) were tested in two experiments. The average number of readings per round and the reading rates of the transponder <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> types were taken as target variables. In the trials with pigs, three transponder <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> types were compared. The animals were driven through the gate for five rounds per repetition, but neither the reader output power nor the reader orientation were varied. The pig experiments were performed indoors. The results of the cattle experiments showed that {{the average number of}} readings per round and the reading rates were significantly higher indoors compared to outdoors. The reader output power of 1. 0 W achieved significantly better results compared to 0. 5 W. The same applied to the reader orientation ‘above’ compared to ‘sideways’. It could also be shown that an improvement of the transponder and, thus, an adjustment to the animal's ear could be achieved during transponder <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> type development. A maximum reading rate of 100 % was reached with the cattle transponder types finally developed (B 3 - 4, B 4 - 4 and B 5). In addition, an average reading rate of 100 % was achieved for one pig transponder <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> type (C 2).
