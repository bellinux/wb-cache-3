5|$|In February 2002, Curtis {{introduced}} TotalFark as {{a subscription}} service, charging $5 per month. By May 2007 {{there were an}} estimated 2,000 subscribers, generating $120,000 per year. Subscribers, known collectively as TotalFarkers or TFers, at one time {{had the privilege of}} seeing and commenting on all links submitted to the site, as opposed to only those approved for inclusion on the <b>main</b> <b>page.</b> However, as of 2010 an estimated 40% of links submitted to TotalFark are deleted within one minute of being submitted. In a typical 24-hour period, TotalFark's <b>main</b> <b>page</b> includes 1,200 to 1,800 links with associated comment threads, whereas Fark's <b>main</b> <b>page</b> includes only 60 to 80 links from that total.|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the story}} links on the <b>main</b> <b>page</b> are {{submitted}} by users and selected for placement based on merit, there was an incident in August 2004 in which Fark was accused of selling preferential placement of story links on the <b>main</b> <b>page.</b> The accusation stemmed from an exchange between Mahalo.com CEO Jason Calacanis and third party sales employee Gogi Gupta, where Gupta claimed Calacanis could buy an editorial on Fark for $300 to $400. Curtis dismissed the incident {{as the result of}} an overenthusiastic salesperson, and subsequently fired Gupta. Gupta worked for a company called Gupta Media and did not have the authority to speak for Fark, according to Curtis.|$|E
