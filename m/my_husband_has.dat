When asked what motivates his philanthropic work, <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> responded with a very powerful statement: 'I regard my philanthropic work as an investment in the future of America. It is the most effective way I can serve my country and help to ensure its benefits for the next generation.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Judge Williams defended her {{approach}} explaining, [...] "there's some addiction in my family. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> been in recovery for over 15 years. And {{about the time}} I started looking to start a drug court about 1996, he had gotten into recovery. So weâ€™ve lived it as a family. Because all the family members are touched by it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Raja Petra {{was held}} without trial under the ISA at the Kamunting Detention Centre in {{northern}} Perak state, which had 60 ISA detainees, mostly suspected Islamic extremists. The ISA permits an initial detention of two months for investigation, {{followed by a}} two-year jail sentence which can be renewed indefinitely. The 1948 ISA is a holdover from British colonial rule, intended for use against communist insurgents. Raja Petra's wife Marina Lee Abdullah said: [...] "(Police) said <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> been sent to Kamunting this morning {{and that he will}} remain there for two years with no trial. This is the worst news I can receive but we will keep fighting for his release. This is dirty foul play by the government as they know {{that we are in the}} process of fighting for his release in the court but I was expecting this. Raja Petra was detained for allegedly 'insulting Islam' and publishing articles on his website which has tarnished the country's leadership to the point of causing confusion among the people." [...] Raja Petra's lawyer sought his release in a court hearing but this was dismissed. Raja Petra's detention caused widespread protests by civil society groups, lawyers and other online commentators.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} I {{do not know}} that?" [...] said Cecil. [...] "Do you think <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> could <b>have</b> been <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> if he <b>had</b> not felt that?" ...|$|R
60|$|I ran back, {{before the}} Major could stop me, {{to the room}} in which I had seen Eustace. It was empty. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> left the house.|$|R
60|$|Jul. Pray {{let this}} go no further; <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> invited both to supper.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to know}} exactly," [...] she said, [...] "what {{you think}} of it all. I know <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> been making fun of it. He does not understand. He never will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{she said}} scornfully, [...] "that <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> been cruelly imposed upon--imposed upon by some wretched woman, {{who has made}} him {{sacrifice}} his property, his friends, his honor--everything but me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! great doctor," [...] she said, [...] "why {{do you ask}} me of <b>my</b> <b>husband?</b> <b>Have</b> you {{not heard}} that he has driven me away and that another takes my place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I really couldn't put off being married, could I," [...] Anna protested, [...] "especially when <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> {{just got}} the special license. Besides, I {{do not wish to}} return to Vienna just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{she said}} after a little pause, [...] "during {{that time it was}} {{possible}} to come to understandings. Neither I nor <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> understood the other. In that interval it was possible--to explain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then if <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> left me all he could--this property," [...] {{she went}} on rapidly, {{twisting}} her handkerchief between her fingers, [...] "I can do with it what I like, can't I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{thought it}} was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me {{introduce}} myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> got seventeen of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{could earn}} that little sum of money," [...] she {{declared}} gaily, [...] "for <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> {{just made me}} cancel a dinner-party for next Thursday because {{he has to go}} up to the stupid place." ...|$|E
60|$|My jealousy of Mrs. Beauly, {{smoldering}} in me {{all through}} the interview, burst into flames at those words. I could resist it no longer--I was obliged to ask him if <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> ever loved her.|$|R
6000|$|... "That I {{can tell}} you at once," [...] the landlady said, entering. [...] "Your {{daughter}} has recovered, sir, and would come to you, but I begged her to wait until <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> done dressing your wound." ...|$|R
6000|$|I added immeasurably {{to my old}} friend's {{surprise}} by {{not even}} employing the post-office. I wished to see the [...] "instructions" [...] which <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> left behind him. So I took the letter to his lawyers myself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You shall hear directly, Mr. Westwick. Let {{me first}} {{tell you what}} my {{position}} is. I am alone in the world. To the loss of <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> now been added another bereavement, {{the loss of my}} companion in America, my brother--Baron Rivar.' ...|$|E
6000|$|JUDITH. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> {{been very}} good to you. He has forgiven you for {{insulting}} him, {{and is trying to}} save you. Can you not forgive him for being so much better than you are? How dare you belittle him by putting yourself in his place? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. March, with a {{promptness}} {{surprising to}} her husband, who {{could think of}} nothing; [...] "tell us where Heinrich Heine lived {{when he was in}} Hamburg. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> always had a great passion for him and wants to look him up everywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Macallan behaved admirably. He {{was still}} helpless. But {{he made an}} excuse for leaving us which it was {{impossible}} to dispute. In two days after <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> spoken to him he was removed from the house.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We go {{back this}} evening. We slept at the Crewes' last night. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> {{business}} there; {{and when they}} asked us to this picnic, {{it was a good}} opportunity for Gertrude to learn the beauties of her county.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} you both," [...] I said. [...] "You need have no fear, Mr. Dexter, of {{speaking}} before me. I know that <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> a first wife, and I know how miserably she died. I {{have read the}} Trial." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Dean laughed. 'It is {{next door}} to blasphemy to speak in society of a peer as a cad, Captain Hampton; still, I am {{not at all sure}} that you are wrong. But I must be going; <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> been making signs to me for the last ten minutes.' ...|$|E
60|$|All sounded {{simple and}} easy, and Margaret repeated, 'It {{will be a}} troop quite large enough to defend you from all ecorcheurs; indeed, they dare not come near our Scottish archers, whom Messire, <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>has</b> told off for your escort. And you will have your own squire,' she added, looking at Jean.|$|E
6000|$|SHE [softening {{and putting}} her hand caressingly on his shoulder] Listen to me, dear. It's very {{nice of you}} to live with me in a dream, and to love me, and so on; but I can't help <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>having</b> disagreeable relatives, can I? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah,' she replied, 'if only <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> sworn by that oath, I {{could have}} spoken {{to him from the}} beginning, and he need never have taken another wife. But now he will never say it, and he will have to go on marrying fresh ones.' ...|$|R
50|$|He and I {{had loved}} {{together}} two years, an <b>my</b> lord <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> not sent immediately word after my lady and my lord's first wife was dead, he made suit to my lord my father, or else I {{had been married}} before Christmas to my Lord of Westmorland'.|$|R
6000|$|... "We have {{something}} to show you besides; we have a breed of swans on the lake, peculiar to the place. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> gone on {{with some of our}} friends; and I believe we are expected to follow, as soon {{as the rest of the}} party--in charge of my sister--have seen the house." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Marian, dear Marian, {{will you}} do me a good turn without asking questions? <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> gone abroad, and somehow I have overrun my allowance, so that I have to fall back upon my old work for a time.

5000|$|In a 1975 profile, she {{described}} {{how she had}} [...] "never been one who pushed ahead and scratched the walls trying to climb my way up".

6000|$|... "Mercy me! You don't say so! Well, <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to}} do with it, you may be sure. He went to London first and then to Paris, and {{in a day or two}} he is to start for Switzerland. His health is very poor and the doctor said he needed the trip." ...|$|R
