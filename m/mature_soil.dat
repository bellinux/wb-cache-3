It follows that this can only happen {{when there is an}} area of {{reasonably}} flat land inland from the beach. In time, this rather inhospitable surface will be colonised by pioneer species. These species (e.g. marram grass) will stabilise the dunes and prevent them moving any more.

50|$|Given {{sufficient}} time, an undifferentiated soil {{will evolve}} a soil profile {{which consists of}} two or more layers, referred to as soil horizons, that differ in one or more properties such as in their texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, color, and reactivity. The horizons differ greatly in thickness and generally lack sharp boundaries; their development is dependent on the type of parent material, the processes that modify those parent materials, and the soil-forming factors that influence those processes. The biological influences on soil properties are strongest near the surface, while the geochemical influences on soil properties increase with depth. <b>Mature</b> <b>soil</b> profiles typically include three basic master horizons: A, B and C. The solum normally includes the A and B horizons. The living component of the soil is largely confined to the solum, and is generally more prominent in the A horizon.|$|E

These preliminary simulation experiments were undertaken to determine whether the ion probe can be used to measure solar-wind-implanted elements on the surface of lunar rock crystals and soil grains and to study mechanisms for the redistribution.

Here we show that soil samples from high–altitude cold deserts in the western Himalayas (Ladakh, India) produce CH 4 after incubation as slurry under anoxic conditions at rates comparable to those of hot desert <b>soils.</b> Samples of <b>matured</b> <b>soil</b> from three different vegetation belts (arid, steppe, and subnival) were compared with younger soils originating from frontal and lateral moraines of receding glaciers. While methanogenic rates were higher in the samples from <b>matured</b> <b>soils,</b> CH 4 was also produced in the samples from the recently deglaciated moraines. In both young and <b>matured</b> <b>soils,</b> those covered by a biological soil crust (biocrust) were more active than their bare counterparts. Isotopic analysis showed that in both cases CH 4 was initially produced from H 2 /CO 2 but later mostly from acetate. Analysis of the archaeal community in the in situ soil samples revealed a clear dominance of sequences related to Thaumarchaeota, while the methanogenic community comprised only a minor fraction of the archaeal community. Similar to other aerated soils, the methanogenic community was comprised almost solely of the genera Methanosarcina and Methanocella, and possibly also Methanobacterium in some cases. Nevertheless, approximately 103 gdw- 1 soil methanogens were already present in the young moraine soil together with cyanobacteria. Our results demonstrate that Methanosarcina and Methanocella not only tolerate atmospheric oxygen but are also able to survive in these harsh cold environments. Their occurrence in newly deglaciated soils shows that they are early colonisers of desert soils, similar to cyanobacteria, and may play a role in the development of desert biocrusts...|$|R

It has been suggested by various international forums and organizations {{that in order to}} adequately establish methods to combat land degradation, it is necessary to evaluate this degradation locally and at a detailed scale. The evaluation of soil degradation of natural ecosystems at a detailed scale requires the definition of standards to which to compare this degradation. To define these standards and properly handle the processes that give rise to variations in soil quality and degradation, it is necessary to establish in some detail the pedogenic processes that have or have not taken place in a particular area and which lead to the formation of a <b>mature</b> <b>soil.</b> A <b>mature</b> <b>soil</b> should be considered as standard in these situations and, therefore, a non-degraded soil. This paper presents the possible evolutive and regressive sequences of soil, and provides some examples of using this methodology to evaluate the degradation of the same in the Monteverde of the island of Tenerife. It also presents some physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of climacic mature soils, degraded soils and low quality soils, and examines their similarities and differences in this bioclimatic environment and on different parent materials. Thus it is observed that the main processes of degradation in these areas are related to plant cover modifications that lead to the decreasing protection of the soil surface, which results in the long term, in the onset of degradation processes such as water erosion, biological degradation, loss of andic properties, compaction and sealing and crusting surface, loss of water retention capacity, illuviation, etc. Climacic soils that can be found in areas of steep lava flows are Leptosols, while gently sloping areas are Cambisols and Andosols. On pyroclastic materials there are vitric Andosols and andic Andosols according to their degree of evolution. The most characteristic regressive processes are illuviation/leaching, resulting in Luvisols, Lixisols and Alisols; and water erosion, causing the presence of secondary Leptosols...|$|E

40|$|Discussion of {{the dynamic}} {{processes}} involved {{in the evolution of}} the lunar soil. Size, shape, and modal analyses of soil returned by Apollo 11, 12, 14, and 15, and Luna 16 indicate that the two most important dynamic processes resulting from meteorite impact are vitrification and comminution of the detrital material. The effects of the two processes are mutually opposed. As the glass content of the soil increases over an extended period of time, the statistical parameters of the <b>mature</b> <b>soil</b> tend to stabilize. Comminution probably plays a dominant role early in the development of the soil by reducing the median grain size and producing a logarithmic-normal grain-size distribution. The evolution of the soil does not necessarily progress in a regular manner.

40|$|Siderophilic element/Ir ratios {{are higher}} in mature lunar soils from {{highlands}} sites {{than in those}} from mare sites.

Arguments are summarized against the viewpoint that the siderophiles in most highlands breccias originated in basin-forming projectiles. Differences in <b>mature</b> <b>soil</b> siderophile concentrations at the Apollo 14 and 16 sites indicate a substantially greater concentration at the latter site immediately following the Imbrium event. Siderophile concentrations are used to estimate mean regolith depths at the landing sites. The long-lived flux is calculated to be 2. 9 g per cm per aeon averaged over the past 3. 7 aeons.

30|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to assess if {{different}} plant species were able to select specific rhizobacterial communities in such a high mountain ecosystem. Consequently, we designed the experimental sampling plan to minimize, {{as much as we}} could, all the environmental variables (i.e. rainfall, moisture, sampling season) within a size-limited area characterized by same soil and ecological parameters (i.e. soil age, floristic successional stage, pH, moisture, mineral composition). We chose plants growing on 160  year old soil due to the quick glacier melting in the last 80  years, as it represents the only transitional step of our glacier moraine between earliest stages (< 10  years) and <b>mature</b> <b>soil</b> (> 500  years). As shown by aerial photos, ortophotos, and a topographic survey, the Matsch Glacier, one of the glacier tongues of the Weisskugel Glacier, has been retreating due to discontinuous movement. Therefore, we did not have a constant gradient of soil age, but rather distinct block stages in which soil age is invariable. Moreover, the 160  year old stage is characterized by harsh environmental niches with poor mineral skeleton, low total carbon, low nitrogen content, and severe climatic regimes. In this environment, more stable than earlier successional soil, it was possible to find a larger number of plant species individuals not interrelated in proto-floristic complex communities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Remote sensing {{technology}} {{has a huge}} potential for improving hydrologic prediction through soil moisture measurement. This is particularly so given that the first dedicated soil moisture satellite is to be launched in 2007; the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. However, targeted field experiments must be undertaken now so that immediate use can be made of this data when it becomes available. Therefore a series of National Airborne Field Experiments (NAFE) are being planned and conducted throughout south-eastern Australia. The first of these experiments was undertaken in the Goulburn Catchment of the Upper Hunter during November 2005, and the second experiment will be undertaken in the Murrumbidgee Catchment during November 2006. The ultimate objective of these campaigns is to <b>mature</b> <b>soil</b> moisture retrieval algorithms, downscaling and data assimilation, such that 1 km near-surface and root-zone soil moisture mapping can become an operational product from SMOS.

To reduce the dependence on JSC equipment, we {{proposed to}} transfer the SEM images to UHCL for analysis. Last summer we developed techniques to use digitized scanning electron micrographs and computer image analysis programs to measure track densities in lunar soil grains. Tracks were formed by highly ionizing solar energetic particles and cosmic rays during near surface exposure on the Moon. The track densities {{are related to the}} exposure conditions (depth and time). Distributions of the number of grains as a function of their track densities can reveal the modality of soil maturation. As part of a consortium effort to better understand the maturation of lunar soil and its relation to its infrared reflectance properties, we worked on lunar samples 67701, 205 and 61221, 134. These samples were etched for a shorter time (6 hours) than last summer's sample and this difference has presented problems for establishing the correct analysis conditions. We used computer counting and measurement of area to obtain preliminary track densities and a track density distribution that we could interpret for sample 67701, 205.

This trio, which includes double drive tube 60009 / 10 (59 cm deep) and deep drill core 60001 - 7 (220 cm), is the only such array of cores returned from the Moon. The top 45 cm of 60013 / 14 is mature, as is surface reference soil 60601 taken nearby. Maturity generally decreases with depth, with soil below 45 cm being submature. The zone of lowest maturity (34 is {{less than or equal to}} I(sub s) /FeO is less than 50) extends from 46 to 58 cm depth, and corresponds to the distinct region of light-colored soil observed during core processing. In the other two cores, most of the compositional variation results from mixing between fine-grained, <b>mature</b> <b>soil</b> with 10 - 11 micro-g/g Sc and coarse-grained ferroan anorthosite consisting of greater than 99 % plagioclase with less than 0. 5 micro-g/g Sc. This is most evident in 60009 / 10 which contains a high abundance of plagioclase at about 54 cm depth (minimum Sc: 3 - 4 micro-g/g); a similar zone occurs in 60001 - 7 at 17 - 22 cm (MPU-C), although it is not as rich in plagioclase (minimum Sc: 6 - 7 micro-g/g). Compositional variations are less in 60013 / 14 than in the other two cores (range: 7. 9 - 10. 0 micro-g/g Sc), but are generally consistent with the 'plagioclase dilution' effect seen in 60009 / 10, i. e., most 60013 / 14 samples plot along the mixing line of 60009 / 10. However, a plagioclase component is not the cause of the lower maturity and lighter color of the unit at 46 - 58 cm depth in 60013 / 14. Many of the samples in this zone have distinctly lower Sm/Sc ratios than typical LM-area soils and plot off the mixing trend defined by 60009 / 10. This requires a component with moderately high Sc, but low-Sm/Sc, such as feldspathic fragmental breccia (FFB) or granulitic breccia. A component of Descartes regolith, such as occurs at North Ray Crater (NRC) and which is rich in FFB, could account for the composition of these soils (i. e., a 3 : 1 mixture of 60601 and NRC soil). It seems unlikely that NRC ejecta would occur half a meter deep at the LM station, thus this low-Sm/Sc component may result from an older, local crater that penetrated the Cayley surface layer and excavated underlying Descartes material, as did North Ray Crater. There is no evidence for such a unit or component in the other two cores. Soil below the light-colored unit (58 - 62) cm has 'typical' Sm/Sc ratios, but the lowest absolute Sc concentrations, i. e., it is compositionally equivalent to a mixture of surface soil and plagioclase such as that in ferroan anorthosite. This is the only soil that might be related to the plagioclase-rich units in the other two cores. Except for the <b>mature</b> <b>soil</b> at the top of each core and, perhaps, the plagioclase-rich layers, there is little compositional evidence for any common unit among the three cores.

However, these data are largely lacking. Particle-counting information for lunar soils, originally obtained to study formational processes, does not provide these necessary data, including the percentages of minerals locked in multi-phase lithic fragments and fused-soil particles, such as agglutinates. We have developed a technique for modal analyses, sensu stricto, of lunar soils, using digital imaging of X-ray maps obtained with an energy-dispersive spectrometer mounted on an electron microprobe. A suite of nine soils (90 to 150 micrometers size fraction) from the Apollo 11, 12, 15, and 17 mare sites was used for this study. This is the first collection of such modal data on soils from all Apollo mare sites. The abundances of free-mineral fragments in the mare soils are greater for immature and submature <b>soils</b> than for <b>mature</b> <b>soils,</b> largely because of the formation of agglutinitic glass as maturity progresses.

A gradual accumulation of the Apollo 15 core is favored, and the Apollo 17 core is found to be heavily irradiated. With the exception of a sample taken at 27 cm depth, and in contrast with the other sections studied, the whole core 76001 consists of material in which the quartile track density is in excess of 10 to the 8 th per sq cm...|$|R
