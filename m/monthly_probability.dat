40|$|Abstract Background Male gonadal {{exposure}} to ionizing radiation may disrupt spermatogenesis, but {{its influence on}} the fecundity of couples has been rarely studied. We aimed to characterize the influence of male gonadal dose of ionizing radiation delivered during radiodiagnostic on the <b>monthly</b> <b>probability</b> of pregnancy. Methods We recruited {{a random sample of}} women who retrospectively described 1110 periods of unprotected intercourse beginning between 1985 and 1999 and leading either to a live birth or to no pregnancy; their duration was censored after 13 months. The male partner answered a telephone questionnaire on radiodiagnostic examinations. We assigned a mean gonadal dose to each type of radiodiagnostic examination. We defined male dose for each period of unprotected intercourse as the sum of the gonadal doses of the X-ray examinations experienced between 18 years of age and the date of discontinuation of contraception. Time to pregnancy was analysed using a discrete Cox model with random effect allowing to estimate hazard ratios of pregnancy. Results After adjustment for female factors likely to influence fecundity, {{there was no evidence of}} an association between male dose and the probability of pregnancy (test of homogeneity, p = 0. 55). When compared to couples with a male gonadal dose between 0. 01 and 0. 20 milligrays (n = 321 periods of unprotected intercourse), couples with a gonadal dose above 10 milligrays had a hazard ratio of pregnancy of 1. 44 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 73 – 2. 86, n = 31). Conclusion Our study provides no evidence of a long-term detrimental effect of male gonadal dose of ionizing radiation delivered during radiodiagnostic on the <b>monthly</b> <b>probability</b> of pregnancy during the year following discontinuation of contraceptive use. Classification errors due to the retrospective assessment of male gonadal exposure may have limited the statistical power of our study. </p...|$|E

The ensemble mean monthly rainfall over land region of India from CFS with one month lead forecast is underestimated during June to September. With respect to the inter-annual variability of monthly rainfall it is seen that the only significant correlation coefficients (CCs) {{are found to be}} for June forecast with May initial condition and September rainfall with August initial conditions. The CFS has got lowest skill for the month of August followed by that of July. Considering the lower skill of monthly forecast based on the ensemble mean, all 15 ensemble members are used separately for the preparation of probability forecast and different probability scores like Brier Score (BS), Brier Skill Score (BSS), Accuracy, Probability of Detection (POD), False Alarm Ratio (FAR), Threat Score (TS) and Heidke Skill Score (HSS) for all the three categories of forecasts (above normal, below normal and normal) have been calculated. In terms of the BS and BSS the skill of the <b>monthly</b> <b>probability</b> forecast in all the three categories are better than the climatology forecasts with positive BSS values except in case of normal {{forecast of}} June and July.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Maternal age is an {{important}} factor in reproduction. Can assisted reproduction technologies (ART) fully compensate for the decline in fertility with age? METHODS: We used a computer simulation (Monte Carlo) model of reproduction, combining the <b>monthly</b> <b>probabilities</b> of conceiving, the risk of miscarriage and the probability of becoming age-dependently permanently sterile. RESULTS: Under natural conditions, 75 % of women starting to try to conceive at age 30 years will have a conception ending in a live birth within 1 year, 66 % at age 35 years and 44 % at age 40 years. Within 4 years the success rates will be respectively 91, 84 and 64 %. If women turn to ART after 4, 3 or 2 years respectively without conception, and if the rate of success is as observed after two cycles of insemination in IVF, ART makes up for only half of the births lost by postponing a ®rst attempt of preg-nancy from age 30 to 35 years, and < 30 % after postponing from 35 to 40 years. CONCLUSIONS: Even if we relax some of the assumptions, ART in its present form cannot make up for all births lost by the natural decline of fertility after age 35 years.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{estimate}} <b>monthly</b> <b>probability</b> that the Czech economy is in a recession. For this purpose, I construct indexes of coincident and leading variables from multiple time series by Maximum Likelihood. Changes in coincident index are preceded by changes in the leading index by almost one year for peaks and about one month for troughs on average. To assess the probability of recession, I estimate multiple mixture models for growth rates of coincident index focusing on Markov-Switching specification for the latent business cycle process. I found that the two-state Markov-Switching AR (1) is superior to other models based on information criteria. Lagged values of leading index further improve the model fit but the model provides less clear signals of recessions compared to models based solely on coincident index...|$|E

METHODS: The <b>monthly</b> <b>probability</b> of conception for douchers and nondouchers was compared {{in a sample}} of 840 married, parous women in King County, Washington. Data on the number of months required to conceive were analyzed. RESULTS: In comparison with nondouchers, women who douched were 30 % less likely to become pregnant each month they attempted pregnancy. This relationship remained after adjustment for covariates, and it could not be explained by women douching for medical reasons. The reduction was not related to the type of douching preparation used. Young women who douched had significantly greater reductions in monthly fertility than older women (50 % reduction for women 18 to 24 years old, 29 % reduction for women 25 to 29 years old, and 6 % reduction for women 30 to 39 years old).

Therefore, accurate and updated information on the location and origin of those potential TADs risks is essential, so preventive measures as market restrictions can be put on place. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the current risk of African swine fever (ASF) and Classical swine fever (CSF) introduction into the US through the legal importations of live pigs and swine products using a quantitative approach that could be later applied to other risks. Four quantitative stochastic risk assessment models were developed to estimate the <b>monthly</b> <b>probabilities</b> of ASF and CSF release into the US, and the exposure of susceptible populations (domestic and feral swine) to these introductions at state level. The results suggest a low annual probability of either ASF or CSF introduction into the US, by any of the analyzed pathways (5. 5 * 10 - 3). Being the probability of introduction through legal imports of live pigs (1. 8 * 10 - 3 for ASF, and 2. 5 * 10 - 3 for CSF) higher than the risk of legally imported swine products (8. 90 * 10 - 4 for ASF, and 1. 56 * 10 - 3 for CSF). This could be caused due to the low probability of exposure associated with this type of commodity (products). The risk of feral pigs accessing to swine products discarded in landfills was slightly higher than the potential exposure of domestic pigs through swill feeding. The identification of the months at highest risk, the origin of the higher risk imports, and the location of the US states most vulnerable to those introductions (Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin for live swine and California, Florida and Texas for swine products), is valuable information that would help to design prevention, risk-mitigation and early-detection strategies that would help to minimize the catastrophic consequences of potential ASF/CSF introductions into the US...|$|R

Our aim was to describe geographic variations in fecundability, the <b>monthly</b> <b>probability</b> of pregnancy, between four cities of France. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in four French maternity units from Toulouse, Rennes, Lyons and Paris, among partners of pregnant women. Women were asked about the time to pregnancy (TTP) of their current pregnancy. TTP was analysed with a discrete Cox model allowing to estimate fecundability ratios (FR). RESULTS: Time to pregnancy was defined for 894 couples. There was no strong evidence of heterogeneity in fecundability between the four compared cities (p= 0. 05 without adjustment and p= 0. 25 after adjustment for behavioural and medical factors). The highest fecundability was observed in Rennes and the lowest in Toulouse (fecundability ratio (FR) = 1. 28, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 63). Differences in fecundability were smaller between the other cities. CONCLUSION: We highlighted a possibly slightly higher fecundability in Rennes compared to Toulouse.

Their riskiness is mostly idiosyncratic and can be diversified away. ...|$|R

We find robust evidence that a decrease in the US federal funds rate prior to loan origination raises the <b>monthly</b> <b>probability</b> of default on individual bank loans. We also find that initiating loans with a subprime credit rating or loans to riskier borrowers with current or past non-performance become more likely when the federal funds rate is low. However, loan spreads do not increase, seemingly even decrease, in changes in the probability of default. Hence banks do not seem to price the additional risk taken. Furthermore, banks with more liquid assets and less funds from foreign financial institutions take more risk when the federal funds rate is low, and reduce loan spreads more despite the additional risk they seemingly take. ...|$|E

This result holds irrespective of whether the joint predictive distribution of several economic indicators or the marginal distribution of real GDP growth is evaluated to extract the real-time recession probabilities of the mixed-frequency Bayesian VAR. The inclusion of the confidence index in industry turns out to be crucial for the performance of the model...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the operational phase of the NASA Research Center's Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS), signal-fade measurements have been recorded at the NASA Ground Station located in Cleveland, Ohio, {{with the use of the}} 20 - and 30 -GHz beacon signals. Compilations of the daily data have been statistically analyzed on a monthly and yearly basis. Such analyses have yielded relevant parameters as (1) cumulative <b>monthly</b> and yearly <b>probability</b> distributions of signal attenuation by rain, (2) attenuation duration versus attenuation threshold probabilities, and (3) rate-of-fade probabilities. Not only are such data needed for a realistic data base to support the design and performance analysis of future satellite systems, but they are necessary to assess predictions made with the ACTS Rain Attenuation Prediction Model...|$|R
