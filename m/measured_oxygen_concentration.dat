Nowadays, the single seed oxygen consumption patterns can be measured on a big scale and at a detailed time resolution using a Q 2 machine. However, interpretation of the data in terms of functioning of internal oxygen transport and overall seed properties is still hard, due to the lack of knowledge on and the complexity of these properties and processes. Modeling may be of great help in understanding the relation between germination and the oxygen consumption pattern of a seed. In this thesis a model for the single seed oxygen consumption inside a closed test tube is proposed, relating the <b>measured</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> to the size of the active mitochondrial population. The analytical solution of this model is used for calibration of the experimental data and all calibrated results are analyzed.

Electrochemical measurement of oxygen partial pressure in equilibrium with the melt can be performed by using solid electrolytes such as the zirconia solid electrolyte. The oxygen measurements in Cu-Ni-Fe-S matte were studied experimentally by measuring the partial pressure of oxygen through the EMF, using a silica-saturated slag and either a CO-CO 2 -SO 2 gas mixture or Ar gas, at 1250 oC. The calculated equilibrium oxygen partial pressure varied from 1. 53 x 10 - 8 to 2. 64 x 10 - 7 atm. Oxygen measurements were conducted by using fully stabilized zirconia as solid electrolyte. Two different solid reference electrodes were used: Cr/Cr 2 O 3 and Fe/FeO. EMF measurements obtained with Cr/Cr 2 O 3 solid reference electrode were less stable and accurate compared to those with Fe/FeO solid reference electrode.

HL- 1 atrial myocytes were cultured onto the sensor surface. Cyclic voltammetry was utilized to characterize the sensor response over 30 minutes while the overlying tissue was subjected to either triiodothyronine or verapamil, drugs known to upregulate or downregulate, respectively, the metabolic activity of myocardial cells. Levels of percent of baseline current were calculated for both drugs, {{as well as for}} controls.

The oxygen potential was measured using a solid state cell incorporating yttria-doped thoria as the electrolyte and Cr+ Cr 2 O 3 as the reference electrode. Oxygen concentration of the alloy was determined by an inert gas fusion technique. The composition of the spinel solid solution, formed at the interface between the alloy and an alumina crucible, was determined by EPMA. The variation of the oxygen concentration and potential and composition of the spinel solid solution with mole fraction of nickel in the alloy have been computed using activities in binary Fe-Ni system, free energies of formation of end member spinels FeO•(1 +x) Al 2 O 3 and NiO•(1 +x) Al 2 O 3 and free energies of solution of oxygen in liquid iron and nickel, available in the literature. Activities in the spinel solid solution were computed using a cation distribution model. The variation of the activity coefficient of oxygen with alloy composition in Fe-Ni-O system was calculated using both the quasichemical model of Jacob and Alcock and the Wagner's model, with the correlation of Chiang and Chang. The computed results for the oxygen potential and the composition of the spinel solid solution are in good agreement with the measurements.

We developed a rapid, automated and non-invasive sensor analysis method based on fluorescence microscopy to <b>measure</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> in a hydrogel scaffold.

Using the reaction enthalpy of reversible gas-solid reactions to store thermal energy represents a promising concept, allowing high energy densities, long term energy storage with minimal losses and a facile separation of the reactants. Specifically for the high-temperature range between 500 °C up to 1100 °C, multivalent metal oxides constitute promising storage materials for thermal energy storage. Those materials offer process technological advantages compared to other thermochemical storage materials, as ambient air {{can be used as}} sink and source of the reactant oxygen during the reduction and oxidation (REDOX) reactions. Accordingly, oxygen {{does not need to be}} stored in this open loop process.

The goal is to decrease the contact area between the corrosive electrolyte and the substrate by creating different surface morphologies using different methods including surface patterns by laser ablation and unidirectional surface roughness through using SiC papers with different grits (G 60 - to G 1200) on nickel and mild steel with different passivation behaviours. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization and different surface characterization methods were performed to investigate the protection performance of the metals. In the first phase, patterns of holes with specific diameters (D) and inter-hole spacings (L) were created by laser ablation on nickel and corrosion tests were carried out in a 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution. The corrosion potential, E Corr, and current density (I Corr) were determined and compared for different ratios of (D/L). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) {{was performed on the}} surface of the samples to investigate the chemical composition, specifically the oxygen content of different regions of the patterned area before and after corrosion testing. By creating such patterns we are able to produce a surface with heterogeneous wetting properties, to decrease the contact area between the liquid and the substrate.

In the next phase, the effect of unidirectional surface roughness on the corrosion of nickel and mild steel was investigated using EIS and potentiodynamic polarization techniques. Scanning electron micrographs were also taken and roughnesses were measured before and after corrosion testing with a profilometer. EDS also <b>measured</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration.</b> By decreasing the roughness, the corrosion resistance of nickel and mild steel increased and decreased respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Low oxygen {{availability}} in soil can impair root function, thereby decreasing agronomic productivity. Without {{oxygen to}} support mitochondrial respiration, energy levels in roots may limit mineral nutrient (N, P, K) transport. Traditional methods for measuring soil oxygenation {{include the use}} of redox electrodes and polarographic oxygen sensors. These approaches are limited to <b>measuring</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> at specific locations and cannot determine the bio‐availability of that oxygen to a growing root. An innovative approach has been developed for direct measurement of oxygen bioavailability. Instead of building the sensor to <b>measure</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations,</b> it is possible to construct an electrochemical system in a manner that makes it sensitive to changes in oxygen transport and availability in the soil. Furthermore, it is even possible to construct the sensor to match the oxygen consumption characteristics of a specific root tip, which is important because most metabolism and nutrient uptake occurs here. This is accomplished by using a conductive‐gel membrane system that allows sensor profiles to be engineered to match the metabolic profiles of specific species. If constructed to these standards, the sensor will biomimetically replicate biophysical oxygen depletion profiles that are analogous to those found in the rhizosphere of a growing root tip. The biomimetic root oxygen bio‐availability (ROB) sensor integrates all biotic and abiotic factors in the soil that limit oxygen transport to the root, while providing real‐time sensing.
