However, {{there is a need}} to investigate other possible impacts of instruments on animals. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of deploying instruments on the surface temperature distribution of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). Infrared (IR) thermography was used to record the surface temperature of two juveniles that had been fitted with heart rate recorders and <b>mounting</b> <b>straps</b> for the attachment of a time depth recorder. When animals were fully wet and inactive, the surface temperature pattern was unaffected by instruments. However, as animals dried out regions of high temperature were recorded around the edges of attachment sites compared to surrounding fur. This appeared to be due to heat leakage around the sides of instruments and <b>mounting</b> <b>straps</b> that provided an additional layer of insulation. There were no obvious changes in the surface temperature distribution around instruments associated with duration of deployment. This work shows that attachment of relatively small biologging instruments will produce localised effects on heat transfer in air but will not significantly change the total heat exchange of grey seals on land or at sea.

40|$|Optical imaging telescopes {{for space}} {{applications}} are typically {{designed and built}} to perform at their diffractionlimited performance, where-in their near theoretical limit of performance to be achieved. To obtain such performance, the mirrors front surfaces of the telescopes are typically fabricated and characterized to a surface accuracy λ/ 60 RMS and λ/ 10 PTV (where λ = 632. 8 nm). Further, typical pointing and geometrical positioning accuracies of different optical elements in the telescope (such as primary & secondary mirror) are required to be controlled to less than 5 arc seconds and 10 microns respectively. The stability of the above performance for given operational and survival conditions is also very critical. The loads that influence the stability of performance of the system may be manufacturing process of each mirror & their mounts, assembly and interface loads, static pre-loads, dynamic launch loads, gravity release effects, on-orbit thermal and other environmental loads. During fabrication and testing of mirror performance on ground, the gravity induced self weight deformations becomes very critical. If the mirror are very large in size and are light weighted, the self weight deflections due to gravity becomes very significant and gravity release support systems thus become very essential.

The about 500 km long overland traverse covered very different surface regimes in the elevation range from sea level up to 1000 m in the austral season 2013 / 14. The presentation is the successful culmination of a six-year effort to develop an operational vibroseis system for Antarctica and Greenland. Over three weeks the campaign acquired: • 407 km of seismic profiles in total, thereof • 110 km in 6 -fold resolution with 125 m shot spacing • 25 km in 3 -fold resolution with 250 m shot spacing. The remaining distance was covered in single-fold with 750 m shot spacing. The traverse used a well-established 60 channel 1. 5 km streamer and a new setup with a vibroseis Buggy “EnviroVibe” with Mattracks on a polyethylen sled. The sled had {{a hole in the}} center to lower the vibrator pad directly onto the snow surface. With this setup data production varied between 20 km/day for 6 -fold and 40 km/day for single fold for a decent 9 h day of measurements. The combination of Mattracks with the PE-sled was especially advantageous on hard and rough surfaces because of the flexibility of each and the relatively lose <b>mounting</b> by cargo <b>straps</b> and wooden blocks. Production speeds were limited by the snow streamer, which had an increasing damage rate of geophone groups for velocities above 6 km/h. The source system itself could easily accommodate transfer velocities of 15 km/h. In combination with the streamer winch mounted in front of the source on a separate freight sled the channel spacing could be reduced to fractions of the 25 m spacing interval by combining several sweeps at the same location, thus increasing spatial resolution.

40|$|Objective: Non-invasive {{navigation}} {{techniques have}} recently been developed to determine mechanical femorotibial alignment (MFTA) in extension. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the precision and accuracy of an image-free navigation system with new software designed to provide multiple kinematic measurements of the knee. The secondary aim was to test two types of strap material used to attach optical trackers to the lower limb. Methods: Seventy-two registrations were carried out on 6 intact embalmed cadaveric specimens (mean age: 77. 8 [*]±[*] 12 years). A validated fabric strap, bone screws and novel rubber strap were used to secure the passive tracker baseplate for four full experiments with each knee. The MFTA angle was measured under the conditions of no applied stress, valgus stress, and varus stress. These measurements were carried out at full extension and at 30 °, 40 °, 50 ° and 60 ° of flexion. Intraclass correlation coefficients, repeatability coefficients, and limits of agreement (LOA) were used to convey precision and agreement in measuring MFTA with respect to each of the independent variables, i. e., degree of flexion, applied coronal stress, and method of tracker fixation. Based on the current literature, a repeatability coefficient and LOA of ≤ 3 ° were deemed acceptable. Results: The mean fixed flexion for the 6 specimens was 12. 8 ° (range: 6 – 20 °). The mean repeatability coefficient measuring MFTA in extension with screws or fabric strapping of the baseplate was &# 8804; 2 °, compared to 2. 3 ° using rubber strapping. When flexing the knee, MFTA measurements taken using screws or fabric straps remained precise (repeatability coefficient &# 8804; 3 °) throughout the tested range of flexion (12. 8 – 60 °); however, using rubber straps, the repeatability coefficient was &# 62; 3 ° beyond 50 ° flexion. In general, applying a varus/valgus stress while measuring MFTA decreased precision beyond 40 ° flexion. Using fabric strapping, excellent repeatability (coefficient &# 8804; 2 °) was observed until 40 ° flexion; however, beyond 50 ° flexion, the repeatability coefficient was &# 62; 3 °. As was the case with precision, agreement between the invasive and non-invasive systems was satisfactory in extension and worsened with flexion. Mean limits of agreement between the invasive and non-invasive system using fabric strapping to assess MFTA were 3 ° (range: 2. 3 – 3. 8 °) with no stress applied and 3. 9 ° (range: 2. 8 – 5. 2 °) with varus and valgus stress. Using rubber strapping, the corresponding values were 4. 4 ° (range: 2. 8 – 8. 5 °) with no stress applied, 5. 5 ° (range: 3. 3 – 9. 0 °) with varus stress, and 5. 6 ° (range: 3. 3 – 11. 9 °) with valgus stress. Discussion: Acceptable precision and accuracy may be possible when measuring knee kinematics in early flexion using a non-invasive system; however, we do not believe passive trackers should be <b>mounted</b> with rubber <b>strapping</b> such as was used in this study. Flexing the knee appears to decrease the precision and accuracy of the system.

All of them, without exception, are grave finds {{discovered}} at four {{more or less}} archaeologically excavated sites {{in the northern part}} of Croatia: a small number of artifacts was found and gathered at the Avaro-Slavic cemetery of Bijelo Brdo-Bajer (2), and the early Slavic cemeteries of Zagreb-Kruge (2) and Brodski Drenovac-Plana (1), while objects of bone and horn were discovered in somewhat greater amounts (7) in the graves of the famous early Bijelo Brdo cemetery of Vukovar-Lijeva Bara (Fig. 1). With the exception of the finds from Zagreb-Kruge, acquired in 1911 by a great strake of luck, although the records state that the AMZ in fact excavated four graves there, I the remaining cemeteries were the subject of systematic archaeological excavations performed immediately after the Second World War and somewhat later: in Bijelo Brdo at the site of Bajer in 1947 and 1948 godine, 2 in Vukovar at the site of Lijeva Bara in 1951 - 1953, 3 and in Brodsld Drenovac at the site of Plana in 1952 - 1953. 4 At the cemetery of Vukovar-Lijeva Bara objects of bone and horn were found in 7 graves, mostly male with only individual female and child graves (gr. 22 /m, 29 /ch, 37 /m, 92 /m, 232 /m, 253 /f?, 306 /m), while at the Bijelo Brdo-Bajer cemetery they were discovered in two male graves (gr. 16, 49), and at the cemeteries of Zagreb-Kruge and Brodski Drenovac-Plana in one male (gr. 4), and one female grave (gr. 16), respectively. Two mostly common groups of artifacts of bone and horn are represented: the group with objects of everyday use includes tools and implements and one musical instrument (8), while the group of weapons and military equipment contains parts and remains of the weaponry and equipment of an archer(4). The tools consist of awls and instruments to tighten!loosen (4), with one thatching needle and awl press each (2), and one needle case, with an exceptionally interesting and important fiute, or actually pipe, representing musical instruments. The scarce example s of weaponry consisted of the covering platelets for the ends and handIe (upper and grip laths) of a short, nomad, or reftex bow (3), while the only objects of decorative character among the military equipment were remnants of the plating for the upper part of a quiver (or arrow container). All of the other II early medieval objects of bone and horn were of a purely utilitarian character. The earliest bone and horn objects in the chronological sense come from the cemetery of Bijelo Brdo-Bajer: these are fragments of the covering plates (or laths) of the upper right end and grip of a composite refiex bow [7. 1. 1 - 3] and a pipe broken into two parts [6. 1], which like the cemetery itself should be dated to the period before the middle and in the middle of the 7 tb century (gr. 49 /m), and to a lesser extent in the second half of the 7 th century (gr. 16 /m). 5 Younger than these by a definite entire century are the excellently preserved tightener/loosener [4. 1] and left exterior lath of the end of a bow [7. 2. 1], both objects from the same grave rich in finds of an older horseman (gr. 4 /m), 6 discovered at the early Slavic cemetery of Zagreb-Kruge. ? Somewhat later than these is the cylindrical ribbed needle case [5. 1] from the partially excavated but nonetheless very important early Slavic cemetery of Brodski Drenovac-Plana (gr. 16 /f), dated to the late 81 h and early 91 h centuries. 8 A later and somewhat larger group of bone and horn objects consists of finds from the early Bijelo Brdo cemetery of Vukovar-Lijeva Bara, which can be dated, like the cemetery they come from, in a span from the second half of the lOth century to the first decades of the 11 Ih century (Fig. 2). 9 Among these, the earliest bone and horn objects should be considered the carved decorative platelets of a qui ver [8. 1. 1 - 4] and a pair of the upper laths of a refiex bow [7. 3. 1 - 2], from warrior graves dated to the second half or the last third of the lOth century, respectively (gr. 232, gr. 92). Graves with finds of a thatching needle [1. 1], awls [2. 1 - 2], and an awl press [3. 1] belong to the end of the lOth and beginning of the 11 th centuries (gr. 29 /ch, 22 /m, 253 /f?, 306 /m), and a grave with the find of a simple but darnaged implement to tighten!loosen [4. 2] is dated to the beginning of the II th century (gr. 37 /m).

Thatching needles are pointed bone objects with a cut tip on one of the ends. They are usually made from the tibia of a small animal (sheep, goat, dog, rabbit), and they served for interweaving vegetative fibers, such as bast, switches, rushes, straw, etc. II They are frequent finds at early medieval Slavic settlements, but they are very rare in early medieval graves, and the graves of the Bijelo Brdo cultural circle are no exception to this. What is more, the Vukovar thatching needle comes from a grave located in the northern edge section of the southwestern zone of burial (gr. 29), where by the head of a child skeleton it was discovered in an nonfunctional position together with an iron file and jewellery for the head and neck (a bronze S-circlet, a necklace of glass beads). 1 2 2.

Awls are not rare finds in the cemeteries of the Bijelo Brdo cultural circle, and they were discovered in graves at Lijeva Bara in Vukovar. Although there, as elsewhere, finds of iron awls predominate, bone awls were found by the shin s of skeletons buried in one male and one female or probably female grave: one thin and slender aw! was made from a bone from a fish head (gr. 253 /f?), and the other somewhat more massive and larger awl with a very short point was made from a tubular animal bone (gr. 22 /m). The graves with fi. nds of bone awls were discovered in the edge sections of the southwestern zone of burial (gr. 22 /m) and in the southeastern zone (gr. 253 /f?). 3. Awl press (PI. 1 : 3. 1) Early medieval, the end of the lOth to the beginning of the II th centuries 3. 1 Press (jor an awl) -AMZ S- 2704. Vukovar-Lijeva Bara, gr. 306 /m on the right side of the chest (at right elbow height); Bijelo Brdo Culture; end of the 10 th to the beginning of the II th centuries. Presses are implements intended to aid in greater efficiency and easier use of awls when puncturing hard materials. At the early Bijelo Brdo cemetery of Lijeva Bara in Vukovar awl presses were found in one probably female grave and in one male, in both cases in different places oo or by the skeleton of the deceased individual, but always and exclusively in the immediate vicinity of the awl, together representing the only grave goods. They are made of stone or bone, of irregular shape, and are polished on one side (gr. 253 /f?) or both sides (gr. 306 /m). Material different from that of the awl was used for the press, so that a stone press was found in combination with a bone awl (gr. 253), while a bone press was found in combination with an iron awl (gr. 306). The graves with a press and an awl were located in the eastern part of the cemetery, but very distant from one another: one on the edge of the southern section of the southeastern zone of burial (gr. 253 /f?), and the other some 50 m to the north in a section considerably beyond the northeastern zone of burial (gr. 306 /m). 4. Tightener I loosener (Pl. 2 : 4. 1 - 2) Early medieval, middle of the 8 th to the beginning of the 11 th centuries 4. 1 Tightener 1 loosener -AMZ S- 2960 (Pl. 2 : 4. 1). Zagreb-Kruge, gr. 4 /m; Early Slavic period; middle of the 8 th century. 4. 2 Tightener Iloosener, fragment -AMZ S- 247 1 (PI. 2 : 4. 2). Vukovar-Lijeva Bara, gr. 37 /m; Bijelo Brdo Culture; beginning of the II tb century. The finds from the rich Avara-Slavic horse man grave found in Zagreb at Kruge (gr. 4) included riding and horse equipment (a bit, asaddle, stirrups, an iron buckle), quite a few weapons (a long sax, an axe, a knife, a reftex bow), and attire elements (bronze buckles with and without <b>mounts,</b> a <b>strap</b> end <b>mount,</b> an iron buckle), as well as one "bone awl", as it was first defined. 14 This carefully worked bone point, which was also considered and claimed to have belonged to the saddIe or the harness (the position of the find in the grave was not noted), 15 in fact is a multi purpose bone tool used to tighten, coil, and loosen, because of which it is cited in the literature as a tightener or loosener. 16 Later than the above and of far simpIer workmanship is the tightener/loosener discovered in one of the Bijelo Brdo graves at Lijeva Bara in Vukovar. It was found in a male grave directly below the nose of the head of the deceased turned toward the right shoulder, one end resting next to the latter (gr. 37). This position means that it probably was in some container hung around the neck of the|$|R
