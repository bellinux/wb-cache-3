25|$|Palestinian stone-throwing {{refers to}} a Palestinian {{practice}} of throwing stones at people or property. It is a tactic with both a symbolic and <b>military</b> <b>dimension</b> when used against heavily armed troops. While stone throwing {{is a form of}} violence, the majority of Palestinian youths engaged in the practice appear to regard it as symbolic and non-violent, given the disparity in power and equipment between the Israeli forces and the Palestinian stone-throwers, with many considering it a method of deterring Israeli military forces and civilians from the occupation of Palestinian lands. In Israel it is considered criminal because it is potentially lethal, and it is argued that in some cases it should be treated as a form of terrorism, or that, in terms of the psychology of those who hurl stones, it is intrinsically aggressive.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{hypothesized}} that Iraq decided {{to destroy the}} oil fields to achieve a military advantage, believing the intense smoke plumes serving as smoke screens created by the burning oil wells would inhibit Coalition offensive air strikes, foil allied precision guided weapons and spy satellites, and could screen Iraq’s military movements. Furthermore, {{it is thought that}} Iraq’s military leaders may have regarded the heat, smoke, and debris from hundreds of burning oil wells as presenting a formidable area denial obstacle to Coalition forces. The onset of the oil well destruction supports this <b>military</b> <b>dimension</b> to the sabotage of the wells; for example, during the early stage of the Coalition air campaign, the number of oil wells afire was relatively small but the number increased dramatically in late February {{with the arrival of the}} ground war.|$|E
