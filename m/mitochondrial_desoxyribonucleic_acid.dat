40|$|The {{substance}} inducing {{transformation of}} pneumococcal types has been isolated from Pneumococcus Type III {{in the form}} of a <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> fraction (1). The data obtained by chemical, enzymatic, and serological analysis, as well as by electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation of the purified material strongly suggest that the nucleic acid is itself responsible for the biological activity. The enzymatic analysis was begun early in the course of the attempts to determine the nature of the transforming substance. Relatively unpurified pneumococcal extracts were subjected to enzymatic study in the hope that by this approach some clue might be obtained as to the identity of the biologically active constituent. Crystalline trypsin, chymotrypsin, and ribonuclease had no effect on the transforming substance, but it was found that certain crude enzyme preparations were able to bring about complete loss of transforming activity. When the possible importance of <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> was suggested by chemical fractionation, the experiments with crude enzyme preparations were extended to determine whether their ability to destroy the activity of the transforming principle could be correlated with any enzymatic action on authentic samples of <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> of non-bacterial origin. A variety of crude enzymes were tested both for their ability to inactivate the transforming substance, and for their effect on <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> from animal tissues (1). Of the enzyme preparations tested only those capable of depolymerizing authentic <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> were effective in destroying the transforming activity of pneumococcal extracts.

Separation of phage <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> from phage protein and penetration of <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> into the host cell, as observed with phage T 2 (Hershey and Chase, 1952), do occur under the conditions of a one-step growth experiment, but fail to take place if the cells are infected and kept in nutrient broth at high bacterial concentrations (over 2 X 109 cells per ml).

40|$|Largely as {{the result}} of Brachet's {{investigations}} (1), it has become appreciated that the differential staining of tissues with the methyl green-pyronin mixture of Unna and Pappenheim is determined by their nucleic acid components. Thus, the green staining of nuclei was demonstrated to be due to their content of <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> and the red staining of the cytoplasm to be determined by the ribonucleic acid content. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to report some observations on the nature of this phenomenon of differential staining of similar acid substrates by two basic dyes. In tissues, <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> apparently occurs as a much higher polymer than ribonucleic acid (2). It appeared to us that this difference in the degree of polymerization might be the determining factor in the differential staining with methyl green-pyronin. It is the purpose of this paper to present observations on the differences in staining between highly polymerized and depolymerized desoxyribonudeic acids. As will be seen, these tend to confirm the hypothesis that the affinity of nucleic acids for methyl green and pyronin is a function of their state of polymerization: methyl green stains preferentially highly polymerized nucleic acid, while pyronin hasa special affinity for low polymers (depolymerized <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> and ribonucleic acid) ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the {{chemical}} nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types have provided strong evidence that this biologically active substance is a nucleic acid of the desoxyribose type (1).

40|$|The {{attempt to}} study the {{relationship}} between the <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> content per cell and polyploidy in the yeasts made mandatory a preliminary study {{of the extent to which}} the content of <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> would vary during the budding cycle. It might be assumed that in a single yeast cell or in a population of yeast cells budding in synchrony, the content of <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> per cell would change by a factor of two at some stage during the formation of the first bud. Relationships between different cultures due to ploidy might be obscured, depend-ing on the stages at which the yeasts were harvested. The situation in most growing yeast cultures is actually far from synchronous. By choosing a well dissimilated culture with a low percentage of buds as the initial point, however, a certain degree of synchrony is introduced into the first cycle of budding to the extent that (1) budding percentage rises sharply within a rela-tively short time interval, and (2) about 80 per cent budding may be achieved in a constant number of mother cells before any buds split off to form new cells. This system makes possible the study of the changes in nucleic acid content which are associated with budding in a constant number of mother cells and facilitates analysis of the data to some extent.

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of evidence indicates that <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> is capable of duplicating itself, a property also possessed by genes. (By a self-duplicating material, we mean one which plays some essential role in its own production.) Watson & Crick (1) have proposed a new structure for <b>desoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> which not only {{takes into account the}} existing analytical and x-ray diffraction data but also seems capable of explaining the mechanism of duplication. Their model consists of two helical chains coiled around the same axis, the purine and pyrimidine bases on the inside, the phosphate groups on the outside. The chains are held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases, the adenine residues of either chain being bonded specifically to thymine in the other, and similarly guanine to cytosine. The sequence of bases along one chain is not restricted, but once fixed the sequence along the other chain is determined. This complementarity, which is the most novel feature of the structure, suggests that duplication takes place by separation of the two chains, followed by the synthesis of its complement alongside each chain.
