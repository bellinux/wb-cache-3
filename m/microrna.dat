Here, we report the cloning and analysis of <b>microRNAs</b> encoded by Rhesus Monkey Rhadinovirus (RRV), an animal virus model for the pathogenic human γ-herpesvirus Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV).

40|$|Amniotic fluid (AF) {{continuously}} exchanges molecules {{with the}} fetus, playing critical roles in fetal development especially via its complex components. Among these components, <b>microRNAs</b> {{are thought to}} be transferred between cells loaded in microvesicles. However, the functions of AF <b>microRNAs</b> remain unknown. To date, few studies have examined <b>microRNAs</b> in amniotic fluid. In this study, we employed miRCURY Locked Nucleotide Acid arrays to profile the dynamic expression of <b>microRNAs</b> in AF from mice on embryonic days E 13, E 15, and E 17. At these times, 233 <b>microRNAs</b> were differentially expressed (p< 0. 01), accounting for 23 % of the total Mus musculus <b>microRNAs.</b> These differentially-expressed <b>microRNAs</b> were divided into two distinct groups based on their expression patterns. Gene ontology analysis showed that the intersectional target genes of these differentially-expressed <b>microRNAs</b> were mainly distributed in synapse, synaptosome, cell projection, and cytoskeleton. Pathway analysis revealed that the target genes of the two groups of <b>microRNAs</b> were synergistically enriched in axon guidance, focal adhesion, and MAPK signaling pathways. MicroRNA-mRNA network analysis and gene- mapping showed that these <b>microRNAs</b> synergistically regulated cell motility, cell proliferation and differentiation, and especially the axon guidance process.

5|$|Somatic {{recombination}} of immunoglobulins, {{also known}} as V(D)J recombination, involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments. V, D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments {{can be used to}} generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different , and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of <b>microRNA</b> miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.|$|E
25|$|One mir-2 <b>microRNA</b> in Drosophila, dme-miR-2a-2 , is two {{nucleotides}} offset {{with respect}} to the canonical products of other mir-2 precursors. This is likely to affect the function of that particular <b>microRNA.</b> This functional shift is associated to a change in the genomic distribution of mir-2 sequences in Drosophila. The functional diversification of microRNAs may require breaking the genomic linkage between paralogs, probably to avoid the co-regulation of multiple products by the same regulatory sequences.|$|E
25|$|Mir-2 microRNAs are {{organized}} {{in a large}} cluster in most insects. This cluster has typically 5 members of the mir-2 family plus mir-71, an evolutionarily unrelated <b>microRNA.</b> The number of mir-2 sequences differs among invertebrate lineages although they remain tightly clustered in the genome.
