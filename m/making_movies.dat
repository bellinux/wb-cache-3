The antics of his fellow fraternities, coupled with experiences {{like that of a}} road trip to UMass Amherst and its Delta Chi Fraternity, became the inspiration for the Delta Tau Chis of Animal House and many characters in the film (and their nicknames) were based on Miller's fraternity brothers.
