500|$|Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode a B– rating. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a {{negative}} review {{and called it}} [...] "easily {{the worst of the}} season". He awarded it a 4 out of 10 and concluded that, [...] "We can only hope that none of the remaining episodes are Shiban-related, and pray that he can do a <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> when he writes for [...] next season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry [...] "solid and efficient". The two complimented Shiban's directorial efforts, noting that [...] "as a director [...] makes 'Underneath' shine", but were critical of some of the [...] "trademark X-File moments", citing [...] "the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror" [...] and [...] "the climactic fight in a sewer" [...] as examples. Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Doggett. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, wrote that the episode felt [...] "very familiar" [...] but was impressed with the production design on the sewer set.|$|E

6000|$|But an {{experiment}} {{conducted by a}} handful of people, who, after thirty years of immunity from the unintentional child slaughter that goes on by ignorant parents in private homes, numbered only 300, could do very little except prove that Communists, under the guidance of a Superman [...] "devoted exclusively to the establishment of the Kingdom of God," [...] and caring no more for property and marriage than a Camberwell minister cares for Hindoo Caste or Suttee, might make a <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> of their lives than ordinary folk under the harrow of both these institutions. Yet their Superman himself admitted that this apparent success was only part of the abnormal phenomenon of his own occurrence; for {{when he came to the}} end of his powers through age, he himself guided and organized the voluntary relapse of the communists into marriage, capitalism, and customary private life, thus admitting that the real social solution was not what a casual Superman could persuade a picked company to do for him, but what a whole community of Supermen would do spontaneously. If Noyes had had to organize, not a few dozen Perfectionists, but the whole United States, America would have beaten him as completely as England beat Oliver Cromwell, France Napoleon, or Rome Julius Cæsar. Cromwell learnt by bitter experience that God himself cannot raise a people above its own level, and that even though you stir a nation to sacrifice all its appetites to its conscience, the result will still depend wholly on what sort of conscience the nation has got. Napoleon seems to have ended by regarding mankind as a troublesome pack of hounds only worth keeping for the sport of hunting with them. Cæsar's capacity for fighting without hatred or resentment was defeated by the determination of his soldiers to kill their enemies in the field instead of taking them prisoners to be spared by Cæsar; and his civil supremacy was purchased by colossal bribery of the citizens of Rome. What great rulers cannot do, codes and religions cannot do. Man reads his own nature into every ordinance: if you devise a superhuman commandment so cunningly that it cannot be misinterpreted in terms of his will, he will denounce it as seditious blasphemy, or else disregard it as either crazy or totally unintelligible. Parliaments and synods may tinker as much as they please with their codes and creeds as circumstances alter the balance of classes and their interests; and, as a result of the tinkering, there may be an occasional illusion of moral evolution, as when the victory of the commercial caste over the military caste leads to the substitution of social boycotting and pecuniary damages for duelling. At certain moments there may even be a considerable material advance, as when the conquest of political power by the working class produces a better distribution of wealth through the simple action of the selfishness of the new masters; but all this is mere readjustment and reformation: until the heart and mind of the people is changed the very greatest man will no more dare to govern on the assumption that all are as great as he than a drover dare leave his flock to find its way through the streets as he himself would. Until there is an England in which every man is a Cromwell, a France in which every man is a Napoleon, a Rome in which every man is a Cæsar, a Germany in which every man is a Luther plus a Goethe, the world will be no more improved by its heroes than a Brixton villa is improved by the pyramid of Cheops. The production of such nations is the only real change possible to us.|$|E

The two grew to be longtime friends and coached together for twenty years. Their first season at Victoria, Wood, Southall, and West shocked many Victoria fans and brought the team a 6-4 winning season. Then Coach Wood brought Victoria another winning season in 1959 with six wins, three losses, and one tie. Wood was getting paid well in Victoria, making about $10,000, but a lack of fan support and homesickness for West Texas convinced him to move back west. He left Victoria with twelve wins, seven losses, and one tie.|$|R

40|$|Women in Britain {{who work}} {{part-time}} have, on average, hourly earnings about 25 % {{less than that}} of women working full-time. This gap has widened greatly over the past 30 [*]years. This article tries to explain this part-time pay penalty. It shows that a sizeable part of the penalty {{can be explained by the}} differing characteristics of FT and PT women. Inclusion of standard demographics halves the estimate of the pay penalty. But inclusion of occupation makes the pay penalty very small, suggesting that almost the entire unexplained gap is due to occupational segregation. The rise in the pay penalty over time is partly a result of a rise in occupational segregation and partly the general rise in wage inequality. Policies to reduce the pay penalty have had little effect and it is likely that it will not change <b>much</b> unless <b>better</b> <b>jobs</b> can be made available on a part-time basis.

Focusing on college graduates, we construct two direct measures of job matching based on how well an individual's job corresponds {{to his or her}} college education.

40|$|Our paper {{studies the}} causes of poverty from the {{perspective}} of job search. We show that poor people remain poor because they have less time and initial endowment to search for a <b>better</b> <b>job.</b> Initial endowment is key to successful job search, as one can afford not to work and search longer for a <b>better</b> <b>job.</b> Having an initial en-dowment, a worker is able to educate or re-qualify himself. Working long hours and obtaining low pay, poor people have little time to look for a <b>better</b> <b>job.</b> Low-paid, low-skilled jobs rarely allow on-the-job search like high-paid positions where with the help of contacts and a lot of idle time professionals seek <b>better</b> <b>jobs.</b> Quit-ting in order to find a <b>better</b> <b>job</b> increases the opportunity cost of search for poorer people. Since they do not have any accumulated income, they can only live off their salary. With less income and time, poorer people are less likely to get educated since education requires both wealth and free time. But being less educated, they are likely to remain poor as education is a promise for success in contemporary society. Thus, they re-main in the vicious circle of poverty.
