Eva Le Gallienne in particular was furious, denouncing de Acosta as a liar and stating that she invented the stories for fame. This characterization is inaccurate since many of her affairs and relationships with women, including that with Le Gallienne, are confirmed in personal correspondence. An exception to this was Marlene Dietrich, who continued to correspond with her and loved the book. According to critic Patricia White, [...] "If she craved being seen, MdA was <b>more</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> what she said than she is given credit for.

These stories consisted of anecdotes, jokes, legends, and tales involving mystical, fantastical or legendary elements.

60|$|Isabel gave {{an extreme}} {{attention}} to this little sketch; she found it indeed intensely interesting. It seemed to show her how far her husband's desire to be effective was capable of going--to the point of playing theoretic tricks on the delicate organism of his daughter. She could not understand his purpose, no--not wholly; but she understood it better than he supposed or desired, inasmuch as she {{was convinced that the}} whole proceeding was an elaborate mystification, addressed to herself and destined to act upon her imagination. He had wanted to do something sudden and arbitrary, something unexpected and refined; to mark the difference between his sympathies and her own, and show that if he regarded his daughter as a precious work of art it was natural he should be more and <b>more</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> the finishing touches. If he wished to be effective he had succeeded; the incident struck a chill into Isabel's heart. Pansy had known the convent in her childhood and had found a happy home there; she was fond of the good sisters, who were very fond of her, and there was therefore for the moment no definite hardship in her lot. But all the same the girl had taken fright; the impression her father desired to make would evidently be sharp enough. The old Protestant tradition had never faded from Isabel's imagination, and as her thoughts attached themselves to this striking example of her husband's genius--she sat looking, like him, at the basket of flowers--poor little Pansy became the heroine of a tragedy. Osmond wished it to be known that he shrank from nothing, and his wife found it hard to pretend to eat her dinner. There was a certain relief presently, in hearing the high, strained voice of her sister-in-law. The Countess too, apparently, had been thinking the thing out, but had arrived at a different conclusion from Isabel.|$|E

We view their response to our article as genuinely helping to clarify the relation between ideology and frames. Nevertheless, a few comments in reply seem in order. Our focus on the "turn " away from ideology in the 1986 Snow et al. article, and especially the 1988 Snow and Benford chapter, does not do justice to the full corpus of their work, either in these two essays, or in the many other works they have published. But the turn is nevertheless there. They essentially say, "Ideology is important and has been neglected by resource mobilization scholars. Let's look at framing processes as a way of remedying this.

L.), concluding from these results that, inflationary cosmology may require multiple fields or a breakdown of slow roll condition. This conclusion has drastically changed with the last data provided by PLANCK 2015 where the modulus of the expected observational value of the running has been reduced one order, getting shorter the distance to its theoretical value 1 σ or more, what allows {{the viability of the}} majority of the potentials disfavored by the running provided by PLANCK 2013 data. However if one takes into account the running of the running, its theoretical value, which in the slow roll regime depends on the slow roll parameters at third order, is incompatible with the expected observational value provided by PLANCK 2013 and PLANCK 2015, disfavouring at 92. 8 % C.

Samples from a (univariate or multivariate) experiment can be histogrammed either in practice or as a thought experiment. Histogramming counts how many samples fall in a certain interval. Underlying is the notion that there is a probability distribution which precisely represents the probability of falling into an interval. If x ∈ R is a real random variable with probability density px(t), this means that the probability that x � b may be found � in an interval [a, b] is a px(t) dt.
