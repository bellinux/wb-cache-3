Ice skates are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.|$|E

The highly insulated external walls are essential prerequisites for low energy consumption of buildings. Filling shell of the brick with insulation material {{is one of the}} methods to reduce cooling loads in buildings. This paper aims to investigate the dynamic thermal parameters <b>of</b> various <b>insulation</b> filled bricks. The dynamic thermal parameters highlighted in the study include thermal transmittance, admittance, decrement factor, time lag and areal thermal heat capacity. The cyclic admittance method was employed in computer simulation program to compute dynamic thermal parameters of stuffed bricks. The four brick materials such as mud bricks, burnt bricks, concrete blocks and fly ash bricks were selected. The insulation materials used for filling shells of the brick are foam glass and asbestos fibre. The total forty eight stuffed bricks were investigated. The shell of the brick is filled by the insulation and the each <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> is separated by a brick web. The shell and web thickness of the brick were maintained as per the Indian standards. The six configurations of the stuffed bricks were investigated (1. Solid brick, 2. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with single <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation,</b> 3. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with two <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> with each insulation layer separated with a brick web, 4. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with three <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> with each insulation layer separated by a brick web, 5. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with four <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> with each insulation layer separated by a brick web and 6. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with five <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> with each insulation layer separated by a brick web). From the results, it is observed that the stuffed bricks significantly improve time lag values as compared to the conventional solid bricks. The decrement factor decreases, admittance increases and areal thermal heat capacity increases with {{the increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>layers</b> in the bricks. The concrete blocks with the shell of the bricks filled with five <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> asbestos fibre <b>insulation</b> offer the highest admittance (3. 11 W/m 2 K), the lowest decrement factor (0. 435), the highest time lag values (8. 26 h) and the highest areal thermal heat capacity (57366 J/m 2 K) among all insulation filled bricks studied.

In this study, the thermal time constant, the time lag, and the decrement factor are calculated for different wall configurations in order to investigate the best insulation/thermal mass layer distribution in external walls. First, this is done for just a wall by developing a numerical model to solve the one dimensional heat transfer equation in a multilayered wall subjected to convective boundary conditions. Second, this is done for a full-scale house using the whole building energy simulation program EnergyPlus.

40|$|There exist {{high end}} {{refrigeration}} cooled super-servers that approach near liquid nitrogen temperatures. One {{of the largest}} problems for cooling schemes of this type is condensation around the evaporator plate which is located amongst sensitive electronics. As {{a solution to this}} problem it has been proposed that a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> be employed in order to eliminate condensation. In the following investigation three different insulating schemes were studied; adding a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> rigid foam to the evaporator assembly in natural convection, adding rigid foam as well as providing forced convection, and applying thin heaters to the surface <b>of</b> the <b>insulation.</b> It was found that with only a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> {{it was not possible to}} prevent condensation. When a forced convection condition was added into the model it was possible to stop condensation from forming with a 15 mm thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> and a h = ~ 100 W/m 2 K; with a 20 mm thick layer it was possible to reduce the convection coefficient to ~ 50 W/m 2 K.
