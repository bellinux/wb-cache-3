5|$|Facing {{charges of}} heresy for their Arminian beliefs, Presbyterian ministers Richard McNemar and John Thompson, along with Barton W. Stone {{and two other}} ministers, chose to {{withdraw}} from the Kentucky Synod and form the independent Springfield Presbytery in 1803. These ministers would later dissolve the Springfield Presbytery and become the founders of the American Restoration <b>Movement,</b> <b>from</b> which the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and Churches of Christ denominations originate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related to the}} shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E
5|$|The city {{remained}} {{as a major}} center of the Indian independence <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> the rebellion of 1857 until the independence, as many national leaders visited the city during the movement such as Lala Lajpat Rai in 1886, Subhas Chandra Bose in 1938, and Jawaharlal Nehru in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E

5|$|Final {{preparations}} for the landings in the Brunei Bay area took place in May 1945. After shortages of shipping delayed I Corps' <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> Australia to Morotai, General Headquarters agreed on 8 May to reschedule the operation from 23 May to 10 June. The 9th Division's staff completed their plans for operations in the Brunei Bay area on 16 May. The 24th Brigade Group was assigned responsibility for capturing Labuan, and the 20th Brigade Group was tasked with securing Brunei and Muara Island. Both brigades were to land simultaneously {{on the morning of}} 10 June. The invasion of the Brunei Bay region was to be preceded by attacks on Japanese bases and transport infrastructure across western and northern Borneo by United States and Australian air units, as well as three days of minesweeping operations in the bay itself.|$|E
5|$|Hart House Theatre is the university's student amateur theatre, {{generally}} producing {{four major}} plays every season. As old as Hart House itself, the theatre {{is considered a}} pioneer in Canadian theatre for introducing the Little Theatre <b>Movement</b> <b>from</b> Europe. It has cultivated numerous performing-arts talents, including Donald Sutherland, Lorne Michaels, Wayne and Shuster and William Hutt. Three members of the Group of Seven painters (Harris, Lismer and MacDonald) have been set designers at the theatre, and composer Healey Willan was director of music for fourteen productions. The theatre also hosts annual variety shows run by several student theatrical companies at the colleges and academic faculties, {{the most prominent of}} which are U.C. Follies of University College, Skule Nite of the Faculty of Engineering, and Daffydil of the Faculty of Medicine, the latter in its hundredth year of production in 2010–2011.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E

5|$|Many women's {{rights activists}} {{who worked with}} Stanton were opposed to the {{publication}} of The Woman's Bible; they felt it would harm the drive for women's suffrage. Although it was never accepted by Bible scholars as a major work, it became a popular best-seller, much {{to the dismay of}} suffragists who worked alongside Stanton within the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Susan B. Anthony tried to calm the younger suffragists, but they issued a formal denunciation of the book, and worked to distance the suffrage <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> Stanton's broader scope which included attacks on traditional religion. Because of the widespread negative reaction, including that of suffragists who had been close to her, publication of the book effectively ended Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement.|$|E
5|$|Mario Bros. also {{introduced}} Mario's brother, Luigi, who {{was created for}} the multiplayer mode by doing a palette swap of Mario. The two-player mode and several aspects of gameplay were inspired by Joust. To date, Mario Bros. has been released {{for more than a}} dozen platforms.

5|$|Nan's {{experiences}} eventually reveal serious faults of {{the society}} she moves through, the primary element of a picaresque novel. For this and other reasons, Waters' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens; the reader follows Nan's <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent-boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator, showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals. Michael Upchurch in The Seattle Times writes that Nan's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting, remaining malleable {{until the end of}} the novel indicates she is her own worst enemy. Likewise, Marianne Brace in The Independent considers Nan selfish and unsympathetic.|$|E

5|$|RPGs {{can suffer}} {{in the area}} of exploration. Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of every detail of the game world, and provide for a more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the internal logic of the game world or plot. Action games reward players for quick <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect streamline the player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian African Rifles {{were based}} at Borrowdale in {{north-east}} Salisbury between 1940 and 1943. Apart from a contingent sent south to Durban to guard Italian prisoners {{on their way}} to Rhodesia, the regiment's main role was garrison duties within the colony. The Rhodesian Air Askari Corps, a unit of black volunteer troops under white command, guarded the air bases and also provided manpower for non-armed labour. The perceived possibility that Japan might attempt an invasion of southern Africa via Madagascar led to the consolidation of a few hundred rural whites into the Southern Rhodesia Commando, a part-time cadre intended as the basis for a guerrilla-style resistance <b>movement,</b> <b>from</b> 1942.|$|E

Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No.3. The group used an orchestra {{for the first time}} on some parts of the suite. The band were on the bill at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival and briefly toured Ireland with Yes and Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band which, by all accounts, was fraught with logistical problems.|$|E

After a quick maintenance check, they were flown up to Port Moresby to help the 374th Troop Carrier Group fly the 17th Infantry Brigade into Wau. This meant that up to 40 aircraft were now available daily.|$|E
5|$|The {{marginalization}} of the Iranian Bahá'ís by current governments {{is rooted in}} historical efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions. Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression aimed at individual Bahá'ís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bahá'í community and its institutions were initiated. In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Bahá'ís were killed. Bahá'í schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girls' schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 1940s, Bahá'í marriages were not recognized and Bahá'í texts were censored.|$|E
5|$|The {{urban area}} has a {{population}} density of 3035/km2 (7,864/mi²), while the rural and suburban areas have a density of 355.5/km2 (920/mi²). The rural areas {{away from the city}} tend to be scarcely populated, becoming denser near it. During the summer the resident population in the city triples; this seasonal <b>movement</b> <b>from</b> neighbouring cities is due to the draw of the beach and 29.9% of homes had seasonal use in 2001, the highest in Greater Porto. Póvoa de Varzim is the youngest city in the region with a birth rate of 13.665 and mortality rate of 8.330. Unlike other urban areas of greater Porto, it is not a satellite city. Significant commuting occurs only with Vila do Conde, an urban expansion area of Póvoa since the 18th century.|$|E
