5|$|Tankersley married Maxwell Peter Miller, Jr. in 1941. She and Miller {{lived in}} Tucson for two years, where she {{developed}} a deep love for Arizona. They {{then moved to}} Chicago for a time, and subsequently to her mother's Trinchera Ranch, which Bazy ran. Her mother died of pancreatitis on December 31, 1944, two <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> serious riding accident. The couple moved back to Illinois prior to relocating to Washington, DC.|$|E

5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E

5|$|Raised in Tucson, Meyer {{attended}} Harvard University. There, {{after becoming}} {{president of the}} Harvard Lampoon, he graduated in 1978 {{with a degree in}} biochemistry. Abandoning plans to attend medical school, Meyer attempted to make money through dog racing but failed after two <b>months.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> series of short-term jobs he was hired in 1981 by David Letterman, on the advice of two of Meyer's Harvard Lampoon cowriters, to join the writing team of his show Late Night with David Letterman.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oblongifolia {{plants can}} live {{for more than}} 60 years. They respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the {{greatest}} number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat, although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are serotinous, that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant.|$|E
5|$|Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle {{manager in}} February 2006, Bruce was again {{linked with the}} job, which {{ultimately}} went to Glenn Roeder. By {{this stage of the}} 2005–06 season, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} nearly six <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.|$|E

5|$|In 1897 Max Weber Sr. {{died two}} <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> severe quarrel {{with his son}} that was never resolved. After this, Weber became {{increasingly}} prone to depression, nervousness and insomnia, {{making it difficult for}} him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne Weber feared that Max Weber's work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{support the}} safety of antivenom, with around a 5% chance of an acute reaction, 1–2% of {{anaphylaxis}} and 10% chance of a delayed reaction due to serum sickness. Nevertheless, {{it is recommended that}} an injection of adrenaline be ready and available in case it is needed to treat a severe anaphylactic reaction, and also that the antivenom from the vial be administered diluted in a 100 ml bag of intravenous solution for infusion over 30 minutes. While it is rare that patients report symptoms of envenomation lasting weeks or months following a bite, there are case reports from the 1990s in which antivenom was reported to be effective in the relief of chronic symptoms when administered weeks or <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> bite, however, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, it is administered within 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Theo Paphitis {{announced}} that he was stepping down as chairman of the club with Jeff Burnige to replace him from May 2005. At the end of the 2004–05 season, manager Dennis Wise {{announced that}} he was leaving as he was unable to form a working relationship with the new chairman. Former Millwall striker Steve Claridge was announced as the new player-manager of Millwall. However, when Burnige then stepped down just two months after taking up the post, it was announced on 27 July that Claridge had been sacked after just 36 days, without ever taking charge of the team in a competitive match. Former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Colin Lee replaced him but lasted only five months in charge of the club. On 21 December, with the club bottom of the Championship, he became the club's Director of Football and was replaced as manager by 32-year-old player Dave Tuttle, on a short-term contract {{until the end of the}} 2005–06 season. Tuttle had no prior experience in football management. In February 2006, Lee left the club altogether. Millwall experienced a difficult season, having had four managers in 2005. Their 13 goals scored at home was the second worst in Football League history. Their relegation to League One was confirmed on 17 April 2006 with a 2–0 loss against Southampton. In the closed season Nigel Spackman was appointed as the new manager, but he lasted only four <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> string of bad results. In September 2006, Theo Paphitis (chairman from 1997 to 2005) ended his nine-year association with the club after a year-long spell as a non-executive director. On 19 March 2007, Willie Donachie signed a two-year contract following some progress which had seen the club climb to 11th place in the league. Before Donachie took charge, Millwall had taken only six points from their first ten games. In the 2007–08 season Millwall sat bottom of the table at the beginning of October. Donachie was sacked on 8 October, with Richard Shaw and Colin West becoming caretaker managers.|$|E

5|$|Stratus' second {{reign as}} {{champion}} {{came to an}} end on June 23, when she was defeated at King of the Ring by Molly Holly. The two Divas continued their storyline feud for the next three <b>months.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> failed attempt to win the title in July, Stratus won the championship back at Unforgiven. While feuding with Holly, Stratus was also involved in an angle with new Diva Victoria, who held a storyline grudge against Stratus, claiming she was betrayed by Stratus when they both worked as fitness models. The two competed in several title matches, with Stratus retaining until Survivor Series, where Victoria won the title in a Hardcore match. On March 17, 2003, Victoria and Steven Richards defeated Jazz and Stratus in a tag team match when Jazz walked out on Stratus. After the match, Jeff Hardy saved Stratus from an attack by Victoria and Richards and then kissed her, resulting in Stratus becoming Hardy's on-screen girlfriend once more. The two would talk and kiss backstage, compete as an intergender tag team, and come to each other's aid when in danger during singles competition. At no point was their previous relationship acknowledged. The storyline was suddenly dropped when WWE released Hardy in April. This marked the second time in two years that a romance between Stratus and Hardy was abruptly scrapped due to a setback in one of their personal lives. In neither instance did the angle fully play out or reach a conclusion.|$|E
