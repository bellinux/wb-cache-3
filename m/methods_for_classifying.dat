40|$|The {{soft-shell clam}} species Mya arenaria {{is a common}} model {{organism}} in leukemia research. Currently, the typical <b>method</b> <b>for</b> <b>classifying</b> leukemic from non-leukemic specimens is based on visualization of cell concentration and morphology through light microscopy. This approach is highly qualitative, which makes identification of pre-leukemic and semi-leukemic specimens difficult. One more quantitative approach uses flow cytometry to measure levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) expression. In certain human tissues, such as breast tissue, high ALDH expression is a marker for identifying cancer stem cells. The enzyme assay ALDEFLUOR® can actively measure aldehyde dehydrogenase expression in viable cells, but the effectiveness of certain protocol conditions is dependent upon the cell type. This project finds the ideal protocol conditions for the ALDEFLUOR® enzyme assay as an alternative <b>method</b> <b>for</b> <b>classifying</b> M. arenaria specimens.
