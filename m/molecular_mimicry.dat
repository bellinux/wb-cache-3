5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or host. In its broadest sense, it could include various types of exploitation, as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms of exploitation involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian mimicry (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. The metaphor of a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the caveat that mimics are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up as and imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive mimics, nor would a human angler. Treated separately is <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry,</b> which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E
5|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (self-antigen), and mounts an immune response against them. Since these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, will naturally always exist in the body, the attacks against them can get stronger over time (akin to secondary immune response). Moreover, many organisms exhibit <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry,</b> which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies will attack the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} will react against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E

Independent studies by a group in Germany have reached similar conclusions.|$|R
40|$|During development, the {{formation}} and remodeling of primary vascular networks occurs by vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Recently, the term “vasculogenic mimicry” {{has been used by}} our laboratory and collaborators to reflect the embryonic-like ability of aggressive, but not nonaggressive, melanoma tumor cells to form a pattern of matrix-rich networks (containing channels) surrounding spheroids of tumor cells in three-dimensional culture, concomitant with their expression of vascular cell markers. Ovarian cancer is usually diagnosed as advanced stage disease in most patients when widespread metastases have already been established within the peritoneal cavity. In this study, we explored whether invasive ovarian carcinoma cells could engage in <b>molecular</b> vasculogenic <b>mimicry</b> reflected by their plasticity, compared with their normal cell counterparts. The data revealed that the invasive ovarian cancer cells, but not normal ovarian surface epithelial cells, formed patterned networks containing solid and hollow matrix channels when grown in three-dimensional cultures containing Matrigel or type I collagen, in the absence of endothelial cells or fibroblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) - 1, - 2, and - 9, and MT 1 -MMP were discretely localized to these networks, and {{the formation}} of the networks was inhibited by treatment with MMP inhibitors. Furthermore, the RNase protection assay revealed the expression of multiple vascular cell-associated markers by the invasive ovarian cancer cells. In patient tumor sections from high-stage, high-grade ovarian cancers, 7 to 10 % of channels containing red blood cells were lined by tumor cells. By comparison, all vascular areas in benign tumors and low-stage cancers were endothelial lined. These results may offer new insights and molecular markers for consideration in ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies based on <b>molecular</b> vascular <b>mimicry</b> by aggressive tumor cells...|$|R

Besides, M. iowe (MI) is an emerging pathogen in turkeys, but of little concern for chickens. Mycoplasmas are bacteria that lack cell wall and belong to the class Mollicutes. Although they have been considered extracellular agents, scientists admit nowadays that some of them are obligatory intracellular microorganisms, whereas all other mycoplasmas are considered facultative intracellular organisms. Their pathogenic mechanism for disease include adherence to host target cells, mediation of apoptosis, innocent bystander damage to host cell due to intimate membrane contact, <b>molecular</b> (antigen) <b>mimicry</b> that may lead to tolerance, and mitotic effect for B and/or T lymphocytes, which could lead to suppressed T-cell function and/or production of cytotoxic T cell...|$|R
5|$|Various {{antibodies}} {{directed at}} nerve cells {{have been reported}} in Guillain–Barré syndrome. In the axonal subtype, these antibodies have been shown to bind to gangliosides, a group of substances found in peripheral nerves. A ganglioside is a molecule consisting of ceramide bound to a small group of hexose-type sugars and containing various numbers of N-acetylneuraminic acid groups. The key four gangliosides against which antibodies have been described are GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b, with different anti-ganglioside antibodies being associated with particular features; for instance, GQ1b antibodies have been linked with Miller Fisher variant GBS and related forms including Bickerstaff encephalitis. The production of these antibodies after an infection is probably the result of <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry,</b> where the immune system is reacting to microbial substances but the resultant antibodies also react with substances occurring naturally in the body. After a Campylobacter infection, the body produces antibodies of the IgA class; only a small proportion of people also produce IgG antibodies against bacterial substance cell wall substances (e.g. lipooligosaccharides) that crossreact with human nerve cell gangliosides. It is not currently known how this process escapes central tolerance to gangliosides, which is meant to suppress the production of antibodies against the body's own substances. Not all antiganglioside antibodies cause disease, and it has recently been suggested that some antibodies bind to more than one type of epitope simultaneously (heterodimeric binding) and that this determines the response. Furthermore, the development of pathogenic antibodies may depend on the presence of other strains of bacteria in the bowel.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> {{is a useful}} tool in {{understanding}} the etiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of autoimmune disorders. <b>Molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> is, however, only one mechanism by which an autoimmune disease can occur in association with a pathogen. Understanding the mechanisms of <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> may allow future research to be directed toward uncovering the initiating infectious agent as well as recognizing the self determinant.

The use of transgenic models such as those used for discovery of the mimicry events leading to diseases of the CNS and muscle disorders has helped evaluate the sequence of events leading to <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{prerequisite}} for <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> to occur is thus {{the sharing of}} the immunodominant epitope between the pathogen and the immunodominant self sequence that is generated by a cell or tissue. However, due to the amino acid variation between different proteins, <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> should not happen from a probability standpoint. Assuming five to six amino acid residues are used to induce a monoclonal antibody response, the probability of 20 amino acids occurring in six identical residues between two proteins is 1 in 206 or 1 in 64,000,000. However, there has been evidence shown and documented of many <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> events.|$|E
40|$|Chemokines play {{a central}} role in immune and {{inflammatory}} responses. It has been observed recently that certain viruses have evolved <b>molecular</b> piracy and <b>mimicry</b> mechanisms by encoding and synthesizing proteins that interfere with the normal host defense response. One such viral protein, vMIP-II, encoded by human herpesvirus 8, has been identified with in vitro antagonistic activities against CC and CXC chemokine receptors. We report here that vMIP-II has additional antagonistic activity against CX 3 CR 1, the receptor for fractalkine. To investigate the potential therapeutic effect of this broad-spectrum chemokine antagonist, we studied the antiinflammatory activity of vMIP-II in a rat model of experimental glomerulonephritis induced by an antiglomerular basement membrane antibody. vMIP-II potently inhibited monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 –, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 �–, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) -, and fractalkine-induced chemotaxis of activated leukocytes isolated from nephritic glomeruli, significantly reduced leukocyte infiltration to the glomeruli, and markedly attenuated proteinuria. These results suggest that molecules encoded by some viruses may serve as useful templates for the development of antiinflammatory compounds.

Moreover, mycoplasma ability to stimulate macrophages, monocytes, T-helper cells and NK cells, results in the production of substances, such as tumor necrosing factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL- 1, 2, 6) and interferon (a, b, g). The major clinical signs seen in avian mycoplasmosis are coughing, sneezing, snicks, respiratory rales, ocular and nasal discharge, decreased feed intake and egg production, increased mortality, poor hatchability, and, primarily in turkeys, swelling of the infraorbital sinus(es). Nevertheless, chronic and unapparent infections are most common and more threatening. Mycoplasmas are transmitted horizontally, from bird to bird, and vertically, from dam to offspring through the eggs. Losses attributed to mycoplasmosis, mainly MG and MS infections, result from decreased egg production and egg quality, poor hatchability (high rate of embryonic mortality and culling of day-old birds), poor feed efficiency, increase in mortality and carcass condemnations, besides medication costs. Mycoplasmas are diagnosed by serologic tests, culture and PCR and are sensitive to antimicrobials whose action sites are other than the bacterial cell wall, such as tetracyclines, macrolides, quinolones and tiamulin. However, mycoplasma control is more efficiently achieved by acquisition of birds free of MG, MS, MM and/or MI, vaccination of layers, and monitoring of breeder flocks, followed by elimination of the infected flocks that are detected...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} Legionella pneumophila to proliferate within various {{protozoa}} in the aquatic environment and in macrophages indicates a remarkable evolution and microbial exploitation of evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic processes. Ankyrin B (AnkB) of L. pneumophila is a non-canonical F-box-containing protein, {{and is the}} only known Dot/Icm-translocated effector of L. pneumophila essential for intra-vacuolar proliferation within both macrophages and protozoan hosts. We show that the F-box domain of AnkB and the (9) L(10) P conserved residues are essential for intracellular bacterial proliferation and for rapid acquisition of polyubiquitinated proteins by the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) within macrophages, Dictyostelium discoideum, and Acanthamoeba. Interestingly, translocation of AnkB and recruitment of polyubiquitinated proteins in macrophages and Acanthamoeba is rapidly triggered by extracellular bacteria within 5 min of bacterial attachment. Ectopically expressed AnkB within mammalian cells is localized to the periphery of the cell where it co-localizes with host SKP 1 and recruits polyubiquitinated proteins, which results in restoration of intracellular growth to the ankB mutant similar to the parental strain. While an ectopically expressed AnkB-(9) L(10) P/AA variant is localized to the cell periphery, it does not recruit polyubiquitinated proteins and fails to trans-rescue the ankB mutant intracellular growth defect. Direct in vivo interaction of AnkB but not the AnkB-(9) L(10) P/AA variant with the host SKP 1 is demonstrated. Importantly, RNAi-mediated silencing of expression of SKP 1 renders the cells non-permissive for intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila. The role of AnkB in exploitation of the polyubiquitination machinery is essential for intrapulmonary bacterial proliferation in the mouse model of Legionnaires' disease. Therefore, AnkB exhibits a novel <b>molecular</b> and functional <b>mimicry</b> of eukaryotic F-box proteins that exploits conserved polyubiquitination machinery for intracellular proliferation within evolutionarily distant hosts...|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of antibody production in Sjögren's syndrome {{is not fully}} understood, but apoptosis (programmed cell death) and <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> may play a role. The Ro and La antigens are expressed {{on the surface of}} cells undergoing apoptosis and may cause the inflammation within the salivary gland by interaction with cells of the immune system. The antibodies may also be produced through <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry,</b> where cross reactive antibodies bind to both virus and human proteins. This may occur with one of the antigens, Ro or La, and may subsequently produce antibodies to other proteins through a process known as epitope spreading. The retroviral gag protein shows similarity to the La protein and is proposed as a possible example for <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> in Sjögren's syndrome.|$|E

40|$|The pathogenesis, {{diagnosis}} and therapy of sarcoidosis as an autonomous disease are subjects of spirited discussions, which haven’t found definitive conclusion yet. Distinguishing between sarcoidosis and sarcoid-like reactions (sarcoid - type granulomas) is not currently a medical “gold standard” {{and is not}} implemented in clinical practice. This leads to 1) misinterpretation of numerous available data; 2) difficulty {{in the interpretation of}} other unverified data, which is often followed by 3) inappropriate or inadequate therapeutic approach. Similarly to many other diseases, in sarcoidosis and sarcoid - types of reactions the concept of personalised approach and therapy should also be introduced. This methodology of clinical guidance is difficult, complex and not always achievable in the current medical status and relations (doctor-patient relationship; financial factor; time factor). It is appropriate to note that in some cases the guidelines or the so-called standards are neglected or not possible to put into practice with the aim of better therapeutic practices and strategies, as well as the achievement of optimal final clinical results (especially in patients with sarcoid granulomas). The sarcoid granuloma, even when it is sterile, should not be considered as the equivalent of sarcoidosis, i. e., sarcoidosis as an autonomous disease. Sure enough, exactly because of this fact, the personalised approach should not be an exception, but it has to gradually become a rule in medical practice. When clinical decisions are conformed to some of the latest modern concepts, officialised in the international databases, often the achieved results can be much better. We present a patient with a tattoo of AC Milan (1899) on his right arm, who subsequently developed localised sterile sarcoid granulomas {{in the area of the}} tattoo. Later the process became generalised on his whole body’s skin, lungs and lymph nodes. It is unclear for the moment whether this condition should be interpreted as sarcoidosis as an autonomous disease or, instead, as a sarcoidal type of reaction with subsequent generalisation due to cross-reactivity against antigens present in other tissues with similarities to the exogenous pigments. Following the modern concepts regarding the pathogenesis of these two conditions, we introduced, in this case, an innovative, non-standard approach: 1) systemic and local immunosuppressive therapy, combined with 2) recommеndation for immediate surgical excision of the tattoo to remove the possible trigger of <b>molecular</b> and antigen <b>mimicry...</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{are ways}} in which {{autoimmunity}} caused by <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> can be avoided. Control of the initiating factor (pathogen) via vaccination {{seems to be the}} most common method to avoid autoimmunity. Inducing tolerance to the host autoantigen in this way may also be the most stable factor. The development of a downregulating immune response to the shared epitope between pathogen and host may be the best way of treating an autoimmune disease caused by <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry.</b> Alternatively, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as ciclosporin and azathioprine has also been used as a possible solution. However, in many cases this {{has been shown to be}} ineffective because cells and tissues have already been destroyed at the onset of the infection.|$|E
25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} {{can also}} be produced through infection via a mechanism known as <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry.</b> Upon exposure to pneumococcal polysaccharides, cross reactive antibodies between dsDNA and pneumococcal polysaccharides are produced in lupus.

25|$|Viral proteins, engulfed molecules, or {{degraded}} self-structures may initiate autoimmunity by <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> {{and increase}} the chances of SS development.

Damaged self-structures targeted for apoptosis may be mistakenly exposed to the immune system, triggering autoimmunity in exocrine glands which are often prone to autoimmune responses.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{dissimilar}} {{sequence homology}} {{between self and}} foreign peptide, weak electrostatic interactions between foreign peptide and the MHC can also mimic self peptide to elicit an autoimmune response within the host. For example, charged residues can explain the enhanced on-rate and reduced off-rate of a particular antigen or can contribute to a higher affinity and activity for a particular antigen that can perhaps mimic that of the host. Similarly, prominent ridges {{on the floor of}} peptide-binding grooves can do such things as create C-terminal bulges in particular peptides that can greatly increase the interaction between foreign and self peptide on the MHC. Similarly, there has been evidence that even gross features such as acidic/basic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions have allowed foreign peptides to interact with an antibody or MHC and TCR. It is now apparent that sequence similarity considerations are not sufficient when evaluating potential mimic epitopes and the underlying mechanisms of <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry.</b> <b>Molecular</b> <b>mimicry,</b> from these examples, has therefore been shown to occur {{in the absence of any}} true sequence homology.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} evidence for mimicking events caused not only by amino acid similarities but also in similarities in binding motifs to the MHC. <b>Molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> is thus occurring between two recognized peptides that have similar antigenic surfaces {{in the absence of}} primary sequence homology. For example, specific single amino acid residues such as cysteine (creates di-sulfide bonds), arginine or lysine (form multiple hydrogen bonds), could be essential for T cell cross-reactivity. These single residues may be the only residues conserved between self and foreign antigen that allow the structurally similar but sequence non-specific peptides to bind to the MHC.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} which epitopes are shared between pathogen and self, large protein databases are used. The largest protein database in the world, {{known as the}} UniProt database (formerly SwissProt), has shown reports of <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> becoming more common with expansion of the database. The database currently contains 1.5 X 107 residues. The probability of finding a perfect match with a motif of 5 amino acids in length is 1 in 3.7 X 10−7 (0.055). Therefore, within the SwissProt database, {{one would expect to}} find 1.5 X 107 X 3.7 X 10−7 = 5 matches. However, there are sequence motifs within the database that are overrepresented and are found more than 5 times. For example, the QKRAA sequence is an amino acid motif in the third hypervariable region of HLA-DRB1*0401. This motif is also expressed on numerous other proteins, such as on gp110 of the Epstein-Barr virus and in E. coli. This motif occurs 37 times in the database. This would suggest that the linear amino acid sequence may not be an underlying cause of <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> since it can be found numerous times within the database. The possibility exists, then, for variability within amino acid sequence, but similarity in three-dimensional structure between two peptides can be recognized by T cell clones. This, therefore, uncovers a flaw of such large databases. They may be able to give a hint to relationships between epitopes, but the important three-dimensional structure cannot yet be searched for in such a database.|$|E
25|$|Anti-nuclear {{ribonucleoprotein}} (anti-nRNP) antibodies, {{also known}} as anti-U1-RNP antibodies, are found in 30–40% of SLE. They are often found with anti-Sm antibodies, {{but they may be}} associated with different clinical associations. In addition to SLE, these antibodies are highly associated with mixed connective tissue disease. Anti-nRNP antibodies recognise the A and C core units of the snRNPs and because of this they primarily bind to the U1-snRNP. The immune response to RNP may be caused by the presentation of the nuclear components on the cell membrane in apoptotic blebs. <b>Molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> has also been suggested as a possible mechanism for the production of antibodies to these proteins because of similarity between U1-RNP polypeptides and Epstein-Barr virus polypeptides.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Smith (Anti-Sm) {{antibodies}} are a {{very specific}} marker for SLE. Approximately 99% of individuals without SLE lack anti-Sm antibodies, but only 20% of people with SLE have the antibodies. They are associated with central nervous system involvement, kidney disease, lung fibrosis and pericarditis in SLE, {{but they are not}} associated with disease activity. The antigens of the anti-Sm antibodies are the core units of the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), termed A to G, and will bind to the U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs. Most commonly, the antibodies are specific for the B, B' and D units. Molecular and epidemiological studies suggest that anti-Sm antibodies may be induced by <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> because the protein shows some similarity to Epstein-Barr virus proteins.|$|E
25|$|The HIV-1 {{virus has}} been shown to cause {{diseases}} of the central nervous system (CNS) in humans through a <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> apparatus. HIV-1 gp41 is used to bind chemokines on the cell surface of the host so that the virion may gain entrance into the host. Astrocytes are cells of the CNS which are used to regulate the concentrations of K+ and neurotransmitter which enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to contribute to the blood brain barrier. A twelve amino acid sequence (Leu-Gly-Ile-Trp-Gly-Cys-Ser-Gly-Lys-Leu-Ile-Cys) on gp41 of the HIV-1 virus (immunodominant region) shows sequence homology with a twelve amino acid protein on the surface of human astrocytes. Antibodies are produced for the HIV-1 gp41 protein. These antibodies can cross-react with astrocytes within human CNS tissue and act as autoantibodies. This contributes to many CNS complications found in AIDS patients.|$|E
25|$|Epitope spreading, {{also known}} as {{determinant}} spreading, is another common way in which autoimmunity can occur which uses the <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> mechanism. Autoreactive T cells are activated de novo by self epitopes released secondary to pathogen-specific T cell-mediated bystander damage. T cell responses to progressively less dominant epitopes are activated {{as a consequence of}} the release of other antigens secondary to the destruction of the pathogen with a homologous immunodominant sequence. Thus, inflammatory responses induced by specific pathogens that trigger pro-inflammatory Th1 responses have the ability to persist in genetically susceptible hosts. This may lead to organ-specific autoimmune disease. Conversely, epitope spreading could be due to target antigens being physically linked intracellularly as members of a complex to self antigen. The result of this is an autoimmune response that is triggered by exogenous antigen that progresses to a truly autoimmune response against mimicked self antigen and other antigens. From these examples, it is clear that the search for candidate mimic epitopes must extend beyond the immunodominant epitopes of a given autoimmune response.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>Mimicry</b> – An {{exogenous}} antigen may share structural similarities {{with certain}} host antigens; thus, any antibody produced against this antigen (which mimics the self-antigens) can also, in theory, bind {{to the host}} antigens, and amplify the immune response.

Although rheumatic fever has been attributed to <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> for half a century no antigen has been formally identified (if anything too many have been proposed). Moreover, the complex tissue distribution of the disease (heart, joint, skin, basal ganglia) argues against [...] a cardiac specific antigen. It remains entirely possible that the disease is due to e.g. an unusual interaction between immune complexes, complement components and endothelium.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> {{is defined}} as the {{theoretical}} possibility that sequence similarities between foreign and self-peptides are sufficient to result in the cross-activation of autoreactive T or B cells by pathogen-derived peptides.

2500|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> {{occurs when}} epitopes are shared between host antigens and Streptococcus antigens. This causes an {{autoimmune}} reaction against native tissues {{in the heart}} that are incorrectly recognized as [...] "foreign" [...] due to the cross-reactivity of antibodies generated {{as a result of}} epitope sharing. The valvular endothelium is a prominent site of lymphocyte-induced damage. CD4+ T cells are the major effectors of heart tissue autoimmune reactions in RHD. Normally, T cell activation is triggered by the presentation of bacterial antigens. [...] In RHD, <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> results in incorrect T cell activation, and these T lymphocytes can go on to activate B cells, which will begin to produce self-antigen-specific antibodies. [...] This leads to an immune response attack mounted against tissues in the heart that have been misidentified as pathogens. [...] Rheumatic valves display increased expression of VCAM-1, a protein that mediates the adhesion of lymphocytes. Self-antigen-specific antibodies generated via <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> between human proteins and streptococcal antigens up-regulate VCAM-1 after binding to the valvular endothelium. [...] This leads to the inflammation and valve scarring observed in rheumatic valvulitis, mainly due to CD4+ T cell infiltration.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> {{has been}} {{characterized}} {{as recently as the}} 1970s as another mechanism by which a pathogen can generate autoimmunity. <b>Molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> is defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products. Either the linear amino acid sequence or the conformational fit of the immunodominant epitope may be shared between the pathogen and host. This is also known as [...] "cross-reactivity" [...] between self antigen of the host and immunodominant epitopes of the pathogen. An autoimmune response is then generated against the epitope. Due to similar sequence homology in the epitope between the pathogen and the host, cells and tissues of the host associated with the protein are destroyed {{as a result of the}} autoimmune response.|$|E
2500|$|Theiler's murine {{encephalomyelitis}} virus (TMEV) {{leads to}} the development in mice of a progressive CD4+ T cell-mediated response after these cells have infiltrated the CNS. This virus {{has been shown to}} cause CNS disease in [...] mice that resembles multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease in humans that results in the gradual destruction of the myelin sheath coating axons of the CNS. The TMEV mouse virus shares a thirteen amino acid sequence (His-Cys-Leu-Gly-Lys-Trp-Leu-Gly-His-Pro-Asp-Lys-Phe) (PLP (proteolipid protein) 139-151 epitope) with that of a human myelin-specific epitope. Bystander myelin damage is caused by virus specific Th1 cells that cross react with this self epitope. To test the efficacy in which TMEV uses <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> to its advantage, a sequence of the human myelin-specific epitope was inserted into a non-pathogenic TMEV variant. As a result, there was a CD4+ T cell response and autoimmune demyelination was initiated by infection with a TMEV peptide ligand. In humans, it has recently been shown that there are other possible targets for <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> in patients with multiple sclerosis. These involve the hepatitis B virus mimicking the human proteolipid protein (myelin protein) and the Epstein-Barr virus mimicking anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (contributes to a ring of myelin around blood vessels).|$|E
2500|$|Microbial superantigens are {{molecules}} {{expressed by}} bacteria and other microorganisms {{that have the}} power to stimulate a strong immune response by activation of T-cells.

Fibrosis and scarring of valve leaflets, commissures and cusps leads to abnormalities that can result in valve stenosis or regurgitation. The inflammation caused by rheumatic fever, usually during childhood, {{is referred to as}} rheumatic valvulitis. About half of patients with rheumatic fever develop inflammation involving valvular endothelium. The majority of morbidity and mortality associated with rheumatic fever is caused by its destructive effects on cardiac valve tissue. The pathogenesis of RHD is complex and not fully understood, but it is known to involve <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry</b> and genetic predisposition that lead to autoimmune reactions.|$|E
2500|$|Rheumatic fever is a {{systemic}} disease affecting the connective tissue around arterioles, and can occur after an untreated strep throat infection, specifically due to group A streptococcus (GAS), Streptococcus pyogenes. It {{is believed to}} be caused by antibody cross-reactivity. This cross-reactivity is a type II hypersensitivity reaction and is termed <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry.</b> [...] Usually, self reactive B cells remain anergic in the periphery without T cell co-stimulation. [...] During a streptococcal infection, mature antigen-presenting cells such as B cells present the bacterial antigen to CD4+T cells which differentiate into helper T2 cells. Helper T2 cells subsequently activate the B cells to become plasma cells and induce the production of antibodies against the cell wall of Streptococcus. However the antibodies may also react against the myocardium and joints, producing the symptoms of rheumatic fever. S. pyogenes is a species of aerobic, cocci, gram-positive bacteria that are non-motile, non-spore forming, and forms chains and large colonies.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} decade the study of autoimmunity, the failure to {{recognize}} self antigens as [...] "self," [...] has grown immensely. Autoimmunity is thought by many researchers to {{be a result of}} a loss of immunological tolerance, the ability for an individual to discriminate between self and non-self, though others are beginning to think that many autoimmune diseases are due to mutations governing programmed cell death, or to environmental products that injure target tissues, thus causing a release of immunostimulatory alarm signals,. Growth in the field of autoimmunity has resulted in more and more frequent diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Consequently, recent data show that autoimmune diseases affect approximately 1 in 31 people within the general population. Growth has also led to a greater characterization of what autoimmunity is and how it can be studied and treated. With an increased amount of research, there has been tremendous growth {{in the study of the}} several different ways in which autoimmunity can occur, one of which is <b>molecular</b> <b>mimicry.</b> The mechanism by which pathogens have evolved, or obtained by chance, similar amino acid sequences or the homologous three-dimensional crystal structure of immunodominant epitopes remains a mystery.|$|E
