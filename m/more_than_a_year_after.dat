5|$|The third film {{produced}} by Union Films, Bajar dengan Djiwa featured many actors {{who had previously}} appeared in the company's works. It was released by February 1941. Advertisements emphasised the realism of the story, and reviewers praised the film's acting, romance, and humour. Screenings continued until at least 1943, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> Union was closed following the Japanese occupation.|$|E
5|$|Active {{during the}} night, Transandinomys talamancae {{lives on the}} ground and eats plants and insects. Males move more and have larger home ranges than females. It breeds {{throughout}} the year, but few individuals survive for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>After</b> a gestation period of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach sexual maturity within two months. A variety of parasites occur on this species. Widespread and common, it is of no conservation concern.|$|E

5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking {{of his childhood}} abuse {{at the hands of}} his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated {{for the first time that}} he had vitiligo.

The portraits of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair hair with a slight tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. Unlike many {{other members of the}} House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Metro's fare collection system was awarded in 1975 to Cubic Transportation Systems. Electronic fare collection using paper magnetic stripe cards started on July 1, 1977, a little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> the first stations opened. Prior to electronic fare collection, exact change fareboxes were used. Metro's historic paper farecard system is also shared by Bay Area Rapid Transit, which Cubic won a {{contract for}} in 1974. Any remaining value stored on the paper cards was printed on the card at each exit, and passes were printed with the expiration date.|$|E

5|$|Sextus Pompeius {{was the son}} of First Triumvir Pompey {{and still}} a renegade general {{following}} Julius Caesar's victory over his father. He was established in Sicily and Sardinia as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39BC. Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius, {{who was a member of}} the republican party, ironically, not the Caesarian faction. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40BC when he married Scribonia, a daughter of Lucius Scribonius Libo who was a follower of Sextus Pompeius as well as his father-in-law. Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only natural child, Julia, who was born the same day that he divorced her to marry Livia Drusilla, little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> their marriage.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger {{went into}} {{production}} in June 1964, little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> {{the completion of}} the Shelby prototype. Painted and trimmed bodies were supplied by Pressed Steel in Oxfordshire, and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America. Installing the engine required some unusual manufacturing methods, including using a sledgehammer to bash in part of the already primed and painted bulkhead to allow the engine to be slid into place. Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month, which were initially offered for sale only in North America. The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg-Warner 4-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox, until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang.|$|E
5|$|The {{street that}} runs beside Novi dvor, now {{the seat of}} the President of Serbia, was posthumously named Andrićev venac (Andrić's Crescent) in his honour. It also {{includes}} a life-size statue of the writer. The flat in which he spent his final years {{has been turned into a}} museum. The museum was opened <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> Andrić's death and houses books, manuscripts, documents, photographs and some of his personal belongings. Several of Serbia's other major cities, such as Novi Sad and Kragujevac, have streets named after him. Streets in a number of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Tuzla, and Višegrad, also carry his name.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} entered the Billboard 200 albums chart at number190, {{the week of}} September 3, 1983. The album had a slow and steady climb, and peaked at eight on the Billboard 200 on the week ending October 20, 1984, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> its release. It also peaked at twenty on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums. Within a year, Madonna had sold 2.8million copies in the United States. It placed at number seven on the year-end chart for 1984 and at number25 on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna {{becoming}} the top pop artist for the year 1985. After 17 years since its release, the album was certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of five million copies across United States. With {{the advent of the}} Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991, the album sold a further 450,000 copies as of August 2010.|$|E
5|$|Two of Rainilaiarivony's cousins {{urged him}} to take his elder brother's place in order to end the shame that Rainivoninahitriniony's {{behavior}} was bringing upon their family. After weighing the idea, Rainilaiarivony approached Rasoherina with the proposal. The queen readily consented and lent her assistance in rallying {{the support of the}} nobles at court. On 14 July 1864, little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> the coup, Rasoherina deposed and divorced Rainivoninahitriniony, then exiled the fallen minister the following year. Rainilaiarivony was promoted to Prime Minister. The arrangement was sealed when Rainilaiarivony took Rasoherina as his bride and demoted his longtime spouse Rasoanalina to the status of second wife. Rainilaiarivony confided in a friend shortly before his death that he deeply loved his first wife and came to share the same degree of feeling toward Rasoherina as well, but never developed the same affection for the subsequent queens he married. None of his royal spouses bore him any children.|$|E
5|$|Although Fillmore {{had retired}} from the {{legislature}} after the 1831 session, he did not remain absent from politics for long. In 1832, {{he ran for the}} House of Representatives, and was elected. The Anti-Masonic presidential candidate, former Attorney General William Wirt, won only Vermont as President Jackson easily gained re-election. At the time, Congress convened its annual session in December, and so Fillmore had to wait <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> his election to take his seat. Fillmore, Weed, and others had realized that opposition to Masonry was too narrow a foundation on which to build a national party, and assembled the broad-based Whig Party from National Republicans, Anti-Masons, and disaffected Democrats. The Whigs were initially united by their opposition to Jackson, but became a major party by expanding their platform to include support for economic growth through rechartering the Second Bank of the United States and federally funded internal improvements including roads, bridges, and canals. Weed joined the Whigs before Fillmore, and became a power within the party; his anti-slavery views were stronger than Fillmore's (who, though he disliked slavery, deemed the federal government without power over it), and closer to those of another prominent New York Whig, William H. Seward of Auburn, who was also seen as a Weed protégé.|$|E
