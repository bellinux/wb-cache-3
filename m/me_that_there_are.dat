500|$|The {{concert was}} {{telecast}} {{live by the}} National Broadcasting Company (NBC) {{to an audience of}} 26 million viewers. As part of its program, NBC asked Copland to talk to the television audience about Connotations. While the cameras alternated between shots of the composer and the manuscript score, Copland said, [...] "It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two things you can do when listening to any new work. The {{most important thing is to}} lend yourself—or to put it another way—try to be as sensitive as you can to the overall feeling the new piece gives off. The second way is to listen with some awareness of the general shape of the new piece, realizing that a composer works with his musical materials just as an architect works with his building materials in order to construct an edifice that makes sense." [...] He then discussed the work briefly but in some detail.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 February 2009, it was {{reported}} that Sutcliffe was [...] "fit to leave Broadmoor". On 23 March 2010, the Secretary of State for Justice, Jack Straw, was questioned by Julie Kirkbride, Conservative MP for Bromsgrove, in the House of Commons seeking reassurance for a constituent, a victim of Sutcliffe, that he would remain in prison. Straw responded that whilst the matter of Sutcliffe's release was a parole board matter, [...] "that all the evidence that I have seen on this case, and it's a great deal, suggests to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no circumstances in which this man will be released".|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{they tell}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> agents {{travelling}} about among the Highland clans, {{and that this}} time something is really to be done." ...|$|E
60|$|The Officer {{in charge}} {{informed}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> much {{need for a}} Maternity Hospital in Liverpool.|$|R
60|$|It {{seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an ugly cloud {{gathering}} {{on the political}} horizon in Natal.|$|R
60|$|And {{if anyone}} reminds <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a Socialist Party in Germany, I reply <b>that</b> <b>there</b> isn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it a shame, sir? The parson, here, {{was telling}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> villains here who attack the {{character}} of my aunt, the Baroness of Bernstein!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't imperil my {{reputation}} before I am established," [...] she answered, smiling. [...] "Afterwards {{it seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no limits to what one may not do amongst one's own set." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come now, sir," [...] said Jenny, [...] "don't tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> any girls {{or women}} so mean and selfish as to want {{aristocracy}} or rank so purchased! You are too bad, Mr. Theophilus!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a sort of}} {{something}} in her voice, a kind of thingummy, you know.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{interrupted}} Ford hastily, [...] "my predecessor, Mr. Martin, distinctly told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was,</b> and <b>that</b> it {{was with}} YOUR permission." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} my glance, and {{it seemed}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some hidden meaning in his eyes which I failed to catch.|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (Aside.) It's safest to let 'em see {{everything}} {{as they come}} across it; but 'seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> exceptions to the rule. (Aloud.) I told you {{that there was nothing}} to be gained from rearranging my table.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Jemimar, {{nothing will}} ever {{convince}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> any savages so depravated as to prefer {{a slice of}} 'uman flesh to a good beefsteak, an' it's my belief that that himperent Irishman, Larry O'Ale, inwented it all to gammon us." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} found any well-marked cases of {{ornamental}} differences between the sexes of the Homoptera. Mr. Douglas informs <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> three British species, in which the male is black or marked with black bands, whilst the females are pale-coloured or obscure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Throgton," [...] he said, [...] "it has {{occurred}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> points about <b>that</b> solution that we didn't get exactly straight somehow." ...|$|R
60|$|He clapped {{a hand on}} my {{shoulder}} as he finished, but it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more determination than hope in his voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. It {{does not}} strike <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{anything}} definite about that. I {{like to be}} stationary. But I am not particular." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Thaxter tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> several burial-places on this island; {{but nobody}} has been buried {{here since the}} Revolution. Her own {{marriage}} {{was the first one}} since that epoch, and her little Karl, now three months old, the first-born child in all those eighty years.|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] began James, in {{his most}} solemn and legal tones, [...] "is {{a view of the}} matter in which I am glad to be able to heartily coincide, {{although}} it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> several points, which I will touch on one by one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nigel!" [...] cried Sir Simon Burley, hurrying up with consternation {{upon his}} face, [...] "Aylward tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> not ten-score arrows left {{in all their}} sheaves. See! they are {{springing}} from their horses, and cutting their sollerets that they may rush upon us. Might we not even now make a retreat?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} a little strange in Mr. Marx's manner {{and the way in}} which he kept glancing towards the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. It {{does not}} strike <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any thing {{definite}} about that. I {{like to be}} stationary. But I am not particular." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{talk this}} {{over for a}} minute or two before we go. It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a curious {{omission}} in the advertisement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you fidget about me, Charlie," [...] he said. [...] "Ferrers tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{at least}} a score of Jacobites here, and that they form quite a society among themselves. Living is very cheap, and he will {{introduce}} me to a man of business, who will see that my money is well invested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! my boy," [...] I answered, [...] "I {{have lived}} long enough to learn never to leave {{anything}} behind that I can possibly carry away. Also, although not an orchidist, it occurred to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more ways of propagating a plant than from the original root, which generally won't go into one's pocket." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Heywood tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many Catholics {{among the}} lower classes in Lancashire and Cheshire,--probably the {{descendants}} of retainers of the old Catholic nobility and gentry, who are more numerous in these shires than {{in other parts of}} England. The present Lord Sefton's grandfather was the first of that race who became Protestant.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good. But it strikes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a want of harmony between your present mood of {{self-sacrifice}} and your past mood of self-preservation." ...|$|R
60|$|C. They--Betty and her set, I mean--laughed at {{and argued}} one thing after another, till they showed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no {{positive}} grounds to go on.|$|R
60|$|We all promised faithfully, Richard with a merry {{glance at}} me {{touching}} his pocket {{as if to}} remind <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no danger of OUR transgressing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Crosby {{told you}} they'd be all right," [...] said Banks; [...] "and as for ourselves, I don't {{see why we}} can't be pretty {{comfortable}} here, and all the better for our being alone. I shall take an opportunity of looking around a bit. It strikes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some resources {{in this country that}} might pay to develop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [110] Mr. Theo. D. A. Cockerell informs <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two slugs in Bermuda {{of which}} {{specimens}} {{exist in the}} British Museum,--Amalia gagates Drap. common in Europe, and Agriolimax campestris of the United States. Both may therefore have been introduced by human agency. Also Vaginulus Morelete var. schivelyæ {{which seems to be}} a variety of a Mexican species; perhaps imported.|$|E
6000|$|... "`Yes, Mrs Bland,' I continued, in {{the same}} tone, `I detest smoking. [...] You know I always did, but now more than ever, for your {{reasoning}} has [...] convinced <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some evil consequences of smoking which [...] are almost worse than smoking itself! Rest assured that never again [...] shall {{the smell of the}} noxious weed defile the walls of this house.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, sir, {{it is an}} idea of Gilmore’s. It may not {{be worth}} {{anything}} at all, but it certainly seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something in it.” ...|$|R
60|$|I hope, meanwhile, {{that you}} will agree with <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> plenty of {{geological}} matter {{to be seen and}} thought over in the neighbourhood of any town.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} recorder. [...] "In fact, two of them, {{and the last}} man {{was good enough to}} inform <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> another of you coming along." ...|$|R
