40|$|A simple, {{quantitative}} experimental model, {{offering a}} convenient and basic approach to studies of plantbacterium interactions, is proposed. This involves immobilizing a unicellular, freshwater microalga, a Chlorella species, {{serving as the}} plant, with a plant growth-promoting bacterium, an Azospirillum species, in small alginate beads to allow close interaction and to avoid external interference from bacterial contaminants. A major obstacle {{in the study of}} interactions between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the complexity of the eukaryote partner, the latter species usually of some economic importance. Studies of basic plant-bacterium interactions of Azospirillum spp., plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), done mainly with cereal roots, are difficult because there are multiple tissue functions and numerous possible interactions with plant roots and there is interference with the soil matrix. Consequently, there is a significantly greater quantity of information on the bacteria than on the interactions (5, 55, 56).

Since U speciation, and hence its toxicity, strongly depends on environmental pH, the present study aimed to investigate dose-dependent effects of U at pH 7. 5. Arabidopsis thaliana plants (<b>Mouse-ear</b> <b>Cress)</b> were exposed for three days to different U concentrations at pH 7. 5. In the roots, the increased capacities of ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase indicate an important role for the ascorbate-glutathione cycle during U-induced stress. However, a significant decrease in the ascorbate redox state was observed after exposure to 75 and 100 µM U, indicating that those roots are severely stressed. In accordance with the roots, the ascorbate-glutathione cycle {{plays an important role in}} the antioxidative defence systems in A. thaliana leaves exposed to U at pH 7. 5 as the ascorbate and glutathione biosynthesis were upregulated.

40|$|Polysaccharide transglycosylases {{catalyze}} disproportionation of polysaccharide molecules by cleaving glycosidic linkages in polysaccharide {{chains and}} transferring their cleaved portions to hydroxyl {{groups at the}} non-reducing ends of other polysaccharide or oligosaccharide molecules. In plant cell walls, transglycosylases have a potential to catalyze both cross-linking of polysaccharide molecules and grafting of newly arriving polysaccharide molecules into the cell wall structure during cell growth. Here we describe a polysaccharide microarray in form of a glycochip permitting simultaneous high-throughput monitoring of multiple transglycosylase activities in plant extracts. The glycochip, containing donor polysaccharides printed onto nitrocellulose-coated glass slides, was incubated with crude plant extracts, along {{with a series of}} fluorophore-labelled acceptor oligosaccharides. After removing unused labelled oligosaccharides by washing, fluorescence retained on the glycochip as a result of transglycosylase reaction was detected with a standard microarray scanner. The glycochip assay was used to detect transglycosylase activities in crude extracts from nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) and <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>cress</b> (Arabidopsis thaliana).
