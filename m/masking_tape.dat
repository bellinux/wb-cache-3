25|$|<b>Masking</b> <b>tape</b> is a {{pressure-sensitive}} tape made with an easy-to-tear thin paper, and fly {{back and a}} removable pressure-sensitive adhesive. In 1925, Richard G. Drew, {{an employee of the}} Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), invented the first <b>masking</b> <b>tape,</b> a two-inch-wide tan paper strip backed with a light, pressure-sensitive adhesive. Drew filed U.S. patent #1,760,820 on May 28, 1928 and was issued to him on May 27, 1930.|$|E
25|$|In art schools {{classrooms}} or studios, {{the model}} usually poses on a raised platform called the model stand or dais. In sculpture studios this platform may be built to rotate {{to allow for}} a 360° view for every artist. Long poses are generally required for painting (hours or days) and sculpture (perhaps days). To aid in resuming a long pose after a break, chalk marks and/or <b>masking</b> <b>tape</b> are often placed on the model stand.|$|E
25|$|The {{instrumental}} {{section of}} the song was recorded on March 10, 1966, at United Western Recorders, Hollywood, California, with the session engineered by Chuck Britz and produced by Brian Wilson. The instrumental part of the song took 20 takes to achieve what is the master take of the song. Present {{on the day of}} the instrumental recording was Carl on twelve-string guitar among other session musicians collectively known as The Wrecking Crew. A strip of <b>masking</b> <b>tape</b> was placed over the strings of a piano while the bottoms of two plastic orange juice bottles were used for percussion.|$|E

50|$|Removable {{adhesives}} {{are designed}} to form a temporary bond, and ideally can be removed after months or years without leaving residue on the adherend. Removable adhesives are used in applications such as surface protection films, <b>masking</b> <b>tapes,</b> bookmark and note papers, price marking labels, promotional graphics materials, and for skin contact (wound care dressings, EKG electrodes, athletic tape, analgesic and transdermal drug patches, etc.). Some removable adhesives {{are designed to}} repeatedly stick and unstick. They have low adhesion and generally cannot support much weight.|$|R
25|$|The {{company began}} by mining stone from {{quarries}} {{for use in}} grinding wheels. Struggling with quality and marketing of its products, management supported its workers to innovate and develop new products, which became its core business. Twelve years after its inception, 3M developed its first exclusive product: Three-M-ite cloth. Other innovations in this era included <b>masking</b> <b>tape,</b> waterproof sandpaper, and Scotch brand tapes. By 1929, 3M had made its first moves toward international expansion by forming Durex to conduct business in Europe. The same year, the company's stock was first traded over the counter and in 1946 listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company is currently {{a component of the}} Dow Jones Industrial Average and of the S 500.|$|E
500|$|The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M) {{was founded}} in 1902 in Two Harbors, Minnesota, and was later moved to Duluth, Saint Paul, and then Maplewood. [...] The founders of 3M got their start by {{manufacturing}} sandpaper. [...] Under the leadership of William L. McKnight, the company established product lines such as abrasives for wet sanding, <b>masking</b> <b>tape</b> and other adhesives, roofing granules, resins, and films.|$|E
500|$|On April 15, 2013, {{the day of}} the Boston Marathon bombings, Revere inscribed [...] "Pray for Boston" [...] onto a {{piece of}} <b>masking</b> <b>tape</b> and taped it to his glove, which he left sitting out while he stretched. A {{photographer}} from Getty Images photographed the glove, and Revere later commented that his phone was [...] "ringing off the hook" [...] with thanks for the gesture. Revere commented, [...] In the subsequent game, Revere made an incredible leaping, diving catch with the glove, robbing Todd Frazier of an extra base hit.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} {{technical}} faults in her {{department and the}} paperwork needed to fix it, Tanya's department has a huge clutter of unwanted junk in the office. In an effort {{to prepare for the}} VIP visit, they decide to put the junk outside temporarily. Knowing it still will remain an eyesore, Alan tells Tanya to conceal it some way, who in turn gets her crew to do so. Eventually Lim is left to handle the matter on his own. He manages to build a temporary wall, yet company incompetence in obtaing supplies leaves the wall completed half-heartedly with <b>masking</b> <b>tapes</b> used instead of nails.|$|R
2500|$|The company's late {{innovations}} include waterproof sandpaper (1921) and <b>masking</b> <b>tape</b> (1925), {{as well as}} cellophane [...] "Scotch Tape" [...] and sound-deadening {{materials for}} cars.|$|E
2500|$|The Travel Air Type R Hawks flew, was {{the fourth}} {{of a series of}} five racers and was {{configured}} for long-distance racing with longer wings and a full set of instrumentation, features that differentiated the aircraft {{from the rest of the}} series. Hawks raced [...] "Texaco 13" [...] as [...] "race No. 28" [...] in the 1930 Thompson Trophy Race at the National Air Races on September 1, 1930, using a set of [...] "racing wings", a pair of shorter wingspan wings fitted out at the factory. Hawks pulled out of the race on the third lap when the engine began to falter at full throttle. It was revealed later that a piece of <b>masking</b> <b>tape</b> placed over the gas cap (for streamlining) caused a loss of pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Anastasia [...] "Ana" [...] Steele is a 21-year-old college senior {{attending}} Washington State University in Vancouver, Washington. Her {{best friend}} is Katherine [...] "Kate" [...] Kavanagh, who writes for the college newspaper. Due to an illness, Kate is unable to interview 27-year-old Christian Grey, a successful and wealthy Seattle entrepreneur, and asks Ana to take her place. Ana finds Christian attractive as well as intimidating. As a result, she stumbles through the interview and leaves Christian's office believing it went poorly. Ana does not expect to meet Christian again, but he appears at the hardware store where she works. While he purchases various items including cable ties, <b>masking</b> <b>tape,</b> and rope, Ana informs Christian that Kate would like some photographs to illustrate her article about him. Christian gives Ana his phone number. Later, Kate urges Ana to call Christian and arrange a photo shoot with their photographer friend, José Rodriguez.|$|E
50|$|On {{the day of}} the visit, {{all goes}} well with the Ministers. Finishing with a photoshoot, the group decides {{to stand in front of}} the wall, when it {{unfortunately}} gives way due pressure on the section which <b>masking</b> <b>tapes</b> was used. An investigation is carried out, and 'finger-pointing' is done to find the scapegoat, in which Lim is blamed. As a result, his bonus is cut, and Lim stems his anger toward Tanya. Their confrontation leads into a car chase in which he chases Tanya's 1998 Seat Toledo in his Citroën Berlingo until the vehicles collide, causing both to run off the flyover and fall down to the beach.|$|R

2500|$|As {{an initial}} {{response}} to the invasion, Truman called for a naval blockade of North Korea, and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only [...] "on paper", since the U.S. Navy {{no longer had the}} warships with which to carry out his request. Army officials, desperate for weaponry, recovered Sherman tanks from World War II Pacific battlefields and reconditioned them for shipment to Korea. Army Ordnance officials at Fort Knox pulled down M26 Pershing tanks from display pedestals around Fort Knox in order to equip the third company of the Army's hastily formed 70th Tank Battalion. Without adequate numbers of tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, the Air Force took F-51 (P-51) propeller-driven aircraft out of storage or from existing Air National Guard squadrons, and rushed them into front-line service. A shortage of spare parts and qualified maintenance personnel resulted in improvised repairs and overhauls. A Navy helicopter pilot aboard an active duty warship recalled fixing damaged rotor blades with <b>masking</b> <b>tape</b> in the absence of spares.|$|E
2500|$|Duterte has {{justified}} {{the drug war}} by claiming that the Philippines was becoming a [...] "narco-state". According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the prevalence of {{drug use in the}} country is lower than the global average. Duterte has dismissed human rights concerns by dehumanizing drug users, stating in August 2016: [...] "Crime against humanity? In the first place, I'd like to be frank with you. Are they humans? What is your definition of a human being?" [...] In {{the first three months of}} Duterte's term in office, according to police figures, over 3,000 killings were attributed to his nationwide anti-drug campaign. More than half were attributed to vigilantes. At the beginning of October, a senior police officer told The Guardian that 10 [...] "special ops" [...] official police death squads had been operating, and that he had personally been involved in killing 87 suspects. He described how the corpses were dumped at the roadside ("salvage" [...] victims), or had their heads wrapped in <b>masking</b> <b>tape</b> with a cardboard placard labelling them as a drug offender, so that the killing would not be investigated. The chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, Chito Gascon, was quoted in the report: [...] "I am not surprised, I have heard of this." [...] The Philippine National Police declined to comment. The report stated: [...] "although the Guardian can verify the policeman's rank and his service history, there is no independent, official confirmation for the allegations of state complicity and police coordination in mass murder." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} eight release agent {{solutions}} and emulsions for {{pressure sensitive adhesive}} tapes have been developed. They offer the following unmatched features: water base with no residual solvent, two levels of release, high total solids, dilutable either with water, or acetone (VOC-exempt) and alcohols for fast drying, low-noise unwind, patented urethane technology and cost effectiveness. They provide efficient release from high tack and high adhesion hot-melt PSA’s based on block copolymers used in BOPP-backed packaging tapes, filament tapes and diaper tapes. They are also effective with natural rubber and SBR base PSA’s used in <b>masking</b> <b>tapes</b> and most acrylic PSA’s used in film and cloth-backed tapes. Coater-ready solutions or emulsions are prepared by simply mixing with a diluent, applying on a backing by a conventional coating technique and drying; no curing is involved. Acetone, or acetone-water mixtures, are the choice diluents for coating and printing lines with no solvent recovering capability, or for ones with insufficient capacity for drying water base coatings, since they are fast drying, VOC-free and relatively benign to human health...|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a masking method generally and, more particularly to {{a method of}} masking perforated titanium sheets having laminar control suction strips. As illustrated in the drawings, a nonaerodynamic surface of a perforated sheet has alternating suction strip areas and bonding land areas. Suction strip tapes overlie the bonding land areas during application of a masking material to an upper surface of the suction strip tapes. Prior to bonding the perforated sheet to a composite structure, the bonding land tapes are removed. The entire opposite aerodynamic surface is <b>masked</b> with <b>tape</b> before bonding. This invention provides a precise control of suction strip porosities by ensuring that no chemicals penetrate the suction strip areas during bonding...|$|R
50|$|Glochidia may be {{difficult}} to remove. Yanking out the bristles may result in leaving one or more 20-30 micrometre sized barbs in the skin, later to be manifest by granuloma formation. Attempts to suck out the glochidia are likely to result in their attachment to the tongue. Popular methods of removing glochidia have included spreading adhesive plaster over the area and ripping it off quickly or using melted wax (hot wax sometimes employed for removing hair). Martinez et al. studied various methods of removing glochidia from rabbit skin. They evaluated tweezers, glue, facial <b>mask,</b> adhesive <b>tape,</b> package-sealing tape, and tweezing followed by glue. The most effective single method was tweezing, which removed 76% of the spines. The method using a thin layer of household glue (Elmer's Glue-All, Borden Inc) covered with gauze, allowed to dry (about 30 minutes) and then peeled off resulted in removal of 63% of the spines. Facial <b>mask</b> and adhesive <b>tapes</b> removed about 40% and 30% of the spines, respectively, and produced more retention and inflammation three days after removal than no treatment. Repeated applications of adhesive tape did not improve the results. According to Martinez, the most effective method is to first use tweezers to remove clumps of spines followed by the application and removal of household glue, resulting in removal of 95% of the spines.|$|R
