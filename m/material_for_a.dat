5|$|Barely Real is the 1992 {{extended}} play (EP) by the American indie {{rock band}} Codeine. After releasing their previous album Frigid Stars LP in 1990, the group accepted {{an invitation from}} the quartet Bastro to tour in Europe in 1991. Following the tour the group was invited to record a single for Sub Pop Singles Club and attempted to record their follow-up album The White Birch in 1992. The recording sessions proved to be disastrous for the group since it found themselves often with unusable tracks over several different studios. As Codeine could not record enough <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> full-length album, they decided to release what tracks they had as an EP.|$|E
5|$|Carson rose {{within the}} Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 {{becoming}} chief editor of publications. Though her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson {{was working on}} <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second book, and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several years}} of {{relative}} inactivity as the band maintained their relaxed touring pace, Perry began writing <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new Daddies album in early 2006, claiming to {{have come to the}} realization of a cathartic reliance on songwriting. In an April 2006 radio interview, he confirmed that the band was in preparation over recording a new studio album, noting that the music would cover new territory for the Daddies, drawing heavily on tropical themes. This was followed shortly thereafter by the band's first U.S. tour since 2000, where much of this new material was debuted.|$|E

5|$|In August 1912 Harriet Monroe hired Pound as {{a regular}} {{contributor}} to Poetry. He submitted his own poems, as well as poems by James Joyce, Robert Frost, D. H. Lawrence, Yeats, H.D. and Aldington, and collected <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 64-page anthology, Des Imagistes (1914). The Imagist movement began to attract attention from critics. In November 1913 Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, rented Stone Cottage in Coleman's Hatch, Sussex, and invited Pound to accompany him as his secretary. They stayed there for 10 weeks, reading and writing, walking in the woods and fencing. It was the first of three winters they spent together at Stone Cottage, including two with Dorothy after she and Pound married on 20 April 1914.|$|E

5|$|Live at the BBC, {{the first}} {{official}} release of unissued Beatles performances in seventeen years, appeared in 1994. That same year McCartney, Harrison and Starr collaborated on the Anthology project. Anthology {{was the culmination of}} work begun in 1970, when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall, their former road manager and personal assistant, had started to gather <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> documentary with the working title The Long and Winding Road. Documenting their history in the band's own words, the Anthology project included the release of several unissued Beatles recordings. McCartney, Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to two songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|On 28 January 2011, Michael Paget {{stated that}} the group had already drawn {{proportions}} for the next studio album and will sound a lot like Fever. He followed-along with stating that the band plans to have the songs for it written within 2011 and will begin recording the album {{by the end of}} the year. A couple tracks left from the Fever sessions might be re-done, re-arranged and re-recorded for the new record. The band played at Uproar Festival 2011, after which they began writing <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fourth studio album.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> double album.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Redding's departure, Hendrix began lodging at the eight-bedroom Ashokan House, in {{the hamlet}} of Boiceville near Woodstock in upstate New York, {{where he had}} spent some time vacationing in mid-1969. Manager Michael Jeffery {{arranged}} the accommodations {{in the hope that}} the respite might encourage Hendrix to write <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new album. During this time, Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery, which included Hendrix's first appearance on U.S. TV—on The Dick Cavett Show—where he was backed by the studio orchestra, and an appearance on The Tonight Show where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy.|$|E

5|$|The group's {{previous}} album, The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other (February 1970) {{had achieved}} {{a small amount}} of commercial success and critical acclaim in the UK and Europe. The next project the group attempted was recording the soundtrack to the 1970 film Eyewitness, but it was rejected, largely for being too sinister. They started to develop a live following during 1970, counting film director Anthony Minghella as one of their fans, but things backfired after a show at the Royal Festival Hall in June that drew negative reviews from Melody Makers Chris Welch. Around this time, the band decided to write some new <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> follow-up album.|$|E
5|$|The travel writer Paul Theroux {{mentions}} the dinosaurs in his 1989 novel My Secret History. The novel's narrator, Andre Parent, accidentally learns of his wife's infidelity when his young son, Jack, reveals {{that he has}} visited the dinosaurs {{in the company of}} his mother's 'friend' during Andre's prolonged absence gathering <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> travel book. The title story in Penelope Lively's 1991 novel Fanny and the Monsters is about a Victorian girl who visits the Crystal Palace dinosaurs and becomes fascinated by prehistoric creatures. The Lie Tree, a 2015 children's mystery-fantasy by Frances Hardinge features a dream scene with some of the dinosaur models coming to life.|$|E

On 16 December 1983, Townshend announced at a press conference that he was leaving the Who, effectively ending the band.|$|E

5|$|All That Is Within Me is {{the fifth}} studio album by American Christian rock band MercyMe. Produced by Brown Bannister, it was {{released}} on November 20, 2007 through INO Records. The album, intended by the band to be a worship album split between covers and original songs, was recorded following the band's tour with Audio Adrenaline in promotion of their previous studio album Coming Up to Breathe (2006). Although the band intended to write <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new album during the tour, they had only written one song {{by the time they}} entered their recording studio, Cider Mountain Studio in Athol, Idaho. The band wrote so many songs at the studio that they decided not to include any cover songs; all of the songs on the album but were written or co-written by the band. The album was described as being a rock and worship album, being aimed directly at a Christian audience.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1988, the band started rehearsing <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new album with producer André Jacquemin, who had worked on all the Monty Python’s records. The album Take a Bite was published by GWR in October 1988 and follows in the steps of Nightmare at Maple Cross, presenting powerful and melodic metal songs, tinged with the humour typical of the band. To promote the album, Girlschool did a UK tour with Gary Glitter, followed by a North American tour. In 1989, they travelled across Europe with Dio and to the Soviet Union with Black Sabbath, {{till the end of}} the year. After their return from Russia, GWR did not renew their contract and the band practically broke up. Musical tastes were changing worldwide in favour of grunge and more extreme metal genres, compelling most acts originated from the new wave of British heavy metal to disband or to reduce their activities, and the same thing happened to Girlschool.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new album, {{tentatively}} titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands.|$|E

5|$|Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) is {{the third}} studio album by American metal band Slipknot. The album was {{released}} on May 25, 2004, by Roadrunner Records, and a special edition, containing a bonus disc, was released on April 12, 2005. It is the band's only album produced by Rick Rubin, and also the only one not to feature any profanity. Following the band's tour to promote its second album in 2002, speculation regarding the future began. Some band members had already been involved in side projects including Murderdolls, To My Surprise, and the reformation of Stone Sour. In 2003, Slipknot moved into The Mansion {{to work on the}} album. Initially, the band was unproductive; lead vocalist Corey Taylor was drinking heavily. Nevertheless, they wrote more than enough <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new album—the band's first to incorporate more traditional, melodic song structures, guitar solos and acoustic guitars.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} December 2008, Keenan had {{mentioned}} that he and Howerdel had passively and separately been writing new <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>A</b> Perfect Circle, although the band would officially remain in hiatus and largely out of {{the view of the}} public through mid-2010. On September 2010, the band officially announced the end of their hiatus, indicating they would again return to live performances. Keenan, Howerdel, Freese, and Iha all returned to their respective roles, though, with Lenchantin and White unavailable, the band recruited Matt McJunkins, touring bassist for Ashes Divide and Puscifer, to join as bassist. The performances, running through the end of 2010, included traveling to five separate cities for three nights of shows in each city, with each night containing a complete, in-order performance of one of each of their three albums - Mer de Noms, Thirteenth Step, and Emotive - notably being the first time most of the material from the latter had ever been performed live. Throughout the year the band would discuss the prospect of new material, but with uncertainty. Keenan continued to insist that logistics and industry trends made recording another full album unlikely, and that single one-off songs would be more likely. Howerdel noted that he had been writing material and presenting rough demos to Keenan since 2008, but that much of the material {{was in a state of}} flux, some being accepted by Keenan as potential A Perfect Circle material, while other being rejected by Keenan, and/or saved by Howerdel for a prospective Ashes Divide release in the future.|$|E
