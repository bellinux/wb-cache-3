5|$|Around 180 BCE the Indo-Greek king Agathocles issued some coinage bearing {{images of}} deities {{that are now}} {{interpreted}} as being related to Vaisnava imagery in India. The deities displayed on the coins appear to be Vishnu's avatars Balarama-Sankarshana with attributes consisting of the Gada mace and the plow, and Vasudeva-Krishna with attributes of the Shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra wheel. According to Bopearachchi, the headdress {{on top of the}} deity is actually a <b>misrepresentation</b> of a shaft with a half-moon parasol on top (chattra).|$|E
5|$|In November 1979, Brock met Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering, Inc. Concerned that Fechter's {{animatronics}} {{would be}} too strong a competition for Bushnell’s work, Brock requested that Bushnell release him from the co-development agreement, citing <b>misrepresentation.</b> In December 1979, Brock and Fechter formed “Showbiz Pizza Place Inc”, severing Brock's business relationship with Bushnell. ShowBiz Pizza Place was conceptually identical to Pizza Time Theatre in all aspects except for animation, which would be provided by Creative Engineering. Showbiz Pizza Place opened its first location on March 3, 1980, in Kansas City, Missouri.|$|E

5|$|Lactantius' De Mortibus Persecutorum, a {{political}} Christian pamphlet on the reigns of Diocletian and the Tetrarchy, provides valuable but tendentious detail on Constantine's predecessors and early life. The ecclesiastical histories of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret describe the ecclesiastic disputes of Constantine's later reign. Written {{during the reign}} of Theodosius II (408–50AD), a century after Constantine's reign, these ecclesiastic historians obscure the events and theologies of the Constantinian period through misdirection, <b>misrepresentation</b> and deliberate obscurity. The contemporary writings of the orthodox Christian Athanasius and the ecclesiastical history of the Arian Philostorgius also survive, though their biases are no less firm.|$|E

5|$|The first commercially {{released}} domestic {{feature film}} {{to deal with}} the events of 1965, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was a commercial and critical success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one, and reached record viewership numbers– although in many cases audiences were required to see the film. The film was used as a propaganda vehicle by the New Order government until its collapse; televised annually on 30 September and became mandatory viewing for students. Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, such use of the film has become less common. Although the film's artistic aspects remain well-received, its <b>misrepresentation</b> of history has been criticised.|$|E

After much outcry (especially from the Métis community) that the statue was an undignified <b>misrepresentation,</b> the statue was removed and placed at the Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface.

Apple paid Proview approximately $53,000 – $55,000 for the mark in 2009. In February 2012, Proview sued Apple in the Santa Clara Superior Court, alleging several permutations of fraud (intentional <b>misrepresentation,</b> concealment, inducement) and unfair competition. Apple paid $60 million to Proview to end the dispute in a court-mediated settlement in the Higher People's Court of Guangdong province; the U.S. case was thrown out of court.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890. A {{month later}} the British and Transvaalers agreed to joint control over Swaziland (without {{consulting}} the Swazis)—the South African Republic {{could build a}} railway through it to Kosi Bay {{on the condition that}} the Transvaal thereafter supported the interests of Rhodes's Chartered Company in Matabeleland and its environs. Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with his handling of the economy and the civil service—now widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports—caused opposition to grow. The industrial monopolies Kruger's administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over <b>misrepresentation</b> and price gouging.|$|E

The suit, Makaeff v. Trump University, LLC, sought refunds for Makaeff and other former clients of Trump University, as well as punitive damages for breach of contract, fraud, negligent <b>misrepresentation</b> and bad faith. It did not {{originally}} name Donald Trump as a defendant, but did so in a later amended complaint. In February 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel denied recognition to the nationwide class the plaintiffs had requested and recognized the suit as class-action {{on the part of}} Trump University clients in three states – California, Florida, and New York – based on specific alleged violations of the consumer protection laws of those states.

Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish.

5|$|Offa died in July 796 {{and his son}} Ecgfrith 141days later. Coenwulf, {{a distant}} relative, succeeded to the Mercian throne after Ecgfrith's death. Soon after his {{accession}} Coenwulf sought to replace the two archdioceses with one at London, arguing that Pope Gregory I's original plan had been that there be an archbishopric at London instead of at Canterbury. In 797 and 798 Coenwulf sent envoys to Rome to Pope Leo III, suggesting that a new archdiocese be created at London for Æthelhard. The king's envoys laid {{the blame for the}} problems encountered with the Lichfield archdiocese on Pope Hadrian I's incompetence. Displeased by criticism of the papacy, Leo ruled against the king's plan. In 801 Coenwulf put down a Kentish rebellion, allowing him to once more assert his authority in Canterbury and control the archbishopric. Finally, in 802, Pope Leo III granted that Hadrian's decision was invalid, after the English clergy told him it had been achieved by Offa's <b>misrepresentation.</b> Leo returned all jurisdiction to Canterbury, a decision announced by Æthelhard at the Council of Clovesho in 803.|$|E

25|$|<b>Misrepresentation</b> means a false {{statement}} of fact made by one party to another party and {{has the effect of}} inducing that party into the contract. For example, under certain circumstances, {{false statement}}s or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of the product that the seller has may constitute <b>misrepresentation.</b> A finding of <b>misrepresentation</b> allows for a remedy of rescission and sometimes damages {{depending on the type of}} <b>misrepresentation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Remedies {{are partly}} {{regulated}} by the <b>Misrepresentation</b> Act 1967. English law generally allows a contract to be unwound, so that both parties are put back into the position before the agreement was made. It {{may be that the}} <b>misrepresentation</b> was incorporated into the contract as a term, so as an alternative one can claim the contract should subsist and claim for a loss in expectations. In this case the misrepresentee can equally sue for damages as if the <b>misrepresentation</b> had been true.
