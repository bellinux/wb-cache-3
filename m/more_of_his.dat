5|$|In Montreal, Carleton {{was finally}} prodded to move. Under {{constant}} criticism {{for failure to}} act sooner, and mistrustful of his militia forces, he developed a plan of attack. He sent word to Colonel Allan Maclean at Quebec to bring <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Royal Highland Emigrants and some militia forces to Sorel, from where they would move up the Richelieu toward St. Jean, while Carleton would lead a force across the Saint Lawrence at Longueuil.|$|E

5|$|By 1970, Takemitsu's {{reputation}} as a leading member of avant-garde community was well established, and during his involvement with Expo '70 in Osaka, he was at last able to meet <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Western colleagues, including Karlheinz Stockhausen. Also, during a contemporary music festival in April 1970, produced by the Japanese composer himself ("Iron and Steel Pavilion"), Takemitsu met among the participants Lukas Foss, Peter Sculthorpe, and Vinko Globokar. Later that year, {{as part of a}} commission from Paul Sacher and the Zurich Collegium Musicum, Takemitsu incorporated into his Eucalypts I parts for international performers: flautist Aurèle Nicolet, oboist Heinz Holliger, and harpist Ursula Holliger.|$|E

5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade {{and he could see}} the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
5|$|During the First Indochina War, Lê Duẩn was {{an active}} revolutionary leader in South Vietnam. He headed the Central Office of South Vietnam, a party organ, from 1951 until 1954. During the 1950s Lê Duẩn became {{increasingly}} aggressive towards South Vietnam and called for reunification through war. By the mid-to-late 1950s Lê Duẩn had become the second-most powerful policy-maker within the Party, eclipsing former party First Secretary Trường Chinh. By 1960, he was officially the second-most powerful party member, after party chairman Hồ. Throughout the 1960s Hồ's health declined and Lê Duẩn assumed <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> responsibilities. On 2 September 1969, Hồ died and Lê Duẩn became the most powerful figure in the North.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{his army}} service in 1919, Marquis was restless and unsure of his future path. He first {{restarted}} the practice at Livingston and sold the house at Clyde Park (retaining some land there as a legacy for his daughters). He then decided to move to Whitehall, where he spent more and <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time writing, at first on his wartime experiences, and then short articles on diverse subjects collected into volumes. He also wrote short stories during this period. However, he could not find a publisher.|$|E
50|$|Carver never married. At age forty, {{he began}} a {{courtship}} with Sarah L. Hunt, {{an elementary school teacher}} and the sister-in-law of Warren Logan, Treasurer of Tuskegee Institute. This lasted three years until she took a teaching job in California. In her 2015 biography, Christina Vella reviews his relationships and suggests that Carver was bisexual and constrained by <b>mores</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> historic period.|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{after leaving}} TSR, Gygax was {{approached}} by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984. Gygax, who was tired of company management, was simply looking for some way to market <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end, while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed that, using Gygax's name, {{he would be able}} to bring in one to two million dollars of investment. Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. (NIPI) was publicly announced. To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and Dragon magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR. But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when his promised outside investment of one to two million dollars failed to materialize.|$|E
5|$|John Ebers, a bookseller, {{took over}} the {{management}} of the theatre in 1821, and seven more London premieres of Rossini operas (La gazza ladra, Il turco in Italia, Mosè in Egitto, Otello, La donna del lago, Matilde di Shabran and Ricciardo e Zoraide) took place there in the following three years. Ebers sublet the theatre to Giambattista Benelli in 1824, and Rossini was invited to conduct, remaining for a five-month season, with his wife Isabella Colbran performing. Two <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> operas, Zelmira and Semiramide, received their British premieres during the season, but the theatre sustained huge losses and Benelli absconded without paying either the composer or the artists. Ebers engaged Giuditta Pasta for the 1825 season, but he became involved in lawsuits which, combined with a large increase in the rent of the theatre, forced him into bankruptcy, after which he returned to his bookselling business.|$|E
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> later {{works are}} the Jewish {{community}} center in Duisburg (1996–1999), and with Rafi Segal, the Palmach Museum in Tel Aviv (1995–2000). The Duisburg Jewish community center {{is located on}} a park, the Garten der Erinnerung designed by Dani Karavan. The community center shares a similar concept to the Page Memorial in its likening to the open pages of a book, and symbolically the Torah of Moses. The Palmach Museum has an angular zig-zag plan positioned around the preservation of trees on the site. It is clad in a local sandstone that was found in excavations for the project. It was exhibited at the Venice Biennale.|$|E

50|$|A {{majority}} of Tambe's poetry is about love, including conjugal love, though love of Nature {{is a close}} second. But among all Marathi poets <b>of</b> <b>his</b> generation, Tambe stands alone in displaying through his poetry enormous empathy toward women, especially toward child widows. These poems implicitly disparaged the social <b>mores</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time whereby old men married teenaged girls who were sometimes left widowed and were essentially left to spend their entire adult lives without a partner.|$|R

To avoid any <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guys getting hurt and to pacify New York, Tony tracks Tony B. to their Uncle Pat's farm and shoots him. Phil, however, is furious {{that he did not}} get the opportunity to do it himself. Tony and Johnny meet at Johnny's house in a reconciliatory manner, but Johnny is arrested by Federal agents, while Tony escapes.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{included}} lyrics in <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> compositions at this point, {{although these}} were sometimes regarded as doggerel or proselytizing. The first album to contain vocals, That Healin' Feelin' (1970), was commercially unsuccessful and Silver had {{to insist on}} the support of Blue Note executives to continue releasing music of the same, new style. They agreed to a further two albums that contained vocals and Silver on an RMI electric keyboard; the three were later compiled as The United States of Mind, but were soon dropped from the catalog.|$|E
5|$|Singers S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, K. S. Chithra and S. Janaki have sung <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> songs {{than any}} other singers. He {{integrated}} folk—in Tamil—and introduced western musical sensibilities into the South Indian musical mainstream. Ilaiyaraja is also known for creating music by fusing symphonic orchestration with traditional Indian instrumentation, often performed by Budapest Symphony Orchestra. In 1993 he organised a full symphony performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London and thus became the First Indian to compose a full symphony, with Ravi Shankar being the only other Indian to do so. He is also the first Asian to compose a full symphony performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He has won five Indian National Film Awards (the highest film honor in India); three for Best Music Direction and two for Best Background Score. In 2010 he has received Padma Bhushan, awarded by the Government of India.|$|E
