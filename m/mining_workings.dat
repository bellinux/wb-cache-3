Based on goafs distribution and stabilities in the White Bull Mine, rock backfill system with a total volume of 362, 000 m 3 in 8 gobs was designed and carried out. The system included technologically and economically feasible stopes, conveying equipments of tramcars, rock transfer by electric rakes, haulage network and <b>mining</b> <b>workings.</b> Field effects showed that rock backfill was applicable to control potential hazards. With rock filling, goaf utilization rates ranged from 60 % to 70 %, which helped to control adjacent rock movement, eliminate rock burst and surface subsidence.

In terms of mobility, these machines are designed in such a way to adapt both to relief conditions (moving horizontally or in an inclined plane) and to larger or restricted spaces of maneuverability.

40|$|The {{load-carrying}} {{system of}} each construction should fulfill several conditions which represent reliable criteria {{in the assessment}} procedure. It is the theory of structural reliability which determines probability of keeping required properties of constructions. Using this theory, {{it is possible to}} apply probabilistic computations based on the probability theory and mathematic statistics. Development of those methods has become more and more popular; it is used, in particular, in designs of load-carrying structures with the required level or reliability when at least some input variables in the design are random. The objective {{of this paper is to}} indicate the current scope which might be covered by the new method—Direct Optimized Probabilistic Calculation (DOProC) in assessments of reliability of load-carrying structures. DOProC uses a purely numerical approach without any simulation techniques. This provides more accurate solutions to probabilistic tasks, and, in some cases, such approach results in considerably faster completion of computations. DOProC can be used to solve efficiently a number of probabilistic computations. A very good sphere of application for DOProC is the assessment of the bolt reinforcement in the underground and <b>mining</b> <b>workings.</b> For the purposes above, a special software application—“Anchor”—has been developed.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this diploma thesis was to {{determine}} whether the deformation zone, which arises above intact <b>mining</b> <b>workings</b> in soils, has a measurable gravity effect and influences the interpretation of gravity measurements. The railway tunnel in Březno u Chomutova has been chosen as a test site. We have progressed so that the geotechnical model of the geological environment above the tunnel was calculated first. The model was constructed on the base of two core wells, which were drilled near the tunnel especially for this purpose. The geotechnical model of deformation zone was converted into a density model and its gravity response was calculated. This model was compared with the gravity effect of the tunnel in rock environment without any deformation zone. The difference between effects of these two models gives the gravity response of the deformation zone. We found out that the gravity effect of the deformation zone is insignificant and does not affect the gravity interpretation in the environment of stiff tertiary clays, where the Březno tunnel is excavated. We compared the results of our modeling with the field gravimetric measurements results above the tunnel in Březno. The measurement was realized on three parallel profiles, which reach the tunnel in various depths. The results of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{magnitude}} 5. 3 seismic event {{occurred on}} 9 March 2005 in the Klerksdorp district of South Africa. The event and aftershocks shook {{the nearby town}} of Stilfontein, causing serious damage to several buildings and minor injuries to 58 people. At a nearby deep gold mine, two mineworkers lost their lives and 3200 mineworkers were evacuated under difficult circumstances. The Chief Inspector of Mines initiated an investigation into the risks to miners, mines and the public arising from seismicity in gold mining districts. It was found that the seismic event on 9 March 2005 could be ascribed to past mining, and that seismic events will continue to occur in the gold mining districts as long as deep-level mining takes place and are likely to persist for some time even after mine closure. Placement of slimes in old <b>mining</b> <b>workings</b> is unlikely to reduce risks significantly. Seismic monitoring should continue after mine closure, and the seismic hazard should be taken into account when the future use of mining land is considered. Seismic events are likely to be triggered as mines are allowed to flood. It is possible that a seismic event could cause movement on a fault transecting a water plug and/or water barrier pillar, open up a fluid pathway, and allow flow of water into populated mine workings. While it is unlikely that such an occurrence would become an uncontrollable inrush, the consequences could be disastrous and the risk must be seriously addressed. However, the risk of a seismi...|$|E
40|$|A {{measurements}} campaign {{carried out}} in the iron basin of Lorraine (North-east of France) put the spot on the existence of under-oxygenated and noxious gas emissions in vast built-up areas related to former mining works. In 1999, following the Lorraine local office of the French Ministry of Industry, Research and Environment (DRIRE) request, INERIS (the French National Institute for Safety and Risks) started some investigations to assess the geographical extend of the problem. These studies brought to the fore the existence of noxious gas emissions in relation with former <b>mining</b> <b>workings</b> that were not completely submerged. High level CO 2 content (up to 6 %) and low level O 2 content (down to 13 %) have been measured. At the same time, the Institute for Radio-protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) and the DAS S (a government organisation responsible to the national Ministry of Health) investigated and measured high level radon content (up to 15000 Bq/m 3) in the gaseous mixture. In some cases, these emissions affected directly inhabited buildings that were shown to have a link with the mine entrances or with the old superficial mining works. The consequences of a CO 2 enrichment and an O 2 impoverishment on health are numerous. The seriousness depends on the contents of these two gases: it ranges from headaches for CO 2 contents between 3 and 4 % and O 2 content between 14 and 16 %, to death for O 2 content lower than 6 % and CO 2 higher than 10 % (Monomakhoff, 1978). Fortunately, the content in inhabited buildings of the investigated areas didn't look directly risky. However, in some cases, the measured contents were very close to the critical level for which harmful effects can appear by O 2 deficit and CO 2 excess. Concerning the radon, it acts essentially on lung epithelium to further the development of cancer in case of long - lasting exposure with content higher than 500 - 1000 Bq/m 3 (Barrier and Lorentz, 2001). Apart from these clinical effects, the observed dysfunctioning of combustion appliances (boiler, gas cooker) due to CO 2 polluted and under - oxygenated air are likely to increase the explosion and CO emission risks in concerned houses. These observations induced INERIS to carry on its investigation, in order to better understand the mechanism of the gaseous emanations and to find reliable solutions to this problem...|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} the extractive activities of magnesite in North Euboea, which politically and geographically {{belongs to the}} region of Sterea Ellada, with particular emphasis on the mines of today’s Municipality of Elimnion. My main motivation for focusing on this region was the presence of many industrial buildings and other interspersed national-archaeological sites – they demonstrate to a visitor the strong interest in mining and metallurgy. Additionally, they serve {{as a reminder of}} the “Industrial Revolution” that the region went through a long time ago. My previous experiences of industrial buildings and national-archaeological sites led me to the assumption that the extensive extractive and <b>mining</b> <b>workings</b> in the region have historical value. Every historian could find in these a precious source of information for the period of industrial development and extractive activity that took place in Greece during the 19 th and 20 th century – a period that, in this context, is almost unknown and, to date, overlooked by historical research. The existing Greek and foreign literature which has been the basis of my research appears not to reference, and therefore ignore, North Euboea and its contribution to the Greek industrialisation. This realisation strengthened my intention to repair the historical injustice – although the absence of data was a constant obstacle to my research. Nonetheless, the rich archival material of the Limni Local Archive and the Monastery of Galataki compensated for the poor bibliographic support. This primary material, which is mostly unpublished, combined with oral evidence recently collected from the very few old metallurgists, enabled me to establish a more complete picture of the life and the general organisation in the region around the mines of Limni. My research is an attempt to compose the chronicle of this important period for the mining history of Greece by focusing on how the exploitation of magnesite started, on it’s systemisation and slow removal from Limni, and, most importantly, on the study of the consequences for the local societies that supported it. At the foot of Kandili mountain (1. 225 meters) in North Euboea where the Municipality of Elimnion meets with the Municipalities of Kireas and Nileas, the land held a gift of nature for its inhabitants with strong impact on the economic, social, cultural and environmental stability of the region. It was the Euboean magnesite, which {{can be found in the}} borders of those three neighbouring Municipalities.
