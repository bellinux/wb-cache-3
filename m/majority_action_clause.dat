Chapter 2 focuses {{on the design of}} <b>majority</b> <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> in bond contracts. It examines under what circumstances impeding creditor coordination might be a useful way to address debtor moral hazard concerns. In chapter 3 the pricing of sovereign bonds with various characteristics is studied. Special attention is drawn {{to the question of how}} the pricing of coordination clauses is affected by the composition of the debt. It is shown that coordination clauses are priced more favorably by the market the larger the share of coordinated debt by the respective issuer is. Chapter 4 investigates the scope for country insurance against macroeconomics shocks. Collateralizing sovereign bond contracts with financial derivatives is shown to be equivalent to indexing claims.

40|$|It {{is easy to}} {{say that}} the International Monetary Fund should not resort to {{financial}} rescue for countries in crisis; this is hard to do when there is no alternative. That is where collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> come in. Collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> are designed to facilitate debt restructuring by the principals - borrowers, and lenders - with minimal intervention by international financial institutions. Despite much discussion of this option, there has been little action. Issues of bonds fear that collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> would raise borrowing costs. The authors update earlier findings about the impact of collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> on borrowing costs. It has been argued that only in the past year or so, have investors focused on the presence of these provisions, and that, given the international financial institutions'newfound resolve to"bail in"investors, they now regard these clauses with trepidation. Extending their data to 1999, the authors find no evidence of such changes, but rather the same pattern as before: Collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> raise the costs of borrowing for low-rated issuers, but reduce them for issuers with good credit ratings. Their results hold both for the full set of bonds and for bonds issued only by sovereigns. They argue that these results should reassure those who regard collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> as an important element in the campaign to strengthen international financial architecture.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the collective action problem in sovereign debt restructurings using a benchmark model of sovereign debt renegotiation. It considers the welfare comparison of outcomes sustainable under collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> and under governing law {{that requires the}} unanimous agreement of bondholders to repayment revisions. One conclusion is that collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> allow the implementation of an efficient renegotiation equilibrium for the model economy while unanimity rules provide incentives for opportunistic behavior by individual bondholders that leads to inefficient outcomes. The potential role for a multilateral sovereign debt restructuring mechanism (SDRM) is also discussed. It is argued that {{the establishment of an}} official international bankruptcy tribunal that collectively restructures all of a country’s debt may not improve upon the universal adoption of collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> for sovereign bond issues. With collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses,</b> mutual gains from collective renegotiation are internalized so that sufficient incentives exist for the private formation of bondholder councils to restructure various debt issues together. The approach abstracts from transactions costs, and the last conclusion might well be sensitive to renegotiation and coordination costs...|$|R

As a result, the holdouts realized that while Argentina could not force the holdouts to accept the terms in the 2005 or 2010 restructurings, NML could use the pari passu clause to force Argentina to choose between paying all its bondholders (including NML) or none of them.|$|R

40|$|The International Monetary Fund (IMF) {{stated in}} spring {{of this year}} that a more timely {{restructuring}} of Greece's sovereign debt would have been beneficial. But what are the available options for early debt restructuring? The report argues that current reforms in the Euro area, in particular, introducing collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses,</b> {{are unlikely to be}} sufficient in their present form. Alternatively, a statutory solution {{in the form of an}} international or European insolvency regime for sovereign states is difficult to implement politically. Therefore, the contractual approach to debt restructuring should be facilitated by redesigning future contracts for bonds in the euro area. Specifically, more powerful collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> should be included in bond contracts and the ratable payment provision of all creditors should be reformed in order to limit the impact of legal disputes in the event of a debt restructuring. This approach would simplify future debt restructuring operations and make the no-bailout rule more credible, thus re-activating the disciplinary effect of interest rates on governments...|$|R
40|$|Since February 2003 {{a number}} of debtor {{countries}} have issued bonds with collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> (CACs) under New York law - a development welcomed by the official sector as tangible progress towards more orderly crisis resolution. Not all of these countries, however, have opted for the same CAC voting threshold, raising concerns that lack of standardisation might undermine the wider adoption of CACs. In this paper, debtors' optimal choice of CAC threshold is analysed using a theoretical model of 'grey-zone' financial crisis, which allows for the interaction of liquidity problems with solvency problems. It finds that individual countries may wish to set different thresholds because of differing risk preferences and creditworthiness. Strongly risk-averse debtors put much greater weight on pay-offs during crisis periods than during non-crisis periods {{and are therefore more}} likely to choose lower CAC thresholds than less risk-averse debtors. The worse the creditworthiness of risk-averse debtors, however, the more likely they will want to issue bonds with high collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} IMF {{programs}} and collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> affect {{the terms of}} market access. We find different effects on different types of borrowers. Fund programs appear to create additional commitment for bond borrowers with “inter-mediate ” credit, who consequently are able to borrow at lower cost. Moreover, Fund programs with limited structural conditions have the most favorable effects on investor confidence. Easier restructuring through collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> raises the costs for borrowers with low credit ratings but lowers them for those with high ratings. Thus, for the relatively high quality creditors, own commitment and voluntary restructuring work best. [JEL F 21, F 33, F 34] A variety of ideas for governing the flow of portfolio capital have been put onthe table {{in the course of}} discussions of how to strengthen the international financial architecture. The goal in each case is to reduce the frequency and severity of crises and limit investor moral hazard by creating alternatives to large-scale finan-cial rescues, which are increasingly seen as ineffective in catalyzing private capital flows. While the ideas falling under this heading are diverse, one thing they have in common is their uncertain impact on borrowing costs. The argument is the same whether the proposal is to add collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> to loan contracts, to mandate the inclusion of universal-debt-rollover options in loan agreements, to empower the IMF to sanction a standstill on payments, or to have the Fund lend into arrears to private creditors.

40|$|The recent wave of {{sovereign}} default has underscored {{the limits of}} the current market-based regime. Recently two alternative approaches propose a contractual approach by way of the introduction of collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> (CAC) in bond contracts, and a statutory approach put forward by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which calls for the establishment of an international debt restructuring mechanism (called the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism or SDRM) that would have many of the features of an international bankruptcy regime. This paper assesses the two crisis-resolution mechanisms. It shows that although no consensus exists on whether the best approach about how to manage and resolve sovereign debt crises is to promote the use of collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses,</b> or to create a statutory mechanism, it is, nevertheless, evident that the SDRM is shelved for the time being. It examines the reasons for this, and argues that to the contrary, a complementary approach that combines elements of both the CAC and the SDRM (now proposed by the IMF) has the potential to help reduce the unacceptably large costs associated with disorderly defaults by sovereign governments whose debt burdens have become unsustainable...|$|R
40|$|The {{contractual}} approach proposes {{the introduction}} of clauses in sovereign debt contracts to address a number of inefficiencies in sovereign debt markets. Two of its central innovations are collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> and seniority clauses. This paper analyses these two clauses when: (1) repayment is endogenous and depends on creditor lobbying effort; (2) litigation for full repayment does not increase the payment to be extracted from the creditor. There is a positive externality of effort that strongly interacts with asset distribution and contractual clauses. Individual litigation is not desirable from the creditors’ point of view since it weakens the incentives to exert effort. Collective <b>action</b> <b>clauses</b> block litigation and maximise repayment, especially when creditors are heterogeneous {{in the amount of}} debt they hold. The adoption of seniority clauses modifies the incentives to exert effort and thus repayment. This effect can be positive or negative. If average portfolio sizes are similar but the marginal loan being repaid is unevenly distributed among creditors, repayment falls. Since effort decisions are influenced by asset distribution, the paper also identifies and analyses a novel role for secondary markets.
