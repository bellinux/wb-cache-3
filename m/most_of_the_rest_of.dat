5|$|She {{was then}} was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1919 and spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the year in the Adriatic Sea. In early 1920, the ship was in the Black Sea supporting the Whites against the Bolsheviks. Cardiff spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> her time between the world wars overseas or in reserve. The ship played a minor role in World War II as she was initially assigned to the Northern Patrol, but became a training ship in late 1940 and continued in that role {{for the rest of the}} war. Cardiff was sold for scrap in early 1946 and subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|Although the Sun {{dominates the}} system by mass, it {{accounts}} for only about 2% of the angular momentum. The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.|$|E
5|$|In February 1941, {{the ship}} {{supported}} Commonwealth forces in Italian Somaliland during the East African Campaign and did {{much the same}} two months later in the Persian Gulf during the Anglo-Iraqi War. After that campaign, Hermes spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the year patrolling the Indian Ocean. She was refitted in South Africa between November 1941 and February 1942 and then joined the Eastern Fleet at Ceylon.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s {{and part}} of the 1960s, the country had a slow rate of growth in line with most Latin American countries, while <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the world enjoyed a golden era. Stagnation prevailed during this period, and the economy often found itself contracting, mostly the result of union strife.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} facade, built {{during the}} 16thcentury in the Renaissance Herrera style, is oldest {{part of the}} cathedral and was named after Juan de Herrera, architect of the El Escorial monastery in Spain.

5|$|Allardyce {{was hired}} as a player-coach by Brian Talbot at West Bromwich Albion in February 1989. He spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the 1988–89 season at The Hawthorns {{managing}} and playing for the reserve team, before being promoted to first team coach in the summer, in a move that saw former first team coach Stuart Pearson demoted to reserve team coaching. Allardyce and Talbot were sacked in January 1991 following a defeat to Isthmian League side Woking in the FA Cup. He later worked as a part-time coach at Bury, but manager Mike Walsh could not afford to keep him on the staff for the 1989–90 season.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the legal}} {{right-of-way}} was cleared by January 1974, cold weather, {{the need to}} hire workers, and construction of the Dalton Highway meant work on the pipeline itself did not begin until March. Between 1974 and July 28, 1977, when the first barrel of oil reached Valdez, {{tens of thousands of}} people worked on the pipeline. Thousands of workers came to Alaska, attracted by the prospect of high-paying jobs at a time when <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the United States was undergoing a recession.|$|E
5|$|Around midnight 7/8 June, {{during the}} slow voyage across the Channel, a German {{airplane}} hit West Honaker with two skip bombs. Because the ship, already {{prepared for a}} fast sinking for the blockship duties, began taking on water, {{a large portion of}} the crew, including Chief Engineer Poropat, abandoned ship. After drifting in the Channel for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the moonless night, they were picked up in the morning by a British trawler and returned to the UK. In the meantime, the master of the ship was able to keep West Honaker in the convoy headed to Utah beach.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It {{proved to be an}} early dawn for Arsenal, who spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.|$|E

From 18 March to 13 June 1945, she was stationed in New London, Connecticut, training U.S. submarines in Long Island Sound to avoid destroyers.|$|E
5|$|Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific {{seaports}} such as Vladivostok. From the 1960s {{until the}} early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused {{the use of the}} railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One factor is that the railways of the former Soviet Union use a wider rail gauge than <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Europe as well as China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.|$|E
5|$|Daniels' {{decision}} {{to run for}} Governor of Indiana led to <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Republican field of candidates {{to drop out of}} the race.

5|$|Gorky {{had a new}} bow section {{fabricated}} in Kronstadt and it was mated {{with the}} ship on 21 July. Kirov provided gunfire support during the defense of Tallinn and served as the flagship of the evacuation fleet from Tallinn to Leningrad {{at the end of}} August 1941. For <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the war both cruisers were blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by Axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the Siege of Leningrad and support for the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive in mid—1944. Both ships were damaged by German air and artillery attacks, but were repaired during the war.|$|E
5|$|Hotspur {{did not see}} {{any action}} during the Japanese Indian Ocean raid in April, but she did escort an {{aircraft}} carrier in September during the later stages of the invasion of Madagascar. In June 1942 the ship returned to the Mediterranean to escort another convoy to Malta (Operation Vigorous). She was converted to an escort destroyer beginning in March 1943 in the United Kingdom and was assigned to escort convoys in the North Atlantic for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the war.

The ship was captured by the Allies in May 1945 and {{spent the rest of}} the year under British control as the Allies decided how to dispose of the captured German ships.|$|E
5|$|The Danton-class {{battleship}} was a {{class of}} six pre-dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy (Marine Nationale) before World War I. The ships {{were assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet after commissioning in 1911. After the beginning of World War I in early August 1914, five of the sister ships participated in the Battle of Antivari.
