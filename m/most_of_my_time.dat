The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse was the only book Potter published in 1910. She wrote a friend on New Year's Day 1911: [...] "I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... I find it very difficult lately to get the drawings done. I {{do not seem to be}} able to go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of sketching and when I was at Bowness last summer I spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> upon the road going backwards & forwards to the farm [...] which was amusing, but not satisfactory for work." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army. He had {{originally}} been classified 4F, or medically ineligible for the draft, because of a high school knee injury, and he felt that he was drafted only because he was a prominent athlete. He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where the roar of the big guns sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier. As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty. This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951. Speaking of his time in the Army, Houtteman said, [...] "I spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> in the Army hospital. I did play a little ball at Camp Pickett", Virginia.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Warne's death and the purchase of Hill Top, Potter produced tales and illustrations inspired by her farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages. She provided Warnes with two books per annum, but, by 1910, she was juggling the demands of ageing parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and, as a result, her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. She published only one book in 1910, The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse, and wrote to a friend on New Year's Day 1911:I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ...

Referring to her niece, she wrote, [...] "The dear little Lucy engrosses <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> and thoughts.

2500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century the United States became engaged in a series of local {{conflicts}} in Latin America, which went into history as banana wars. The main purpose of these wars were to defend American commercial interests in the region. Later, U.S. Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler famously wrote, [...] "I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism." ...|$|E

[...] Clarkson sings, before promising to spend the rest of her days appreciating what she has and being herself."

5000|$|At the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005 held in San Luis, Argentina between September and October, Svidler placed shared {{second with}} Anand (third on number of wins tiebreak) scoring 8½/14 games, 1½ points behind the winner, Veselin Topalov. Alexander Motylev acted as his second. Shortly after the tournament Svidler said: [...] "I only {{prepared}} seriously for San Luis, and I {{think it has}} paid off. But in general I spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> spare <b>time</b> with <b>my</b> wife and kids, so my relative success in 2005 was a pleasant surprise." [...] Crushing China in the last round secured Svidler-led Russia gold at the World Team Championship. He came sixth on tiebreak at the Russian Superfinal. His success in 2005 earned him fourth place in the Chess Oscar voting.|$|R

Reflecting on his childhood in The Bronx, DeLillo later described how he was [...] "...always out in the street. As a little boy I whiled away <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>time</b> pretending to be a baseball announcer on the radio. I could think up games for hours at a time.

She reportedly used her time on air {{to comment on the}} difference between the tram systems in San Francisco and those in Sydney. In 1931 she also notes that she experimented with improving the science of television through the use of chemistry:"I have a pronounced kink for television work and devote <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> spare <b>time</b> in experimenting that branch of the science.

I disguised myself as a simple-minded young man who had come into a little money, and wormed myself into the confidence of the servants. I interviewed half the town upon the pretence that I was writing the commercial history of New England, and should like some particulars of their career, and I invariably ended my examination by asking them which was their favourite bar, and where they got their washing done.

40|$|Many {{students}} at American universities {{have trouble with}} technical writing. To help students over this trouble, we often use inefficient methods. These methods, like other aspects of graduate education, sometimes remind me of medieval apprenticeships. For example, I have known smart, capable teachers who were reduced to “teaching a student to write ” by taking that student’s first paper and rewriting it from start to finish. This booklet describes better methods. Instead <b>of</b> spending <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> “student <b>time</b> ” working on writing—teaching the same material to seniors, graduate students, and postdocs—I now prefer to teach writing to a group that meets weekly. Teaching a group uses <b>my</b> <b>time</b> more effectively, and working in a group shows students {{that they are not}} alone in their difficulties. The problems they have are problems that everyone has, and they see these problems even in published papers. But we do not emphasize problems; instead we emphasize useful principles and practices that students can learn to apply to their own manuscripts. • I emphasize principles that can be applied successfully by a beginning writer. Especially for students in science and engineering, a principle is easily applicable whe...|$|R

I think his countenance was more massive than it looks in any of the portraits ... there was a strong expression of shrewdness in all his lineaments; the eye alone, I think, indicated the poetical character and temperament.
