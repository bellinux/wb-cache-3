50|$|Prunus mahaleb, the <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> or St Lucie cherry, is {{a species}} of cherry tree. The tree is {{cultivated}} for a spice obtained from the seeds inside the cherry stones. The seeds have a fragrant smell and have a taste comparable to bitter almonds with cherry notes.|$|E
5000|$|A lesser known opinion {{states that}} the [...] "galbanum" [...] (Heb. חלבנה) {{may have been a}} spice derived from the <b>Mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus mahaleb), a tree {{cultivated}} for an aromatic oil obtained from its seeds. Others have suggested that this spice may have been labdanum, a view rejected by Maimonides.|$|E
50|$|The {{crest of}} the cliff, where the {{limestone}} is bare, is a habitat for Cerastium pumilum, Cerastium semidecandrum, Potentilla neumanniana, Veronica spicata, Scabiosa columbaria and Pilosella peleteriana. Nearby, can be found stands of Artemisia rupestris, Sorbus rupicola, Cotoneaster niger, elderberry, Rosa mollis and sweet briar. There are grape vines and <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherrys,</b> probably from seeds carried by birds, growing on a barrow near the hill fort. The area below the cliff is forested with firs and deciduous trees entwined with ivy. A number of rare and endangered species of funi have also been registered in the reserve.|$|R
40|$|Simazine and dalapon {{have been}} used to control weeds in many crops during the last few years, but in 1963, when this study was begun, their uses in fruit {{orchards}} were limited. To study the effects of simazine and dalapon both on the control of weeds and on various metabolic changes in apple (Malis pumila), Montmorency sour cherry (Prunus cerasus), sweet cherry (Prunus avium), and Prunus mahaleb root s tock, experiment s were conducted from 1964 through 1966 in both the field and in the greenhouse. The application of a low do sage of simazine (4 lb/A) to soil around twelve-year-old Montmorency sour cherry trees in the field resulted in 60 to 70 percent weed control, while tree growth, chlorophyll content of the leaves, fruit y i e ld, and fruit quality were enhanced. Simazine applied at the higher dosages (8 and 12 lb/A) gave very good weed control (up to 100 percent) but reduced tree growth, chlorophyll content, and fruit yield and quality. In the greenhouse, the application of simazine at all three levels caused severe damage to R· mahal eb and sweet cherry trees and hence reduced the water uptake, but young apple trees treated with simazine showed no visible damage, although water uptake was reduced. In young sour cherry trees treated with 4 lb/A simazine, slight chlorophyll increase s we re observed, while at the higher dosages, decreases were observed. Simazine applied to the soil surface was absorbed readily by all trees. It accumulated in large amounts in the l eaves compared with the other parts of these plants. Sour cherry trees accumulated more simazine than apple trees. Results from both field and greenhouse trial sindicate that apple trees were comparatively resistant, and sweet cherry and ~ · mahaleb trees were very sensitive. Enzyme analys i s indicated that simazine caused an increase in the activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in all trees. The activity of catalase and cytochrome oxidase was decreased in f. <b>mahaleb,</b> sweet <b>cherry,</b> and sour cherry trees, but apple trees showed an increase in both catalase and cytochrome oxidase activity. Compared to the other trees, the most tolerant, untreated trees (apple) had relatively high peroxidase and low polyphenol oxidase activity, with moderate catalase and cytochrome oxidase activity. The moderately resistant species (sour cherry) had moderate peroxidase, catalase, and cytochrome oxidase activity but very low polyphenol oxidase activity, while the sensitive trees (~. <b>mahaleb</b> and sweet <b>cherry)</b> showed a wide range of enzyme activities. ~ · mahaleb leaves had low peroxidase and catalase activities and high polyphenol oxidase and cytochrome oxidase activities, but sweet cherry leaves had moderate peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase, high catalase, and l ow cytochrome oxidase activities. The movement of simazine in the soil was s low. Regardless of applied amounts, most of the herbicide stayed in the top 0 - 6 inches of soil after surface application, but movement in t he soil increased as the rate of application increased. The post-emergence application of dalapon to a Montmorency sour cherry orchard reduced weed growth in general, but complete weed control was not observed. Tree growth, chlorophyll content of the l eaves, fruit yield, and fruit quality of dalapon-treated Montmorency sour cherry trees were reduced compared with the untreated control. These reductions became greater as t he dalapon dosage increased...|$|R
50|$|Dense forest {{ecosystems}} occupy a smaller and wetter {{area in the}} southeast. These are deciduous tree species (Caucasian ash, moss-capped oak, yoke elm, white poplar, <b>Mahaleb</b> <b>cherry)</b> covered with climbing plants: old man’s beard, wild vines, ivy, hop, and silk vine. These forests are surprisingly similar to tropical forests. Grasses include wood horsetail, oriental iris, wild orchids, and cuckoo pint.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rootstock}} {{that the}} cherry is grafted onto {{can play a}} significant role in the disease symptoms seen. Rootstocks of <b>Mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> exhibit different symptoms from stocks of Colt, Mazzard, or Stockton Morello. When the scion is grafted onto Mahaleb, symptoms consistent with Phytophthora root rot can be seen. To distinguish between root rot and x-disease the wood under the bark at the graft union should be examined. If it is x-disease the wood at the union will have grooves and pits this causes a browning of the phloem and shows the cells in decline. This rapid decline is caused by the rootstock cells near the graft union dying in large quantities. Foliage begins to turn yellow and the curl upward and inward toward the leaf midrib. Trees infected with Mahaleb rootstock die by late summer or early the following year.|$|E
50|$|About 450 {{plant species}} were {{recorded}} in and around Nemrut Caldera, around 200 (44%) of them belonging to the region. The diversity of the flora points out to the variation of climate conditions in the past. Around 38 (8.4%) of the existing plant species are endemic. The upside down tulip, which grows here, is a world-famous flower. The climax vegetation of Nemrut Caldera forms the haired birch (Betula) and the trembling aspen (Populus tremula). Other notable plants growing around two lakes of the caldera are the trees dwarf juniper (Juniperus communis), Norway maple (Acer platanoides), European mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia), common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), white willow (Salix alba), and the shrubs coinwort cotoneaster (Cotoneaster nummularius), cherry plum (Prunus divaricata), grey willow (Salix cinerea), Greek juniper (Juniperus excelsa), breaking buckthorn (Frangula alnus), alder buckthorn (Frangula alnus) and <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus mahaleb). Steppe-like vegetation is spread over wide areas in the caldera. Those are mainly species of milkvetch (Astragalus). Other subshrubs and herbaceous plants are prickly thrift (Acantholimon), sainfoin (Onobrychis), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella), Thymus, Alyssum, sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), Salvia, Ranunculus, Silene, rabbitfoot clover (Trifolium arvense), Pimpinella, Artemisia, squarrose (Centaurea triumfettii). Reedy areas are present In the northwestern part of Lake Nemrıt.|$|E
5000|$|Prunus mahaleb is {{a likely}} {{candidate}} for the ḫalub-tree mentioned in early Sumerian writings, a durable fruit-bearing hardwood with seeds and leaves known for their medicinal properties and associated with the goddess Inana. The Arabic محلب mahleb or mahlab meaning the <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> is in medieval Arabic writings by among others Al-Razi (died 930), Ibn al-Baitar (died 1248) and Ibn al-Awwam. Ibn Al-Awwam in his book on agriculture dated late 12th century described how to cultivate the mahaleb tree: he says the tree is a vigorous grower, easy to grow, but a thing {{to watch out for}} {{is that it is not}} resistant to prolonged drought. He also described how to prepare the mahaleb seeds by boiling them in sugared water. The word, and probably the mahaleb itself, does not appear in classical Latin, nor early or mid medieval Latin, and is rare in late medieval Latin. One early record in Latin is year 1317 in an encyclopedia by Matthaeus Silvaticus who wrote that the [...] "mahaleb" [...] is the kernel seed of the fruit of both domesticated and wild cherry trees in Arabic countries. Another early record in Latin is in a medical-botany book by Ioannis Mesuae in 1479 spelled almahaleb (where [...] "al-" [...] is the Arabic definite article). In 1593 the Latin botanist Carolus Clusius spelled it mahaleb. Today its cultivation and use is largely restricted to the region that in the 19th and earlier centuries formed the Ottoman Empire. Syria is the main exporting country.|$|E
40|$|The studies {{concerning}} {{the effect of}} the times and the methods of budding on the growth of young cherry trees were conducted in the years 1997 - 2000 at Felin Experimental Farm of Lublin Agricultural University. The objects of investigations were the young cherry trees obtained as a result of budding of <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus mahaleb L.) and sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) seedlings in the way by the chip budding- 15 th July and T-budding-on the 15 th July and the 1 st September. The used terms and budding methods did not affect the bud taking and the quality of cherry trees during three years studies. Chip budding of the sweet cherry on the 15 th July was the most effective way of this seedling budding. Late budding-on the 1 st September-did not change the efficiency of the nursery only in case of <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry.</b> The highest number- 33 000 of the young trees, average per 1 ha was got {{as a result of the}} chip and "T" <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> budding on the 1 st September...|$|E

40|$|The {{strength}} {{of growth of}} 'Łutówka' trees {{was related to the}} soil quality and the rootstock. Measurements of the tree trunks and the crown size showed that on fertile soil the trees grafted on <b>Mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> grew worse, forming by 12 % thinner trunks and by over 20 % (significantly) smaller crowns as compared to Mazzard cherry trees. On poor sandy-loamy soil the crowns of trees grafted on Mahaleb were significantly, more than 40 % bigger than those on Mazzard cherry. No significant differences in the yielding and productivity of trees grafted on Mahaleb and Mazzard cherry trees were found on grey brown podzolic soil. The experiment conducted on sandy-loamy soil pointed to significant differences in the yielding and productivity between 'Łutówka' trees grafted on the studied rootstocks. The trees grafted on <b>Mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> in both studied years were characterized by significantly greater productivity than on the other rootstocks. Significantly higher yields were gathered from the trees on <b>Mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> than on vegetative rootstocks, and by 70 % higher than on Mazzard cherry. P-HL A rootstock is of little use in the planting of 'Łutówka', which grown poorly on light soils. Besides poor growth and yielding, in longer dry periods the studies found the appearance of chlorosis of magnesium on older leaves, and even wilting of the leaves...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of 58 <b>Mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus mahaleb) genotypes and six sweet cherry (P. avium) accessions was studied using 25 cpSSR primer pairs. Thirteen {{out of them}} demonstrated two to four alleles {{with an average of}} 2. 46 alleles per primer pair. The mean of PIC value for the primers was 0. 32. The average values of expected heterozygosity (He) and Shannon’s information index (I) for all loci were 0. 35 and 0. 55, respectively. The dendrogram based on cpSSR markers has been illustrated by MEGA 4 software with Maximum Composite likelihood model and the Neighbor-joining method, which clustered the genotypes into four groups. Sum of first three principal components analysis (PCAs) could be represented most of (63. 07 %) the total variation in the original dimensions and confirmed the results of cluster analysis. Based on the AMOVA results, the allele numbers among groups and species studied in this research were more than those observed within them. In this study cpSSR markers provided a good tool for assessment of genetic diversity among and within <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> and sweet cherry genotypes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the period}} 2006 – 2009 in Lublin, a study was {{conducted}} to determine the effect of five types of rootstock: ‘Colt’, ‘F 12 / 1 ’, sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.), ‘GiSelA 5 ’ and ‘Piast’ <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus mahaleb L.), on the growth and quality of maiden sweet cherry trees cv. ‘Regina’ in a commercial nursery. Based on the three-year average, rootstocks were shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the investigated quality characteristics of maiden sweet cherry trees. Trees budded on ‘Colt’ vegetative rootstock were characterized by strongest growth and best quality. In each year, they were thicker, higher and better branched than sweet cherries on the rootstock. Under the tested conditions, ‘GiSelA 5 ’ dwarf rootstock significantly reduced the growth and quality of budded sweet cherry trees in the nursery. During the period 2007 – 2009, no physiological incompatibility symptoms were observed ‘Regina’ sweet cherry cv. and ‘Piast’ seedling rootstocks. The growth of trees budded on ‘Piast’ <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> was poorer than on ‘Colt’ clonal rootstock, but it was stronger than on ‘F 12 / 1 ’ and Prunus avium L. rootstocks...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} at the Felin Experi- mental Farm, belonging to the University of Life Sciences in Lublin, during the period 2005 – 2008. The experimental material consisted of maiden trees of sour cherry 'Łutówka' budded on seedlings of <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus mahaleb L.) of unknown origin. The experiment evaluated the effect of four budding times: 15 July, 1 August, 15 August, and 1 September, {{on the quality of}} cherry trees in a nursery. The mean for the three years showed that budding time did not {{have a significant effect on}} the quality of cherry trees in the nursery. It was observed that the budding of <b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> performed on the two August dates (1 st and 15 th) had a more beneficial effect on the growth and branching of trees than the budding done on 15 July and 1 September. The quality of maiden cherry trees 'Łutówka' in the nursery was primarily dependent on weather conditions in a given growing season, which is evidenced by the significant differences between production cycles, high variation in the quantitative results in individual years, and the absence of significant differences in the mean for 2006 – 2008...|$|E

40|$|Anthocyanins, the {{naturally}} occurring pigments {{responsible for most}} red to blue colours of flowers, fruits and vegetables, have also attracted interest because of their potential health effects. With the aim of contributing to major insights into their structure–activity relationship (SAR), we have evaluated the radical scavenging and biological activities of selected purified anthocyanin samples (PASs) from various anthocyanin-rich plant materials: two fruits (<b>mahaleb</b> <b>cherry</b> and blackcurrant) and two vegetables (black carrot and “Sun Black” tomato), differing in anthocyanin content (ranging from 4. 9 to 38. 5 mg/g DW) and molecular structure of the predominant anthocyanins. PASs from the abovementioned plant materials have been evaluated for their antioxidant capacity using Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assays. In human endothelial cells, we analysed the anti-inflammatory activity of different PASs by measuring their effects on the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1. We demonstrated that all the different PASs showed biological activity. They exhibited antioxidant capacity of different magnitude, higher for samples containing non-acylated anthocyanins (typical for fruits) compared to samples containing more complex anthocyanins acylated with cinnamic acid derivatives (typical for vegetables), even though this order was slightly reversed when ORAC assay values were expressed on a molar basis. Concordantly, PASs containing non-acylated anthocyanins reduced the expression of endothelial inflammatory antigens more than samples with aromatic acylated anthocyanins, suggesting the potential beneficial effect of structurally diverse anthocyanins in cardiovascular protection...|$|E
