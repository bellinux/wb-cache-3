5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason {{it has long been}} used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by <b>Muntz</b> <b>metal</b> and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|The cruisers' hulls were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames with yellow pine planking {{up to the}} upper deck. A layer of <b>Muntz</b> <b>metal</b> sheathing covered the hull to protect the wood from shipworm. The stem and sternposts {{were constructed}} with steel and timber. A bronze naval ram was fitted at the bow. The hull was divided into ten watertight compartments, and a double bottom was installed below the boiler rooms. The ships were good sea boats, but they rolled badly and the sponsons for the main guns caused severe vibration. Since Geier was laid down after the other five ships entered service, she was redesigned slightly to discard the sponsons, and so she did not suffer from bad vibration. They were very maneuverable, except for turns into the wind when steaming at low speed. The ships had a crew of 9officers and 152enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one cutter, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E

50|$|Wiggin {{was born}} at Cheadle, Staffordshire, the son of William Wiggin of Cheadle who owned a nickel and cobalt {{refining}} and manufacturing business. In 1870 the company took over Evans & Askin, which had been founded by Brooke Evans, to form Henry Wiggin & Co., manufacturers of speciality metal products. He was also a Director of the Midland Railway, the Staffordshire Water Works Co., the Birmingham Joint Stock Bank, and <b>Muntz's</b> <b>Metal</b> Co. He was a governor of King Edward's School, Birmingham, a J.P. for Worcestershire and Birmingham, and Deputy Lieutenant of Staffordshire.|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of Dorridge is strongly {{linked to the}} Muntz family, who lived in nearby Umberslade Hall. The Muntz family were descendants of Philip Fredrick Muntz, an immigrant of the 18th century, who had left revolutionary France after settling there from Poland. Through industrial wealth, founded on a brass-making process for creating <b>Muntz</b> <b>Metal,</b> a form of brass used in shipbuilding, the family acquired a considerable estate in the area.|$|E
25|$|The wreck lay in 20m {{of water}} on a silty bottom and was found on 13 May 2013. The <b>muntz</b> <b>metal</b> outline that {{originally}} clad {{the outside of the}} hull and a pile of basalt which was the final cargo of blue metal from Kiama are all that was visible. The bow can still be made out (basically pointing to the harbour bridge) and some concreted near here which is most likely anchor chain.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} maritime {{community has}} phased out {{the use of}} organtin-based coatings. This phase-out of toxic biocides in marine coatings posed a severe problem for the shipping industry; it presents a major challenge for the producers of coatings to develop alternative technologies. Safer methods of biofouling control are actively researched. Copper compounds have successfully been used in paints, heat sinks inside of medical electronics, {{and continue to be}} used as metal sheeting (for example <b>Muntz</b> <b>metal</b> which was specifically made for this purpose), though there is still debate as to the safety of copper.|$|E
5000|$|With Muntz {{successfully}} {{supervising the}} manufacturing operations, by 1840 <b>Muntz’s</b> Patent <b>Metal</b> Company employed 30 men to smelt and roll the alloy and were producing 2,000 tons yearly. Three {{years later the}} Company had over 200 men producing 3-4000 tons yearly at £8 per ton profit. By then the Grenfells had left the partnership, for the agreement with Pascoe Grenfell & Sons had been terminated with some acrimony in 1842. When Muntz’s patent expired in 1846, they and others began making fastenings and sheathing to the Muntz patent at will.|$|R
25|$|Heat {{exchangers}} using {{copper and}} its alloys have evolved along with heat transfer technologies {{over the past}} several hundred years. Copper condenser tubes were first used in 1769 for steam engines. Initially, the tubes were made of unalloyed copper. By 1870, <b>Muntz</b> <b>metal,</b> a 60% Cu-40% Zn brass alloy, was used for condensers in seawater cooling. Admiralty metal, a 70% Cu-30% Zn yellow brass alloy with 1% tin added to improve corrosion resistance, was introduced in 1890 for seawater service. By the 1920s, a 70% Cu-30% Ni alloy was developed for naval condensers. Soon afterwards, a 2% manganese and 2% iron copper alloy was introduced for better erosion resistance. A 90% Cu-10% Ni alloy first became available in the 1950s, initially for seawater piping. This alloy is now the most widely used copper-nickel alloy in marine heat exchangers.|$|E

2500|$|Possibly {{the most}} famous of the Muntz family was the {{inventor}} of <b>Muntz</b> <b>metal,</b> George Frederic Muntz, who was also an early Member of Parliament for Birmingham. He was a supporter of political reform and {{a founding member of the}} Birmingham Political Union along with Thomas Attwood. In his actions that led to the Reform Act 1832 Muntz was indicted for sedition as he tried to undermine the Duke of Wellington with a run on gold – To stop the Duke, run for Gold. He also was involved in a riot at St Martin's in Birmingham in protest against the Church Rates which were levied at around 6d to 9d in the pound. He was sent to trial in 1838 but was acquitted on all but one of 13 charges. Whilst claiming to be a Republican, his true character appeared to be that of an egotistical aristocrat. E. Edwards wrote in 1877 in the Birmingham Daily Mail of a conversation about a speech he made: [...] "They won't be able to print Muntz's speech verbatim." [...] "Why not?" [...] said I. [...] "Why my dear fellow, no printing office in the world would have capital I's enough." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Muntz</b> <b>metal</b> {{is a form}} of alpha-beta brass {{with about}} 60% copper, 40% zinc and a trace of iron. It is named after George Fredrick Muntz, a metal-roller of Birmingham, England, who commercialised the alloy {{following}} his patent of 1832.|$|E
50|$|Ocean had a {{metacentric}} height of 6.01 ft {{which meant that}} she rolled a lot and was an unsteady gun platform. Her hull was sheathed with <b>Muntz</b> <b>metal</b> to reduce biofouling. Her crew consisted of 605 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
50|$|Finally, a {{suitable}} alloy for the hull bolts was found, that of copper and zinc. At great cost, the Admiralty decided in 1786 {{to go ahead}} with the re-bolting of every ship in the navy, thus finally eliminating the bolt corrosion problem. This process lasted several years, after which no significant changes to the coppering system were required and metal plating remained a standard method of protecting a ship's underwater hull until the advent of modern anti-fouling paint. In the 19th century, pure copper was partially superseded by <b>Muntz</b> <b>metal,</b> an alloy of 60% copper, 40% zinc and a trace of iron. <b>Muntz</b> <b>metal</b> had the advantage of being somewhat cheaper than copper.|$|E
50|$|His father Philip Frederic Muntz came to England {{shortly after}} the French revolution. As an industrialist, George Frederic Muntz {{developed}} <b>Muntz</b> <b>Metal.</b> This was a brass alloy intended to replace the copper that was then used to prevent fouling on ocean-going ships.|$|E
