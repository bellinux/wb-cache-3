40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the effects of heat treatments, humidity and hydrogen bonding on thin film and fibre samples of poly (vinyl alcohol). A number of different techniques are utilised in order to analyse samples that have undergone {{a number of different}} treatments. The techniques include X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). From the XRD and DSC work the increase in crystallisation due to annealing time and temperature has been investigated and for dry samples the crystallinity was found to be dependant on both the temperature and also the heating method. For samples exposed to varying humidities and annealed in this wet environment two stages of crystallisation have been proposed. The crystals formed are of two types, those with small unit cell parameters and low melting points, and a second class of crystals with bigger unit cell parameters which, perhaps surprisingly, were found to have the higher melting points. The melting temperature was also not found to be significantly dependant on the amount of water take up or the degree of crystallinity. These changes have been explained in terms of the hydrogen bonding between the polymer chains and between the polymer and water molecules. Solubility and swelling experiments showed that as the crystallinity of the sample increases the amount of water the sample is able to absorb is reduced. This is because it is the amorphous region of the <b>material</b> that <b>swells,</b> although {{it has been shown that}} not all the amorphous <b>material</b> <b>swells</b> to the same extent. The glass transition temperature (T_g) could not be followed with DSC as the semicrystalline nature of the samples masked this transition and hence DMA was used to follow the changes in T_g with both annealing and moisture content. A decrease in T_g with increasing humidity was clearly observed. An interesting observation was the increase in T_g for films exposed to humidity and then dried before analysis as XRD showed no corresponding increase in crystallinity. For fibre samples the crystallinity was found to be greatly increased by the orientation processes which gave rise to very large melting enthalpies in the DSC suggesting that there is more and/or stronger bonding opportunities within the fibre samples.

40|$|This paper reports {{experimental}} results relative to volume changes caused by exposure of clay soils to fluids {{different from the}} pore fluid. Furthermore it reports some results relative {{to the influence of}} pore fluid composition on swelling pressure of an active smectitic clay. The experimentation on volume change was carried out on several soils differing for both grain size distribution and clay mineral composition. The results show that exposure of water saturated Ponza bentonite to NaCl, KCl and CaCl 2 solutions causes consolidation. At high void ratio, pores and fissures form. On re-exposure to water, Na+ effects are reversible and the <b>material</b> <b>swells</b> noticeably. On the contrary, Ca 2 + and K+ make swelling potential decrease greatly because they substitute Na+ as counterions. Under low values of axial stress and high void ratio, potassium and calcium effects can be reverted by exposing the material to concentrated NaCl solutions. The effects of exposure to electrolytes of soils with a smectite content between 10 % and 30 % - such as Bisaccia, Gela and Marino clays - are lower than those on the Ponza bentonite, however they are noticeable. Furthermore, depending on axial stresses, type of solution and on types of exchangeable cations, swelling caused by subsequent exposure to distilled water can be lower or higher than previous consolidation. The commercial kaolin, the Potenza and the Villa d'Agri clays undergo small consolidation as an effect of exposure to the salt solution and further large consolidation because of subsequent exposure to water. The Milazzo clays undergoes swelling because of exposure to NaCl solution. The results relative to volume change can be interpreted qualitatively in terms of double layer processes, ion exchange and initial fabric. Results relative to swelling pressure show that Bolt’s model interprets satisfactory the behaviour of the Bisaccia clay reconstituted with a con-centrated salt solution and exposed to distilled water. As expected, the model interprets only qualitatively the behaviour of the material exposed to concentrated salt solutions...|$|R

40|$|Device {{applications}} of shape memory polymers demand diverse shape changing geometries, which are currently limited to non-omnidirectional movement. This restriction originates from traditional thermomechanical programming {{methods such as}} uniaxial, biaxial stretching, bending, or compression.

40|$|Blasting in SLC (sublevel caving) {{takes place}} in a semi-confined situation. Blasted <b>{{material}}</b> <b>swells</b> while the caved material compacts, and also, to a lesser extent, fills parts of the void volume of the production drift. Several analytical and empirical models have been developed in the past. However, understanding of the interaction of semi-confined blasting conditions, SLC blast design and rock mass characteristics on rock breaking performance is rudimentary. Instrumentation of the blasted burden with various sensors and study of the dynamics of burden movement against confinement is therefore important. Such measurements are very scarce and thus different systems have been tested both in laboratory and in the field. Main focus was thereby the development of measuring equipment that could be scaled up to full-scale SLC blasting and installed behind the rings. In the field tests, blastholes were drilled in a pillar, parallel to a cross cut drift in the LKAB Kiruna SLC mine. The burden constraint was achieved either by filling the drift of 7. 0 x 5. 2 m (width x height) with rock masses or reinforcing the drift wall. The tests were instrumented with different redundant sensors, which were installed in holes drilled from a parallel cross cut. The most promising one was a concept, which combines the initial movement recorded by an accelerometer designed to minimize zero-shift with the final displacement recorded by a fibre photoelectric sensor (‘fibre-optic zebra gauge’). For the filled drift wall blasting test the maximum velocity varied between 16 - 32 m/s with a compaction in the range of 4 - 5 %. A gap was verified to exist between the intact pillar and the blasted material. By comparison, the velocity for the unconfined situation yielded a considerably increased velocity (42 - 47 m/s). In addition, ‘Blo-Up’, a component within the Hybrid Stress Blast Model (HSBM), was used to model the blasting results. The ob-jective was to show that reasonable predictions of fragmentation and burden movement under confined conditions can be made. An unconfined reference experiment was used to calibrate Blo-Up and forward predictions of the confined case were made. In both cases, Blo-Up accurately reproduced the burden velocity and displacement observed in the experiments. The suggested measurement concept could be used for further measurements of confined burden movement in filled drift wall blasting tests and under controlled situations. As mentioned the final objective is instrumentation of the burden in SLC production rings. Godkänd; 2012; 20121112 (matwim...|$|R

The development of ceramics adapted for nuclear-waste immobilization {{is the focus of}} this dissertation. The yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic (ZrY) O_x is a promising candidate material for both inert matrix fuel and waste form due to its high solubility of actinides, high chemical durability and exceptionally high stability under irradiation over a vast temperature range. Cubic <b>materials</b> <b>swell</b> isotropically when damaged by radiation under different strains. This leads to less microcracking in a repository. They are also capable of forming isomorphous solid solutions with actinides. In order to obtain fully stabilized solid solution with cubic symmetry, yttria oxide was chosen as a stabilizer for zirconia ceramics and ceria oxide and neodymia oxide were chosen as stimulant wastes in the current study. A simple fabrication method was chosen for the synthesis of powders. The cubic yttria-stabilized zirconia matrix with different ceria contents (0 - 25 wt%) and neodymia (0 - 100 wt%) contents was synthesized using the co-precipitation method. The mild attrition method was used to dry powders at 110 °C or calcine powders at 600 °C. Both acetone and propanol milling solvent media were used to get active fine powders for neodymia ceramics. Then, the different characterizations of powders were performed using the following methods: agglomerate size and distributions of powder by optical microscopy and granulometry, properties of the powder and its structural appearance by XRD, phase transition and structural formation of the powder with a temperature gradient by TG/DSC, surface area and crystalline size of the powder by BET. After these initial investigations into the characteristics of the powders, pellets with different ceria and neodymia contents, were compacted using isostatic pressure of 229 MPa - 1019 MPa. Then, they were sintered at a temperature of 1600 °C. Some physical and mechanical properties of ceria ceramic and neodymia ceramic pellets were investigated before chemical durability tests, were carried out. The chemical durability of the final products was subsequently investigated using static and dynamic leaching tests, according to MCC- 1 and MCC- 5 with different leachants at interesting pHs. The influence of the different fabrication processes on the leachability of fabricated products was investigated and evaluated. The results from these chemical durability tests were then used to determine the effect that different structures have a stability of the ceramic materials...|$|R

Turpoaminen oli huomattavasti vähäisempää kuin PS-DVB-runkoisella materiaalilla. Silikarunkoisen erotus-materiaalin titrauksen tuloksena voitiin todeta, että se oli heikosti emäksinen. Titrauskäyrä muistutti PS-DVB-runkoisen erotusmateriaalin titrauskäyrää, vaikka erotusmateriaalien protonoitumisalueet olivat hieman erilaiset.

The silica-based separation <b>material</b> <b>swelled</b> about 4 %, when changed from free base form to acid form. This was {{much less than the}} swelling of the PS-DVB-based material. The titration results of the silica-based material showedthat it is weakly basic. The titration curve resembled the titration curve of the PS-DVB-based material, even though there were some differences between the protonation areas. This is because the structure of the functional groups of the silica-based material differ slighly from the PS-DVB-based material. The results of the equilibrium experiments showed that the silica-based material is most selective for copper and nickel and least selective for zinc among the investigatedmetals. Each of the metals could be eluted with sulphuric acid from the silica-based material. The PS-DVB-based material requires either sulphuric acid or ammonium hydroxide for the regeneration, depending on the metal in question. Columnruns showed that the silica-based separation material adsorbs better copper from concentrated zinc sulphate solutions than the PS-DVB-based material. The otherinvestigated metals were not adsorbed in both beds. The results of repetitive column experiments showed that the copper capacity of the silica based material remains during four load-rinse-regeneration cycles. Furthermore, no metal ions are irreversibly accumulated on the silica-based material during the four cycles...|$|R
40|$|The {{mid-infrared}} is {{a promising}} region for detection different materials. Many vibrational modes, including bending and stretching, {{are located in}} this regime. Photothermal spectroscopy and imaging in the mid-infrared region is an emerging new method for non-contact detection of molecular groups. Our approach to photothermal spectroscopy and imaging utilizes a near-infrared erbium doped fiber laser (EDFL) to detect the photothermal induced changes in the refractive index. These changes are excited by a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser (QCL) pump beam. The probe beam is detected by a commercially available near-infrared photodetector. This method has advantages of high sensitivity, label-free detection, high spatial resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Hydrogels such as pHEMA are polymers that are of interest for contact lens, drug delivery and soft tissue replacement. The pHEMA hydrogel can retain water content, causing the <b>material</b> to <b>swell.</b> Additionally, pHEMA has a critical temperature at which the hydrogel undergoes a glass transition. Photothermal spectroscopy of pHEMA is demonstrated in this thesis where {{the presence of this}} glass transition temperature can be revealed. Additionally, photothermal imaging of a PMMA USAF target sample is shown and ideal parameters for high-resolution photothermal imaging are determined. In this thesis, we report a spatial resolution much smaller than the diffraction limited spot size of the mid-infrared beam. 2018 - 07 - 09 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
40|$|Much {{interest}} {{has been paid}} to develop a variety of radiation-crosslinked hydrated polymeric <b>materials,</b> which <b>swell</b> in water but do not dissolve, as biocompatible materials used for wound healing, drug delivery system, surface-coating material for medically used devices, etc. With the aim of establishing design rules to produce hydrogels of controlled size at the nanoscale and desired internal network structure using conventional electron accelerators and set-ups, here we attempt a description in terms of structural and dynamic properties of polymer networks generated through e-beam irradiation of aqueous solutions of the same model polymer, a commercial grade poly(N-vinyl-pyrrolidone), subjected to e-beam irradiation with a 12 MeV Linac accelerator, at same dose (40 kGy) and dose-rate (100 kGy/h) and at the variance of polymer concentration in water. Concentration has been systematically varied from above (10, 8, 6, 4, 2 % w) to below (1, 0. 5, 0. 25, 0. 1, 0. 05 % w) the critical chain overlap concentration value (~ 1 %w) of the chosen polymer in water, as estimated by intrinsic viscosity measurements. The transition between macroscopic gelation and micro-/nanogels formation is observed just below the critical overlap concentration (0. 5 %w), whereas the net prevalence of intra-molecular over inter-molecular crosslinking occurs at a polymer concentration below 0. 25 % w, as revealed by both dynamic and static laser light scattering measurements. Significant structural differences between nanoscalar “finite” crosslinked networks and macrogels are evidenced by both FTIR and solid state NMR spectra. Polymeric segments mobility of the formed networks, at the different scales, has been assessed through stress-rheometry, solid-state cross-polarization times and nuclear relaxation time NMR studies of the freeze-dried residues...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{suitability}} of different materials as polymeric seals in the Nuclear Industry three commercial samples of nitrile rubber at grades BA 40, BA 50, and BA 60 have been tested. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to find the glass transition temperature (Tg) and a Lloyds Texture Analyser 500 (TA 500) was used to find the ratio of energy returned during relaxation against energy applied during compression. The mechanical properties determined from these experiments were then compared against the materials infrared spectra to infer structural characteristics. These were in turn cross-analyzed against the <b>materials</b> ability to <b>swell</b> in a liquid solvent and absorption behavior in a gaseous solvent. From this information, a statement could be made about each material's capacity to perform as a seal. It was thus found that the high energy retention and low absorption characteristics of BA 40 made this material the best choice out of those studied {{for use as a}} polymeric seal in the nuclear industry. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
