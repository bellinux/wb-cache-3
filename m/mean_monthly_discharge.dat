The daily rainfall-runoff model Hron which was developed at the Department of Land and Water Resources Management, SUT Bratislava, was used. The model was calibrated on a period between 1981 - 1995 and validated on 1996 - 2010 For the simulation of the possible impact of climate change, the KNMI and MPI climate change scenarios, which illustrate changes in daily precipitation, daily air temperature and the average air humidity in the river basin for future periods, were used.

40|$|Ideally, {{the results}} from models {{operating}} at different scales should agree in trend direction and magnitude of impacts under climate change. However, this implies that the sensitivity to climate variability and climate change is comparable for impact models designed for either scale. In this study, we compare hydrological changes simulated by 9 global and 9 regional hydrological models (HM) for 11 large river basins in all continents under reference and scenario conditions. The foci are on model validation runs, sensitivity of annual discharge to climate variability in the reference period, and sensitivity of the long-term average monthly seasonal dynamics to climate change. One major {{result is that the}} global models, mostly not calibrated against observations, often show a considerable bias in <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>discharge,</b> whereas regional models show a better reproduction of reference conditions. However, the sensitivity of the two HM ensembles to climate variability is in general similar. The simulated climate change impacts in terms of long-term average monthly dynamics evaluated for HM ensemble medians and spreads show that the medians are to a certain extent comparable in some cases, but have distinct differences in other cases, and the spreads related to global models are mostly notably larger. Summarizing, this implies that global HMs are useful tools when looking at large-scale impacts of climate change and variability. Whenever impacts for a specific river basin or region are of interest, e. g. for complex water management applications, the regional-scale models calibrated and validated against observed discharge should be used. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrech...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the extraordinary difficulties met in gauging glacier streams and establishes criteria {{that have to}} be fulfilled for a correct determination of glacier run off. Discussion of the hydraulic principles of gauging in tranquil and rapid flow shows why the latter is to be favored for glacier streams. The concept of the station at Vernagtbach, the original stream bed, considerations of proper dimensioning and characteristics of the construction of the gauging channel are described in detail. A brief history is given of planning, organization and technology involved. The water level is recorded by two floats and one pneumatic gauge which together provide uninterrupted and trouble-free records. The rating curve was determined with current meters and shows an unambiguous relation between water level and discharge with little scattering of calibration values. Temporary changes of flow conditions up-stream of the station do not have any noticeable effect on the water level in the channel.

In the paper, {{based on data}} mining theory and technology, we analyse hydrological daily discharge time series of the Shaligunlanke Station in the Tarim River Basin in China from the year 1961 to 2000. Firstly, according to the four monthly statistics, namely <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>discharge,</b> monthly maximum discharge, monthly amplitude and monthly standard deviation, K-mean clustering was used to segment the annual process of the daily discharge. The clustering result showed that the annual process of the daily discharge {{can be divided into}} five segments: snowmelt period I (April), snowmelt period II (May), rainfall period I (June-August), rainfall period II (September) and dry period (October-December and January-March). Secondly, dynamic time warping (DTW), which is a different distance metric method from the traditional Euclidian distance metric, was used to look for similarities in the discharge process. On the basis of the similarity matrix, the similar discharge processes can be mined in each period. Thirdly, agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to cluster and discover the discharge patterns in terms of the autoregressive model. It was found that the discharge had a close relationship with the temperature and the precipitation, and the discharge processes were more similar under the same climatic condition. Our study shows that data mining is a feasible and efficient approach to discover the hidden information in the historical hydrological data and mining the implicative laws under the hydrological process.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of research into the transformation of series of hydro-meteorological data for determining dry periods with the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardised Discharge Index (SDI). Time series from eight precipitation stations and five series of river discharge data in Eastern Kujawy (central Poland) were analysed for 1951 – 2010. The frequency distribution of the series for their convergence with the normal distribution was tested with the Shapiro–Wilk test and homogeneity with the Bartlett's test. The transformation of the series was done with the Box–Cox technique, which made it possible to homogenise the series in terms of variance. In Poland, the technique has never been used to determine the SPI. After the transformation the distributions of virtually all series complied with the normal distribution and were homogeneous. Moreover, a statistically significant correlation between the δ transformation parameter and the skewness of the series of monthly precipitation was observed.

Various methodologies have been used to predict <b>monthly</b> <b>mean</b> river <b>discharges</b> that are based on "Predictive Analytics", an area of statistical analysis that studies the extraction of information from historical data to infer future trends and patterns. Our study couples the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with traditional methods, e. g. Autoregressive Model of Order 1 (AR 1) and Neural Networks (NN), to predict <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> river <b>discharges</b> in Colombia, South America. The EMD allows us to decompose the historical time series of river discharges into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) that capture the different oscillatory modes of different frequencies associated with the inherent time scales coexisting simultaneously in the signal (Huang et al. 1998, Huang and Wu 2008, Rao and Hsu, 2008). Our predictive method states that it is easier and simpler to predict each IMF at a time and then add them up together to obtain the predicted river discharge for a certain month, than predicting the full signal.

With a simple mixing model, we estimated how much hyporheic exchange cools the river during hot summer months. Hyporheic exchange was primarily identified by temperature anomalies, which are patches of water that demonstrate at least a 1 °C temperature difference from the main channel. Forty hyporheic temperature anomalies were identified through field investigations and thermal-infrared-radiometry (TIR) in summer 2006. The location of anomalies was associated with specific geomorphic features, primarily bar channels and bar heads that act as preferential pathways for hyporheic flow. Detailed field characterization and groundwater modelling on three Clackamas gravel bars indicate residence times of hyporheic water can vary from hours to weeks and months. This was largely determined by hydraulic conductivity, which is affected by how recently the gravel bar formed or was reworked. Upscaling of modelled discharges and hydrologic parameters from these bars to other anomalies on the Clackamas network shows that hyporheic discharge from anomalies comprises a small fraction (− 1 %) of mainstem discharge, resulting in small river-cooling effects (0 Ð 012 °C).

The mechanisms most important for generating floods included winter fronts, cutoff lows, tropical storms, snowmelt, and widespread and localized summer monsoon-related circulation patterns. When flood discharges were grouped into hydroclimatically homogeneous categories, histogram plots of their frequency distributions exhibited means and variances that differed from those of the overall frequency distribution of the entire flood series. The means of the discharges generated by frontal precipitation and tropical storms tended to plot above the mean of the overall series, while the means of floods generated by snowmelt tended to plot below the overall mean. Flood estimates computed from a series containing mixed distributions were not the same as flood estimates computed from climatically homogeneous subsets of the same series. These results have implications for traditional flood-frequency analysis and other stochastic methods of analyzing hydrologic time series. The hydroclimatically-defined subgroups in the flood series of the Gila River basin indicate that nonhomogeneity and nonstationarity can be imparted to a hydrologic time series by differing atmospheric mechanisms alone...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{highlight}} the impacts of the reservoirs on the low flow downstream of dams. It {{is based on the}} analysis of the flow data sets (<b>mean</b> daily and <b>monthly</b> <b>discharges,</b> minimum <b>monthly</b> <b>discharges)</b> provided by gauging stations located downstream four reservoirs in Romania: Gilău, Siriu Pecineagu and Surduc. Statistical methods and comparative analyzes of low flow parameters in natural regime and modified regime were mainly used. The results show that the impacts are differents from one case to another. Generally, the flow decrease significantly in modified regime, mainly in spring and summer periods (the breeding period for most aquatic species). This occurs downstream of the reservoirs Surduc, Gilău and Pecineagu. In the case of Siriu reservoir, the impact of the dam construction on the low flow is less significant, and the low flow in modified regime are higher that in natural regime...|$|R
