5|$|Like their German counterparts, Soviet {{divisions}} {{were also}} seriously understrength. For example, {{divisions in the}} 40th Army averaged 3,500–4,000 men each, while the 69th Army fielded some divisions which could only count on 1,000–1,500 soldiers. Some divisions had as little as 20–50 mortars to provide fire support. This shortage in <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> equipment led Vatutin's Southwestern Front to request over 19,000 soldiers and 300 tanks, while {{it was noted that}} the Voronezh Front had only received 1,600 replacements since the beginning of operations in 1943. By the time Manstein launched his counteroffensive, the Voronezh Front had lost so much <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> had overextended itself {{to the point where it}} could no longer offer assistance to the Southwestern Front, south of it.|$|E
5|$|The same historians {{would not}} {{consider}} the immense logistical effort fielded by the U.S. to sustain its military in Southeast Asia as a waste of <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> resources, even if only one American soldier in four assigned to South Vietnam served in the combat arms.|$|E
5|$|While these {{operations}} succeeded, {{the cost in}} terms of <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> resources was high. By {{the end of the}} year the military experienced shortages as a result of decreased American aid, while communist forces continued gaining strength.|$|E

5|$|A {{replacement}} for Melbourne was under consideration {{as early as}} 1956, and the question was revisited on several occasions until the 1980s. In every situation, a new aircraft carrier was turned down due to the increases in <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> operating costs required to operate the ship when compared to Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the siege}} {{consumed}} {{a large part}} of the Caliphate's <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine frontier in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured a fortress near Melitene and in 718 Amr ibn Qais raided the frontier. On the Byzantine side, the numbers are unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (which might have been neglected following his deposition), the Byzantines could count on the assistance of the Bulgars, with whom Leo concluded a treaty that possibly included alliance against the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1942 and November 1943, Groves paid monthly {{visits to}} the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Reports {{indicated}} that compared to the alternatives of a gaseous diffusion plant or a plutonium-producing nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic plant would take longer and require more scarce materials to build, and need more <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> more electricity to operate. The cost of a kilogram of fissile material would therefore be much greater. On the other hand, while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles, the electromagnetic process was proven to work, and could be built in stages that would immediately start producing fissile material. Groves cancelled the pilot plant on 14 November, in favor of proceeding immediately with the production plant.|$|E

5|$|By 1914 the Territorial Force {{had some}} 30,000 men {{involved}} in divisional level training camps; two years previously, the <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> logistical {{constraints of the}} force was such that only battalion level camps could be achieved. When General Ian Hamilton, the Inspector General of Overseas Forces, visited New Zealand in 1914, he {{was impressed with the}} level of preparedness of the country's military. This reflected positively on Godley's work, and he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} of the insurgency, the MNLA had largely split into small groups of guerrillas, which existed by basing {{themselves}} in a chosen rural area, subverting local villagers and accumulating from them <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> supplies. The lot of any security forces posted nearby was to play a constant game of hide-and-seek with the communists, whereby the army would indefinitely search for and destroy any base camps and food caches the MNLA set up. The Commonwealth leaders surmised that the MNLA could not possibly resist such a campaign forever, and would, in time, simply give up attempting to regroup.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the success}} of VIII Corps attack, I Corps would then launch two {{supporting}} operations codenamed Aberlour and Ottawa. In the former the 3rd Infantry Division, supported by a Canadian infantry brigade, would attack north of Caen; the latter would be a move by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade to take the village and airfield of Carpiquet. Originally planned for 22 June, Epsom was postponed until 26 June, to make up deficiencies in <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> materiel. The initial opposition was expected to come from the depleted 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend ("Hitler Youth"), elements of the 21st Panzer Division, and the Panzer Lehr.|$|E

5|$|For the Americans, Laos {{became almost}} {{exclusively}} an air war, one which saw {{a reversal of}} the role it played in the conflict in neighboring South Vietnam. In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. The mission of the U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, a {{war broke}} out between Pangala' and Baruppu', a {{neighbouring}} state led by Pasusu. Tiku took {{an active role in}} a successful campaign against the neighbouring state, and when Pasusu was defeated Tiku took his place as ruler of Baruppu'. The newly annexed kingdom was rich in rice fields and easily defensible, giving Tiku great power. Although the Torajans traditionally valued <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> did not kill more people than necessary, Baruppu' oral history describes Tiku as killing men, women, and children with abandon.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force {{was small}} enough {{for all its}} {{elements}} to be directly controlled by RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. After war broke out, the RAAF began to decentralise its command structure, commensurate with expected increases in <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> units. Between March 1940 and May 1941, it divided Australia and Papua into four geographically based command-and-control zones: Central Area, Southern Area, Western Area, and Northern Area. The roles of these area commands were air defence, protection of adjacent sea lanes, and aerial reconnaissance. Each was led by an Air Officer Commanding (AOC) responsible for the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary.|$|E

5|$|Rolling {{resistance}} {{is also the}} reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During {{the time of the}} Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> water than a cart pulled by oxen.|$|E
5|$|The Inchon {{landings}} were {{a crushing}} blow for the North Korean Army, catching it completely unprepared and breaking the already weak forces along the perimeter. With virtually no equipment, exhausted <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> low morale, the North Koreans {{were at a}} severe disadvantage and {{were not able to}} continue to pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, the North Koreans were in full retreat from the Pusan Perimeter, with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way.|$|E
5|$|Time {{constraints}} prevented {{many elements}} from {{appearing in the}} final game. One such missing feature was a fatality system by which Spartans or Covenant leaders could inflict massive damage on large groups of units. Pottinger said that the animations, while interesting, did not mesh with the fast-paced combat of Halo Wars and raised balance concerns. Other elements based on Halo fiction did not work in a strategy game. Although more than 100 people worked on the project, which cost {{tens of millions of}} dollars, a Covenant campaign was never realized {{because of a lack of}} <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> money.|$|E

5|$|Very heavy {{strategic}} bombing by the Allies targeted refineries producing {{synthetic oil}} and gasoline {{as well as}} the German transportation system, especially rail yards and canals. The armaments industry began to break down by September 1944. By November, fuel coal was no longer reaching its destinations and the production of new armaments was no longer possible.

5|$|After he {{left the}} military, Barrowclough {{returned}} to his legal career. His law firm had suffered {{during the war years}} through a lack of <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> the rebuilding of his practice occupied much of his time. In 1953, he moved to Wellington to take up an appointment as Chief Justice of New Zealand. The following year, he received an honorary doctorate in law from Otago. He also {{became a member of the}} Privy Council, was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to New Zealand in 1954. While Chief Justice, he established the permanent Court of Appeal for New Zealand. After his retirement in January 1966 Barrowclough returned to Auckland where he died on 4 March 1972 at the age of 77. He was survived by three children. His wife, Mary, who he had married in 1921, predeceased him in 1964.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of {{manpower}} led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of <b>manpower</b> <b>and</b> the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E
