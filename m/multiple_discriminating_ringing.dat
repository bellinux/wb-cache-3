They also have impacts on capital flows and utilisation of corporate borrowers. Therefore, {{it is essential}} to establish a scientific, objective, and accurate model of credit ratings for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) of the banking industry. The correct results of customers' ratings can serve as an important reference in the CRM of banks. This paper applies two classification methods, <b>Multiple</b> <b>Discriminate</b> Analysis (MDA) and Rough Set Theory (RST), to analyse and compare a total of 70 entries of corporate credit data. The result shows that the RST classification model boasts better classifying effects and is suitable for the analysis of credit ratings in the banking industry.

40|$|The Support Vector Machine (SVM) {{has been}} a popular {{classification}} method in machine learning and has enjoyed great successes for many applications. How-ever, the standard SVM cannot select variables automatically and consequently its solution typically utilizes all input variables. This {{makes it difficult to}} identify important variables which are predictive of the response and can be a concern for many problems. In this paper, we propose a novel type of regularization for the multicategory SVM (MSVM), which automates the process of variable selection and results in a classifier with enhanced interpretability and improved accuracy, especially for high dimensional low sample size data. The MSVM generally re-quires estimation of <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminating</b> functions and applies the argmax rule for prediction. For each individual variable, we propose to characterize its impor-tance by the supnorm of its coefficient vector associated with different functions, and then minimize the MSVM hinge loss function subject to a penalty on the sum of supnorms. The adaptive regularization, which imposes different penalties on different variables, is studied as well. Moreover, we develop an algorithm to compute the proposed supnorm MSVM effectively. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and an application to microarray gene expression data.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims at {{developing}} {{an early warning}} signal model for predicting corporate default in emerging market economy like India. At the same time, it also aims to present methods for directly estimating corporate probability of default (PD) using financial as well as non-financial variables. Design/methodology/approach – <b>Multiple</b> <b>Discriminate</b> Analysis (MAD) is used for developing Z-score models for predicting corporate bond default in India. Logistic regression model is employed to directly estimate the probability of default. Findings – The new Z-score model developed in this paper depicted not only a high classification power on the estimated sample, but also exhibited a high predictive power {{in terms of its}} ability to detect bad firms in the holdout sample. The model clearly outperforms the other two contesting models comprising of Altman's original and emerging market set of ratios respectively in the Indian context. In the logit analysis, the empirical results reveal that inclusion of financial and non-financial parameters would be useful in more accurately describing default risk. Originality/value – Using the new Z-score model of this paper, banks, as well as investors in emerging market like India can get early warning signals about the firm's solvency status and might reassess the magnitude of the default premium they require on low-grade securities. The default probability estimate (PD) from the logistic analysis would help banks for estimation of credit risk capital (CRC) and setting corporate pricing on a risk adjusted return basis.

This study focused only two sectors, beverage food and tobacco and manufacturing out of 20 sectors in CSE. The sample size of study is 25 companies and a period of five years from 2006 to 2010. The required data and information for the study were gathered from published annual reports, handbook of listed companies. The growth of the companies is represented by assets growth, profit growth and sales growth, which were calculated using growth index. Altman (1968) <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminate</b> function was constructed to ascertain the financial strength of sample companies. Both correlation and regression model were used to analyze the data. According to the results of the analysis, the researcher found that the assets growth, profit growth and financial strength are positively related with financial leverage and sales growth is negatively related with financial leverage in beverage food and tobacco sector. But, in manufacturing sector, the assets growth and profit growth negatively related with financial leverage and sales growth and financial strength are positively related with financial leverage. So, to get an optimum capital structure and favorable performance, the growth opportunities and effects of debt overhung should be recognized by capital market.

This study addresses the following research questions: Do differences exist between levels of perceived environmental change/uncertainty and users of middle-up-down and top-down strategy implementation approaches? And, does this relationship become more meaningful when ownership, firm structure and foodservice segment characteristics are considered? There has been very little research on the food service industry that assesses {{the relationship between}} eleven task environment measures of complexity and dynamism {{and the use of}} a predominately top-down or middle-up-down approach to the implementation of strategies. Using a sample of food industry managers, <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminate</b> analysis (MDA) was used to predict the use of implementation strategies. Substantive differences appear to exist between levels of perceived environmental change/uncertainty and users of middle-up-down and top-down strategy implementation approaches for foodservice firms. The ability to correctly classify users of middle-up-down and top-down approaches using a multivariate combination of environmental variables is improved radically when ownership, firm structure, and market segment classifications were are considered. Taken as a whole, the findings are most convincing and support the basic hypotheses. Study findings indicate that a broad brushstroke approach to determining whether a middle-updown or top-down is used or appropriate based on the perceived task environment may not be valuable. The results support previous findings in other industries in that the prediction is better for market segments served and the public versus private nature of the firms involved...|$|R
40|$|The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is {{a popular}} {{classification}} paradigm in machine learning and has achieved great success in real applications. However, the standard SVM can not select variables automatically and therefore its solution typically utilizes all the input variables without discrimination. This {{makes it difficult to}} identify important predictor variables, which is often one of the primary goals in data analysis. In this paper, we propose two novel types of regularization {{in the context of the}} multicategory SVM (MSVM) for simultaneous classification and variable selection. The MSVM generally requires estimation of <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminating</b> functions and applies the argmax rule for prediction. For each individual variable, we propose to characterize its importance by the supnorm of its coefficient vector associated with different functions, and then minimize the MSVM hinge loss function subject to a penalty on the sum of supnorms. To further improve the supnorm penalty, we propose the adaptive regularization, which allows different weights imposed on different variables according to their relative importance. Both types of regularization automate variable selection in the process of building classifiers, and lead to sparse multi-classifiers with enhanced interpretability and improved accuracy, especially for high dimensional low sample size data. One big advantage of the supnorm penalty is its easy implementation via standard linear programming. Several simulated examples and one real gene data analysis demonstrate the outstanding performance of the adaptive supnorm penalty in various data settings.

The existence of multiples limits the capabilities of inversion algorithms, thus suitable identification and suppression techniques should be applied to reduce this undesired effect. Assuming a scenario composed of loss-less and non-dispersive media, and providing an accurate time delay estimation (TDE) of backscattered signals, the proposed method allows not only to evaluate the presence of <b>multiples</b> and <b>discriminate</b> them from primary reflections, but also to determine their propagation paths.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the nature of the apparent inconsistency reported in the literature on the relationship between personality variables and indices of religiosity. The literature indicates that indices of religiosity have been associated with labels both of 2 ̆ 2 desirable 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 undesirable 2 ̆ 2 personality traits to varying degrees, and no definitive conclusions have been thus far reached. The study suggested that the inconsistent evidence has been a result of a narrow definition of personality functioning and a broad definition of religiosity that has not allowed an adequate test of the relationship between personality and religiosity. The study developed the notion that a multidimensional personality measure (California Psychological Inventory [...] CPI) paired with (1) a theoretically precise and psychometrically researched index of religiosity (i. e., Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale [...] IRMS) and (2) a traditional index of religiosity (i. e., denominational membership) might provide new information relative to the relationship between religiosity and personality. The CPI and the IRMS were administered to 108 male and female Baptist, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day-Saints (LOS) and Presbyterian denominational members. CPI subscale scores and IRMS scores were analyzed by a Pearson product-moment correlational analysis, a univariate analysis of variance, and a step-wise <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminate</b> analysis. Significant correlations between IRMS scores and CPI subscale scores were found; however the variance explained was not sufficient to be of theoretical use. There were statistically significant mean differences among denominations (Baptists, LOS, Presbyterians) and between types of religious motivation (intrinsics and extrinsics defined by an IRMS score median split) on the CPI subscales. It was noted that all CPI subscale means fell within the normal range and were not clinically significant. Subjects characterized by denominational membership and religious motivation were characterized by normal personality functioning. Discriminant functions were computed which predicted group membership based on the CPI subscales at accuracy level s between 63. 7...|$|R

40|$|In the {{assessment}} of financial risks of enterprises in the non-financial sphere, and in {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} in particular, it is recommended that the principles of Occam and KISS (keep it simple, stupid) be used as guidelines. The application of these principles in relation to the choice of the methods of financial risks assessment means that mainly simple methods - and those known by enterprise specialists - should be used. These sufficiently simple methods are the following: special ratios method and expert examination method. The author evaluates the development of discriminant and conditional probability methods of financial risk assessment in nine East European countries. The usage of these methods enables small and medium-sized enterprises to assess, predict and manage risks related to liquidity, credit, decreasing financial stability and insolvency/bankruptcy. In doing this research we applied an approach built on conditional probability models (logit and probit analysis) on source reviews and the author's own experience. Selection and assessment of the described models of insolvency/bankruptcy and provisions of financial risk assessment are based on the author's personal opinion. The chapter proceeds as follows: after the introduction in Section 2 the financial risk definition is introduced and a three-level classification of financial risk is presented. Next, in Section 3 the development of financial ratios will be described and a review of using classic models for assessing insolvency/bankruptcy, <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminate</b> analysis (MDA) type models and their development in nine countries of Europe are given.

Tests to assess the risks to the enterprises at different stages of the life cycle will also be discussed. At the end of chapter 4 a case study of the risk occurrence reasons is provided. It is possible to position these factors on a scale of risk probabilities by employing expert assessment. In Section 5 a critical evaluation of the methods of measuring the financial risks of enterprises in the non-financial sphere are discussed and future ideas are given.

Previous modeling studies have attributed patterning in the Everglades (Florida, USA) to sediment redistribution and anisotropic soil hydraulic properties. In this work, we tested an alternate theory, the self-organizing-canal (SOC) hypothesis, by developing a cellular automata model that simulates pattern evolution via local positive feedbacks (i. e., facilitation) coupled with a global negative feedback based on hydrology. The model is forced by global hydroperiod that drives stochastic transitions between two patch types: ridge (higher elevation) and slough (lower elevation). We evaluated model performance using multiple criteria based on six statistical and geostatistical properties observed in reference portions of the Everglades landscape: patch density, patch anisotropy, semivariogram ranges, power-law scaling of ridge areas, perimeter area fractal dimension, and characteristic pattern wavelength. Model results showed strong statistical agreement with reference landscapes, but only when anisotropically acting local facilitation was coupled with hydrologic global feedback, for which several plausible mechanisms exist. Critically, the model correctly generated fractal landscapes that had no characteristic pattern wavelength, supporting the invocation of global rather than scale-specific negative feedbacks...|$|R

We developed an all-in-one web-based tool for genotyping Mtb, {{referred to as}} the Total Genotyping Solution for TB (TGS-TB), to facilitate multiple genotyping platforms using NGS for spoligotyping and the detection of phylogenies with core genomic SNVs, IS 6110 insertion sites, and 43 customized loci for variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) through a user-friendly, simple click interface. This methodology is implemented with a KvarQ script to predict MTBC lineages/sublineages and potential antimicrobial resistance. Seven Mtb isolates (JP 01 to JP 07) in this study showing the same VNTR profile were accurately discriminated through median-joining network analysis using SNVs unique to those isolates. An additional IS 6110 insertion was detected in one of those isolates as supportive genetic information in addition to core genomic SNVs. The results of in silico analyses using TGS-TB are consistent with those obtained using conventional molecular genotyping methods, suggesting that NGS short reads could provide <b>multiple</b> genotypes to <b>discriminate</b> <b>multiple</b> strains of Mtb, although longer NGS reads (≥ 300 -mer) will be required for full genotyping on the TGS-TB web site.

Our method has also reduced the error rate (by ~ 12 %) at the transition phase of gestures which could improve robustness of gesture recognition when continuous classification from sEMG is required...|$|R
40|$|Directional {{filters are}} not {{normally}} used as pre-filters for optical flow estimation because orientation selectivity tends {{to increase the}} aperture problem. Despite this fact, here we apply a subband decomposition using directional spatio-temporal filters at di#erent resolutions to <b>discriminate</b> <b>multiple</b> motions at the same location. We first obtain multiple estimates of the velocity by applying the classic gradient constraint to the output of each filter (a bank of 6 directional second order Gaussian derivatives-GD 2 - at 3 spatial scales). Spatio-temporal gradients of GD 2 channel responses are easily obtained as linear combinations of the set of 10 separable GD 3 channel responses, which constitutes a multipurpose scheme for visual representation of image sequences. Then, we obtain an overdetermined linear system by imposing local constant velocity. This system is solved by least-squares yielding {{an estimate of the}} velocity and its covariance matrix (a 2 D confidence measure). After segme [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present and}} discuss an {{algorithm}} {{to identify and}} characterize the long icosahedral structures (staggered pentagonal nanowires with 1 - 5 - 1 - 5 atomic structure) that appear in Molecular Dynamics simulations of metallic nanowires of different species subjected to stretching. The use of the algorithm allows the identification of pentagonal rings forming the icosahedral structure {{as well as the}} determination of its number, and the maximum length of the pentagonal nanowire. The algorithm is tested with some ideal structures to show its ability to <b>discriminate</b> between pentagonal <b>rings</b> and other ring structures. We applied the algorithm to Ni nanowires with temperatures ranging between 4 K and 865 K, stretched along the [100] direction. We studied statistically the formation of pentagonal nanowires obtaining the distributions of the maximum length and number of rings as function of the temperature. The pentagonal nanowire maximum length distribution presents a peaked shape, with peaks locate at fixes distances whose separa-tion corresponds to the distance between two consecutive pentagonal rings.
