5000|$|... 3. Adequate vessel {{diameter}} and height or length to allow {{most of the}} liquid to separate from the gas so that the <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> will not be flooded.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. A {{vessel that}} {{includes}} (a) primary separation device and/or section, (b) secondary “gravity” settling (separating) section, (c) <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> to remove small liquid particles from the gas, (d) gas outlet, (e) liquid settling (separating) section to remove gas or vapor from oil (on a three-phase unit, this section also separates water from oil), (f) oil outlet, and (g) water outlet (three-phase unit).|$|E
50|$|If a {{gas stream}} {{carrying}} liquid mist flows {{in a circular}} motion at sufficiently high velocity, centrifugal force throws the liquid mist outward against {{the walls of the}} container. Here the liquid coalesces into progressively larger droplets and finally gravitates to the liquid section below. Centrifugal force {{is one of the most}} effective methods of separating liquid mist from gas. However, according to Keplinger (1931), some separator designers have pointed out a disadvantage in that a liquid with a free surface rotating as a whole will have its surface curved around its lowest point lying on the axis of rotation. This created false level may cause difficulty in regulating the fluid level control on the separator. This is largely overcome by placing vertical quieting baffles which should extend from the bottom of the separator to above the outlet. Efficiency of this type of <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> increases as the velocity of the gas stream increases. Thus for a given rate of throughput, a smaller centrifugal separator will suffice.|$|E
3000|$|Wire mesh, vane {{type and}} {{cyclonic}} separators are standard as <b>mist</b> <b>extractors</b> {{for the small}} liquid droplets that are not separated by gravity in {{the main body of}} the separator (Gas Processors Suppliers Association 2004). These cyclones are used for water and condensate removal but have not been applied for removing condensed contaminants, such as CO_ 2 or H_ 2 S. [...] This is because cyclones can only handle condensing droplet sizes above 10  μm (Gas Processors Suppliers Association 2004; Clift 1997; Svarovsky 1984). To achieve such droplet, sizes requires unrealistically large droplet growth pipes. It is well known in laboratory chemical applications that microcyclones can separate micron-sized droplets having diameters as small as 1 μm, but then the flow is very small and orders of magnitude less than the flow in gas well applications. Alternatively, one can improve separation efficiency by increasing swirl velocity to supersonic velocity but at the costs of large pressure drops (Schinkelshoek et al. 2008).|$|R
50|$|The three {{configurations}} of separators {{are available for}} two-phase operation and three-phase operation. In the two-phase units, gas is separated from the liquid with the gas and liquid being discharged separately. Oil and gas separators are mechanically designed such that the liquid and gas components are separated from the hydrocarbon steam at specific temperature and pressure according to Arnold et al (2008). In three-phase separators, well fluid is separated into gas, oil, and water with the three fluids being discharged separately. The gas-liquid separation section of the separator {{is determined by the}} maximum removal droplet size using the Souders-Brown equation with an appropriate K factor. The oil-water separation section is held for a retention time that is provided by laboratory test data, pilot plant operating procedure, or operating experience. In the case where the retention time is not available, the recommended retention time for three-phase separator in API 12J is used. The sizing methods by K factor and retention time give proper separator sizes. According to Song et al (2010), engineers sometimes need further information for the design conditions of downstream equipment, i.e., liquid loading for the <b>mist</b> <b>extractor,</b> water content for the crude dehydrator/desalter or oil content for the water treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Natural gas {{is lighter}} than liquid hydrocarbon. Minute {{particles}} of liquid hydrocarbon that are temporarily suspended {{in a stream}} of natural gas will, by density difference or force of gravity, settle out of the stream of gas if the velocity of the gas is sufficiently slow. The larger droplets of hydrocarbon will quickly settle out of the gas, but the smaller ones will take longer. At standard conditions of pressure and temperature, the droplets of liquid hydrocarbon may have a density 400 to 1,600 times that of natural gas. However, as the operating pressure and temperature increase, the difference in density decreases. At an operating pressure of 800 psig, the liquid hydrocarbon may be only 6 to 10 times as dense as the gas. Thus, operating pressure materially affects {{the size of the}} separator and the size and type of <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> required to separate adequately the liquid and gas. The fact that the liquid droplets may have a density 6 to 10 times that of the gas may indicate that droplets of liquid would quickly settle out of and separate from the gas. However, this may not occur because the particles of liquid may be so small that they tend to [...] "float" [...] in the gas and may not settle out of the gas stream in the short period of time the gas is in the oil and gas separator. As the operating pressure on a separator increases, the density difference between the liquid and gas decreases. For this reason, it is desirable to operate oil and gas separators at as low a pressure as is consistent with other process variables, conditions, and requirements.|$|E
30|$|The {{efficiency}} of the optimum vessel configuration (Case 3) was improved due to installation of a vane-type inlet diverter, perforated plates and a high-performance <b>mist</b> <b>extractor.</b>|$|E
30|$|As we {{mentioned}} before, a perforated plate and a <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> were modeled inside the gas zone of Case 7 (ref. Figure  1 a). In the <b>mist</b> <b>extractor,</b> liquid droplets coalesce and {{fall to the}} liquid zone (Stewart and Arnold 2008). In addition, perforated plates are used to improve the flow distribution, increase the liquid residence time and enhance the separation (Lu et al. 2007; Laleh et al. 2012 a, b). As a result, the mass distribution of the condensate and water droplets slightly reduced after passing through the above-mentioned internals of Case 7.|$|E
30|$|The {{original}} <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> {{is a type}} E {{wire mesh}} demister. In this study, based on Helsør and Svendsen (2007) work, the porosity, viscosity resistance coefficient and the inertial resistance coefficient of the <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> were set at 97.7 %, 3.84 e 6 m− 2 and 126 m− 1, respectively. Moreover, the flow distribution baffle was modeled as a perforated plate with a free area of 40 % and an inertial resistance factor of 1822.1 m− 1. Note that the properties of internals {{were taken from the}} configuration of the existing NIOC separator for validation purposes.|$|E
30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Table  3, Cases 3, 6 and 7 {{have the}} same seam to seam length and diameter. However, these vessels are {{equipped}} with different internals. A spherical inlet diverter is used for Case 3, while Case 6 is equipped with a vane-type inlet diverter. In addition, Case 7 is equipped with a vane-type inlet diverter, perforated plates and a high-efficiency <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> device. The comparison between these cases could highlight the effect of different internals on the three-phase separation performance. It should also be emphasized that Case 7 has the dimensions and internals quite similar to those of an industrial separator currently in use for one of the Iranian oil fields. The results obtained from this vessel were reviewed in a CFD evaluation. The overall arrangement of this separator (Case 7) is shown in Fig.  1 b. Note that the <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> device and perforated plates were modeled as the porous zone, while the curved plates were used for modeling of the vane-type inlet diverter.|$|E
30|$|There {{are also}} a few {{publications}} that made use of the Eulerian–Lagrangian method. Laleh et al. (2011) applied numerical calculations to study the fluid flow behavior in two-phase separators. In their paper, two simulation approaches, the DPM model and a combination of VOF and DPM model, were used to simulate the multiphase flow. In addition, the k–ε turbulence model was used because of its simplicity and achieved accuracy. Their simulation results demonstrated {{that the combination of}} VOF and DPM models was more reliable than the DPM model with respect to predicted separation efficiency. Laleh et al. (2012 a, b, 2013) used DPM, VOF and k–ε turbulence models to develop a realistic CFD simulation in order to debottleneck a three-phase separator. In that study, the flow-distributing baffles and the <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> were modeled as porous media. However, the results of the CFD simulation and the experimental data were not compared in their work.|$|E
30|$|Considering the {{above-mentioned}} results {{in conjunction with}} the total cost of the separator, it was decided to opt for Case 3 as the best configuration. It should be mentioned that the smaller the diameter, the less the vessel will weigh and therefore the lower it cost (Stewart and Arnold 2008; Mulyandasari 2011). A high condensate–water separation performance along with a low water content at the condensate outlet was predicted for this case. In addition, the high condensate percentage at the gas outlet in this case could have been decreased by using a suitable <b>mist</b> <b>extractor.</b> It should also emphasize that vessel number three can effectively handle increasing the gas and water flow rates. The dimensions of this vessel were compared with the length and diameter of the existing three-phase separator of NIOC, which was a three-phase horizontal separator with a seam to seam length of 5000  mm and a diameter of 1850  mm. No difference in dimensions of the Case 3 and existing vessel was observed.|$|E
30|$|On {{production}} units, a multiphase separator is {{the first}} surface equipment {{which is used to}} separate the produced wellhead fluid into the liquid and gas fractions. Inappropriate design of three-phase separators is a major obstacle to stable hydrocarbon processing and leads to reduce the efficiency of the entire surface equipment such as: heaters, exchangers and pressure maintenance equipment. When sizing a horizontal separator, it is necessary to choose a seam to seam vessel length and a diameter (Stewart and Arnold 2008). In the semiempirical method, the separator length and diameter are chosen, in order to allow different phases to separate from each other and reach an equilibrium. Much work has been conducted to investigate the aspects of designing three-phase separators (GPSA 1998; Smith 1987; Gerunda 1981 and Watkins 1967). Bothamley (2013 a, b, c) conducted a complete study for quantifying the separation performance. The effects of different types of momentum breaker and <b>mist</b> <b>extractor</b> device, feed pipe velocity, particle-size distribution and the main vessel dimensions were discussed in their work.|$|E
