40|$|Subsea {{infrastructure}} for deep-water {{oil and gas}} developments is often supported by <b>mudmat</b> foundations. Traditionally, subsea mudmats are designed to resist the loads imposed by pipeline {{thermal expansion and contraction}} while remaining stationary. As subsea facilities have grown, the required size andweight of the mudmats challenge the handling capacity of installation vessels and raise costs. Tolerable mobility of a subsea <b>mudmat</b> can significantly relieve the applied loads, leading to reduced <b>mudmat</b> size and weight. In this paper, the cyclic shearing and reconsolidation response of fine-grained soil around a tolerably mobile <b>mudmat</b> is investigated through results of finite-element analysis using a critical state soil model. The <b>mudmat</b> was subjected to a simulated lifetime of operation, with many cycles of undrained sliding with intervening consolidation between cycles. The sliding resistance was shown to rise exponentially with cycles and reach the drained limit, accompanied by significant strength gain in the subsoil because of the intervening consolidation between movements. The degree of reconsolidation between slides affects the number of cycles required to mobilise the drained limit. The hardening response for periodic shearing with intervening consolidation is shown to scale from the hardening response for continuous undrained shearing by an amount depending on the degree of intervening consolidation during pipeline operation. Expressions for the rate of hardening of sliding resistance of a tolerably mobile <b>mudmat</b> foundation are proposed in this paper to assist design practice. </p...|$|E

It is a low-growing, mat-forming invasive aquatic plant that has remained largely under the radar due to its small size and the public’s lack of familiarity with it.

40|$|Two- and {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} analyses are performed {{to identify the}} optimal internal skirt spacing for the maximum undrained capacity of subsea skirted <b>mudmats.</b> Fully three-dimensional loading (vertical, biaxial horizontal, biaxial moment and torsion) is considered for subsea <b>mudmats</b> with skirt embedment ranging from 5 % to 20 % of the foundation breadth in soil {{with a range of}} linearly increasing strength with depth. The results have identified the governing case for determining the optimal skirt spacing for <b>mudmats</b> subjected to fully three-dimensional loading. It is also shown that optimal skirt spacing for rectangular or square <b>mudmats</b> can be determined in plane strain conditions using the equivalent foundation embedment ratio. The number of internal skirts required to ensure soil plug rigidity under fully three-dimensional loading is presented as a function of skirt embedment ratio, soil heterogeneity index and vertical load mobilisation. Results also indicate that effects of skirt roughness become negligible as foundation embedment ratio increases in terms of determining the optimal skirt spacing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental work}} and numerical analysis {{that has been}} undertaken to assess the bearing capacity of perforated offshore foundations. Perforated foundations {{may be used to}} support subsea infrastructure, including as <b>mudmats</b> into which a number of perforations have been made, or as grillages which consist of a series of structurally connected strip footings. Larger gravity base foundations, such as for offshore wind turbines or oil and gas platforms, may adopt a single central perforation. The advantages of using perforated foundations can include reduced material requirements and easier offshore handling as a result of smaller weight and lower hydrodynamic forces during deployment. Limited guidance currently exists for assessing the bearing capacity of these foundation types. Bearing capacity of perforated foundations has been examined in this thesis under conditions of combined vertical, horizontal and moment loading which is typical in offshore settings. Undrained soil conditions have been considered, except for the case of grillages in which drained conditions are often most relevant. Experimental work has included centrifuge testing of ring and square annular foundations on clay, and 1 g testing of grillage foundations on sand. Finite element modelling has also been undertaken to assess perforated foundation capacity. A Tresca material subroutine (UMAT) and an adaptive meshing scheme have been developed to improve the accuracy of the finite element analysis carried out. The results showed that perforated foundations can be an efficient foundation solution for accommodating combined loading. As a ratio of their vertical load capacity, perforated foundations may be able to withstand higher moment and horizontal loads compared with unperforated foundations. The experimental and numerical results have been used to develop design expressions that could be employed by practitioners to estimate the vertical and combined load bearing capacity of these foundation types.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with four different types of offshore foundations, namely gravity foundations, jack-up foundations, the <b>mudmats</b> for piled jacket structures and caisson foundations for jacket structures. In most applications, these can be idealised as circular rigid foundations. Unlike onshore foundations, offshore foundations are subjected to large horizontal and moment loads. This research used the finite element method to examine the elastic behaviour and stability of circular footings under combined loading. Due to the circular shape of the footings and the combination of vertical, horizontal and moment loads, three dimensional finite element analysis was used. In-depth analyses of the elastic behaviour of circular footings under combined loading (V,H,M) were performed. The vertical stiffness coefficient was investigated using two dimensional axi-symmetric analyses whereas three dimensional analyses were {{used to examine the}} other coefficients. Different features of offshore foundations such as footing embedment and cone angle were taken into consideration. Based on the numerical results, a set of empirical expressions for elastic stiffness coefficient was derived. For footing stability calculations, large horizontal or moment loads can cause the footing to lose contact with the soil, or cause the footing to slide relative to the soil. In finite element analyses, this loss of contact and sliding are modelled by interface elements. A new zero-thickness iso-parametric interface element was formulated for both two and three dimensional analyses. An exact close formed solution for integration of the stress-strain relationship (for the two dimensional interface element) was found. The element is then used to explore footing stability. It was shown that by using a yield criteria which allows the interface to behave as either frictional or cohesive interface, depending upon the normal stress, numerical stability is achieved. The footing stability was examined by establishing the bearing capacity envelope. The envelopes for footings on undrained clays were established for surface flat strip footings and for surface flat circular footings. The effects of soil strength varying with depth, cone angle and embedment on the bearing capacity envelope were also investigated...|$|R
40|$|The results {{presented}} in this paper systematically quantify shape effects on undrained capacity of rectangular <b>mudmat</b> foundations under multi-directional loading for a practical range of soil shear strength heterogeneity. <b>Mudmat</b> foundations are extensively deployed to support infrastructure for subsea production systems, are typically rectangular in plan, ranging from square to a width-to-length aspect ratio of 0. 2, and are subject to multi-directional loading from the attached pipelines and jumpers. The load-carrying capacity of rectangular mudmats on deposits with undrained shear strength linearly increasing with depth is analysed by the finite-element method, and {{presented in}} the form of ‘failure envelopes’. The results show that shape effects are significant and are dependent on the degree of soil strength heterogeneity and loading direction (relative to the orthogonal axes of the <b>mudmat).</b> General algebraic expressions are established that systematically define the coupled effects of width-to-length aspect ratio of the mudmats and the degree of strength heterogeneity of the subsoil. Expressions describing the uniaxial ultimate limit states and the normalised failure envelopes under multi-directional loading can be programmed into a calculation tool for automating optimised <b>mudmat</b> sizing for a range of foundation geometry and soil strength heterogeneity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Rectangular <b>mudmat</b> {{foundations}} {{are frequently}} used for supporting subsea structures for offshore {{oil and gas}} developments. The self-weight of the subsea structure and <b>mudmat</b> often mobilise a relatively small proportion of the vertical bearing capacity and horizontal–torsional sliding generally represents the governing load case. However, the effect of torsion on <b>mudmat</b> capacity is not explicitly considered in current guidelines for geotechnical design of offshore foundations. In this paper, upper-bound plastic limit analysis is used to develop explicit expressions for the combined horizontal and torsional capacity of skirted mudmats. The results of the limit analyses are compared with results from finite-element analysis, and with other published solutions. A method is proposed for estimating the translational sliding resistance from the interaction diagram for biaxial horizontal loading and a unique expression is proposed to define the normalised H–T failure envelope. The effects of foundation aspect ratio, foundation embedment ratio, skirt–soil interface roughness, direction of horizontal loading and degree of soil strength heterogeneity are investigated systematically. </p...|$|E
40|$|Rectangular shallow {{foundations}} {{known as}} mudmats {{are commonly used}} in the offshore oil and gas industry. They are often subject to large horizontal forces that can also give rise to overturning and torsional moments. This paper focuses on analysing the ultimate capacity of a rigid rectangular <b>mudmat</b> resting on the surface of, or embedded in, homogeneous undrained clay. Realistic three-dimensional load combinations are applied, based on the combined horizontal, moment and torsional loading generated by a horizontal force applied within the envelope of the <b>mudmat</b> and the equipment that it supports. Analytical lower- and upper-bound plasticity calculations are performed for a surface footing under combined horizontal and torsional loading, while embedded footings and more complex loading arrangements are considered using three-dimensional finite-element limit analysis. The undrained soil is modelled as a rigid–plastic von Mises material, and the interface between the external sides of the <b>mudmat</b> and the soil is modelled with both unlimited and zero tension capacity. Design charts are presented and relationships between loading combinations and failure mechanisms are explored...|$|E
40|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of the foundation is reduced in combination with horizontal loads and moments, and can be further reduced when torsion moment is applied. Therefore, torsion moment {{must be taken into}} account when calculating the loading capacity. This is particularly relevant for offshore foundations (underwater structures), since torsion is often of considerable size. The aim of this thesis is to make a numerical study of a rectangular <b>mudmat</b> foundation subjected to vertical loading, horizontal loading and torsion moment. The numerical calculations were mainly calculated by the finite element program PLAXIS 3 D. Meanwhile, hand calculations of bearing capacities with Janbu and Davis & Booker methods are also carried out for comparison. The numerical studies were limited to undrained loading condition, where the undrained shear strength increases linearly with depth for a rectangular <b>mudmat</b> foundation; a) with outer skirts only b) with both outer and inner skirtsVertical and horizontal bearing capacities of <b>mudmat</b> foundation from finite element program PLAXIS 3 D correspond well with the hand calculation results by Janbu method. However, the vertical bearing capacities from PLAXIS 3 D are slightly higher than Janbu method, with a differencial value of 460 kN(Model 1) and 80 kN(Model 2), corresponding to a differencial of 6 % and 1 %, respectively. It may have several explanations:?	The results of finite element programs is dependent on network element and element type. Theoretically, the analyses of model with more fine meshes and smaller average element size would generate more accurate results. ?	PLAXIS 3 D bulids a real 3 -dimensional model, taking into consideration the 3 D effections. However, Janbu method is based on the plane strain. However, torsional {{bearing capacity}} from PLAXIS 3 D is almost twice the value determined from hand calculations, which may because of the conservative calculation method or some possible parametrical errors in PLAXIS 3 D. By intergrating the FEM analyses package PLAXIS 3 D with the Swipe test procedure of loading, the failure envelopes of <b>mudmat</b> foundation and approximating expressions are investigated. Through numerical computations and comparative analyses based on FEM, the two-dimensional failure envelopes of <b>mudmat</b> foundation are established by using proposed method to evaluate the stability of foundation under combined loadings. These results could be utilized to provide vital reference for the design and construction of <b>mudmat</b> foundation...|$|E
40|$|Large {{diameter}} piles {{have increasingly}} been used, especially for offshore foundations. Most of the piles {{that have been}} used offshore have been open-ended. There is evidence from previous work that closed-ended piles have merits over open-ended piles; they have a greater ultimate axial capacity and are easier to drive than open-ended piles of the same outer diameter. However, because a greater volume of soil is displaced, closed-ended piles give rise to much greater ground heave. This additional heave may cause unacceptable distortion to the structure as each leg is fixed to the sea-bed in turn. For this reason, this research was commissioned. Laboratory studies of ground heave around driven open- and closed-ended piles (16 mm o. d.) were carried out. Two different types of specimen reconstituted from Speswhite Kaolin were prepared; semi-cylindrical and full cylindrical specimens each 450 mm in diameter and about 450 mm in height. The semi-cylindrical specimens were used to obtain qualitative data about the movements of soil around the driven pile. The full cylindrical specimens were used to take accurate measurements of the ground heave during pile driving and to study the influence of the ground heave on a small surcharged collar through which a pile was driven. A further series of tests investigated the effect of ground heave when a group of piles was driven through a larger surcharged collar which was used to represent the <b>mudmat</b> of an offshore structure. The lateral movement of soil at around the mid-depth of a driven pile agreed with the cavity expansion model (plane strain analysis) assuming undrained conditions and no vertical movement. Closed-ended piles were found to generate about four times the magnitude of ground heave compared to open-ended piles with an area ratio of 34 %. Ground heave appeared to be unaffected by overconsolidation ratio and rate of pile driving (22 to 150 blows/min.). However, maximum vertical consolidation pressure seemed to have a small effect. A remarkably good agreement was obtained between the field data and the results of this investigation when both were made dimensionless. The surcharged collar and model <b>mudmat</b> generally settled during pile driving. However, when very low surcharge pressures were used, the collar and <b>mudmat</b> were lifted up. For pile groups, the surcharged <b>mudmat</b> tilted towards the pile being driven. The magnitude of this tilt for the <b>mudmat</b> was greater when closed-ended piles were used...|$|E
40|$|Mudmats {{are used}} in the {{offshore}} oil and gas industry to support subsea infrastructure for pipeline terminations and well manifolds. Expansion and contraction of connected pipelines and jumpers due to changing thermal and pressure conditions impose fully three-dimensional loading on the foundations, dominated by horizontal, moment and torsional loading rather than high vertical loads. The <b>mudmat</b> foundations are rectangular, and include shallow skirts in order to increase capacity, particularly for sliding. Offshore design guidelines for shallow foundations tend to excessive conservatism; optimisation of <b>mudmat</b> capacity under general loading has thus become critical in order to keep foundation footprints within the limits of current installation vessels. The paper presents an alternative design method, based on failure envelopes derived from an extensive programme of three-dimensional finite-element analyses, focusing on the sliding and rotational capacity of the foundation. Starting from expressions that quantify the uniaxial capacity under each of the six degrees of freedom, failure envelope shapes for different biaxial combinations are developed. Ultimately, the allowable capacity under the six-degree-of-freedom loading is expressed in terms of a two-dimensional failure envelope for the resultant horizontal and moment loading, after due allowance for the vertical and torsional components of load. </p...|$|E
40|$|Rectangular <b>mudmat</b> {{foundations}} are extensively {{deployed in}} deep waters to support subsea infrastructure leading to {{renewed interest in}} optimizing the design of offshore shallow foundations. Offshore mdustry guidelines (e. g. API RP 2 GEO and ISO 19901 - 4) are based on classical bearing capacity theory of a plane strain strip foundation resting {{on the surface of}} a uniform Tresca material. More realistic conditions are accounted for through a range of superposed empirical modification factors and the effective width principle. In practice, subsea foundations experience complex loading in six degrees-of-freedom (vertical load, biaxial horizontal load, biaxial moment and torsion), due to expansion and contraction of connected pipelines and jumpers; {{they may be able to}} mobilize transient tensile capacity; and they are typically three-dimensional in plan, shallowly embedded and founded on soft, nonnally consolidated, soils with linearly increasing strength with depth. Accurate determination of the ultimate limit state of subsea mudmats is best achieved by considering the relevant foundation, soil and loading boundary conditions explicitly. In this paper, a simplified approach for predicting the ultimate limit state of <b>mudmat</b> foundations under six degrees-of-freedom, based on failure envelopes, obtained from extensive finite element analyses, is compared with the traditional bearing capacity methods as recommended in industry guidelines. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} soil–foundation {{interface}} condition on the undrained capacity of rectangular <b>mudmat</b> foundations under loading in {{six degrees of}} freedom is investigated. Undrained failure envelopes for mudmats with zero-tension interface have been derived from finite-element analyses, and compared with the solutions from traditional methods and established for an unlimited-tension interface condition. The zero-tension interface has minimal effect on failure envelopes in the absence of moment, but significantly reduces the load-carrying capacity of mudmats under all other load paths that include moment. The traditional method for predicting the capacity of shallow foundations under multidirectional loading generally predicts lower capacity under any combined loading condition in comparison with the finite-element results for mudmats with zero-tension interface. Algebraic expressions are proposed to describe failure envelopes for mudmats with zero-tension interface. The proposed expressions can be implemented in an automated calculation tool to enable essentially instantaneous generation of failure envelopes and optimisation of a foundation design as a function of foundation dimension or material factor. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method to}} calculate the bearing and overturning capacity of a shallow foundation installed in soft clay using the upper bound method of plasticity. Mudmats are commonly used shallow foundations in offshore projects and are often eccentrically loaded. As economics and project requirements change, mudmats have evolved from simple circles and rectangles to more complex geometries. Computing the bearing and overturning capacities of such complex geometries using existing methods outlined in API procedures becomes difficult, as these procedures have been established for simple shapes. FEM is an alternative and established method for analysis, but these programs can be costly. In this thesis, the procedures for analysis using the upper bound method of plasticity are outlined and used to compute the bearing and overturning interaction for several foundations of varying shapes and undrained shear strength profiles. These results are compared to output of the FEM analysis program ABAQUS for validation. The conclusions of this case study are that the upper bound method of plasticity provides a reasonable prediction of the bearing and overturning capacity of an eccentrically loaded <b>mudmat</b> foundation, though considerations should be made when significant torsion or overturning moments in multiple directions are expected...|$|E

Resisting these forces with a fixed foundation solution such as a skirted <b>mudmat</b> or hybrid foundation with pin piles would lead to excessive foundation sizes when axial expansions are large.

A study has been initiated to develop a design framework for sliding PLET foundations, allowing a controlled movement of the foundation during its design life. Such a performance-based design needs to characterize displacements and rotations of the foundation during several cycles of large-amplitude foundation movement in order to provide a robust design. Series of scale model tests in the centrifuge of IFSTTAR in Nantes have been performed to validate the performance based design approach outlined by this study.

The objective {{of the study was to}} validate existing non-linear finite element models for estimating the loads and strength of offshore platforms. From August 24 to 26 1992, hurricane Andrew moved through the Gulf of Mexico with sustained winds of 140 miles per hour. Thirty-six major platforms suffered significant damage, of these, ten were completely toppled and twenty-six were leaning significantly or had significant topside damage. Structures "H" and "K" were bridge-connected platforms, located in the ST 151 field of the South Timbalier area of the Gulf of Mexico, platform "H" collapsed during Andrew, while "K" survived undamaged. They were both designed, fabricated, and installed in the early 1960 's. A push-over analysis, using the program USFOS was used to estimate the ultimate strength of the two structures in three direction: end-on, diagonal and broadside. In the first series of analyses, all the primary members such as legs, vertical and horizontal braces, piles, soil, conductors and deck structure were precisely defined with appropriate finite elements as well as secondary members such as conductors guides barge bumpers. In the second series of analyses it was assumed that there was no horizontal or vertical movements at the level of the <b>mudmat.</b> In the third series of analysis the model used in the first series of analysis was modified by increasing stiffness and resistance of the piles 10 times.

A two-dimensional RANS method with a standard high Reynolds number k-ε turbulence model have been applied. Resulting values of CD are in good agreement with published physical experiments for δ/h= 0. 73, δ/h= 1. 70 and δ/h= 2. 55. Different values of width to height ratio for δ/h= 1. 70 also prove similar results between numerical simulation and experiments. Reattachment is present when b/h= 5 while not present for b/h= 3, as observed in published experiments. Local velocity properties for square cross section with δ/h= 0. 73 from present study is also validated against published experiment. The resulting trend {{from the present study}} seem to agree with the experiment. Results from numerical simulations show excellent agreement of CD when compared to experiments for δ/h ≥ 1. 70, hence further study of various width to height ratio b/h when δ/h= 1. 70 is performed. The resulting value of CD from the numerical simulations indicated a slight over prediction when δ/h ≤ 0. 73. Transient (Unsteady RANS) and steady-state (RANS) simulations are carried out. The steady-state runs did not have fluctuating values of CD and CL in any simulation, indicating that two-dimensional boundary layer flow over simple structures with sharp corners may be treated as a stationary problem. Resulting hydrodynamic quantities for simplified geometries of GRP covers are found to be similar to equivalent values obtained from square and rectangular cross sections. It is also found that <b>mudmat</b> can be neglected in further analysis of GRP 1. The numerical method used is capable of producing physically sound hydrodynamic quantities for simplified subsea structures on the seabed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{the study of the}} effect of heave passive {{compensation}} during subsea factory heavy lift operations. All the analysis are based on the data provided by Peter Sandvik, Marintek. The main objective is to demonstrate the positive effect of passive heave compensation and de- termine the optimized stroke of passive heave compensator by the static and dynamic analysis in SIMA program. The literature study is based on articles related to heave compensation during marine operation and DNV-RP-H 103, which provides guidance for modelling and analysis of marine operations. The different types of heave compensator with different applications are introduced in the the- sis. Then, an introduction of SIMA program will be presented in chapter 4. Meanwhile how the models of environment conditions, different bodies and coupling specifications, as well as the calculation parameters are established in SIMA is illustrated in chapter 5. Moreover, five cases are performed in this thesis to prove that the passive heave compensator will contribute to the reduction of dynamic loads and motions during heavy lift operation. The analysis is performed in SIMA, a workbench used to solve tasks during marine operations. The lifting module is modelled as a combination of four same <b>mudmat</b> and the passive heave com- pensator is modelled by a fixed elongation coupling between the hook and cranemaster. As for the model without passive heave compensator, it just replaces the fixed elongation coupling be- tween the hook and cranemaster with a simple coupling wire. And all he results from SIMA will be plotted in chapter 6. In the last chapter, the conclusion is drawn. It proves that the passive heave compensator has an effect of alleviating vertical forces and motions during heavy lift operation. Meanwhile it also demonstrates that the optimized PHC has the same influence as the initial PHC(passive heave compensator). At last, the recommendation for further work is given...|$|E
