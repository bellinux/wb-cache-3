5|$|Because {{no money}} is {{exchanged}} and laws are rarely broken, {{there is little}} legal recourse to take upon discovery of someone faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for defamatory language in 2005. The lawsuit followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict <b>medical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and his own accounts. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's medical history.|$|E

5|$|Following World War II, a {{nationwide}} movement pressed {{to return to}} pre-war society {{as quickly as possible}} in the U.S. When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become pervasive in <b>medical</b> <b>knowledge,</b> homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals were thought to be vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees' private lives. State and local governments followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting laws against cross-dressing for men and women.|$|E

His morality is nuanced, weighing both sides of an issue. When leaving the confrontation with Baxter, he questions his use of his <b>medical</b> <b>knowledge,</b> {{even though it was}} in self-defense, and with genuine Hippocratic feeling. While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and wonders whether he should stop eating them.

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, it can be concluded that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th century <b>medical</b> <b>knowledge</b> was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a young person was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1914, {{just before}} the start of World War I, Olga's regiment, the Akhtyrsky Hussars, {{appeared}} at an Imperial Review before her and the Tsar at Krasnoe Selo. Kulikovsky volunteered for service with the Hussars, who were stationed on the frontlines in Southwestern Russia. With the Grand Duchess's prior <b>medical</b> <b>knowledge</b> from the village of Olgino, she started work as a nurse at an under-staffed Red Cross hospital in Rovno, near to where her own regiment was stationed. During the war, she came under heavy Austrian fire while attending the regiment at the front. Nurses rarely worked so close to the frontlines and consequently she was awarded the Order of St. George by General Mannerheim, who later became President of Finland. As the Russians lost ground to the Central Powers, Olga's hospital was moved eastwards to Kiev, and Michael returned to Russia from exile abroad.|$|E

5|$|The {{criminal}} trial continued {{for most of}} the summer and Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite were all called on to give evidence. Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant, although medieval <b>medical</b> <b>knowledge</b> claimed that children could not be conceived as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case. Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite's maidservants also gave evidence and, as was the custom of the day for people of low birth, they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony. During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris, although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite's cousin, Thomin du Bois. In his evidence, Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife's testimony, while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing the charges and beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire. In his statement, Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival. Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the entire week the crime {{was supposed to have been}} committed and attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden the twenty-five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question. A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris's alibi was true. Le Gris' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it, a squire named Jean Beloteau, was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed. On 15 September, with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England, the parlement handed down its verdict: As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case, the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386.|$|E

All third-year medical students at a single institution during the period of November 2001 to February 2004 completed a questionnaire to assess their knowledge of cultural competence during their medicine clerkship. The 40 -item questionnaire measured several domains of cultural competence: health disparities, stereotyping, exploring culture, perceptions of health and illness, and communication/language.

40|$|Abstract—The {{prevalence}} {{of heart failure}} is 2 - 3 % {{of the adult population}} and it is expected to grow. Half of all patients diagnosed with it die within four years. To minimize life-threatening situations and to minimize costs, it is interesting to predict mortality rates for a patient with heart failure. In this paper, a fuzzy decision tree based on classification ambiguity and a fuzzy decision tree based on cumulative information estimations are presented. They are employed on a heart failure data fuzzified on the basis of <b>medical</b> expert <b>knowledge.</b> After a transformation of fuzzy decision trees, the use of <b>medical</b> expert <b>knowledge</b> allows us to create a group of fuzzy rules that is easily interpretable by medical experts. Our study shows that different types of fuzzy decision trees can have significantly different accuracy results and interpretability.

40|$|Research in (<b>medical)</b> terminological <b>knowledge</b> {{representation}} is showing an {{increased interest in}} the family of Description Logics (DLs), as they allow for automatic reasoning. This interest is driven {{by an increase in}} demands on the quality of and reasoning ability with <b>medical</b> terminological <b>knowledge.</b> Recent advances in Computer Science have demonstrated the computational decidability and empirical tractability of quite expressive DLs. The question arises whether this expressivity is usable and useful. This paper motivates and describes an exploratory study to address this question by examining the surplus value of individual DL constructors based on an investigation of UMLS terms. Our study indicates that the disjunction and negation operators comprise very valuable extensions to current DLs. The impact of formalization depends on the involved semantic type; "Injury and Poisoning" is one of the semantic types in which a large portion of concepts will benefit from the extensio...|$|R
