5|$|Seven {{minutes after}} the restart, Whelan was penalised for an offence {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool area. Winterburn took the {{resulting}} indirect free kick, from which Alan Smith scored with a header. Liverpool's players protested, claiming Smith had not <b>made</b> <b>contact</b> (and thus the goal should have been disallowed, coming directly from an indirect free kick) or that there had been a push by O'Leary. After consulting his linesman, the referee David Hutchinson awarded the goal. After the match, he recalled none of the Liverpool players knew why they had protested, and TV replays confirm that Smith <b>made</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E

50|$|K'Nex <b>made</b> <b>contacts</b> at {{the four}} largest toy companies: Hasbro, Mattel, Lego, and Tyco (then an {{independent}} toy company), and all four turned K'Nex down.

He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he <b>made</b> <b>contact</b> with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
