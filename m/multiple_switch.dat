40|$|Abstract: The {{optimal control}} {{problem for the}} {{networked}} control system with <b>multiple</b> <b>switching</b> modes over high speed local area networks is addressed, where an initial state is a parametric vector. Because in the general case, the time delay is {{much less than the}} sampling period and the possibility of the packets collision is much lower, it can be assumed that the influence of the time delay and the packets loss on the optimal controller design can be ignored. On the basis of the assumption, the networked control systems with <b>multiple</b> <b>switching</b> modes are modeled as a hybrid system. Moreover, based on the Bellman type inequality for the hybrid systems, a dynamic program to solve the optimal control with a parameter vector is proposed, in every step of the technique, the feasible region is divided into evenly distributed grid points, and then, the optimal control law is transformed into maximizing the lower bound of the cost to go function in grid points.

The critical problem related to <b>multiple</b> <b>switches</b> is how to synchronize them {{in a short time}} interval and how to obtain current/voltage balance. A multiple-switch technique based on a TLT (Transmission-Line-Transformer) can solve this problem. It provides a failure-free solution to synchronize <b>multiple</b> <b>switches</b> automatically like in a Marx generator. In contrast to the Marx generator, it can produce pulses with various voltage and current gains and {{with a high degree of}} freedom in choosing output impedances.

We extend their results and discover {{a class of}} extra stage interconnection networks that tolerate <b>multiple</b> <b>switch</b> failures with a minimal number of extra stages. Adopting the same fault model as Adams and Siegel, the faulty switches can be bypassed {{by a pair of}} demultiplexer/multiplexer combinations.

We present the first known construction of an extra stage interconnection network that meets this lower-bound. This 12 -dimensional multistage interconnection network has n+f stages and tolerates I switch failures. An n-bit label called mask is used for each stage that indicates the bit differences between the two inputs coming into a common switch. We designed the fault-tolerant construction such that it repeatedly uses the singleton basis of the n-dimensional vector space as the stage mask vectors. This construction is further generalized and we prove that an n-dimensional multistage interconnection network is optimally fault-tolerant if and only if the mask vectors of every n consecutive stages span the n-dimensional vector space...|$|E
