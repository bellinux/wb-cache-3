25|$|However, many growers, traders, and {{consumers}} reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits {{in a fashion}} similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters. However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.|$|E

Species {{frequency}} {{is the number of}} times a plant species is present in a given number of quadrats of a particular size or at a given number of sample points.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine what effects the type of pollutants, storage conditions, storage time, and <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> conditioning have on the reported weight of an air pollutant collected by filtration. Samples were collected from a refuse dump, an arc furnace smelting nickel ore, and a rotary kiln burning car bodies. These three sources <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> represented extremes in moisture content and organic matter. An initial weight was determined; then each sample was put through a certain procedure before final weighing. These procedures included storage times from one to twenty-five days, freezing and ambient storage, and sample conditioning by heating and desiccation. Data were analyzed using a graphical approach. The type of pollutant, storage conditions, storage time, and <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> conditioning significantly affected the reported weights of air pollutants. It was found that the magnitude of the weight loss caused by a particular type pollutant and pre-weighing procedure was dependent on the percent of organic matter initially present. The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> conditioning had the greatest effect on weight losses. This effect, again, was dependent on the percent of organic matter initially present.

5000|$|In statistics, {{sampling}} bias is a bias {{in which a}} sample is collected {{in such a way}} that some members of the intended population are less likely to be included than others. It results in a biased sample, a non-random sample of a population (or non-human factors) in which all individuals, or instances, were not equally likely to have been selected.
