A more robust strategy can succeed over a larger range of possible values for non-quantiﬁed risk. This form of robustness analysis is often not undertaken in eradication program evaluations.

At present, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that ASIA syndrome is a viable explanation for unusual autoimmune diseases. Since the initial paper, over 80 publications have discussed ASIA. This systematic review examines the research that has been done to investigate whether ASIA is a broad umbrella term with little clinical significance, or whether there is some underlying mechanism which could be utilised to reduce the occurrence of adjuvant mediated disease. Twenty-seven animal, epidemiological and case studies were reviewed. Unfortunately, a robust animal model of ASIA using biologically relevant doses of adjuvants has yet to be defined. It is also apparent that the broadness of the current ASIA criteria lack stringency and, as a result, very few cases of autoimmune disease could be excluded from a diagnosis of ASIA. The current studies involving human cases are so diverse, in both external stimuli and in resulting conditions, that there is currently a lack of reproducible evidence for any consistent relationship between adjuvant and autoimmune condition.

40|$|The {{delineation}} of forested {{areas is}} a critical task, because the resulting maps are a fundamental input for a broad field of applications and users. Different national and international forest definitions are available for manual or automatic delineation, but unfortunately most definitions lack precise geometrical descriptions for the different <b>criteria.</b> A <b>mandatory</b> <b>criterion</b> in forest definitions is the criterion of crown coverage (CC), which defines {{the proportion of the}} forest floor covered by the vertical projection of the tree crowns. For loosely stocked areas, this criterion is especially critical, because {{the size and shape of}} the reference area for calculating CC is not clearly defined in most definitions. Thus current forest delineations differ and tend to be non-comparable because of different settings for checking the criterion of CC in the delineation process. This paper evaluates a new approach for the automatic delineation of forested areas, based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with a clearly defined method for calculating CC. The new approach, the ‘tree triples’ method, is based on defining CC as a relation between the sum of the crown areas of three neighboring trees and the area of their convex hull. The approach is applied and analyzed for two study areas in Tyrol, Austria. The selected areas show a loosely stocked forest at the upper timberline and a fragmented forest on the hillside. The fully automatic method presented for delineating forested areas from ALS data shows promising results with an overall accuracy of 96 %, and provides a beneficial tool for operational applications...|$|R

Aim: To study {{the association of}} individual parameters of MetS with WC cutoffs suitable for South Asian Indians. Materials and Methods: From an ongoing hospital-based study on MetS as per the criteria of diagnosis of modified NCEP ATP III, 713 subjects having a minimum {{three of the four}} parameters, i. e., dyslipidemia [low high density lipoprotein (HDL), high triglycerides], dysglycemia and hypertension, without regard to cutoffs of WC, were included in the present study. Results: Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis of WC cut-off points for males was 90 cm with a sensitivity and specificity of 71 % and 96 %, respectively, and for females was 85 cm with a sensitivity and specificity of 86 % and 93 %, respectively, associated with the risk factors of MetS. Multiple logistic regression analysis for low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration of ≥ 3. 38 mmol/l showed an odds ratio of 5. 03 (95 % CI = 1. 29 - 19. 5) in males and 3. 17 (95 % CI = 1. 14 - 8. 76) in females which was statistically significant (P < 0. 02); in addition to higher WC, higher level of triglyceride (P ≤ 0. 0001) and lower level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (P ≤ 0. 02) were observed. Conclusion: This study suggests that WC of 90 cm in males and 85 cm in females should be a <b>mandatory</b> <b>criterion</b> of MetS in our subset of population.
