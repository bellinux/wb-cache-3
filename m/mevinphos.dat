The concentrations of listed pesticides were all significantly above comparison values and therefore of concern for human and environmental health. On-site groundwater was reported to contain low levels of butyric acid, dinoseb, and endosulfan due to leaching. Only endosulfan concentrations were significantly above comparison values. On-site air analyses also found eight different pesticides at levels significantly above background levels. The eight pesticides were dacthal, diainon, endosulfan, malathion, <b>mevinphos,</b> maled, methyl parathion, and phorate. However, these concentrations were not enough in comparison to raise concern. Lastly, dead fish samples found in the pond contained dacthal (27.3 mg/kg), DDE (0.11 mg/kg), diazinon (0.1 mg/kg), and endosulfan (0.92 mg/kg).|$|E

Separation of six organophosphorus {{pesticides}} (<b>mevinphos,</b> methidathion, diazinon, profenofos, quinalphos and chlorpyrifos) {{has been}} investigated using micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) with on-column UV-Vis detection. Separations involved using anionic sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) surfactant and phosphate or borate buffer as carrier electrolytes. Separations have been found incomplete regardless of changing all sort of possible factors such as buffer types, buffer and surfactant concentrations, addition of organic modifier, methanol and pH of the running buffer. Irrespective of the combinations of levels of factors, <b>mevinphos</b> alone appeared always as a distinguishable strong peak followed by diazinon and methidathion. Even {{in the absence of}} any surfactant in buffer matrices, <b>mevinphos</b> and diazinon were detected but methidathion, profenofos, quinalphos and chlorpyrifos were undetected. The use of 6 mM β−cyclodextrin (β−CD), 20 mM borate buffer with 40 mM SDS and buffer pH of 9. 5 resulted in the best separation of <b>mevinphos,</b> diazinon and methidathion.

It has developed resistance rapidly to almost every insecticide used for its control. <b>Mevinphos,</b> a fast degrading and slow resistance evocating organophosphorus insecticide, has been recommended for controlling P. xylostella in Taiwan for more than 40 years. SHM strain of P. xylostella, with ca. 22 -fold resistance to this chemical, has been established from a field SH strain by selecting with <b>mevinphos</b> since 1997. Three mutations, i. e., G 892 T, G 971 C, and T 1156 T/G leading to A 298 S, G 324 A, and F 386 F/V amino acid substitutions in acetylcholinesterase 1 (AChE 1), were identified in these two strains; along with three haplotype pairs and a polymorphic intron in AChE 1 gene (ace 1). Two genetically pure lines, i. e., an SHggt wild type with intron AS and an SHMTCN mutant carrying G 892 T, G 971 C, T 1156 T/G mutations and intron AR in ace 1, were established by single pair mating and haplotype determination.

40|$|Background: Spontaneous {{circulation}} {{returns to}} {{less than half of}} adult cardiac arrest victims who received in-hospital resuscitation. One clue for this disheartening outcome arises from the prognosis that asystole invariably takes place, after a time lag, on diagnosis of brain stem death. The designation of brain stem death as {{the point of no return}} further suggests that permanent impairment of the brain stem cardiovascular regulatory machinery precedes death. It follows that a crucial determinant for successful revival of an arrested heart is that spontaneous circulation must resume before brain stem death commences. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that maintained functional integrity of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a neural substrate that is intimately related to brain stem death and central circulatory regulation, holds the key to the vital time-window between cardiac arrest and resumption of spontaneous circulation. Methodology/Principal Findings: An animal model of brain stem death employing the pesticide <b>mevinphos</b> as the experimental insult in Sprague-Dawley rats was used. Intravenous administration of lethal doses of <b>mevinphos</b> elicited an abrupt cardiac arrest, accompanied by elevated systemic arterial pressure and anoxia, augmented neuronal excitability and enhanced microvascular perfusion in RVLM.

40|$|The {{current study}} was {{undertaken}} to detect toxicity in purified Aloe vera gel fractions using the Artemia nauplii lethality bioassay, thereby allowing for the identification of compounds of interest for further investigation. The work presented here therefore seeks to not only detect toxicity in gel extracts, but also to assign this toxicity to individual fractions. Methanol extraction and RP-HPLC were used to purify fractions from Aloe vera gel leading to the isolation of 13 major components. Of these 13 fractions tested using the Artemia nauplii lethality bioassay, one proved to be toxic with a 24 h LC 50 of 435 姠mL- 1. Compared to the tested reference toxins, this Aloe vera gel fraction was approximately three times more toxic than the organophosphate insecticide <b>Mevinphos</b> (24 h LC 50 1336 姠mL- 1) and approximately six fold less toxic than potassium dichromate (LC 50 73 姠mL- 1). Of particular interest was the rapid onset of toxicity against the Artemia nauplii. Dilutions of the gel extract were capable of causing 100 % mortality within 90 min. The isolated fraction induced 100 % mortality within 120 min at a concentration of approximately 800 姠mL- 1. In contrast, greater than 36 h was required for <b>Mevinphos</b> and 18 h for potassium dichromate to produce 100 % mortality, even at high concentrations (2000 姠mL- 1 or 800 姠mL- 1 respectively).

To effectively manage insecticides resistance, {{it is necessary}} to understand the inheritance of insecticide resistance and evaluate the speed of resistant development in diamondback moth. In this study, we used <b>mevinphos</b> an example to investigate the inheritance of insecticide resistance in P. xylostella. Based on our previous studies that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) amino acid substitution associated with resistance to <b>mevinphos,</b> two pure lines, a wild-type SHggt strain and resistant SHMTCN strain carrying A 298 S, G 324 A and F 386 V amino acid substitutions, were established and performed reciprocal cross experiments, bioassays, and mutation frequency analysis. The results showed that the LC 50 of parental, SHggt and SHMTCN, and two reciprocal cross progeny, F 1 and F 1 ’, were 14. 9, 775. 6, 334. 1 and 363. 3 μg / ml. The degree of dominance of F 1 and F 1 '' were 0. 57 and 0. 62. A plateau was found on the log dose –Probit lines of backcrossing and self-cross progeny. These results indicate that the inheritance of mevinphos-resistance in P. xylostella is an incomplete dominant and autosomal trait governed by polygene. In addition, the frequency of AChE gene (ace 1) mutation in P. xylostella was found highly correlated with the LC 50, the R 2 is 0. 97. The relaxation of SHMTCN show the resistant ratio 52. 01 -fold at first generation and decline to 5. 48 -fold at eleventh generation prove the unstable mevinphos-resistane in P. xylostella. The results show faster development of resistance than recessive inheritance. Therefore, the future of resistant management strategy is to use high doses <b>mevinphos</b> to kill all heterozygous, and to continue monitoring of resistance trends, to rotate insecticides with different mode of action, in order to avoid or delay the resistance in diamondback moth. 小菜蛾 (Plutella xylostella L.) 為十字花科蔬菜的重要害蟲，也是最容易對防治藥劑產生抗藥性的害蟲之一。為有效管理抗藥性問題，有必要進一步了解小菜蛾對殺蟲劑之抗藥性遺傳特性，以評估小菜蛾的抗藥性發展速度。本研究以美文松為例，利用本實驗室先前研究發現與美文松抗藥性相關的乙醯膽鹼酯&# 37238; (Acetylcholinesterase, AChE) A 298 S、G 324 A與F 386 V胺基酸置換建立攜帶AChE感性基因型的 SHggt品系與抗性基因型的SHMTCN品系，並進行互交、生物檢定與突變頻度分析。初步結果發現感性與抗性親代，以及兩個互交子代F 1 及F 1 ’ 小菜蛾的半致死濃度分別為 14. 9, 775. 6, 334. 1 及 363. 3 μg/ ml，F 1 及F 1 ’ 小菜蛾的顯性度 (Degree of dominance) 分別為 0. 57 及 0. 62 。這些結果顯示小菜蛾對美文松的抗藥性是沒有母體效應的不完全顯性遺傳。經由F 1 與感性親代回交及F 1 自交的子代死亡率Probit值與美文松濃度作圖，發現劑量死亡反應曲線為具有平台的椅型曲線，表示由單基因控制，但在卡方檢測不符合單基因模型，進而進行間接卡方檢測，則符合 2 個基因模型。小菜蛾對美文松抗藥性穩定度，第一至第十一世代其抗性倍率從 52. 10 倍衰退到 5. 48 倍，可見小菜蛾對美文松的抗藥性不穩定。第一步偵測小菜蛾AChE基因 (Pxae 1) 變異頻度發現G 892 T、G 971 C、T 1156 G點突變頻度與半致死濃度高度相關，相關度達 0. 97 。綜合上述結果得知小菜蛾對美文松抗藥性主要與ae 1 點突變相關，屬於不完全顯性遺傳，抗藥性發展速率較隱性遺傳者快。因此，未來在小菜蛾對美文松或其他有機磷殺蟲藥劑的抗藥性管理應使用高劑量藥劑的防治策略來殺死偏顯性的異型合子，並且持續監測抗藥性的發展趨勢，適時輪用不同作用機制的藥劑，以達到避免或延遲抗藥性產生的目的。中文摘要	 1 英文摘要	 2 目錄	 3 表目錄	 5 圖目錄	 5 壹、 前言	 6 貳、 前人研究	 8 一、 小菜蛾簡介	 8 (一) 小菜蛾形態特徵與生活史	 8 (二) 小菜蛾的重要性與防治歷史	 8 (三) 台灣現行防治方法	 9 二、 殺蟲藥劑─美文松	 10 (一) 	美文松之分類	 10 (二) 	美文松作用機制	 11 (三) 	美文松應用歷史	 11 三、 抗藥性遺傳研究	 12 (一) 	抗藥性產生之機制	 12 (二) 	抗藥性遺傳	 13 參、 材料與方法	 17 小菜蛾飼養	 17 小菜蛾純系建立	 17 遺傳雜交	 18 生物檢定	 19 數據分析	 19 抗藥性穩定度	 20 抗藥性基因點突變偵測	 21 (一) 樣本收集	 21 (二) DNA萃取	 21 (三) 聚合&# 37238;連鎖反應	 21 (四) 聚合&# 37238;連鎖反應-限制酵素多型性	 22 肆、 結果	 24 美文松感性與抗性純系小菜蛾之建立	 24 生物檢定與抗藥性遺傳研究	 24 抗藥性基因點突變偵測	 25 抗藥性基因點與抗藥性相關性	 25 抗藥性穩定度	 25 伍、 討論	 26 美文松感性與抗性純系小菜蛾之建立	 26 生物檢定與抗藥性遺傳研究	 27 抗藥性穩定度	 28 陸、 結論	 31 柒、 引用文獻	 32 捌、 圖表	 3...|$|E

This trend was greatest at succes-sive treatment intervals of 2 d, where <b>mevinphos</b> increased by 79 %, methomyl by 161 %, and pennethrin by 242 %. The importance of this residue loading phenomenon is discussed in light of management of insecticide residues on lettuce in commercial production.

40|$|AbstractA multiresidue {{method for}} the {{quantification}} of 128 pesticides in banana is described. It involves {{the application of}} a modified QuEChERS procedure followed by UHPLC–MS/MS (Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry) analysis. The method was validated according to the European Union SANCO/ 12495 / 2011 guidelines and Brazilian Manual of Analytical Quality Assurance. The validation levels were 10. 0; 25. 0; 50. 0 and 100  μg kg− 1. Acceptable values were obtained for the following parameters: linearity, limit of detection – LOD (5. 00  μg kg− 1) and limit of quantification – LOQ (10. 0  μg kg− 1), except for fenamiphos and <b>mevinphos</b> (LOD =  7. 5  μg kg− 1 and LOQ =  25  μg kg− 1), trueness (for the levels: 10. 0, 25. 0, 50. 0 and 100  μg kg− 1 the recovery assays values were between 70 and 120 %) except for methamidophos at 10  μg kg− 1 level (67. 5 %), intermediate precision (< 20. 0 %) and measurement uncertainty tests (< 50. 0 %).

40|$|Experimental data on {{airborne}} pesticide {{emissions from}} greenhouses are scarce {{due to their}} generally laborious, complex and costly determination. Therefore modelling may be helpful. USES 2. 0 - a decision-support system for governmental institutions - includes a module to estimate airborne concentrations in the lee eddy within 25 meters of a greenhouse. In a 1998 study this module was used to estimate the concentrations of seven organophosphorous pesticides near greenhouses. The health-based limit values available for these pesticides allowed a preliminary risk assessment to be performed for inhabitants near greenhouses by comparing the estimated concentrations with these limit values. As both limit values and estimated air concentrations {{should be considered as}} being tentative, the outcomes of this risk assessment are indicative. For example, acute effects to inhabitants near a greenhouse due to the exposure to dichlorvos, chlorfenvinphos, <b>mevinphos,</b> parathion, or parathion-methyl cannot be completely excluded during the first hours after application in the greenhouse. Acute effects due to the exposure to azinphos-methyl or diazinon can probably be excluded. As the uncertainty margins for both the exposure and the effect assessment could be considered high, the outcomes of the present study plea for a more refined risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{method for}} {{simultaneous}} determination of 20 organophosphorus pesticide residues in corn samples {{has been developed}} and validated. For the extraction of organophosporus pesticide residues from the samples, the accelerated solvent technique with the mixture of dichloromethane: acetone (1 : 1, V/V) was used. Clean up was done using liquid – liquid extraction with n – hexane, followed by solid phase extraction on primary secondary amine adsorbent, and elution with the mixture of acetone: toluene (65 : 35). The determination of the pesticides {{was carried out by}} gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorus detection. Separation and quantitative determination of the analytes were performed on a fused silica capillary ZB- 35 column (30 m x 0. 25 mm i. d. x 0. 25 μm, Phenomenex).

40|$|Ten day old chick {{sympathetic}} ganglia cultured in a microslide assembly {{were treated}} with a selected group of organophosphate pesticides to evaluate their cytotoxicity ranges, and the usefulness of such a model for screening pesticides. Examination by phase contrast and light microscopy for chemically-induced morphological alteration of nerve fibers, glial cells and neurons provided the criteria for quantitation and assessment of the toxic effects. Concentrations that produced half-maximal effects ranged from 1 × 10 - 6 M (severely toxic) for methylparathian, diazinon, paraoxon, <b>mevinphos,</b> diisopropylfluorophosphate, tri-o-tolyl phosphate and its mixed isomers to a 1 × 10 - 3 M (intermediate) for malathion, leptophos, coumaphos, mono- and dicrotophos. Some or no effects were evident at 1 × 102 -M for O'ethyl-O-p-nitrophenyl phenyl phosphonothioate, tri-m-tolylphosphate, chlorpyriphos and triphenyl phosphate. In all instances, nerve fibers were more sensitive than neurons or glial cells to insecticides. All cellular growth was inhibited at 1 × 10 - 2 M (except triphenyl phosphate). Below 1 x 10 - 7 M, no inhibitory effects were evident. The secondary abnormalities included decreased cellular migration, diffuse cellular growth pattern, increased vacuolization, nerve fiber swelling and cellular degeneration.

40|$|Introduction: Many {{species of}} Syzygium {{are known to}} have {{antiseptic}} activity. Australian Syzygium species had roles as traditional bush medicines for Australian Aborigines although their antiseptic potential has not been rigorously studied. Methods: Methanol extracts of leaves from Syzygium forte, Syzygium francissi, Syzygium moorei, Syzygium puberulum and Syzygium wilsonii were tested for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion assay. Antibacterial strength was measured by MIC determination. Toxicity was determined using the Artemia franciscana nauplii bioassay. Results: S. forte, S. francissi, S. moorei, S. puberulum and S. wilsonii leaf methanolic extracts inhibited the growth of 5 (36 %), 3 (21 %), 3 (21 %), 5 (36 %) and 2 (14 %) of the 14 bacteria tested respectively. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial growth was inhibited by the Syzygium extracts, although Gram-positive bacteria appeared slightly more susceptible. With the exception of S. forte, all Syzygium leaf extracts tested also displayed low toxicity (LC 50 > 1000 姯ml) in the Artemia fransiscana bioassay. S. forte had a 48 h LC 50 of 392. 4 ᠳ 3. 0 姯ml, making it slightly more toxic than <b>Mevinphos</b> (495. 0 ᠳ 5. 1 姯ml) and approximately 28 fold less toxic than potassium dichromate (14. 0 ᠲ. 4 姯ml) at 48 h. Conclusions: The antibacterial activity and low toxicity of the Syzygium spp. validate their medicinal usage by Australian Aborigines and indicate their potential as antibacterial medicinal agents.

40|$|Background: One {{aspect of}} brain death is {{cardiovascular}} deregulation because asystole invariably occurs shortly after its diagnosis. A suitable neural substrate for mechanistic delineation of {{this aspect of}} brain death resides in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). RVLM is the origin of a life-and-death signal that our laboratory detected from blood pressure of comatose patients that disappears before brain death ensues. At the same time, transcriptional upregulation of heme oxygenase- 1 in RVLM by hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 a (HIF- 1 a) plays a pro-life role in experimental brain death, and HIF- 1 a is subject to sumoylation activated by transient cerebral ischemia. It follows that sumoylation of HIF- 1 a in RVLM in response to hypoxia may play a modulatory role on brain stem cardiovascular regulation during experimental brain death. Methodology/Principal Findings: A clinically relevant animal model that employed <b>mevinphos</b> as the experimental insult in Sprague-Dawley rat was used. Biochemical changes in RVLM during distinct phenotypes in systemic arterial pressure spectrum that reflect maintained or defunct brain stem cardiovascular regulation were studied. Western blot analysis, EMSA, ELISA, confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that drastic tissue hypoxia, elevated levels of proteins conjugated by small ubiquitin-related modifier- 1 (SUMO- 1), Ubc 9 (the only known conjugating enzyme for the sumoylation pathway) or HIF- 1 a, augmented sumoylation of HIF- 1 a, nucleus-bound translocation and enhanced transcriptional activity of HIF- 1 a in RVLM neurons took place preferentially during the pro-life phase of experimental brain death.

40|$|Based on {{the highly}} {{sensitive}} and selective fluorescence enhancement of water-soluble CdTe/CdS core-shell quantum dots (QD) by organophosphorus pesticides (OPs such as <b>mevinphos,</b> phosalone, methidathion and diazinon), a simple, rapid and selective method is developed using CE with QD/LIF detection (473 nm excitation/ 532 nm fluorescence) to determine OPs in vegetable samples. The method enables {{the use of}} a simple pretreatment procedure based only on solvent extraction and eliminates the use of a time-consuming SPE step. A novel procedure is developed to immobilize QD onto the inside capillary surface via the formation of a silane coupling mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane network. Under optimized CE conditions, baseline separation for all four OPs was observed within 12 min. The CE-QD/LIF method was shown to have a detection limit from 50 to 180 μg/kg, working ranges 0. 1 - 30 mg/kg, recoveries 88. 7 - 96. 1 % and repeatability (RSD, n = 3) 0. 36 - 0. 75 % for migration time and 2. 9 - 5. 7 % for peak height. For tomato samples, the detection limits were more than ten times lower than maximum residue levels specified by the Codex Alimentarius Commission for all four OPs investigated. The method thus satisfies the need for a simple, quick and selective method to determine residual OPs in complex vegetable matrix as required by the increasingly strict regulations for health protection introduced in recent years. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|As {{the origin}} of a ‘life-and-death’ signal that {{reflects}} central cardiovascular regulatory failure during brain stem death, the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a suitable neural substrate for mechanistic delineation of this vital phenomenon. Using a clinically relevant animal model that employed the organophosphate pesticide <b>mevinphos</b> (Mev) as the experimental insult, we evaluated the hypothesis that transcriptional up-regulation of nitric oxide synthase I or II (NOS I or II) gene expression by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) on activation of muscarinic receptors in the RVLM underlies brain stem death. In Sprague-Dawley rats maintained under propofol anaesthesia, co-microinjection of muscarinic M 2 R (methoctramine) or M 4 R (tropicamide), but not M 1 R (pirenzepine) or M 3 R (4 -diphenylacetoxy-N-dimethylpiperidinium) antagonist significantly reduced the enhanced NOS I–protein kinase G signalling (‘pro-life’ phase) or augmented NOS II–peroxynitrite cascade (‘pro-death’ phase) in ventrolateral medulla, blunted the biphasic increase and decrease in baroreceptor reflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone that reflect the transition from life to death, and diminished the elevated DNA binding activity or nucleus-bound translocation of NF-κB in RVLM neurons induced by microinjection of Mev into the bilateral RVLM. However, NF-κB inhibitors (diethyldithiocarbamate or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) or double-stranded κB decoy DNA preferentially antagonized the augmented NOS II–peroxynitrite cascade and the associated cardiovascular depression exhibited during the ‘pro-death’ phase. We conclude that transcriptional up-regulation of NOS II gene expression by activation of NF-κB on selective stimulation of muscarinic M 2 or M 4 subtype receptors in the RVLM underlies the elicited cardiovascular depression during the ‘pro-death’ phase in our Mev intoxication model of brain stem death...|$|E
