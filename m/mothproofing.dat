There were special departments for dry cleaning clothes, furs, rugs, blankets, and draperies; and for laundering shirts. <b>Mothproofing</b> and waterproofing clothes were also offered. There was also a specially constructed large refrigerated cold storage vault for furs and other clothing that needed to be stored at cold temperatures for long periods of time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mothproofing</b> {{chemicals}} - Treatment {{of materials}} as a preventive measure before their use, {{as well as}} simply for storage, has a long history. [...] Arsenical compounds were effective in killing larvae but were considered too toxic for human contact even {{in the early twentieth}} century. Triphenyltin chloride was effective at 0.25%. After 1947, chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides of many varieties were found to be effective at the low concentrations practical for preservative treatment. [...] Examples are chlordane at 2% per weight of wool, toxaphene at 0.8%, pentachlorophenol or BHC at 0.5%, DDT at 0.2%, chlordecone and mirex at 0.06%, and dieldrin at 0.05%. Imidazole (a non-chloronated aromatic heterocyclic) at 1% also gave satisfactory protection. Besides solvent-based applications, insecticidal dusts were commonly used to treat fabrics. In the 1950s EQ-53, a DDT emulsion, was recommended by the US Department of Agriculture to add to the final rinse of washable woolens, but even then cautions were given to the use of chlorinated hydrocarbons on items subject to commercial drycleaning. The 1985 United States EPA ban on most uses of Aldrin and Dieldrin exempted moth-proofing in a closed manufacturing process. Triazole, thiazole, and imidazole derivatives have an anti-feeding effect on Tineola bisselliella larvae when wool is treated with these compounds. At 3% on mass of wool, both epoxiconazole and econazole nitrate protect wool fabric from Tineola bisselliella to the standard specified by Wools of New Zealand Test Method 25 (based on ISO 3998-1977(E).|$|E

40|$|I suspect {{many people}} {{do not know what}} natural history museums are all about. These museums hold nature 2 ̆ 7 s works of art, instead of just man 2 ̆ 7 s. There are not many museums of natural history and those few are usually in big cities. Field Museum of National History in Chicago {{is one of the largest}} in the world, along with the British Museum of Natural History in London, the Smithsonian (U. S. National Museum) in Washington, and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. These are the museums that have the actual skeletons of dinosaurs, or stuffed elephants, poised in combat, {{exhibited}} in impressive halls. Many of the specimens were collected early in the century during a time of large field expeditions and adventurous wealthy men. Today those adventurous wealthy types are probably still around, but the big expeditions carry cameras rather than guns. The large animals are hard to come by in the wild, either because there are not many left or because there are too many restrictions in getting them. Fortunately for us and our children and grandchildren, places like Field Museum have carefully preserved these big beasts, and often in a setting that looks like their native habitat. But the numbers of animals and other natural history objects on exhibit are only a small fraction of the holdings of natural history museums. In the places closed to the public are thousands - millions - of specimens carefully stored in airtight, <b>mothproof</b> cases or tanks and jars. There are mammals, snakes, insects, snails, birds, plants, rocks, fossils and artifacts, named and catalogued and waiting for competent scientists to study them...|$|R
30|$|Chlorophenols are {{xenobiotic}} contaminants {{that occur}} during numerous anthropogenic activities and become {{released into the}} environment (Zilouei et al. 2006). These compounds are widely used as <b>mothproofing</b> agents, miticides, germicides, algicides, fungicides, and wood preservatives {{as well as for}} the synthesis of dyes and drugs (Arora and Bae 2014). Owing to their biocide properties, chlorophenols in industrial wastewater pose serious ecological problems as environmental pollutants (Salmerón-Alcocer et al. 2007; Bajaj et al. 2008). Because of their ecological risk, chlorophenols become the target of investigations focusing on their possible biodegradation (Khodadoust et al. 1997; Wilson et al. 1997). Various chlorophenols, including 2 -chlorophenol (2 -CP), have been listed as priority pollutants by US Environmental Protection (EPA) (Oh et al. 2011). Fortunately, these compounds can be degraded by indigenous microorganisms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Häggblom et al. 2000). In aerobic pathway, the biodegradation of chlorophenols is more diverse since the ring cleavage may occur before dechlorination, thus forming more complex intermediates of various toxicity (Chang et al. 2003). Contrarily, many types of microorganisms, Desulfomonile tiedjei, Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans, and Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans, are known to utilize chlorophenols as their sole carbon and energy source under anaerobic conditions. The anaerobic pathway produced less-chlorinated intermediates that are less toxic to the environment (Bajaj et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2003). For large scale wastewater treatment, mixed consortia rather than pure cultures are preferred because they are easier to handle and contain diverse microorganisms capable of withstanding various unfavorable influent fluctuations.|$|E
40|$|Fourier transfonn (FT) Raman, Raman {{microspectroscopy}} and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{have been}} used for the structural analysis and characterisation of untreated and chemically treated wool fibres. For FT -Raman spectroscopy novel methods of sample presentation have been developed and optimised for the analysis of wool. No significant fluorescence was observed and the spectra could be obtained routinely. The stability of wool keratin to the laser source was investigated and the visual and spectroscopic signs of sample damage were established. Wool keratin was found to be extremely robust with no signs of sample degradation observed for laser powers of up to 600 m W and for exposure times of up to seven and half hours. Due to improvements in band resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, several previously unobserved spectral features have become apparent. The assignment of the Raman active vibrational modes of wool have been reviewed and updated to include these features. The infrared spectroscopic techniques of attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and photoacoustic (P A) {{have been used}} to examine shrinkproofed and mothproofed wool samples. Shrinkproofing is an oxidative chemical treatment used to selectively modifY the surface of a wool fibre. <b>Mothproofing</b> is a chemical treatment applied to wool for the prevention of insect attack. The ability of PAS and A TR to vary the penetration depth by varying certain instrumental parameters was used to obtain spectra of the near surface regions of these chemically treated samples. These spectra were compared with those taken with a greater penetration depth, which therefore represent more of the bulk wool sample. The PA and ATR spectra demonstrated that oxidation was restricted to the near-surface layer of wool. Extensive curve fitting of ATR spectra of untreated wool indicated that cuticle was composed of a mixed protein conformation, but was predominately that of an a. -helix. The cortex was proposed to be a mixture of both a. helical and -pleated sheet protein conformations. These findings were supported by PAS depth profiling results. Raman microspectroscopy was used in an extensive investigation of the molecular structure of the wool fibre. This included determining the orientation of certain functional groups within the wool fibre and the symmetry of particular vibrations. The orientation ofbonds within the wool fibre was investigated by orientating the wool fibre axis parallel and then perpendicular to the plane of polarisation of the electric vector of the incident radiation. It was experimentally determined that the majority of C=O and N-H bonds of the peptide bond of wool lie parallel to the fibre axis. Additionally, a number of the important vibrations associated with the a-helix were also found to lie parallel to the fibre axis. Further investigation into the molecular structure of wool involved determining what effect stretching the wool fibre had on bond orientation. Raman spectra of stretched and unstretched wool fibres indicated that extension altered the orientation ofthe aromatic rings, the CH 2 and CH 3 groups of the amino acids. Curve fitting results revealed that extension resulted in significant destruction of the a-helix structure a substantial increase in the P-pleated sheet structure. Finally, depolarisation ratios were calculated for Raman spectra. The vibrations associated with the aromatic rings of amino acids had very low ratios which indicated that the vibrations were highly symmetrical...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{assessment}} of the allergenic potential towards wool products from indoor living areas (e. g. carpets, bedding and insulating material) with skin contact and with contact by the respiratory tract for inhale particles. New and used wool products were characterised with protein chemical methods (amino acid analysis and SDS gel electrophoresis). The processing agents (e. g. flame retarding and <b>mothproofing</b> agents) and substances like pesticides were characterised with analytic methods. The long-term use of wool products from indoor living areas can lead to changes of the products. Mechanical influence is important by carpets and is leading to damages {{on the surface of the}} carpet and the wool fibres. Fibrillates wool fibres were found. Thermal influence is important by insulating material and beddings and is leading only to small changes on the wool fibre surface. By insulating material humidity could not provoke the building of mildew. Mite contamination was founded by several beddings. This mite contamination must be involved by the investigation of the allergenic potential. The changes of the wool products generated by thermal influences are be simulated by an artificial thermal ageing process. The wool before and after ageing is not significantly different in the composition of the amino acids. But it was found a significantly decrease in the band pattern in the area of the KIF. This decrease was caused by new protein cross linkage (lanthionine and isodipeptide linkage (epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine). The changes of the processing agents are characterised by analytical methods. During the long-term use of the products dust particles can be produced. The building of dust was simulated by laboratory tests for mechanical weakly influenced products (e. g. insulating material, bedding) and mechanical strongly influenced products (e. g. carpets). Wool dust is a complex mixture of the wool, inorganic and organic compounds from the processing agents and substances of the environment. The dust particles of wool fibres are wool fibre fragments of different dimension, cortical cells, cortical fragments, polygonal cuticular cells and cuticular cell fragments. The total airborne dust and the fine airborne dust of a carpet were collected with a dust sampler. The collected dust was characterised. The investigation of the solubility of wool and wool dust was made with physiological model solution under in-vitro-conditions. The model solution of sweat and bronchial fluid are modified with enzymes for simulate the enzymatic activity of human fluids. The incubation of beddings with synthetic enzyme free and modified sweat solution solved only a small amount of proteins (max. 1 %). The soluble proteins show a great similarity to the PCL of the wool and the endocuticula. The incubation of dust of insulating materials and carpets with enzyme free and modified solution for the extracellular and intracellular lung solution solved only a small amount of proteins (max. 2 %). The soluble proteins show a substantial similarity to the PCL and the endocuticula and by the use of the enzyme trypsine to the proteins of the medulla and of the intermediarfilaments. However neither wool nor wool dust could be solved by the model solution under the conditions of these investigations. The dermatological tests (prick test) of extracts from the wool products showed no significantly reactions by test persons with a positive wool intolerance. Processing agents and the ageing of the products showed likewise no influences. No type-I-allergy is released by the solved proteins and substances from the wool products...|$|E
