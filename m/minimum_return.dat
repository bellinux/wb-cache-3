25|$|On 26 May 1963, BUA began a twice-daily rail-air-rail service {{between the}} city centres of London and Paris. The service, which was marketed as Silver Arrow in the UK and as Flèche d'argent in France, was a joint {{operation}} between British Rail (BR), BUA and Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer français (SNCF). At London's Victoria Station, where BUA check-in facilities were available, Paris-bound passengers boarded a BR train to Gatwick Airport railway station. At Gatwick they transferred to a BUA Viscount, which flew them to Le Touquet Airport. At Le Touquet Airport an SNCF train was waiting {{to take them to}} Paris's Gare du Nord station. The entire journey took five hours and the <b>minimum</b> <b>return</b> fare was £10 9s. This compared with Skyways Coach-Air's London Victoria Coach Station — Lympne Airport — Beauvais Airport — Paris République Coach Station £11 return coach-air-coach fare. BUA's Silver Arrow service was an example of Laker turning an adversity into an opportunity. BUA's lack of traffic rights prevented it from running non-stop Gatwick—Paris scheduled flights although it held a licence for that route, which the ATLB had awarded it in late 1961. Faced with this restriction, Laker hit upon the idea to offer an indirect travel option {{between the city}} centres of London and Paris by combining the existing Victoria—Gatwick rail link with BUA's Gatwick — Le Touquet traffic rights. At the time, Le Touquet Airport was not linked to the French railway network. As a result, the surface journey between the airport and Paris was difficult and time-consuming as this involved an intermodal change between coach and train at Étaples. To overcome this drawback, Laker persuaded the French authorities to build a spur line into Le Touquet Airport so that BUA passengers could be met on arrival by a dedicated SNCF train that took them direct to Gare du Nord train station in the centre of Paris. BUA's new London—Paris rail-air-rail service via Gatwick replaced a coach-air-coach/rail service it had operated on this route via Lydd. BUA Silver Arrow fares were less than what BEA and Air France charged their passengers to fly non-stop between Heathrow and Paris to compensate for the longer travelling times (5 hr vs. 2 hr 45 min.).|$|E
500|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. [...] Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. [...] In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). [...] Unfortunately, there is no easy, non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. [...] It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, return loss. [...] Return loss by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic return loss anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. [...] The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of return loss with frequency. [...] The <b>minimum</b> <b>return</b> loss so measured is called the structural return loss (SRL). [...] SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. [...] The measurement must also be carried out at all in-band frequencies to be significant. [...] The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to quarter wave impedance transformer action.|$|E

40|$|A {{new state}} space {{approach}} is proposed {{to model the}} time- dependence in an extreme value process. The generalized extreme value distribution is extended to incorporate the time-dependence using a state space representation where the state variables either follow an autoregressive (AR) process or a moving average (MA) process with innovations arising from a Gumbel distribution. Using a Bayesian approach, an efficient algorithm is proposed to implement Markov chain Monte Carlo method where we exploit a very accurate approximation of the Gumbel distribution by a ten-component mixture of normal distributions. The methodology is illustrated using extreme returns of daily stock data. The model is fitted to a monthly series of <b>minimum</b> <b>returns</b> and the empirical results support strong evidence for time-dependence among the observed <b>minimum</b> <b>returns.</b> Extreme values, Generalized extreme value distribution, Markov chain Monte Carlo, Mixture sampler, State space model, Stock returns...|$|R

50|$|In Victoria, gaming {{machines}} {{must provide}} a <b>minimum</b> <b>return</b> rate of 85% (including jackpot contribution), including machines in Crown Casino. As of December 1, 2007, all gaming machines with support for $100 notes were banned {{due to an}} amendment to the gaming laws; all gaming machines made since 2003 comply with this rule. This new law also banned machines which would automatically play with the button held. One exception to these laws exists in Crown Casino, any player with a VIP loyalty card can still insert $100 notes and use the autoplay feature, whereby the machine will continue to play without player intervention until credit is exhausted or the player intervenes. All gaming machines in Victoria have an information screen accessible to the user by pressing the 'i key' button, showing the game rules, paytable, return to player percentage, and the top and bottom five combinations, with the odds shown. These combinations are stated to be played on a minimum bet (usually 1 credit per line, with 1 line or reel played), excluding feature wins.|$|E
