5|$|Since the 1755 earthquake, Boston and its {{surrounding}} towns have become a <b>major</b> <b>metropolitan</b> area. Much new construction has been built on infill, especially in the Back Bay area, which may be prone to greater shaking and to compaction of the sand and gravel used as fill. Many older buildings in the Boston area are built from stone and brick, {{and are likely to}} collapse completely during a major earthquake. Given this, modern observers have expressed concern about the effects of another quake in such a major city. A 1990 study by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency estimated potential financial losses at between $4 billion and $5 billion, and potential loss of life in the hundreds. As a consequence, the state has updated building codes and zoning laws to require that new construction and additions in vulnerable areas be built to resist earthquakes.|$|E

40|$|Understanding growth {{patterns}} at {{the metropolitan}} level is instructive for better planning and policy making on sustainable urban development. Using DMSP/OLS data from 1992 to 2013, this article aims to investigate growth patterns of <b>major</b> <b>metropolitans</b> in Mainland China from the aspects of intensification and expansion. We start by calibrating the DMSP/OLS data and selecting 45 <b>major</b> <b>metropolitans.</b> On intensification, results suggest that aggregately, metropolitans displayed cyclical pattern over time and large metropolitans tended to {{have higher levels of}} intensification than moderate or small ones. Individually, metropolitans with similar intensification over time could be clustered together using Dendrogram, and evolution pattern of the clusters exhibited similarity to the aggregated one. On expansion, results show that aggregately metropolitans displayed a decreasing trend over time, and moderate or small metropolitans tended to have higher levels of expansion than large ones. Particularly, moderate metropolitans were more likely to expand adjacently, and small ones were more likely to experience scatter or corridor expansion. Each metropolitan can be represented by a mixed expansion model over time, which might tell where and how much expansion occurred in the current year. Furthermore, intensification is highly correlated with expansion over time for small metropolitans, but they are poorly correlated for large or moderate ones. Lastly, the high correlation of intensification and expansion with the change of GDP in each year indicates the reliability of our work...|$|R

In 2008 and 2009, Site Selection magazine ranked Dayton the #1 medium-sized metropolitan area in the U.S. for economic development. Dayton is also among the top 100 metropolitan areas in both exports and export-related jobs, ranked 16 and 14 respectively by the Brookings Institution. The 2010 report placed the value of exports at $4.7billion and the number of export-related jobs at 44,133. The Dayton Metropolitan Statistical Area ranks 4th in Ohio's Gross Domestic Product with a 2008 industry total of $33.78billion. Additionally, Dayton ranks third among 11 <b>major</b> <b>metropolitan</b> areas in Ohio for exports to foreign countries. The Dayton Development Coalition is attempting to leverage the region's large water capacity, estimated to be 1.5trillion gallons of renewable water aquifers, to attract new businesses.

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Marrakesh {{underwent}} {{several years of}} unrest. After the premature death in 1900 of the grand vizier Ba Ahmed, who had been designated regent until the designated sultan Abd al-Aziz became of age, the country was plagued by anarchy, tribal revolts, the plotting of feudal lords, and European intrigues. In 1907, Marrakesh caliph Moulay Abd al-Hafid was proclaimed sultan by the powerful tribes of the High Atlas and by Ulama scholars who denied the legitimacy of his brother, Abd al-Aziz. It was also in 1907 that Dr. Mauchamp, a French doctor, was murdered in Marrakesh, suspected of spying for his country. France used the event as a pretext for sending its troops from the eastern Moroccan town of Oujda to the <b>major</b> <b>metropolitan</b> centre of Casablanca in the west. The French colonial army encountered strong resistance from Ahmed al-Hiba, a son of Sheikh Ma al-'Aynayn, who arrived from the Sahara accompanied by his nomadic Reguibat tribal warriors. On 30 March 1912, the French Protectorate in Morocco was established. After the Battle of Sidi Bou Othman, which saw {{the victory of the}} French Mangin column over the al-Hiba forces in September 1912, the French seized Marrakesh. The conquest was facilitated by the rallying of the Imzwarn tribes and their leaders from the powerful Glaoui family, leading to a massacre of Marrakesh citizens in the resulting turmoil.|$|E
