This isn't the frontier, but in some respects it's worse, because we have all the luxuries and appearances--the pretty glass and silver to put on the table. We have to dust, polish, and arrange 'em after we've done our housework. I don't suppose that <b>means</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but--try it for a month! We have no help.

Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "If {{the history of}} rock music <b>means</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> you know the individuals in question could only be the Wrecking Crew, a legendary group of Los Angeles-based studio musicians, and though their story has taken decades to reach the screen, it has been worth the wait." [...] Mark Feeney of The Boston Globe commented, [...] "Think of The Wrecking Crew as 20 Feet from Stardom (2013) for instrumentalists, or a West Coast version of Standing in the Shadows of Motown (2002). There's a similar shared joy among the participants, a similar sense of discovery for the viewer, and, of course, a killer soundtrack."

Leigh's marvelous achievement is not only in capturing emotional clarity on film, but also in illustrating {{the ways in which}} families start to heal and find a certain bravery in their efforts." [...] Similarly, Kenneth Turan from the Los Angeles Times ranked the film within [...] "the best of the 14 features Leigh" [...] had directed by then. He found that Secrets & Lies was [...] "a piercingly honest, completely accessible piece of work that will go directly to the hearts of audiences who have never heard of him. If film <b>means</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> if emotional truth is a quality you care about, this is an event that ought not be missed ... Unforced, confident and completely involving, with exceptional acting aided by Dick Pope's unobtrusive camera work and John Gregory's telling editing, Secrets & Lies is filmmaking to savor." ...|$|R

60|$|There {{are some}} {{exceedingly}} useful words in this language. SCHLAG, for example; and ZUG. There are {{three-quarters of a}} column of SCHLAGS in the dictonary, and a column {{and a half of}} ZUGS. The word SCHLAG means Blow, Stroke, Dash, Hit, Shock, Clap, Slap, Time, Bar, Coin, Stamp, Kind, Sort, Manner, Way, Apoplexy, Wood-cutting, Enclosure, Field, Forest-clearing. This is its simple and EXACT meaning--that is to say, its restricted, its fettered meaning; but there are ways by which you can set it free, so that it can soar away, as on the wings of the morning, and never be at rest. You can hang any word <b>you</b> please <b>to</b> its tail, and make it <b>mean</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want <b>to.</b> <b>You</b> can begin with SCHLAG-ADER, which means artery, and you can hang on the whole dictionary, word by word, clear through the alphabet to SCHLAG-WASSER, which means bilge-water--and including SCHLAG-MUTTER, which means mother-in-law.|$|R
5000|$|Written by Hardy, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Mer" [...] ("Sea") concern suicide in a gentle manner, as she intones: [...] "I would love to fall asleep in the sea—magical, original, in its {{essential}} rhythm. I would love the sea to {{take me back to}} be reborn—elsewhere than inside my head, somewhere other than the earth, where without my love I can do nothing." [...] The song's string arrangements imitate the tide of the sea, [...] "both menacing and welcoming", like the possibility of killing oneself. Similarly to [...] "Viens", the lyrics on [...] "Oui, je dis adieu" [...] ("Yes, I Say Goodbye") describe the rupture of a couple, as Hardy sings: [...] "Your show and your emptiness/Your weaknesses and your tiredness/Don't <b>mean</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> me anymore/With <b>you</b> I am not anything", and [...] "Without a future or present/I don't feel like it anymore/That waste of my time". [...] "Doigts" [...] ("Fingers") has been considered the most sensual song in the album, as its lyrics [...] "describe the art of communication through touch." [...] It is followed by [...] "La maison" [...] ("The House"), an [...] "melancholic" [...] track in which Hardy combines singing with spoken word. The main melody of [...] "Si mi caballero" [...] is both sung and whistled. [...] "Bâti mon nid" [...] ("Built My Nest") has been described as [...] "a lively Brazilian jazz piece featuring a female-male vocal duet, an energetic double bass line and wonderful syncopation." [...] With its [...] "la-la-la" [...] chorus, the song presents a [...] "particularly catchy" [...] moment of the album. Closing track [...] "Rêve" [...] ("Dream") is a cover of [...] "A transa", a song by Taiguara. Author Richie Unterberger felt that [...] "Hardy curbs the fussiest excesses of the original, and adds some pretty enchanting cloud-drifting scat vocals through most of the arrangement." [...] It also features a [...] "la-la-la" [...] refrain, followed by Hardy's lyrics: [...] "You marvel me like a dream/That finally came true/And you hurt me like a dream/I shall awake from". The [...] "progrescent passage" [...] of the almost instrumental track has been noted for its resemblance to [...] "The Court of the Crimson King", a 1969 song by King Crimson.|$|R
