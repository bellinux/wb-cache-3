500|$|A solar flyer {{has also}} been {{proposed}} by Geoffrey A. Landis {{in place of a}} balloon, and the idea has been featured from time to time since the early 2000s. Venus has a high albedo, and reflects most of the sunlight that shines on it making the surface quite dark, the upper atmosphere at 60km has an upward solar intensity of 90%, meaning that solar panels on both the top and the bottom of a craft could be used with nearly equal efficiency. In addition to this, the slightly lower gravity, high air pressure and slow rotation allowing for perpetual solar power make this part of the planet ideal for exploration. The proposed flyer would operate best at an altitude where sunlight, air pressure, and wind speed would enable it to remain in the air perpetually, with slight dips down to lower altitudes for a few hours at a time before returning to higher altitudes. As sulfuric acid in the clouds at this height is not a threat for a properly shielded craft, this so-called [...] "solar flyer" [...] would be able to measure the area in between 45km and 60km indefinitely, for however long it takes for <b>mechanical</b> <b>error</b> or unforeseen problems to cause it to fail. Landis also proposed that rovers similar to Spirit and Opportunity could possibly explore the surface, with the difference being that Venus surface rovers would be [...] "dumb" [...] rovers controlled by radio signals from computers located in the flyer above, only requiring parts such as motors and transistors to withstand the surface conditions, but not weaker parts involved in microelectronics that could not be made resistant to the heat, pressure and acidic conditions.|$|E

During the Spring Semester of 1979, 404 community college English instructors were mailed an identical essay whereon only the ascribed student name varied. Of these 404, 246 instructors returned usable test instruments. This represented a response rate of 60. 9 percent. Thirty instructors marked an essay ascribed to the first name Daniel; 30, Frederick; 31, George; and 34, James. Another group of 30 instructors marked an essay ascribed to Buschbacher; 32, Etheredge; 31, Kronowski; and 28, Mendez. The letter grades were converted to a numerical scale (from 0 = F through 12 = A+) for computational purposes. Counts were made of the number of marked <b>mechanical</b> <b>errors,</b> content errors, miscellaneous positive comments, and miscellaneous negative comments. Ten separate analyses of variance were performed to determine the degree of relationship between the ascribed names and the dependent measures. No statistically significant relationship was found between first names and grades, <b>mechanical</b> <b>errors,</b> content errors, and miscellaneous positive comments. Nor was any relationship found between surnames and grades, <b>mechanical</b> <b>errors,</b> content errors, and miscellaneous negative comments. A statistically significant relationship was found between first names and miscellaneous negative comments. The post hoc Scheffe test was performed. The test data indicated that the essay ascribed to George received the highest mean number of miscellaneous negative comments while the essay ascribed to Daniel received the lowest mean number of miscellaneous negative comments. A statistically significant relationship was also found between surnames and miscellaneous positive comments. The post hoc Scheffe test data indicated that the essay ascribed to Mendez received the highest mean number of miscellaneous positive comments, followed in order by Etheredge, Buschbacher, and Kronowski. On the basis of these findings, two conclusions were offered. Community college English instructors were not influenced by variant first names or surnames in "professional" marks, i. e., grades, <b>mechanical</b> <b>errors,</b> and content errors. However, community college English instructors may have been partially subject to the influences of variant first names and surnames in "non-professional" marks, i. e., miscellaneous negative and positive comments. These findings and conclusions were not consistent with earlier studies. The influences of name stereotypes in this study appeared to be more subtle than found in earlier studies. This study was inconclusive in isolating the source of personal name stereotypes.

In 2006, Riggs failed to make the Daytona 500 because of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>error</b> in {{qualifying}} and a lack of owner points from the previous season (from the former No. 91 team). The No. 10 team finished the 2006 season high enough in owners' points to guarantee themselves a starting spot in the first 5 races in 2007. Riggs had back-to-back top-10 finishes at Martinsville and Texas. Riggs also won the pole for the Coca-Cola 600 and the NEXTEL Open exhibition race at Charlotte. He won the NEXTEL Open, leading all but one lap, and advanced to the NEXTEL All-Star Challenge where he finished tenth. In the Coca-Cola 600, Riggs led 90 laps, but a pit road violation took him out of contention and he finished 13th. His highest ranking in the 2006 NEXTEL Cup points standings has been 18th. Riggs best finish in the 2006 Nextel Cup season was a 4th-place finish which came at the Sharpie 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway.

40|$|In machine tools, the {{difference}} between the position of the tool center point and that of position detectors of the control system leads to a dynamic <b>mechanical</b> <b>error,</b> which is obtained as {{the difference}} between the feedback-controlled table position and the position of the tool relative to the table (tool–table relative position). In this paper, analysis methods are proposed to roughly determine the component of the mechanical system that causes the dynamic <b>mechanical</b> <b>error.</b> Two methods, a two-encoders method and a four-accelerators method, for investigating the influence of the mechanical component on the dynamic <b>mechanical</b> <b>error</b> are proposed.

The results suggest that multiple iterations of closed-loop position updating may reduce the error further, but this needs more investigation. The causes of the position error during open-loop actuation can be broadly divided into two categories: system error and <b>mechanical</b> <b>error.</b> The system error is due to the spatial resolution of the SLM and any misalignment of the optical elements. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>error</b> is caused by the misalignment of the image coordinates compared to the LabVIEW user interface coordinates. This misalignment exists due to the mechanical adjustment of the camera position when attempting to match to the LabVIEW coordinates. The software-defined coordinates in LabVIEW were considered the ideal coordinates, and the camera was adjusted by hand such that a single pixel on both the MATLAB image-processing module and the LabVIEW actuation module had the same dimensions. Despite the careful adjustment, an error of approximately 6 – 8 pixels was present; this was quantified by taking multiple measurements of a stationary micro-object.|$|E
