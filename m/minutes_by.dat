5|$|In March 2016 {{the route}} to Oslo was closed down. The {{operator}} was Air Norway at this time. This leaves charter flights as the only traffic, and big uncertainty whether the airport should be closed down or not.

5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 <b>minutes)</b> <b>by</b> swelling and a tingling sensation.

Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{started the}} 1955–56 season, which was purely domestic, with 164 against Queensland in Brisbane. On the final day, Miller set the hosts 275 for victory in three hours. He {{lengthened}} the innings break by seven <b>minutes,</b> <b>by</b> remonstrating with officials to pause the {{match for the}} running of the Melbourne Cup. They agreed and the match was stopped for 13 minutes for the race. Queensland lost seven wickets but held on for a draw, aided by the 20 minutes lost by Miller's love of horseracing.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{also used}} her {{protected}} ranking to enter premier clay events in Madrid and Rome, where {{she lost her}} first round matches to Victoria Azarenka and Christina McHale respectively. She had put on a promising display against Azarenka, {{but was unable to}} convert 8 out of 9 breakpoints, allowing Azarenka to clinch victory in straight sets. Robson was awarded a wild card into Wimbledon for a second year, but was defeated in 69 <b>minutes</b> <b>by</b> Angelique Kerber in the first round in an error-strewn performance.|$|E

Portland answered right away with goals in the 54th <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> Baptiste, 66th <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> Boyd and 76th <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> Alhassan.

5|$|Toms ran to {{a nearby}} petrol station for help and a man there gave her his mobile phone to call the police. While making the call, she twice heard Parker cry out in pain.

5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>by</b> a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Friday's fine form {{continued}} into the 1975–76 season; after their 4–2 victory over Hartlepool United on 23 September 1975, Reading were top of the Fourth Division having just won four games in a row. Friday, meanwhile, was the club's top scorer. The next game was against Bournemouth on the 27th, and although Reading won 2–1 Friday was sent off after 79 <b>minutes.</b> <b>By</b> this time the forward was overwhelmingly popular among Reading's fans, to whom he endeared himself by performing a lap of honour after each goal he scored. A month later, after two wins, two defeats and a draw during October, the team was fourth in the table.|$|E

5|$|In {{the quarter}} final against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Arsenal {{initially}} went {{down by a}} goal but an equaliser was gained after a further 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>by</b> Billy Blyth. Both teams had good attacks on goal {{throughout the rest of}} the game, but the only further goal came following a header by Joe Hulme for Arsenal after a run and a cross from Jack Butler. The draw for the semi-final saw Arsenal play Southampton at Stamford Bridge. The muddy state of the pitch hampered the normal pace of the play shown by Arsenal, but both Buchan and Hulme scored for the gunners to Southampton's single response by Bill Rawlings. Southampton were denied two penalty appeals.|$|E
5|$|Marquinhos {{made his}} debut on 16 September in a 2–3 loss against Bologna at the Stadio Olimpico, sent on by manager Zdeněk Zeman to replace Iván Piris for the match's final 15 <b>minutes.</b> <b>By</b> October, Zeman decided to partner Marquinhos for his speed {{alongside}} former Corinthians teammate and fellow Brazilian Leandro Castán in central defence, demoting former starter Nicolás Burdisso to the substitutes' bench.

5|$|On 19 April, a new Jetstream 32 {{aircraft}} {{was taken into}} service.

In addition to allowing more passengers, larger planes would give higher comfort, and allow a more flexible ticket pricing scheme. An agreement with Danish Air Transport (DAT) to operate an ATR 42, with a capacity of 48 seats, was signed in mid-October.|$|E

5|$|The {{engagement}} {{had lasted}} just ten minutes according to Shannons log, or eleven <b>minutes</b> <b>by</b> Lieutenant Wallis' watch. Broke more modestly claimed fifteen minutes in his official despatch. Shannon had lost 23 men killed, and had 56 wounded. Chesapeake had about 48 killed, including four lieutenants, the master {{and many other}} of her officers, and 99 wounded. Shannon {{had been hit by}} a total of 158 projectiles, Chesapeake by 362 (these figures include grapeshot). In the time the batteries of both ships were firing, the Americans had been exposed to 44 roundshot, whilst the British had received 10 or 11 in reply (these are figures for shot which would have produced casualties or material damage; some of Chesapeakes shot was fired low, bouncing off Shannons side at waterline level). Even before being boarded, Chesapeake had lost the gunnery duel by a considerable margin.|$|E
5|$|The main {{airport for}} Roskilde is Copenhagen Airport {{which can be}} reached in about 40 <b>minutes</b> <b>by</b> train. Since April 1973, {{there has also been}} the small local Roskilde Airport, serving light {{aircraft}} for training, taxi, and flight instruction. There are plans to expand it for use by larger aircraft, possibly including discount international flights. The plans were approved, but lack of commitment from any carriers has postponed progress. The airport currently handles up to 100,000 operations (flights) per year, most of which are light aircraft operations associated with school flights.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} PvP modes in Vainglory: Standard, {{in which the}} whole map is available, Battle Royale, in which {{progression}} is faster and the battle is limited only to the lane, and Blitz, in which players must gain the most number of points or reach the 15 point score cap in 5 <b>minutes</b> <b>by</b> taking down turrets and killing off Crystal Sentries or the Gold Miner which gives three points each, or by killing other players which gives one point. If a Blitz match were to ever be tied by the 5 minute mark, then {{the first team to}} score the first point in overtime wins. Players can play ranked Standard games to increase their in-game ranking, or casual Standard games, in which their rank is not affected. In the game client, ranked play duration is listed as 25 minutes, whereas casual play is 20 minutes.|$|E
