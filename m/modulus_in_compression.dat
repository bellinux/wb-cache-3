40|$|Adobe masonry {{is largely}} used as {{construction}} material worldwide and the mechanical modelling of adobe structures {{is a key}} issue. This work deals with 2 -D micromechanical analysis of two component adobe masonry (i. e. composite system composed of adobe bricks and mortar joints), focusing {{on the influence of}} different bond configurations and loading schemes. Homogenization is applied by defining a periodic unit cell for each of the investigated bond schemes and by deriving global failure curves, based on failure criteria of both mortar and bricks. Experimental tests showed bi-modularity (i. e. different Young <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> and tension) for both mortar and bricks, so this feature of elastic behaviour was taken into account in micromodelling. The results are twofold: for each bond scheme, critical curves in the principal stress plane are derived for the homogenised unit cell, and the relationships between the homogenised elastic moduli and the loading angle is obtained. Micromechanical analysis provided a major difference between homogenised elastic behaviour in tension and in compression. In any masonry bond scheme, homogenised elastic moduli drastically change with the loading angle...|$|E
40|$|The tensile {{behavior}} of plain concrete is customary {{assumed to be}} linear, and the stiffness modulus is approached by {{the value of the}} initial tangent stiffness <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression.</b> However, even two decades ago the contrary was proven by the experimental results on plain concrete in direct tension. The stress-strain {{behavior of}} concrete in tension was demonstrated to be highly non-linear, even at very low stress levels. One of the major difficulties in obtaining an accurate tensile stiffness response is to achieve a uniform tensile stress in the section, without creating stress concentrations at any point along the section. These stress disparities will lead to micro crack initiation and falsely recorded responses. A non-linear Finite Element Model (FEM) based on the anisotropic material approach, was developed to produce the load-displacement response of a concrete beam loaded with a two point loading system. The load-displacement curves and stress-strain curves were validated to laboratory tested specimens having identical material properties. It was shown that the stiffness behavior of plain concrete in flexure is non-linear, and follows a quadratic function. The research work also covered the evaluation of two failure criteria...|$|E

The preliminary evaluation of this novel method for production of porous bioceramics showed promising potential applications in bone tissue engineering. The produced bioceramics {{were subjected to}} microstructural, physical, mechanical, and in vitro characterisation. Mercury intrusion porosimetry, supported by SEM analysis, showed the presence of bimodal porosity (smaller pores with diameters of 10 to 30 µm and cylindrical macropores with diameters from 100 to 400 µm) and 60 % of the interconnected porosity.

40|$|Meniscal repair {{is widely}} used as a {{treatment}} for meniscus injury. However, where meniscal damage has progressed such that repair is not possible, approaches for partial meniscus replacement are now being developed which have the potential to restore the functional role of the meniscus, in stabilising the knee joint, absorbing and distributing stress during loading, and prevent early degenerative joint disease. One attractive potential solution to the current lack of meniscal replacements is the use of decellularised natural biological scaffolds, derived from xenogeneic tissues, which are produced by treating the native tissue to remove the immunogenic cells. The current study investigated the effect of decellularisation on the biomechanical tensile and compressive (indentation and unconfined) properties of the porcine medial meniscus through an experimental-computational approach. The results showed that decellularised medial porcine meniscus maintained the tensile biomechanical properties of the native meniscus, but had lower tensile initial elastic <b>modulus.</b> <b>In</b> <b>compression,</b> decellularised medial porcine meniscus generally showed lower elastic modulus and higher permeability compared to that of the native meniscus. These changes in the biomechanical properties, which ranged from less than 1 % to 40 %, {{may be due to the}} reduction of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) content during the decellularisation process. The predicted biomechanical properties for the decellularised medial porcine meniscus were within the reported range for the human meniscus, making it an appropriate biological scaffold for consideration as a partial meniscus replacement...|$|E

The approach {{has been shown to be}} valid and several compositions have been fabricated. The alumina hydrate particle size and the amount of alumina hydrate in the composites are also shown to have an influence on the extent of densification. The densities for all sintered specimens were measured. It was found that density increases as compaction pressure increases, the density decreases as particles size increases. At 400 MPa there is an optimum particles size which is (90 - 125) µm to reach maximum density and the density decreases as volume fraction increases from 2 % to 20 %. The microstructure enhances as compaction pressure increases, agglomeration of alumina hydrate particles increases with increasing of volume fraction and cavities increases especially at low compaction pressure more than at high compaction pressure. The mechanical properties (compression test and Vickers hardness) of sintered specimens compacted at 100 MPa accomplished for three volume fractions 2 %, 10 % and 20 % and three particles size (45 - 90) µm, (90 - 125) µm and (125 - 150) µm.

40|$|International audienceFindings {{from animal}} studies have {{suggested}} that bone remodeling is under beta-adrenergic control. However, the level of adrenergic inhibition required to achieve the most favorable effects on the skeleton remains unknown. To address this question, we compared the effects of low (0. 1 mg/Kg/day), medium (5 mg/Kg/day) or high (20 mg/Kg/day) doses of propranolol given 5 days per week for 10 weeks in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Characteristics of bone microarchitecture, biomechanical properties and bone turnover were investigated, whilst heart functions were assessed by echocardiography and catheterization of the left ventricle. We first confirmed the expression of Adrbeta 2 R and the absence of Adrbeta 1 R on osteoblasts by PCR and confocal microscopy. We then showed that low dose propranolol prevented OVX induced bone loss by increasing bone formation (+ 30 % of MAR vs. placebo, P = 0. 01) and decreasing bone resorption (- 52 % of osteoclast surface on bone surface vs. placebo, P = 0. 01). Consequently, rats receiving 0. 1 mg/kg/day propranolol displayed higher stress (+ 27 %), intrinsic energy (+ 28. 7 %) and Young's <b>Modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> versus placebo (all, P < 0. 05). No significant effects on heart hemodynamic parameters were found in rats receiving this dose. In contrast, medium and high doses of propranolol had a negative effect on heart functions but no significant protective effects on bone mass in ovariectomized rats. These results, consistent with the dominant nature of the high bone mass phenotype and normal heart function of Adrbeta 2 R-deficient mice, suggest that low doses of beta-blockers may have a therapeutic utility in the treatment of osteoporosis with high selectivity for bone tissues...|$|E
40|$|Flexor {{tendinopathy}} is {{a common}} problem affecting humans and animals. Tendon healing is poorly understood and the outcomes of conservative and surgical management are often suboptimal. While often considered a localized injury, recent evidence indicates that in the short term, tendinopathic changes are distributed widely throughout the tendon, remote from the lesion itself. Whether these changes persist throughout healing is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to document gene expression, histopathological and biomechanical changes that occur throughout the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) up to 16 weeks post-injury, using an ovine surgical model of tendinopathy. Partial tendon transection was associated with decreased gene expression for aggrecan, decorin, fibromodulin, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPS 1, 2 and 3), collagen I and collagen II. Gene expression for collagen III, lumican and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP 13) increased locally around the lesion site. Expression of collagen III and MMP 13 decreased with time, but compared to controls, collagen III, MMP 13 and lumican expression remained regionally high throughout the study. An increase in TIMP 3 was observed over time. Histologically, operated tendons had higher pathology scores than controls, especially around the injured region. A chondroid phenotype was observed with increased cellular rounding and marked proteoglycan accumulation which only partially improved with time. Biomechanically, partial tendon transection resulted in a localized decrease in elastic <b>modulus</b> (<b>in</b> <b>compression)</b> but only at 8 weeks postoperatively. This study improves our understanding of tendon healing, demonstrating an early 'peak' in pathology characterized by altered gene expression and notable histopathological changes. Many of these pathological changes become more localized to the region of injury during healing. Collagen III and MMP 13 expression levels remained high close to the lesion throughout the study and may reflect the production of tendon tissue with suboptimal biomechanical properties. Further studies evaluating the long-term response of tendon to injury (6 - 12 months) are warranted to provide additional information on tendon healing and provide further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathology observed in this study...|$|E
40|$|Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used bone substitute material for vertebroplasty. However, there are serious complications, such as cement leakage and an increased fracture rate of the adjacent vertebral bodies. The latter may be related to the mechanical properties of the augmented segment within the osteoporotic spine. A possible counter-measure is prophylactic augmentation at additional levels, but this aggravates the risk for the patient. Introduction of pores is a possible method to reduce the inherent high stiffness of PMMA. This study investigates the effect of porosity on the mechanical properties of PMMA bone cement. Different fractions of a highly viscous liquid were mixed into the PMMA during preparation. An open-porous material with adjustable mechanical properties resulted after removal of the aqueous phase. Different radiopacifiers were admixed to investigate their suitability for vertebroplasty. The final material was characterized mechanically by compressive testing, microscopically and radiologically. In addition, the monomer release subsequent to hardening was measured by means of gas chromatography. The Young's <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> could be varied between 2800 +/- 70 MPa and 120 +/- 150 MPa, and the compression ultimate strength between 170 +/- 5 MPa and 8 +/- 9 MPa for aqueous fractions ranging between 0 and 50 % of volume. Only a slight decrease of the Young's modulus and small changes of ultimate strength were found when the mixing time was increased. An organic hydrophilic and lipophilic radiopacifier led to a higher Young's modulus of the porous material; however, the ultimate strength was not significantly affected by adding different radiopacifiers to the porous cement. The radiopacity was lost after washing the aqueous phase out of the pores. No separation occurred between the aqueous and the PMMA phase during injection into an open porous ceramic material. The monomer released was found to increase for increasing aqueous fractions, but remained comparable in magnitude to standard PMMA. This study demonstrates that a conventional PMMA can be modified to obtain a range of mechanical properties, including those of osteoporotic bone...|$|E

40|$|International audienceContext Mechanical {{properties}} {{are essential for}} biological functions of the hyaline cartilage such as energy dissipation and diffusion of solutes. Mechanical {{properties are}} primarily dependent on the hierarchical organization {{of the two major}} extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecular components of the cartilage: the fibrillar collagen network and the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) -substituted proteoglycan, mainly aggrecan, aggregates. Interaction of chondrocytes, the only cell type in the tissue, with the ECM through adhesion receptors is involved in establishing mechanical stability via bidirectional transduction of both mechanical forces and chemical signals. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of the transmembrane β 1 integrin adhesion receptors in cartilage biomechanical properties by the use of genetic modification in mice. Methods Costal cartilages of wild type and mutant mice lacking β 1 integrins in chondrocytes were investigated. Cartilage compressive properties and solute diffusion were characterized by rheometric analysis and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), respectively. Cartilage tissue sections were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Results At the histological level, the mutant costal cartilage was characterized by chondrocyte rounding and loss of tissue polarity. Immunohistochemistry and safranin orange staining demonstrated apparently normal aggrecan and GAG levels, respectively. Antibody staining for collagen II and TEM showed comparable expression and organization of the collagen fibrils between mutant and control cartilages. Despite the lack of gross histological and ultrastructural abnormalities, rheological measurements revealed that the peak elastic <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> of mutant cartilage was 1. 6 -fold higher than the peak elastic modulus of wild-type sample. Interestingly, the diffusion coefficient within the mutant cartilage tissue was found to be 1. 2 -fold lower in the extracellular space and 14 -fold lower in the pericellular (PCM) space compared to control. Conclusion The results demonstrate that the absence of β 1 integrins on the surface of chondrocytes increases the stiffness and modifies the diffusion properties of costal cartilage. Our data imply that β 1 integrins-mediated chondrocyte-matrix interactions directly affect cartilage biomechanics probably by modifying physical properties of individual cells. This study thus highlights the crucial role of β 1 integrins in the cartilage function...|$|E

The sample cultivars were Hidarimaki-sugi, Tosaaka-sugi, Haara-sugi, Boka-sugi and Ji-sugi, and they were 31 years old and had been planted in the Tokyo University Forest in Chiba. The discs were taken from sample trees at fixed heights for stem analysis, and the specimens for green moisture content, basic density, compression test parallel to the grain and bending test were taken from the log at about 1. 3 m above ground level.

The results are summarised as follows; 1) Total volume growth was the greatest in Tosaaka-sugi, followed by Ji-sugi, Haara-sugi and the least in Hidarimaki-sugi. 2) The radial distribution of green moisture content was classified into four types. 3) The basic density was somewhat higher near the pith than in sapwood. 4) A good linear correlation was found between the specific gravity in air dry and compressive strength of both juvenile wood and mature wood for all cultivars, but a good correlation was not found betwenn Young's <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> paralell to the grain, Young's modulus in bending, bending strength and specific gravity in air dry, either of juvenile wood or mature wood of cultivars. 5) A highly significant correlation was confirmed between Young's modulus and strength. 6) The strength properties in Boka-sugi showed lower values than those of the other 4 sugi cultivars and it was remarkable in Young's modulus. This was due to qualitative difference in the cell wall of tracheids. 7) Both the growth and the strength properties in Boka-sugi were not good. 8) For Hidarimaki-sugi the strength properties were good, but growth was not good. 9) Both the growth and the strength properties were good for Tosaaka-sugi, Ji-sugi and Haara-sugi. スギの品種による材の基本的な性質の違いを調べるために，同じ環境で，同じ施業を受けたスギ 5 品種についてその成長と材質について検討した。試料は東京大学農学部付属千葉演習林の品種試験地に植栽されていた 31 年生のスギ 5 品種（ヒダリマキスギ，トサアカスギ，ハアラスギ，ボカスギ，ジスギ）である。心材の色は 5 品種とも赤色であった。各供試木から樹高別に樹幹解析用の円盤を採取した。また，胸高部位より生材含水率（容積密度），曲げ試験片及び縦圧縮試験片を採取した。曲げ試験片及び縦圧縮試験片は未成熟材部と成熟材部に分けて採取し，気乾状態で試験を行なった。得られた結果は次の通りである。 1 ）材積成長量はトサアカスギが最大で，次にジスギ，ハアラスギ，ボカスギ，ヒダリマキスギの順であった。 2 ）生材含水率の半径方向分布は大きく 4 つのタイプに分けられた。 3 ）容積密度はいずれの品種においても，樹心部分が辺材部分よりも若干高い傾向を示した。 4 ）縦圧縮強さと気乾密度との間には各品種とも成熟材，未成熟材で良い相関が見られたが，繊維方向のヤング率，曲げヤング率及び曲げ強さと気乾密度との間には各品種について，成熟材，未成熟材に分けても必ずしも良い相関は見られなかった。 5 ）ヤング率と強さとの間には良い相関が見られた。 6 ）ボカスギの強度，ヤング率は他の 4 品種のそれより小さい値を示した。特にヤング率の場合に顕著であった。これは，ボカスギの細胞壁の質的要因が関与しているものと思われた。 7 ）ボカスギは強度的性質も成長も良くなかった。 8 ）ヒダリマキスギは強度的性質は良好であったが，成長が良くなかった。 9 ）トサアカスギ，ジスギ，ハアラスギは成長も強度的性質も優れていた...|$|E

In this respect {{the effects of}} different processing parameters on the PLGA 85 / 15 scaffold's physical and mechanical properties were investigated. Porous PLGA 85 / 15 scaffolds were prepared using a gas foaming/salt leaching technique. The processing parameters under examination included gas saturation pressure, gas saturation time, and NaCl/polymer mass ratio. The physical properties of the scaffold considered were the density, the porosity, the average pore size, and the pore density. The mechanical property studied was the Young's <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression.</b> The results demonstrated that all the processing parameters worked in concert to produce a scaffold {{with a high level}} of interconnectivity. From the parameteric study, key processing parameters were identified and selected parameters led to optimal physical and mechanical properties of the scaffold. The experimental results obtained from the mechanical properties of scaffolds were compared with a theoretical model from Gibson and Ashby relating the scaffold's mechanical properties to the density. The predicted elastic responses of opened pores structure from the theoretical model showed agreement with the experimental results. Subsequently, the effect of the optimized PLGA 85 / 15 scaffolds on the cell growth and the cell viability of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL- 60) were reported. The investigation showed that the cell growth and viability were not impaired by the presence of PLGA 85 / 15 scaffolds for the time period under investigation. Finally, the effects of different degradation media on the optimized PLGA 85 / 15 scaffold's physical and mechanical properties were also elucidated. The three different media were distilled water (dH 2 O), a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, and HL- 60 cells. In general, the average macropore size and the average molecular weight decreased as the degradation time increased in each medium. However, the scaffolds maintained mechanical and structural integrity throughout the study in all three media over the degradation period studied. Overall, PBS solution most strongly affected physical and mechanical properties, followed by dH 2 O and HL- 60 cells. The distinct variations of the scaffold's properties using different media, demonstrated the importance of carefully selecting the medium to perform in vitro studies.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a new {{theoretical}} model is developed {{to characterize the}} damage of the adhesive joint. Elastic modulus of adhesive joints is an important parameter to represent damage characteristics. Based {{on the fact that}} the thickness of the adhesive layer is very small, it is reasonable to believe that damage will decrease the tension modulus of the adhesive joint while the compression modulus will keep unchanged. Modeling the adhesive joint as an interface with different <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> tension and <b>compression,</b> and applying integral transform method, we solve the associated nonlinear boundary problem to obtain the nonlinear ultrasonic waves transmitting through the adhesive layer. With this nonlinear ultrasonic wave, variation of elastic modulus and damage variable of the adhesive layer are thereafter characterized nondestructively by a nonlinear coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Because {{average life}} {{expectancy}} has increased and peoples lifestyles have changed, degenerative diseases have become a critical issue. The demand for biomedical materials to replace or improve major body systems (skeletal, circulatory and nervous, etc.) will increase as people strive to maintain good quality of life. Cellulose is the most abundant naturally occurring polymer and is an inexhaustible resource for raw materials. Bacterial cellulose (BC) resembles human tissue {{in the sense that}} it is soft and is composed of highly hydrated nano fibrils with high mechanical strength. The material is versatile and can be manufactured in various sizes and shapes depending on the product requirements. This makes it interesting to explore BC for use in several biomedical applications. In this work bacterial cellulose was fermented into tubular and meniscus form. The material properties were evaluated with a focus on mechanical, morphological and surface properties for applications such as blood vessels and meniscus substitutes. Bacterial cellulose tubes with asymmetric morphology and an onion like multilayer structure were produced by optimizing the oxygen ratio during fermentation. The inner lumen of the tube was smooth and promoted the adhesion and formation of a confluent layer of endothelial cells. The outer layer was more open, to allow cell ingrowth. The mechanical properties were improved by an increase in the oxygen ratio. A maximal burst pressure value of 880 mmHg was recorded for tubes produced at 100 % oxygen ratio, which is far higher than physiological blood pressure. The material was proven to be biocompatible, subcutaneous in rats. There were no foreign body reactions or encapsulation of the material. Instead newly formed blood vessels could be seen as well as ingrowth of cells and production of tissue in the material. Modification of the cellulose with xyloglucan bearing an adhesion peptide improved the adhesion of endothelial cells with an unaffected morphology of the cellulose network. The nano fibrils were also surface modified with ionic groups and decorated with calcium phosphate to improve bone adhesion and later fixation of the material as a future meniscus substitute. Initial mechanical properties of BC in compression and tensile load revealed that BC has advantageous mechanical properties compared to collagen material and has the same Youngs <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> load as a pig meniscus. This research contributes to knowledge of tubular fermentation and the mechanical, morphological properties thereof and has developed two novel surface modifications to improve cell adhesion to the nano cellulose. The results can be used as a starting point for new optimization and developments of new generations of cardiovascular and orthopaedic implants using microbially derived cellulose...|$|E
40|$|A {{technical}} bending {{theory of}} beams accounting for nonlinearity due to damage and bimodularity of brittle rocks was proposed in Part I. In order {{to check the}} validity of the above theory, a series of three-point bending (3 PB) tests has been carried out using Dionysos marble beams that have been sampled from the same extracted block. Although the modeling of the 3 PB test is considerably more complicated than that of the four-point bending test, the experimental procedure in the former test is simpler than in the later test and most importantly, the location of the fracture is better controlled in the 3 PB test, Herein, it is demonstrated that the test results have very good repeatability and they support the above technical theory. The bending tests also indicate that Dionysos marble is characterized by different elastic <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> (E-c) and in tension (E-t) at small loads, such that the relation m = E-c/E-t congruent to 0. 8 holds true. This relationship of elastic moduli for this type of marble is also supported independently by uniaxial compression and direct tension tests on test specimens cored from the same marble block. A plausible physical explanation for this type of marble anisotropy has yet to be made. This observed difference cannot be explained by considering the rock simply as a material with cracks. It may be attributed to pure micromechanical reasons such as the complex microstructure of this type of reck, characterized by a complex previous loading history (metamorphism), Until such an explanation is available, the apparent behavior can be used in analyzing the stress-strain behavior of rocks. Further, the 3 PB experiments indicate that fracture of marble starts always at the bottom fiber of the middle cross-section of the beam and the failure extension strain is the same with that occurring in the direct tension test. This last result {{is due to the fact}} that the central section of marble beam is almost under extensional strain, which in turn is caused by the combination of the concentrated load and Poisson's effects. The damage parameter that enters the direct tension stress-strain law was obtained independently from longitudinal strain measurements at the outermost compression and extension fibers, as well as, from bending curvature and deflection measurements. This value of the damage factor is in accordance with the damage measured from the direct tension tests. It is also demonstrated that a linear Timoshenko-type theory containing an intrinsic length scale is able to approximate the nonlinear deflection behavior of Dionysos marble beams. Finally, based on a suggestion by Ludwig Prandtl, the stress-strain relationships in unconfined compression and direct tension, as well as Poisson's ratio, of Dionysos marble were derived from bending tests.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. April 2012. Major: Aerospace {{engineering}} and mechanics. Advisors: Perry H. Leo, Jack L. Lewis. 1 computer file (PDF); xi, 159 pagesThe composition {{and structure of}} articular cartilage (AC) are inhomogeneous within the tissue and vary throughout its depth. Its extracellular matrix {{can be considered as}} a fiber-reinforced composite solid consisting of a dense stable network of collagen fibers embedded in a proteoglycan (PG) gel. Several studies have shown that this specialized structure plays a vital role in the mechanical function of AC. In pathological conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA), degeneration of cartilage due to changes in mechanical properties is observed. Osteoarthritis is {{the most common cause of}} disability in the elderly and affects more than 20 million people in the USA alone. The focus of this work is to understand the mechanical response of AC using finite element models using ABAQUS, a commercial FEA package that is widely used in the field of cartilage mechanics. This is done at two different scales - the macroscale and the mesoscale. At the macroscale, AC is considered as a homogeneous isotropic poroviscoelastic (PVE) material saturated by the interstitial fluid (water). Indentation tests are performed on cartilage from the mouse tibia plateau using two different sized flat-ended conical indenters with flat-end diameters of 15 μm and 170 μm. A finite element (FE) model of the test is developed and the PVE parameters identified by using inverse methods to minimize the errors between FE simulated and test data. Data from the smaller indenter is first used to fit the viscoelastic (VE) parameters, on the basis that for this tip size the gel diffusion time (approximate time constant of the poroelastic (PE) response) is of the order of 0. 1 s, so that the PE response is negligible. These parameters are then used to fit the data from the larger indenter for the PE parameters, using the VE parameters extracted from the data from the smaller indenter. At the mesoscale the inhomogeneities of AC need to be addressed to understand the microstructural behavior of AC. The problem of interest in this part of the work is to understand the mechanical role of interfibrillar cross-links (IFLs), if they exist, suspected in AC and most collagenous tissues. A 3 D FE model of AC meso-structure motivated by the parallel fibril geometry of the mid and deep zones of the patella is developed consisting of a PE matrix, unidirectional, bilinear fibrils (different stiffness in tension and compression), and the IFLs. Parametric studies are then performed for the model in simulated compression tests along the fibril direction and the effect of the IFLs and matrix are predicted and compared. Results suggest presence of IFLs would increase the effective <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>compression.</b> This is due to maintaining organization of the fibrils into a network due to IFLs imparting stability to the network by preventing early bending of fibrils and effectively reducing the Poisson effect. Finally, with a set of literature based parameters, compression tests for AC using the mesomodel show that removing the cross-links results in a significant (43 %) drop in the effective compressive modulus, suggesting resolution necessary to experimentally detect the IFLs. At the mesoscale, the IFLs would play the mechanical role of stabilizing the fibril network and enhancing its stiffness...|$|E

Properly designed and carefully conducted experiments using coupon specimens following ISO and ASTM test standards were performed to characterize the flexural, tensile, compressive and shear properties of the fiber composite skins and the modified phenolic core of the composite sandwich structure. As a general behavior, the glass fiber composite skins behaved linearly elastic up to failure in both tension and compression with the tensile strength {{much higher than the}} compressive strength. The modified phenolic core behaved linearly elastic in tension but exhibited non-linear behavior <b>in</b> <b>compression.</b> The modified phenolic core material exhibited higher strength and <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> shear and <b>compression</b> compared to the traditional core material systems. The improved mechanical properties of the core structure combined with the high-strength and lightweight glass fiber composite skins suggest a high potential of the novel composite sandwich panel for structural applications.

30|$|The {{critical}} {{buckling load}} was determined experimentally for various buckling lengths of the GFRP bars (141 – 283  mm). The lengths {{were chosen to}} correspond to possible lengths of connector diagonals at an inclination of 45 ° to the TRRPC panel surface. The length {{is a function of}} the distance between the TRRPC panels which is controlled by the prescribed FC insulation thickness. The critical buckling load was observed to decrease with increasing buckling length; longer connector diagonals become less effective <b>in</b> <b>compression.</b> <b>In</b> a double connector, the compressed bars may become more effective due to a decreased buckling length, provided that the diagonals are attached at the intersections. For the selected thickness of 150  mm (samples with a free length of 212  mm), the average measured buckling load was 1.72  kN. Based on the obtained results, a <b>modulus</b> of elasticity <b>in</b> <b>compression</b> was estimated to be 26.5  GPa. This value is significantly lower than that obtained in tension which is likely due to micro-buckling or kinking of the fibres within the matrix material (fib 2007).|$|R
