50|$|Moustaches can be tended through shaving {{the hair}} of the chin and cheeks, {{preventing}} it from becoming a full beard. A variety of tools {{have been developed for}} the care of moustaches, including safety razors, moustache wax, <b>moustache</b> nets, <b>moustache</b> <b>brushes,</b> <b>moustache</b> combs and moustache scissors.|$|R
60|$|Her {{shoulders}} shook convulsively {{under his}} hands, which he laid on her paternally. His straggly, wiry <b>moustache</b> <b>brushed</b> her forehead in a good-night kiss. She closed the door, and went {{away from it}} {{to the middle of}} the room before she allowed herself a tired-out sort of laugh, without buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|On 25 August 1887, six {{citizens}} of Triengen found Bürstenfabrik AG Triengen with a share capital of CHF 40,000. A local businessman, Xavier Pfenniger-Vonnarburg becomes the commercial manager. By {{the start of}} the 20th Century, the company finishes building a brush woods production plant and starts production of toothbrushes, subsequently followed by hair brushes, cloth <b>brushes,</b> hat <b>brushes,</b> <b>moustache</b> <b>brushes</b> and other equipment for gardening and farming activities.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} my suspicions of the Count were profound. From the first I had doubted him; {{he was so}} blandly plausible. But as we landed at Ostend I had accidentally overheard a low whispered {{conversation}} when he passed a shabby-looking man, who had travelled in a second-class carriage from London. 'That succeeds?' the shabby-looking man had muttered under his breath in French, as the haughty nobleman with the waxed <b>moustache</b> <b>brushed</b> by him.|$|R
60|$|The play went on. But he {{was obsessed}} {{by the desire}} to kiss the tiny blue vein that nestled in the bend of her arm. He could feel it. His whole face seemed {{suspended}} till he had put his lips there. It must be done. And the other people! At last he bent quickly forward and touched it with his lips. His <b>moustache</b> <b>brushed</b> the sensitive flesh. Clara shivered, drew away her arm.|$|R
6000|$|GERMAN TRAVELLER. 'Kellner, bezahlen'! [His voice is, {{like his}} <b>moustache,</b> stiff and <b>brushed</b> {{up at the}} ends. His figure also is stiff and his hair a little grey; clearly once, if not now, a colonel.] ...|$|R
60|$|Poirot seized his hat, gave {{a ferocious}} twist to his <b>moustache,</b> and, {{carefully}} <b>brushing</b> an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned me to precede {{him down the}} stairs; there we joined the detectives and set out for Styles.|$|R
6000|$|It was at Barnard Scrolls, {{the next}} station to Worsted Skeynes, on the {{following}} afternoon, that a young man entered a first-class compartment of the 3.10 train to town. The young man wore a Newmarket coat, natty white gloves, and carried an eyeglass. His face was well coloured, his chestnut <b>moustache</b> well <b>brushed,</b> and his blue eyes with their loving expression seemed to say, [...] "Look at me--come, look at me--can anyone be better fed?" [...] His valise and hat-box, of the best leather, bore the inscription, [...] "E. Maydew, 8th Lancers." ...|$|R
60|$|Old Jolyon {{followed}} a very little maid--not more than sixteen one would say--into {{a very small}} drawing-room where the sun-blinds were drawn. It held a cottage piano and little else save a vague fragrance and good taste. He stood in the middle, with his top hat in his hand, and thought: 'I expect she's very badly off!' There was a mirror above the fireplace, and he saw himself reflected. An old-looking chap! He heard a rustle, and turned round. She was so close that his <b>moustache</b> almost <b>brushed</b> her forehead, just under her hair.|$|R
6000|$|Outside the old fellow's lodging a {{dismounted}} cocher {{was standing}} disconsolate in the sun. [...] "How was I {{to know they}} were going to fight a duel?" [...] he burst out on seeing me. [...] "He had white hair--I call you to witness he had white hair. This is bad for me: they will ravish my licence. Aha! you will see--this is bad for me!" [...] I gave him the slip and found my way upstairs. The old fellow was alone, lying on the bed, his feet covered with a rug as if he might feel cold; his eyes were closed, but in this sleep of death, he still had that air of faint surprise. At full length, watching the bed intently, Freda lay, as she lay nightly when he was really asleep. The shutters were half open; the room still smelt slightly of rum. I stood for a long time looking at the face: the little white fans of <b>moustache</b> <b>brushed</b> upwards even in death, the hollows in his cheeks, the quiet of his figure; he was like some old knight.... The dog broke the spell. She sat up, and resting her paws on the bed, licked his face. I went downstairs--I couldn't bear to hear her howl. This was his letter to me, written in a pointed handwriting: ...|$|R
6000|$|His lean, short {{face had}} a skin so burnt {{that it looked}} like leather; his jaw was long and prominent, his chin pointed, and he had hollows in his cheeks. There were {{wrinkles}} across his forehead; his eyes were brown; and little white <b>moustaches</b> were <b>brushed</b> up from the corners of his lips. The back of his head bulged out above the lines of his lean neck and high, sharp shoulders; his grey hair was cropped quite close. In the Marseilles buffet, on the journey out, I had met an Englishman, almost his counterpart in features--but somehow very different! This old fellow had nothing of the other's alert, autocratic self-sufficiency. He was quiet and undemonstrative, without looking, as it were, insulated against shocks and foreign substances. He was certainly no Frenchman. His eyes, indeed, were brown, but hazel-brown, and gentle--not the red-brown sensual eye of the Frenchman. An American? But was ever an American so passive? A German? His <b>moustache</b> was certainly <b>brushed</b> up, but in a modest, almost pathetic way, not in the least Teutonic. Nothing seemed to fit him. I gave him up, and named him [...] "the Cosmopolitan." ...|$|R
60|$|Quentin Durward--though, {{like the}} Scottish {{youth of the}} period, he had been early taught to look upon arms and war--thought {{he had never seen}} a more martial looking, or more {{completely}} equipped and accomplished man at arms than now saluted him in the person of his mother's brother, called Ludovic with the Scar, or Le Balafre; yet he could not but shrink a little from the grim expression of his countenance, while, with its rough <b>moustaches,</b> he <b>brushed</b> first the one and then the other cheek of his kinsman, welcomed his nephew to France, and, in the same breath, asked what news from Scotland.|$|R
50|$|Sabato was {{distinguished}} by his bald pate and <b>brush</b> <b>moustache</b> and wore tinted spectacles and open-necked shirts. He {{was born in}} Rojas, {{a small town in}} Buenos Aires Province. Sabato began his studies at the Colegio Nacional de La Plata. He then studied physics at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, where he earned a PhD. He then attended the Sorbonne in Paris and worked at the Curie Institute. After World War II, he lost interest in science and started writing.|$|R
6000|$|Leaving {{at the end}} of April, I forgot him altogether. In {{the same}} month, however, of the {{following}} year I was again at Monte Carlo, and going one day to the concert found myself seated next this same old fellow. The orchestra was playing Meyerbeer's [...] "Prophete," [...] and my neighbour was asleep, snoring softly. He was dressed in the same grey suit, with the same straw hat (or one exactly like it) on his knees, and his hands crossed above it. Sleep had not disfigured him--his little white <b>moustache</b> was still <b>brushed</b> up, his lips closed; a very good and gentle expression hovered on his face. A curved mark showed on his right temple, the scar of a cut {{on the side of his}} neck, and his left hand was covered by an old glove, the little forger of which was empty. He woke up when the march was over and brisked up his moustache.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile {{the shop}} slowly churned its oddments. Every Thursday {{afternoon}} James sorted out tangles of bits and bobs, antique garments and occasional finds. With these he trimmed his window, {{so that it}} looked like a historical museum, rather soiled and scrappy. Indoors he made baskets of assortments: threepenny, sixpenny, ninepenny and shilling baskets, rather like a bran pie in which everything was a plum. And then, on Friday evening, thin and alert he hovered behind the counter, his coat shabbily buttoned over his narrow chest, his face agitated. He had shaved his side-whiskers, so that they only grew becomingly as low as his ears. His rather large, grey <b>moustache</b> was <b>brushed</b> off his mouth. His hair, gone very thin, was brushed frail and floating over his baldness. But still a gentleman, still courteous, with a charming voice he suggested the possibilities of a pad of green parrots' tail-feathers, or of a few yards of pink-pearl trimming or of old chenille fringe. The women would pinch the thick, exquisite old chenille fringe, delicate and faded, curious to feel its softness. But they wouldn't give threepence for it. Tapes, ribbons, braids, buttons, feathers, jabots, bussels, appliqués, fringes, jet-trimmings, bugle-trimmings, bundles of old coloured machine-lace, many bundles of strange cord, in all colours, for old-fashioned braid-patterning, ribbons with H.M.S. Birkenhead, for boys' sailor caps--everything that nobody wanted, did the women turn over and over, till they chanced on a find. And James' quick eyes watched the slow surge of his flotsam, as the pot boiled but did not boil away. Wonderful that he did not think of the days when these bits and bobs were new treasures. But he did not.|$|R
6000|$|Round {{the long}} table, at their dinner-hour, what {{a variety of}} type among the men! And yet a likeness, a sort of quickness and sensibility, common to them all. A few are a little méfiant of these newcomers, with the méfiance of {{individual}} character, not of class distrustfulness, nor of that defensive expressionless we cultivate in England. The French soldier has {{a touch of the}} child in him--if we leave out the Parisians; a child who knows more than you do perhaps; a child who has lived many lives before this life; a wise child, who jumps to your moods and shows you his [...] "sore fingers" [...] readily when he feels that you want to see them. He has none of the perverse and grudging attitude towards his own ailments that we English foster. He is perhaps a little inclined to pet them, treating them with an odd mixture of stoic gaiety and gloomy indulgence. It is like all the rest of him; he feels everything so much quicker than we do--he is so much more impressionable. The variety of type is more marked physically than in our country. Here is a tall Savoyard cavalryman, with a maimed hand and a fair <b>moustache</b> <b>brushed</b> up at the ends, big and strong, with grey eyes, and a sort of sage self-reliance; only twenty-six, but might be forty. Here is a real Latin, who was buried by an explosion at Verdun; handsome, with dark hair and a round head, and colour in his cheeks; an ironical critic of everything, a Socialist, a mocker, a fine, strong fellow with a clear brain, who attracts women. Here are two peasants from the Central South, both with bad sciatica, slower in look, with a mournful, rather monkeyish expression in their eyes, as if puzzled by their sufferings. Here is a true Frenchman, a Territorial, from Roanne, riddled with rheumatism, quick and gay, and suffering, touchy and affectionate, not tall, brown-faced, brown-eyed, rather fair, with clean jaw and features, and eyes with a soul in them, looking a little up; forty-eight--the oldest of them all--they call him Grandpère. And here is a printer from Lyon with shell-shock; medium-coloured, short and roundish and neat, full of humanity and high standards and domestic affection, and so polite, with eyes a little like a dog's. And here another with shell-shock and brown-green eyes, from the [...] "invaded countries"; méfiant, truly, this one, but with a heart when you get at it; neat, and brooding, quick as a cat, nervous, and wanting his own way. But they are all so varied. If there are qualities common to all they are impressionability and capacity for affection. This is not the impression left on one by a crowd of Englishmen. Behind the politeness and civilised bearing of the French I used to think there was a little of the tiger. In a sense perhaps there is, {{but that is not the}} foundation of their character--far from it! Underneath the tiger, again, there is a man civilised for centuries. Most certainly the politeness of the French is no surface quality, it is a polish welling up from a naturally affectionate heart, a naturally quick apprehension of the moods and feelings of others; it is the outcome of a culture so old that, underneath all differences, it binds together all those types and strains of blood--the Savoyard, and the Southerner, the Latin of the Centre, the man from the North, the Breton, the Gascon, the Basque, the Auvergnat, even to some extent the Norman, and the Parisian--in a sort of warm and bone-deep kinship. They have all, as it were, sat for centuries under a wall with the afternoon sun warming them through and through, as I so often saw the old town gossips sitting of an afternoon. The sun of France has made them alike; a light and happy sun, not too southern, but just southern enough.|$|R
5000|$|Channel 13 began {{operation}} in October 1953 as KGGM-TV, {{owned by the}} Hebenstreit family's New Mexico Broadcasting Company along with KGGM radio (610 AM, now KNML). In the late 1960s, the Hebenstreits sold a minority share to Chicago's Harriscope Broadcasting, which at one point owned WSNS-TV in Chicago (among other stations). Many early Westerns were filmed, at least partially, at KGGM. The large studio that it used is now KRQE's [...] "Newsplex," [...] a combination newsroom and news studio. KGGM talent Earnest [...] "Stretch" [...] Scherer, known as Captain Billy, hosted a children's show called Captain Billy's Clubhouse. The format was a kids peanut gallery on bleachers holding about 50 seats with games and banter between cartoons, à la Bozo's Circus. Captain Billy was a sea captain with a Dutch boy white haircut sticking {{out from under a}} sea Captain's hat and big <b>brush</b> <b>moustache.</b> Scherer was shot in the station's lobby after a misunderstanding involving a jealous husband. He died later at a hospital.Among many alumni at KGGM/KRQE is Ray Rayner, formerly a children's television personality at WGN-TV in Chicago. He spent the last several years at KRQE before going into retirement.|$|R
