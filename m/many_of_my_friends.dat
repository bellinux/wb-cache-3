Schwab said, [...] "On this record I was really able to take the reins of the creative process in a direction I was passionate about. I was able to write songs that pushed me to grow as an artist. It was also insanely fun to have so <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> involved in the process and {{at this point in the}} game that is what its about.

[...] With concert goers noting the new energy of the songs and new band members Scott Davis on drums, Dustinn Lowry on guitar and Mikee [...] "Norman" [...] Williams on bass it seems P86 has benefited from a back to basics reinvention.|$|E

In this article he also quotes the book Karma Cola describing that in this book a German economist tells author Gita Mehta, [...] "It is my opinion that quality control has to be introduced for gurus. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> have become crazy in India". She describes a comment by Suranya Chakraverti who said that some Westerners {{do not believe in}} spirituality and ridicule a true guru. Other westerners, Chakraverti said, on the other hand believe in spirituality but tend to put faith in a guru who is a swindler.|$|E

There is no trouble in writing a scientific treatise on the folk-lore of Central China, or a statistical enquiry into the declining population of Prince Edward Island. But to write something out of one's own mind, worth reading for its own sake, is an arduous contrivance only to be achieved in fortunate moments, few and far between.
