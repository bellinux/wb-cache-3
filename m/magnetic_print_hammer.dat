50|$|The {{line printer}} could print 600 lines of 120 {{characters}} per minute. It used a print barrel {{made up of}} 120 print wheels each with 50 characters around its edge. Each of the 120 print positions had a <b>print</b> <b>hammer</b> which when fired squeezed the paper and an inked ribbon between itself and the rotating print barrel {{for a fraction of}} a second. It is reputed to be the first commercially produced barrel printer.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Magnetic</b> striped <b>prints</b> were {{expensive}} to produce; each print {{cost at least}} twice as much as a print with a standard optical soundtrack only. Furthermore, these striped prints wore out faster than optical prints and caused more problems in use, such as flakes of oxide clogging the replay heads. Due to these problems, and also because many cinemas never installed the necessary playback equipment, <b>magnetic</b> sound <b>prints</b> started to be made in small quantities for [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings only, with the main release using standard mono optical sound prints. As time went by roadshow screenings were increasingly made using 70 mm film, and the use of striped 35 mm prints declined further. Many CinemaScope films from the 1960s and 1970s were never released in stereo at all. Finally the introduction in 1976 of Dolby Stereo, which provided a similar performance to striped <b>magnetic</b> <b>prints</b> but more reliably and at a far lower cost, caused the 4-track magnetic system to become totally obsolete.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> Limited was {{a company}} founded in 1954 by Nigel Henderson and Eduardo Paolozzi.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> {{coincided with}} the artists’ {{involvement}} in the Independent Group, a contingent of artists, architects and writers who celebrated popular culture and mass production. Paolozzis notes stated ‘it {{is the object of}} <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> Ltd that an attack be made on the craft field using the silk-screen as the media to be exploited.’ [...] <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> wallpapers were manufactured by Cole & Son from 1955, and their textile designs were produced by the Lancashire firm Hull Traders from 1958. Coalface, Cowcumber, Hessian and Sgraffito were the first tobecome available from January 1955. Barkcloth, Big Drawings, Newsprint, Portobello and Townscape followed whilst Sea Beasts and Toys were developed for a range of ceramic tiles, lampstands, bowls, trays and furniture.|$|R
40|$|Written on {{invitation}} by the ‘Journal of Visual Culture’, {{and guest}} editor Professor Anne Massey, {{for a special}} volume on the ‘Independent Group’, Walsh’s 10, 000 -word essay (which exceeded the 5, 000 word length but was left unedited due to its importance and originality) presents an account of <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> Ltd, a design firm established by Nigel Henderson and Eduardo Paolozzi in the 1950 s. Building on her pioneering and ongoing research into Henderson, the initial lecture, on which the article is based, {{was presented at the}} ICA in London (2012) and led to an invitation to deliver a lecture for the first major exhibition of <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> held at Fristsite Gallery in Colchester, UK, in January 2013. Walsh’s research was acknowledged throughout Firstsite’s exhibition publication ‘Hammer Prints’. Drawing on archival material that Walsh had exclusive access to in the extended family archives and estates of Henderson, Paolozzi, Alison and Peter Smithson, and Richard Hamilton, the article re-situates the ethos and designs of <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> within the wider aesthetic concerns and strategies of the Independent Group and the reordering of the visual first proposed by the artists in collaboration with the Smithsons in the seminal exhibition ‘Parallel of Life and Art’ (ICA, 1953). The article argues that the importance of <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> has been significantly marginalised by art history as a category of applied arts. As Walsh demonstrates, a more complex account of <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> is revealed once it is reconnected to both artists’ interest in gestalt principles of perception, contemporary theorisations of ‘pattern’, ontological questions of art posed by Malraux’s idea of the ‘imaginary museum’, and Duchamp’s idea of the ‘portable museum’. It concludes by locating <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> within the new field of Communication Theory developed by Gregory Bateson which has been understudied in relation to post-war British art, design and exhibition-making...|$|R

50|$|Variable-density's {{fate was}} then sealed as these stereo optical sound prints (as contrasted with stereo <b>magnetic</b> sound <b>prints</b> or mono optical sound prints) became a {{marketing}} imperative.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{magnetic}} audio was {{of excellent}} quality {{it also had}} significant disadvantages. <b>Magnetic</b> sound <b>prints</b> were expensive, 35mm <b>magnetic</b> <b>prints</b> cost roughly {{twice as much as}} optical sound prints, whilst 70mm prints could cost up to 15 times as much. Furthermore, they wore out faster and were also prone to damage and erasure over time. Because of the high cost of installing magnetic sound reproduction equipment only a minority of movie theaters ever installed it and the magnetic soundheads needed considerable maintenance to keep their performance up to standard. As a consequence the use of the Cinemascope 35mm four-track magnetic sound format decreased significantly {{during the course of the}} 1960s and effectively ended with the success of the Dolby Stereo optical stereo format in the late 1970s. However 70mm film continued to be used for prestigious [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings until the introduction of digital sound on 35mm film in the early 1990s removed one of the major justifications for using this expensive format.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line printer}} ran at 600 lines per minute, using a {{continuously}} rotating print drum technology, with letters, figures and punctuation marks distributed around the drum at each column. 132 solenoid-operated flat-faced <b>print</b> <b>hammers</b> comprised a <b>print</b> line, with ten characters to the inch. When a desired character {{arrived at the}} printing position, as indicated by timing marks {{on the end of}} the drum, a thyratron would fire and energize a print column solenoid, propelling its hammer to the back face of the printing paper. The paper would be bounced against a wide inked ribbon and against the drum, printing the desired character. The hammer would then rebound with a spring to await the next thyraton firing and the process would repeat on the next line down the sheet. Drum printers, when not adjusted properly, or due to component wear would mis-register the character vertically.|$|R

Also with lesser risk of overloading amps or damaging these smaller speakers. The Megasound processing algorithms were triggered by low-frequency bass below 40 Hz from a DBX-type Megasound encoded soundtrack. The bass generation synthesis had a custom cut-off fail-safe @ 16 Hz to prevent risk of structural damage to the presentation venue.|$|R
5000|$|Magnetic 3D {{bioprinting}} {{can be used}} {{to screen}} for cardiovascular toxicity, which accounts for 30% of drug withdrawals [...] Vascular smooth muscle cells are magnetically printed into 3D rings to mimic blood vessels that can contract and dilate. This system could potentially replace experiments using ex vivo tissue, which are costly and yield few data per experiment. Furthermore, magnetic 3D bioprinting can use human cells to approximate a human in vivo response better than with an animal model. This has been demonstrated by the bioassay which combines the benefits of 3D bioprinting in building tissue-like structures for study with the speed of <b>magnetic</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|R
500|$|The textile {{department}} {{was run by}} the constructivist designer Varvara Stepanova. In common with other departments, it was run on utilitarian lines, but Stepanova encouraged her students to {{take an interest in}} fashion: they were told to carry notebooks so that they could note the contemporary fabrics and aesthetics of everyday life as seen on the high street. Stepanova wrote in her 1925 course plan that this was done [...] "with the goal of devising methods for a conscious awareness of the demands imposed on us by new social conditions". Lyubov Popova was {{also a member of the}} textile faculty, and in 1922, when hired to design fabrics for the First State Textile Print Factory, Popova and Stepanova were among the first women designers in the Soviet textile industry. Popova designed textiles both with asymmetrical architectonic geometries, and also work that was thematic. Before her death in 1924, Popova produced fabrics with grids of <b>printed</b> <b>hammers</b> and sickles, which would predate work by others in the political climate of the first five-year plan.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike the {{original}} version of Sensurround, Mod-II (and later, Mod-III) were only for use with mono optical soundtracks. Due {{to the use of}} dbx Type-II noise reduction, MCA eliminated the standard Academy Filter traditionally used on optical prints, thus giving Sensurround an increased frequency response of 16 Hz to 16 kHz and a dynamic range of 86 dB, superior to 70mm <b>magnetic</b> <b>prints</b> of the time. It also allowed a mono optical track to have surround sound effects and MCA began to market the system to other studios and producers as a truly high-fidelity sound and special effects system. Dolby Stereo optical was just beginning to become known in the industry and MCA felt they had a viable competing format. While Warner Bros. and Paramount seriously considered adopting the system, in the end only Universal Studios ever released films using the process. Both Warner and Paramount later patented their own [...] "special effects" [...] systems to create Sensurround-type effects.|$|R
