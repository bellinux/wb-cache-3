He had always shown a great fondness for music, but had never received any technical training in the art. Entirely self-taught, his knowledge was acquired solely by 'picking up' information. [...] "I wish it to be distinctly understood," [...] he said, [...] "that I {{have always been a}} mere amateur in music. I wrote about the symphonies and concertos because I wished to try to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>clear</b> to myself and to discover the secret of the things that charmed me so; and from that sprang a wish to make other amateurs see it in the same way." ...|$|E

And, without {{thinking}} for an instant that what concerned him so intensely might be of no moment to her, he began forthwith upon the subject which was ever at his heart.

60|$|Lady Carbury {{was sure}} that the article was {{intended}} to write up the railway, and took great joy in it. She entertained in her brain a somewhat confused notion that if she could only bestir herself {{in the right direction}} and could induce her son to open his eyes to his own advantage, very great things might be achieved, so that wealth might become his handmaid and luxury the habit and the right of his life. He was the beloved and the accepted suitor of Marie Melmotte. He was a Director of this great company, sitting at the same board with the great commercial hero. He was the handsomest young man in London. And he was a baronet. Very wild Ideas occurred to her. Should she take Mr Alf into her entire confidence? If Melmotte and Alf could be brought together what might they not do? Alf could write up Melmotte, and Melmotte could shower shares upon Alf. And if Melmotte would come and be smiled upon by herself, be flattered as she thought that she could flatter him, be told that he was a god, and have that passage about the divinity of joining ocean to ocean construed to him as she could construe it, would not the great man become plastic under her hands? And if, while this was a-doing, Felix would run away with Marie, could not forgiveness be made easy? And her creative mind ranged still farther. Mr Broune might help, and even Mr Booker. To such a one as Melmotte, a man doing great things through the force of the confidence placed in him by the world at large, the freely-spoken support of the Press would be everything. Who would not buy shares in a railway as to which Mr Broune and Mr Alf would combine in saying that it was managed by 'divinity'? Her thoughts were rather hazy, but from day to day she worked hard to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>clear</b> to herself.|$|E

Some of the features that were added in the latest revision are stress stiffening, corotational formulation, bandwidth minimization, residual monitoring, and dynamic memory allocation. Some parts of the program were also rewritten to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>clearer</b> and improve their performance.

It quickly edits business reports, emails, correspondence, briefs, and memoranda to help <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>clear</b> and concise. WordRake is used in over 7000 law firms (its initial market), and in businesses, government agencies, and academia. In January 2013, the City of Seattle announced that it had installed WordRake for use in several municipal departments. Reviews of WordRake have been generally positive while acknowledging the software’s limitations. The program works as an extension to Microsoft Word, with another version for Outlook, and, like automated spelling and grammar checking, WordRake can be prone to false positives.|$|E

Retargetability is achieved by Opcode Maps, a textual description of the instruction mnemonics and encodings of the target architecture, for which to generate machine code. Opcode maps feature an inheritance model, which <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>clearer</b> and also means less effort in describing an instruction set because only the extensions compared to its binary compatible parent instruction set(s) need to be specified...|$|R

One of the longest produced regional programmes was daily Autofahrer unterwegs, ("drivers en route") with 15,153 episodes produced between 1957 and 1999.
