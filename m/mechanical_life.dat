50|$|Proportional hazards {{models are}} {{a class of}} {{survival}} models in statistics. Survival models relate the time that passes before some event occurs {{to one or more}} covariates that may be associated with that quantity of time. In a proportional hazards model, the unique effect of a unit increase in a covariate is multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate. For example, taking a drug may halve one's hazard rate for a stroke occurring, or, changing the material from which a manufactured component is constructed may double its hazard rate for failure. Other types of survival models such as accelerated failure time models do not exhibit proportional hazards. The accelerated failure time model describes a situation where the biological or <b>mechanical</b> <b>life</b> history of an event is accelerated.|$|E
50|$|It {{remains a}} {{difficult}} medical challenge {{to prevent the}} sudden cardiac death of athletes, typically defined as natural, unexpected death from cardiac arrest within one hour of the onset of collapse symptoms, excluding additional time on <b>mechanical</b> <b>life</b> support. (Wider definitions of sudden death are also in use, but not usually applied to the athletic situation.) Most causes relate to congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease with no symptoms noted before the fatal event. The prevalence of any single, associated condition is low, probably less than 0.3% {{of the population in}} the athletes' age group, and the sensitivity and specificity of common screening tests leave much to be desired. The single most important predictor is fainting or near-fainting during exercise, which should require detailed explanation and investigation. The victims include many well-known names, especially in professional soccer, and close relatives are often at risk for similar cardiac problems.|$|E
50|$|Air {{conditioning}} and heating equipment is {{sold to the}} residential replacement market, the commercial market and residential new construction market.

The <b>mechanical</b> <b>life</b> of central air {{conditioning and}} furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable replacement market.|$|E
