The titer of base {{required to}} reach the final potentiometric endpoint was dependent on the solvent and increased according to the following solvent order in both the presence and absence of excess neutral salt: methanol ~< water < ethanol ~< 1 -propanol < 1 -butanol < 2 -propanol < DMF < t-butanol < DMSO < pyridine ~< acetonitrile ~< <b>methylethyl</b> <b>ketone</b> < acetone. With the protic solvents, titratable acidity increased according to decreasing dielectric onstant of the solvent and increasing size and/or branching of the aliphatic onstituent.

It is not possible to explain the large abundances of aldehydes in the background troposphere without invoking significant oceanic sources. A strong correlation between the observed mixing ratios of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde is present. We infer that higher aldehydes (such as acetaldehyde and propanaldehyde) may provide a large source of formaldehyde and sequester Cox throughout the troposphere. The atmospheric behavior of acetone, <b>methylethyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> and methanol is generally indicative of their common terrestrial sources with a Image contribution from biomass/biofuel burning.

The sample volume was 5 mL, {{and the internal}} standard was diethyl ketone. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a PoraPLOT Q capillary column, and the effluent was first directed to the FTIR {{and then to a}} flame ionization detector (FID). FTIR identification limits were measured for 27 volatile organic compounds; the criteria for the limit were that the first hit-list position should be obtained against the Sadtler library, which contains 3240 spectra, and that the correlation value should exceed 0. 5. It was required that the peak be seen by FID but not necessarily by a Gram-Schmidt chromatogram. The FTIR identification limits, ranging from 0. 01 mg/L for ethyl acetate, <b>methylethyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> and sevoflurane to 24 mg/L for methanol, generally allowed the detection of volatile-substance exposure at a lower level than is acutely toxic.

Prior to this, the MCM v 3 butane degradation chemistry was also evaluated using chamber {{data on the}} photo-oxidation of butane, and its degradation products, <b>methylethyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (MEK), acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO) and formaldehyde (HCHO), in conjunction with an initial evaluation of the chamber-dependent auxiliary mechanisms for the series of relevant chambers.

40|$|Airborne {{measurements}} {{of a large}} number of oxygenated volatile organic chemicals (OVOC) were carried out in the Pacific troposphere (0. 1 - 12 km) in winter/spring of 2001 (24 February to 10 April). Specifically, these measurements included acetone (CH 3 COCH 3), <b>methylethyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (CH 3 COC 2 H 5, MEK), methanol (CH 3 OH), ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH), acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO), propionaldehyde (C 2 H 5 CHO), peroxyacylnitrates (PANs) (C(sub n) H(sub 2 n+ 1) COO 2 NO 2), and organic nitrates (C(sub n) H(sub 2 n+ 1) ONO 2). Complementary {{measurements of}} formaldehyde (HCHO), methyl hydroperoxide (CH 3 OOH), and selected tracers were also available. OVOC were abundant in the clean troposphere and were greatly enhanced in the outflow regions from Asia. Background mixing ratios were typically highest in the lower troposphere and declined toward the upper troposphere and the lowermost stratosphere. Their total abundance (Summation of OVOC) was nearly twice that of nonmethane hydrocarbons (Summation of C 2 -C 8 NMHC). Throughout the troposphere, the OH reactivity of OVOC is comparable to that of methane and far exceeds that of NMHC. A comparison of these data with western Pacific observations collected some 7 years earlier (February-March 1994) did not reveal significant differences. Mixing ratios of OVOC were strongly correlated with each other as well as with tracers of fossil and biomass/biofuel combustion. Analysis of the relative enhancement of selected OVOC with respect to CH 3 Cl and CO in 12 plumes originating from fires and sampled in the free troposphere (3 - 11 km) is used to assess their primary and secondary emissions from biomass combustion. The composition of these plumes also indicates a large shift of reactive nitrogen into the PAN reservoir thereby limiting ozone formation. A three-dimensional global model that uses state of the art chemistry and source information is used to compare measured and simulated mixing ratios of selected OVOC. While there is reasonable agreement in many cases, measured aldehyde concentrations are significantly larger than predicted. At their observed levels, acetaldehyde mixing ratios are shown to be an important source of HCHO (and HO x) and PAN in the troposphere. On the basis of presently known chemistry, measured mixing ratios of aldehydes and PANs are mutually incompatible. We provide rough estimates of the global sources of several OVOC and conclude that collectively these are extremely large (150 - 500 Tg C / yr) but remain poorly quantified...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The present {{dissertation}} consisted essentially in {{the evaluation}} of several schemes included in Master Chemical Mechanism and in its capability of predicting the transformation processes of pollutants in the atmospheric environment. This was achieved by comparison of model simulations with environmental chamber data, and also by incorporation of the chemical mechanism into a tropospheric model, allowing the comparison of model predictions with atmospheric observational data. Butane, ethene, propene, 1 -butene, 1 -hexene, isoprene, α−pinene, β−pinene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, methacrolein, acetone, <b>methylethyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> and methylvinyl ketone degradation mechanisms included in version 3. 1 of Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v 3. 1) were evaluated using environmental chamber datasets from the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center at the University of California. Photo-oxidation of butane, and its degradation products <b>methylethyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, was made in conjunction with an initial evaluation of the chamber-dependent auxiliary mechanisms. The MCM v 3. 1 mechanism for butane was found to provide an acceptable reaction framework for describing the NOX-photo-oxidation experiments on the above systems, although a number of parameter modifications and refinements were identified which resulted in an improved performance. These generally relate to the magnitude of sources of free radicals from carbonyl photolysis processes. The simulations for ethene and propene systems were found {{to be sensitive to the}} branching ratios assigned to molecular and free radical forming pathways of the O(3 P) reactions. With this constraint, the MCM v 3. 1 mechanisms for ethene and propene generally performed well. Evaluation of the MCM v 3. 1 1 -butene and 1 -hexene degradation mechanisms was found to be inconclusive. Photo-oxidation of Isoprene was made simultaneously with its degradation products, methacrolein and methylvinyl ketone. The MCM v 3. 1 mechanism for isoprene was found to provide an acceptable reaction framework for describing the NOX-photo-oxidation experiments, although a number of parameter modifications and refinements were identified which resulted on improved performance. These all relate to the magnitude of sources of free radicals from organic chemical process, such as carbonyl photolysis rates and the yields of radicals from the reactions of O 3 with unsaturated oxygenates, and specific recommendations are made for refinements. In addition to this, it was necessary to include a representation of the reactions of O(3 P) with isoprene, methacrolein and methylvinyl ketone. α-Pinene and β-pinene degradation mechanism included in MCM v 3. 1 has been evaluated and refined. α-pinene mechanism was found to overestimate D(O 3 -NO) specially for low VOC/NOx ratios. In addition, the simulated decay of α-pinene was in advance and formation of the product HCHO is underpredicted relative to the observations. A number of parameter modifications and refinements were identified which resulted in an improved performance. These all relate to the magnitude of sources of free radicals from organic chemical process. The reaction of O(3 P) with α-pinene was incorporated, although the effect of its inclusion was found to be small. The main refinements proposed to α-pinene degradation mechanism are the increasing of nitrate yields from the initially formed RO 2 and decreasing the OH yield from the reaction of O 3. β-pinene mechanism was evaluated against the chamber data. However, an improvement of it was not obtained for all the evaluated runs. As a result of chamber evaluation of MCM, it is possible to make a number of suggestions and recommendations for future work, in relation to gaps and uncertainties in the kinetic and mechanistic database, and the availability of chamber data: confidence in chamber evaluations requires the uncertainty to be reduced on the kinetics of the reaction of OH with NO 2; Chamber evaluation of VOC systems requires confirmatory information on their reactions with O(3 P); further information is required to quantify fully free radical formation from reactions of ozone with alkenes under atmospheric conditions. The MCM v 3. 1 was incorporated into a Photochemical, one layer, Trajectory box Model (PTM) using a Lagrangian approach. The PTM was used to evaluate and intercompare the original and adapted versions of MCM v 3. 1, (resulting from refinements provided by chamber evaluation), at normal environmental conditions, in the polluted boundary layer atmosphere. The PTM was applied to a real situation in the Portuguese west coast, during an ozone summer episode, by following the air mass transported by sea breeze, from the coast line (Aveiro) to a location, approximately 65 kilometres inland (Covelo). The PTM was applied during the period of June 29 and 30 (2001), using meteorological and air quality data, obtained from a field campaign. The ozone concentrations obtained by application of PTM, using as chemical mechanism MCM v 3. 1 are a good approximation to the measured values in Sangalhos and Covelo. The refinements in MCM v 3. 1 resulting from chamber evaluation show only a very small change when applied to these field conditions. Sensitivity tests show that temperature has a large effect in calculated ozone concentrations. The field evaluation of MCM v 3. 1 inserted in the photochemical trajectory model indicate that there are too many model uncertainties to allow a quantitative analysis for the several species represented on explicit mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The Exposure Assessment Pro- gram {{provides}} {{national and}} inter- national {{leadership in the}} development and use of effective exposure assessment tools to pre- vent work-related illness and in- jury. This snapshot shows recent accomplishments and upcoming work. What are our priorities? The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Exposure Assessment Program works with partners in industry, labor, trade associations, professional organizations, and academia. The program focuses on promoting the use of 21 st century exposure assessment sensors, methods, and processes. What do we do? 1. Develop guidance for how to conduct exposure assessments in all types of occupational settings. Exposure assessments help identify who is exposed, how they are exposed (air, water, skin contact), how much exposure occurs, how often, and the duration of exposure. 2. Develop new or improved sensors for assessing exposure to make it easier and quicker to identify and measure exposures. 3. Develop new or improved assessment methods to ensure that exposure measure-ments are accurate and able to detect lower levels of agents in the workplace. What have we accomplished? 1. Published NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods (NMAM) Method 0501, "Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated," which accurately measures nuisance dusts. 2. Published NMAM Method 5100, "Carbon Black," which more accurately measures the fine carbon powder that {{can be found in the}} air when petroleum products are not completely burned. 3. Published NMAM Method 8319, "Acetone and <b>Methylethyl</b> <b>Ketone</b> in Urine. " These two chemicals are used in a wide variety of industrial processes. 4. Published NMAM Method 8322, "Trichloroacetic Acid in Urine," which detects a metabolite of trichloroethylene that occurs from inhaling this industrial solvent or swallowing trichloroethylene-contaminated water. 5. Published a method on a new sensor for hazardous drug exposure. It enables rapid assessment of unknown spills of hazardous drugs in the pharmacy or treatment areas of healthcare facilities. Current methods to measure for spills can take weeks to analyze, but this new sensor checks for hazardous drugs in just a few minutes, so workers can be protected sooner. 6. Published guidance on using biomarkers of effect to set occupational exposure limits. This is one of a series of NIOSH documents to understand factors that can or cannot be reliably used to assess risk and set standards. 7. Published NMAM method 7306, "ELEMENTS by Cellulosic Internal Capsule Sampler and ICP-AES. " It uses an analyzable filter insert to improve reporting accuracy for 33 elements by collecting material that may have adhered to the sampler wall and making that material available for analysis. What's next? 1. Refine the NMAM method for total isocyanates, at OSHA's request. Isocyanates are potent irritants and sensitizers which are increasingly used in the automobile industry, for auto body repair, and in insulation for buildings. Current methods underreport isocyanate levels, and a refined method will more accurately assess exposure levels. 2.

40|$|Mercury {{is highly}} toxic but often {{neglected}} element that is readily emitted {{into the environment}} via a number of industrial processes. In Australia, coal-fired power plants and the alumina industry are the two largest emitters of mercury. In {{order to maintain the}} alumina industry’s commitment to reduce the environmental impact of its processes and remain economically sustainable, innovative technologies are required that can monitor mercury concentrations within its processes. The aim of this research project was to develop robust quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based sensors for measuring Hg vapour levels in challenging industrial environments, such as those found in the alumina industry (i. e. Hg concentrations of 1 - 40 mg/m 3 at 20 - 90 °C). In order to gain a deeper understanding of Hg vapour interactions with the surface of the QCM electrodes, parameters such as Hg sorption and desorption rates, sticking probability and Hg diffusion were studied in detail. When Hg diffusion in ultra-thin films of Au was studied, it was observed that Hg accumulation occurred at the interface between the Au sensitive and SiO 2 layers. These observations lead to the exploration of two different electrochemical methods for the direct formation of Hg selective and sensitive nanostructured Au films directly on QCM crystals. In the first case, galvanic replacement (GR) reactions were employed to form Ni-Au hybrid nanoclusters. This method resulted in Hg sensors with 93 - 100 % recovery, excellent selectivity towards Hg in the presence of ammonia and humidity and ~ 27 % higher sensitivity than the Au control QCM. The second case involved forming highly oriented and ornate Au nanostructures (nanospikes) with controlled crystallographic facets onto the QCM electrode by a single step electrodeposition method. These sensors were tested towards Hg vapour in the presence of ammonia and humidity at ~ 90 °C for a 50 day period in a specially designed and developed 8 -channel computer controlled gas calibration system. The testing sequences were made to simulate some of the conditions found in Hg-emitting industries. The nanospike QCM showed high selectivity, recovery and around 4. 7 times higher sensitivity than the Au control QCM, with low degradation in response magnitude over the long testing period. The high sensitivity of the nanospikes was found to be not only due to high surface area but also due to the increased number of surface defect sites created during the electrodeposition step. Due to its excellent performance, a nanospike QCM was then tested towards Hg in the presence of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that either had high affinity towards Au or was present in alumina effluent streams. The nanospikes based QCM was tested against VOCs such as acetone, dimethyl disulphide, <b>methylethyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> ethyl mercaptan, acetaldehyde as well as ammonia and humidity. The nanospike QCM was observed to maintain high selectivity and sensitivity towards Hg vapour when compared to Au control vi QCM. The success of the data presented in this thesis has resulted in a PCT patent of the developed nanospikes and is due to undergo preliminary testing at industry partners’ sites. If successful, the developed sensor will assist industries in complying with mercury emission targets and would be a significant technological breakthrough with potential for many other applications in pollution control...|$|E
