50|$|South Walker Creek Mine {{is located}} on the eastern flank of the Bowen Basin, 35 km west of the town of Nebo and 132 km south west of the Hay Point port facilities. South Walker Creek is a {{contract}} mining operation owned by BHP Mitsui Coal. Annual production capacity is 3.2 million tonnes of <b>marketable</b> <b>coal,</b> which is suitable for Pulverised Coal Injection (PCI).|$|E
50|$|Golden Cycle {{controlled}} the Pikes Peak Consolidated Fuel Company, which had 15,000,000 tons of <b>marketable</b> <b>coal,</b> a 50% interest in East Colorado Springs Land Company, held {{more than a}} third interest in United Gold Mines in Cripple Creek and owned 400 acres in Cripple Creek. It operated a custom mill, treating up to 40,000 tons of Cripple Creek ore each month. The mill includes rolls, roasting furnaces and cyanide equipment.|$|E
50|$|Beginning about 1830, timber {{harvested}} {{from the region}} was floated on the Coal River to Saint Albans. At the same time, great quantities of <b>marketable</b> cannel <b>coal</b> {{were found on the}} upper Coal River. However, only at periods of high water could logs and shallow wooden boats loaded with coal be drifted over the Upper Falls and Lower Falls and on down the river.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Gatling, Ohio LLC {{invested}} $75 {{million to}} open a new coal mine and coal prep plant near Racine. It is capable of employing 120 to 150 miners, and is capable of producing 3.5 million <b>marketable</b> tons of <b>coal</b> per year.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to develop, design, and build a system prototype to demonstrate the practicality of two-way, wireless through-the-earth communications between {{the interior of a}} mine and the surface. The system was to communicate data for process and environment monitoring and control, and provide real-time voice communication for emergency situations and for daily operations use. Transmitters and receivers were designed, built, and tested in actual mines. A wireless in-mine communications system was also developed. The feasibility of the concept and the marketability of the product were successfully demonstrated. Additional work must be done to make the product suitable for, and <b>marketable</b> to, the <b>coal</b> mining industry...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the work}} is a {{verification}} of selective flotation on the black coal slurries sampled from slurry ponds of Mine Lazy, OKD company. Reflotation was realized with 6 collectors: Flotakol NX, Flotalex Ekofol 440, Montanol, MP 125 and AF 2. The technology of main flotation was applied. The variance analysis was used for the selectivity evaluation of particular collectors, whereby both the yield and flotation concentrate quality were tested. The {{goal of the}} flotation experiments was to achieve the flotation concentrate quality under 10 % of ash. From the results follows that by using basic flotation it is possible (with the slurry samples) to reach the <b>marketable</b> <b>coal</b> concentrates with the ash content under 10 % by Flotalex collector application...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. (Geography) Coal mined in South Africa for the {{competitive}} international market, {{has to be}} selected to meet the many quality specifications of customers. This upgrading is done by washing the coal in a heavy medium separation plant. <b>Marketable</b> <b>coal,</b> discard and slurry are produced from this washing. Discard consists mainly of poor quality coal, carbonaceous shale and waste rock. Iron pyrite (FeS 2) occurs {{in all of the}} above in higher concentrations than in the <b>marketable</b> <b>coal.</b> Both the carbonaceous materials and pyrites generate heat when oxidizing. If this oxidation is not arrested at an early stage on a discard dump and the temperature of the dump increases above BOoC, spontaneous combustion is quite likely. The South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has estimated that smouldering discard dumps in the Eastern Transvaal highveld region contribute approximately 400 000 tons of S 02 per annum to the atmospheric pollution in that area. As a result, significant localized acid rain occurs, Louw (1990). The oxidation of iron pyrites to sulphuric acid, and the oxidation of other trace elements, is accelerated under the high temperature conditions generated by spontaneous combustion. Leaching of these oxidation products results in local groundwater and surface water contamination. This study describes different disposal technique and pilot study aimed at minimising the oxidation within the dumps. Slurry, which consists of discard and/or coal of less than 1 mm in diameter is co-deposited with discard in sequential layers of approximately 200 mm thick. This has resulted in reducing the permeability, porosity and air and water exchange within the dump. This in turn has led to a reduction in spontaneous combustion, pollution and costs. A visual increase in stability of the discard dumps, moisture content and operational ease of placement were experienced. The saleable value of the dump as a low value heat source is also preserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of clean, affordable energy {{is essential for}} the prosperity and security of the United States and the world in the 21 st century. Carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) emissions to the atmosphere are an inherent part of energy-related activities, such as electricity generation, transportation, and building systems. These energy-related activities are responsible for roughly 85 % of the U. S. greenhouse gas emissions, and 95 % of these emissions are dominated by CO{sub 2 }. Over the last few decades, an increased concentration of CO{sub 2 } in the earth's atmosphere has been observed. Many scientists believe greenhouse gases, particularly CO{sub 2 }, trap heat in the earth's atmosphere. Carbon sequestration technology offers an approach to redirect CO{sub 2 } emissions into sinks (e. g., geologic formations, oceans, soils, and vegetation) and potentially stabilize future atmospheric CO{sub 2 } levels. Coal seams are attractive CO{sub 2 } sequestration sinks, due to their abundance and proximity to electricity-generation facilities. The recovery of <b>marketable</b> <b>coal</b> bed methane (CBM) provides a value-added stream, reducing the cost to sequester CO{sub 2 } gas. Much research is needed to evaluate this technology in terms of CO{sub 2 } storage capacity, sequestration stability, commercial feasibility and overall economics. CONSOL Energy, with support from the U. S. DOE, is conducting a seven-year program to construct and operate a coal bed sequestration site composed of a series of horizontally drilled wells that originate at the surface and extend through overlying coal seams in the subsurface. Once completed, the wells will be used to initially drain CBM from both the upper (mineable) and lower (unmineable) coal seams. After sufficient depletion of the reservoir, centrally located wells in the lower coal seam will be converted from CBM drainage wells to CO{sub 2 } injection ports. CO{sub 2 } will be measured and injected into the lower unmineable coal seam while CBM continues to drain from both seams. In addition to metering all injected CO{sub 2 } and CBM produced, the program includes a plan to monitor horizontal migration of CO{sub 2 } within the lower seam. This is the second Technical Progress report for the project. Progress to date has been focused on pre-construction activities; in particular, attaining site approvals and securing property rights for the project. This report provides a concise overview of project activity this period and plans for future work. This is the second semi-annual Technical Progress report under the subject agreement. During this report period, progress was made in completing the environmental assessment report, securing land and coal rights, and evaluating drilling strategies. These aspects of the project are discussed in detail in this report...|$|E
