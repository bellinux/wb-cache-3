5|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere {{is called the}} <b>magnetopause.</b> The distance from the <b>magnetopause</b> {{to the center of}} the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ (where RJ=71,492km is the radius of Jupiter) at the subsolar point—the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer. The position of the <b>magnetopause</b> depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. In front of the <b>magnetopause</b> (at a distance from 80 to 130RJ from the planet's center) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and <b>magnetopause</b> is called the magnetosheath.|$|E
5|$|Sunward of the <b>magnetopause</b> is the bow shock, {{the area}} where the solar wind slows abruptly.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} described above is {{sustained by the}} neutral sheet current (also known as the magnetotail current), which flows with Jupiter's rotation through the tail plasma sheet, the tail currents, which flow against Jupiter's rotation at the outer boundary of the magnetotail, and the <b>magnetopause</b> currents (or Chapman–Ferraro currents), which flow against rotation along the dayside <b>magnetopause.</b> These currents create the magnetic field that cancels the internal field outside the magnetosphere. They also interact substantially with the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, he pioneered X-ray {{astronomy}} and space plasma physics. His instrumentation on Explorer 10 detected the <b>magnetopause,</b> and he initiated the rocket experiments that discovered Scorpius X-1, the first extra-solar source of X-rays.|$|E
5|$|At the {{subsolar point}} the bow shock stands 1900km (0.3 Rv, where Rv is the radius of Venus) {{above the surface}} of Venus. This {{distance}} was measured in 2007 near the solar activity minimum. Near the solar activity maximum it can be several times further from the planet. The <b>magnetopause</b> {{is located at the}} altitude of 300km. The upper boundary of the ionosphere (ionopause) is near 250km. Between the <b>magnetopause</b> and ionopause there exists a magnetic barrier—a local enhancement of the magnetic field, which prevents solar plasma from penetrating deeper into the Venusian atmosphere, at least near solar activity minimum. The magnetic field in the barrier reaches up to 40nT. The magnetotail continues up to ten radiuses from the planet. It is the most active part of the Venusian magnetosphere. There are reconnection events and particle acceleration in the tail. The energies of electrons and ions in the magnetotail are around 100eV and 1000eV respectively.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is {{a complex}} structure comprising a bow shock, magnetosheath, <b>magnetopause,</b> magnetotail, magnetodisk, and other components. The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates {{from a number of}} different sources, including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the internal field), electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the solar wind, which carries the interplanetary magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's bow shock, {{where the}} {{magnetosphere}} begins {{to slow the}} solar wind, occurs {{at a distance of}} 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The <b>magnetopause,</b> where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.|$|E
5|$|The {{solar wind}} exerts a pressure, {{and if it}} could reach Earth's {{atmosphere}} it would erode it. However, it is kept away by {{the pressure of the}} Earth's magnetic field. The <b>magnetopause,</b> the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10Earth radii out but the other side stretching out in a magnetotail that extends beyond 200Earth radii.|$|E
5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a <b>magnetopause,</b> located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|SvalRak is the world's northern-most {{rocket launch}} site, and {{is located at}} the 79th {{parallel}} north. This makes it an ideal location for sending instruments into Earth's magnetic field and the polar cups, cleft and cup. It is also used for studying the <b>Magnetopause</b> and aurora borealis, for which Ny-Ålesund is the most convenient location because of its ease of access. It is owned by Andøya Rocket Range, which is owned by the Norwegian Space Center (90 percent) and the Kongsberg Group (10 percent). SvalRak has no permanent staff in Ny-Ålesund. The main users are American and Japanese and to a less extent Norwegian.|$|E
5|$|Venus {{is known}} {{not to have}} a {{magnetic}} field. The reason for its absence is not clear, but is probably related to the planet's slow rotation or the lack of convection in the mantle. Venus only has an induced magnetosphere formed by the Sun's magnetic field carried by the solar wind. This process can be understood as the field lines wrapping around an obstacle—Venus in this case. The induced magnetosphere of Venus has a bow shock, magnetosheath, <b>magnetopause</b> and magnetotail with the current sheet.|$|E
25|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the solar wind's plasma from that within Saturn's magnetosphere {{is called the}} <b>magnetopause.</b> The <b>magnetopause</b> distance from the planet's center at the subsolar point varies widely from 16 to 27Rs (Rs=60,330km is the equatorial radius of Saturn). The magnetopause's position depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. The average <b>magnetopause</b> standoff distance is about 22Rs. In front of the <b>magnetopause</b> (at the distance of about 27Rs from the planet) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and <b>magnetopause</b> is called the magnetosheath.|$|E
25|$|In {{the outer}} parts of Saturn's {{magnetosphere}} beyond approximately 15–20Rs {{the magnetic field}} near the equatorial plane is highly stretched and forms a disk-like structure called magnetodisk. The disk continues up to the <b>magnetopause</b> on the dayside and transitions into the magnetotail on the nightside. Near the dayside it can be absent when the magnetosphere is compressed by the Solar wind, which usually happens when the <b>magnetopause</b> distance is smaller than 23Rs. On the nightside and flanks of the magnetosphere the magnetodisk is always present. The Saturn's magnetodisk is a much smaller analog of the Jovian magnetodisk.|$|E
25|$|In {{the outer}} {{parts of the}} {{magnetosphere}} the dominant ions are protons, which originate either from the Solar wind of Saturn's ionosphere. Titan, which orbits close to the <b>magnetopause</b> boundary at 20Rs, is not {{a significant source of}} plasma.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of Saturn is {{the cavity}} {{created in the}} flow of the solar wind by the planet's internally generated magnetic field. Discovered in 1979 by the Pioneer 11 spacecraft, Saturn's magnetosphere is the second largest of any planet in the Solar System after Jupiter. The <b>magnetopause,</b> the boundary between Saturn's magnetosphere and the solar wind, is located at a distance of about 20 Saturn radii from the planet's center, while its magnetotail stretches hundreds of Saturn radii behind it.|$|E
25|$|The high {{latitude}} magnetosphere {{is filled}} with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines. The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth {{and back into the}} solar wind through the <b>magnetopause</b> on the day-side. In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.|$|E

500|$|Geospace is {{the region}} of outer space near Earth. Geospace {{includes}} the upper region of the atmosphere and the magnetosphere. The Van Allen radiation belt lies within the geospace. The outer boundary of geospace is the <b>magnetopause,</b> which forms an interface between the planet's magnetosphere and the solar wind. The inner boundary is the ionosphere. As the physical properties and behavior of near Earth space {{is affected by the}} behavior of the Sun and space weather, the field of [...] is interlinked with heliophysics; the study of the Sun {{and its impact on the}} Solar System planets.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, during 52 {{hours of}} data {{recorded}} by the MIT probe before battery power ran out, Rossi's group found a transition between two distinct regions around earth. [...] Near earth. there were fairly strong and well organised magnetic fields, but no indication of interplanetary protons. [...] At 22 earth radii, the spacecraft entered a region where magnetic fields were weaker and more irregular, and where a substantial flux of protons was observed coming from {{the general direction of}} the Sun. [...] On several occasions during the rest of the flight, this flux disappeared and then reappeared again, which indicated that the spacecraft was flying close to the boundary between the two regions and that this boundary was moving irregularly. Eventually, this boundary became known as the <b>magnetopause.</b>|$|E
500|$|While Earth's {{magnetic}} field is roughly teardrop-shaped, Jupiter's is flatter, more closely resembling a disk, and [...] "wobbles" [...] periodically about its axis. The {{main reasons for}} this disk-like configuration are the centrifugal force from the co-rotating plasma and thermal pressure of hot plasma, both of which act to stretch Jupiter's {{magnetic field}} lines, forming a flattened pancake-like structure, known as the magnetodisk, at the distances greater than 20RJ from the planet. The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the middle plane, approximately near the magnetic equator. The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above the sheet and towards Jupiter below it. The load of plasma from Io greatly expands {{the size of the}} Jovian magnetosphere, because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind. In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the <b>magnetopause</b> at the subsolar point would be no more than 42RJ, whereas it is actually 75RJ on average.|$|E

2500|$|Saturn's {{magnetosphere}} {{is often}} {{divided into four}} regions. The innermost region co-located with Saturn's planetary rings, inside approximately 3Rs, has a strictly dipolar magnetic field. It is largely devoid of plasma, which is absorbed by ring particles, although the radiation belts of Saturn are located in this innermost region just {{inside and outside the}} rings. The second region between 3 and 6Rs contains the cold plasma torus and is called the inner magnetosphere. It contains the densest plasma in the saturnian system. The plasma in the torus originates from the inner icy moons and particularly from Enceladus. The magnetic field in this region is also mostly dipolar. [...] The third region lies between 6 and 12–14Rs and is called the dynamic and extended plasma sheet. The magnetic field in this region is stretched and non-dipolar, whereas the plasma is confined to a thin equatorial plasma sheet. The fourth outermost region is located beyond 15Rs at high latitudes and continues up to <b>magnetopause</b> boundary. It is characterized by a low plasma density and a variable, non-dipolar magnetic field strongly influenced by the Solar wind.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distance}} from Earth to the subsolar <b>magnetopause</b> varies over time due to solar activity, but typical distances range from 6 - 15 R. Empirical models using real-time solar wind data {{can provide a}} real-time estimate of the <b>magnetopause</b> location.

50|$|The <b>magnetopause</b> is {{the abrupt}} {{boundary}} between a magnetosphere {{and the surrounding}} plasma. For planetary science, the <b>magnetopause</b> is {{the boundary between the}} planet’s magnetic field and the solar wind. The location of the <b>magnetopause</b> is determined by the balance between the pressure of the dynamic planetary magnetic field and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. As the solar wind pressure increases and decreases, the <b>magnetopause</b> moves inward and outward in response. Waves (ripples and flapping motion) along the <b>magnetopause</b> move {{in the direction of the}} solar wind flow in response to small scale variations in the solar wind pressure and to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.|$|E
50|$|Research on the <b>magnetopause</b> is {{conducted}} using the LMN coordinate system (which is set of axes like XYZ). N points normal to the <b>magnetopause</b> outward to the magnetosheath, L lies along {{the projection of}} the dipole axis onto the <b>magnetopause</b> (positive northward), and M completes the triad by pointing dawnward.|$|E

50|$|If one {{assumed that}} <b>magnetopause</b> {{was just a}} {{boundary}} between a magnetic field in a vacuum and a plasma with a weak magnetic field embedded in it, then the <b>magnetopause</b> would be defined by electrons and ions penetrating one gyroradius into the magnetic field domain. Since the gyro-motion of electrons and ions is in opposite directions, an electric current flows along the boundary. The actual <b>magnetopause</b> is much more complex.|$|E

50|$|The <b>magnetopause</b> is {{the area}} of the {{magnetosphere}} wherein the pressure from the planetary magnetic field is balanced with the pressure from the solar wind. It is the convergence of the shocked solar wind from the magnetosheath with the magnetic field of the object and plasma from the magnetosphere. Because both sides of this convergence contain magnetized plasma, the interactions between them are complex. The structure of the <b>magnetopause</b> depends upon the Mach number and beta of the plasma, as well as the magnetic field. The <b>magnetopause</b> changes size and shape as the pressure from the solar wind fluctuates.|$|E
5000|$|Behind the {{bow shock}} is the thin plasma layer {{separating}} the Earth and solar wind magnetic fields {{known as the}} <b>magnetopause.</b> This boundary moves continuously due to the constant variation in solar wind pressure. Since the plasma and magnetic pressures within the solar wind and the magnetosphere, respectively, should be in equilibrium, the magnetosphere should be an impenetrable boundary.
