The UERL acquired London bus and tram companies in 1912 {{and the following}} year the City & South London and Central London Railway joined the company. That year the Great Northern & City {{was taken over by}} the Met. Suggestions of merger with the Underground Group were rejected by the Metropolitan, a press release of November 1912 noting its interests in areas outside London, its relationships with main line railways and its freight business. Further coordination {{in the form of a}} General Managers' Conference faltered after the Metropolitan withdrew in 1911 when the Central London Railway, without any reference to the conference, set its season ticket prices significantly lower than those on the Met's competitive routes. The UERL introduced station name boards with a red disc and a blue bar and the Met responded with station boards showing a blue bar on a red diamond.|$|E

500|$|One {{long-term}} {{survivor of}} the craze over Ruth may be the Baby Ruth candy bar. The original company to market the confectionery, the Curtis Candy Company, maintained that the bar was named after Ruth Cleveland, daughter of former president Grover Cleveland. [...] She died in 1904 and the bar was first marketed in 1921, {{at the height of}} the craze over the slugger. The slugger later sought to market candy bearing his name; he was refused a trademark because of the Baby Ruth bar. Corporate files from 1921 are no longer extant; the brand has changed hands several times and is now owned by the Nestlé company. The Ruth estate licensed his likeness for use in an advertising campaign for Baby Ruth in 1995.

These findings suggest that, {{in addition to the}} direct stimulus that interlinked cash crop <b>marketing</b> <b>arrangements</b> can have on small farmer incomes, these institutional arrangements may provide spillover benefits for the productivity of farmers' other activities such as food cropping.

40|$|The meat {{value chain}} {{is a complex}} {{organization}} with multiple participants performing numerous value added functions. Perhaps the most complex and least well understood segment is that downstream from the packer, e. g., the processor, wholesaler, exporter, retailer and food service (or restaurant) operator. One portion of the Livestock and Meat Marketing Study provided an overview of marketing and pricing methods used in this sector and, in particular, the results of analyses {{of the relationship between}} use of alternative <b>marketing</b> <b>arrangements</b> (AMAs) and the distribution and sales of meat products downstream from the packer. The analyses include both beef and pork products, are descriptive and focus on the relationships among industry articipants beyond the packing plant. The information used includes the results of the industry interviews, data from the industry surveys, and transactions data from meat processors. Primary conclusions related to meat processing, distribution, and sales, are as follows: • Firms differ greatly in the sales, purchase, and pricing methods for meat. Firms rely heavily on the spot market but also use other methods. They also mix-and-match purchase and pricing methods, e. g., buying on the forward market, but pricing on a formula. • Meat processors play an important distribution role in the meat value chain by purchasing large lots from a few sources and selling small lots to many firms. • Packers sort cattle purchased under various <b>marketing</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{to meet the needs of}} its buyers, but aggregate transactions data suggest that downstream <b>marketing</b> <b>arrangements</b> have little or no relationship to cattle purchase methods or branded beef sales programs.
