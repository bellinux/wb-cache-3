5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in <b>many</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>in</b> part because Poe's sincerity {{in the work}} is questionable. It has been {{considered}} prophetically scientific, intuitively romantic, and even calculatingly ironic. Lacking scientific proof, Poe {{said it was not}} his goal to prove what he says to be true, but to convince through suggestion.|$|E

5|$|There are <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which {{epilepsy}} occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections {{within the}} neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.|$|E

5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which the sail could have functioned in life. Some {{of the first}} to think about its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while Dimetrodon waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the animal was in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E
5|$|Although modern {{scholars}} know of some surviving {{cases where}} Han law dealt with commerce and domestic affairs, the spheres of trade (outside the monopolies) {{and the family}} were still largely governed by age-old social customs. <b>Many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which family relations were conducted during the Han were already stipulated in the ancient Confucian canon, especially in the Book of Rites. This became accepted as the mainstream guide to ethics and custom. In terms of private commercial contracts, they usually entailed information on the goods transferred, the amount paid, {{the names of the}} buyer and seller, the date of transfer and the signatures of witnesses.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which viruses {{spread from}} host to host but each species of virus uses {{only one or}} two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It {{is important to know}} how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E

5|$|White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a {{versatile}} precursor {{to many other}} silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver {{was associated with the}} moon. It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.|$|E

Using maggot therapy with livestock could be beneficial in <b>many</b> <b>ways.</b> <b>In</b> dairy cattle, it would eliminate the need to destroy milk contaminated with antibiotics. The use of antibiotics on horses can affect its gastrointestinal flora which may result in colitis. Maggot therapy would eliminate this additional stress when treating equine wounds.

25|$|On the {{molecular}} level, all auxins are compounds with an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group. The most important {{member of the}} auxin family is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which generates the majority of auxin effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native auxin. And as native auxin, its stability is controlled in <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> plants, from synthesis, through possible conjugation to degradation of its molecules, always {{according to the requirements}} of the situation. However, molecules of IAA are chemically labile in aqueous solution, so it is not used commercially as a plant growth regulator.|$|E
25|$|During the {{majority}} of the year caribou roam the tundra in small herds, but twice a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must be very careful when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from the caribou crossing and wait until they are in full view to attack. There are <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which the caribou can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using blinders, scaring the caribou, and stalking the caribou. When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use to gently spear the animal.|$|E
