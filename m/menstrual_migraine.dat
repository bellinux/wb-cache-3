50|$|One {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} these <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraines</b> is that the woman does not experience an aura. Clinical research has shown migraine with aura to be unrelated to the menstrual cycle, and, in women who have headaches sometimes with aura and sometimes without, {{the presence or absence}} of aura does not appear to be related to the menstrual cycle.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as being}} split into two classes, <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraines</b> may have two {{different}} pathophysiologies, based {{on whether or not}} a woman is taking any oral contraceptives or another form of cyclical hormone replacement therapy. When these medications are being used, the regular hormonal changes that take place and result in ovulation and other events in the menstrual cycle are suppressed, and menstruation is instead the result of withdrawal from abnormal progestogen concentrations.|$|R

50|$|Prof MacGregor {{received}} her MB BS from St Bartholomew's Hospital in London in 1986. Although she has undertaken research {{in all aspects}} of primary headaches, her postgraduate interest has focussed on the effects of female sex hormones on headache.

Her MD Thesis discussed the role of oestrogen in <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine.</b> Through her work, she delineated clinical definitions for <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine,</b> accepted by the International Headache Society.

50|$|Frovatriptan (trade name Frova) is a triptan drug {{developed}} by Vernalis {{for the treatment}} of migraine headaches and for short term prevention of <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine.</b> The product is licensed to Endo Pharmaceuticals in North America and Menarini in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The ICHD-2 {{specifies}} {{two different}} forms of the previously-dubbed [...] "menstrual migraine": pure <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> without aura and menstrually-related migraine without aura. The sole difference between these diagnoses is the occurrence of headache attacks outside of the 5-day period described in the diagnostic criteria. If a woman experiences no attacks outside of this 5-day period, she may be diagnosed with pure <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> with aura; if she does experience other attacks, however, she may suffer from menstrually-related migraine without aura. This distinction is made solely for treatment purposes; a woman who only experiences migraines in that 5-day period is likely to benefit more from hormone therapy than a traditional migraine medication such as a triptan.|$|E
50|$|Contraception {{has many}} {{benefits}} beyond preventing pregnancy. Combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives can successfully treat dysmenorrhea (painful periods), provide symptom relief from endometriosis, reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and improve anemia related to menstrual blood loss, reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, reduce ovarian and colon cancer risk, reduce moderate acne, prevent of <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraines,</b> and reduce hirsutism (abnormal hair growth). The progestin containing intrauterine device can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and protect against pre-cancerous changes or {{cancer in the}} uterus. Condoms (male or female) are the contraceptive method which protects against acquisition of sexually transmitted infections.|$|R
50|$|Ibuprofen is a {{medication}} in the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class {{that is used}} for treating pain, fever, and inflammation. This includes painful <b>menstrual</b> periods, <b>migraines,</b> and rheumatoid arthritis. About 60% of people improve with any given NSAID, and {{it is recommended that}} if one does not work then another should be tried. It may also be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in a premature baby. It can be used by mouth or intravenously. It typically begins working within an hour.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{stronger}} {{physical and}} emotional or psychological sensations may interfere with normal activities, and include <b>menstrual</b> pain (dysmenorrhea), <b>migraine</b> headaches, and depression. Dysmenorrhea, or severe uterine pain, is particularly common for young females (one study found that 67.2% of girls aged 13-19 have it).|$|R
5000|$|Menstrual migraines {{may also}} be linked to {{oestrogen}} withdrawal. Under the category of headache attributed to a substance or its withdrawal, the ICHD specifies the diagnostic criteria for oestrogen-withdrawal headache (8.4.3, [...] and [...] ), and suggests that both that diagnosis {{and one of the}} <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> diagnoses be used in case of migraines related to oestrogen withdrawal occurring mainly at menstruation.|$|E
50|$|Preventive {{migraine}} medications {{are considered}} effective if they reduce the frequency or {{severity of the}} migraine attacks by at least 50%. Guidelines are fairly consistent in rating topiramate, divalproex/sodium valproate, propranolol, and metoprolol as having {{the highest level of}} evidence for first-line use. Recommendations regarding effectiveness varied however for gabapentin and pregabalin. Timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity, while frovatriptan is effective for prevention of <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine.</b> Tentative evidence also supports the use of magnesium supplementation. Increasing dietary intake may be better.|$|E
5000|$|This {{relationship}} was {{noted by the}} IHS in both versions of the ICHD, and particularly that this disorder fell under [...] "migraine without aura". The ICHD-1 referred to this as <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine,</b> noting {{that there were no}} strict guidelines for this diagnosis, but that at least 90% of a womans attacks should occur within two days of the beginning or end of menstruation. When the ICHD-2 was published, explicit guidelines for a diagnosis of two distinct types of menstruation-related migraine were released, and appear to the right. However, because {{the nature of the relationship}} is still unclear, and because the IHS was still uncertain as to whether these were a subset of migraine without aura or a distinct class of migraine, the criteria were delegated to an appendix, while anticipating that they would appear within the main text in the next revision.|$|E
40|$|There {{are those}} who believemenstrual {{suppression}} is unnatural. However, studies have proven that suppression of ovulation and menses by hor-mones, either combined oral contraceptives (COC) or prog-esterone-only contraception, {{reduces the risk of}} ovarian and endometrial cancer by at least 40 % after one year of use. 1 How does it work? After the 21 days of active tablets, during the seven-day hormone-free interval (HFI) COC regimen, the hypothalam-ic pituitary ovarian (HPO) axis recovers, with ovarian follicle growth {{by the beginning of the}} next pill cycle. Pill omissions adjacent to the HFI are associat-ed with escape ovulation and contraceptive failure. Extending the number of days of active COC may increase contraceptive efficacy, as there would be less opportu-nity to omit pills adjacent to the HFI. Decreasing the HFI to three or four days could also poten-tially increase contraceptive efficacy by reducing HPO recovery. The lower the COC dose, the faster the recovery of the HPO axis. In Europe and the U. S., use of low-dose COCs—containing as low as 15 µg of ethinyl estra-diol—has lead to new contra-ceptive regimens. These regi-mens extend the number of active pills and reduce the num-ber of hormone-free days to diminish hypothalamic recov-ery associated with the tradi-tional seven-day HFI. Though physicians have pro-duced menstrual suppression in the past, most have not done so for social reasons. Using prog-esterone-only contraception, along with continuous COC, danazol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone antago-nists/agonists, suppresses menses in women who have endometriosis, menorrhagia, <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraines</b> and other symptoms associated with the HFI. 2 Zena’s cas...|$|R

40|$|During the {{reproductive}} years, migraine is {{two to three}} times more prevalent in women compared to men. This sex difference may, at least in part, be due to the cyclic changes in female sex hormones and a subset of female migraineurs recognizes menstruation as the most important trigger of attacks. In 2004, formal diagnostic criteria for <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> were published in the appendix of the International Classification of Headache Disorders 2 nd edition (ICHD II). <b>Menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> was defined as attacks of migraine without aura occurring on the days centering {{on the first day of}} the menstrual bleeding, i. e. day - 2 to + 3, in at least two out of three consecutive menstrual cycles. In the revised version from 2013 (ICHD III beta), a requirement of prospective headache diaries over three menstrual cycles was added in order to confirm the diagnosis. This was based on previous studies reporting that women tend to over report <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> by self-assessment. The diagnosis is still placed in the appendix because it is considered as insufficiently validated. Most previous studies on <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> are conducted in clinic populations, and no studies have previously used the ICHD criteria in the general population. The purpose of the present study was to investigate prevalence and characteristics in <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> in the general population. This thesis is based on four original research papers from a population-based study on <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine.</b> The participants were recruited by questionnaires mailed to 5000 women aged 30 - 34 years from the general population and women with self-reported <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> were invited to a clinical interview and examination at Akershus University Hospital. Subsequently, the women were instructed to complete a headache- and menstruation diary for three consecutive menstrual cycles. Among 308 eligible women who self-reported migraine in at least half of their menstruations by questionnaire, 237 (77 %) participated in the interview. The lifetime prevalence of <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> was 17. 6 % among female migraineurs and 6. 1 % among all women. Only one out of seven women experienced migraine exclusively in relation to menstruation. The headache diary was returned by 123 (52 %) women. A substantial agreement between <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> diagnoses given by interview versus those given by diaries was found (Kappa 0. 62). The characteristics of menstrual and non-menstrual attacks of migraine without aura were compared among the 56 women with a prospectively confirmed diary-diagnosis of <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine.</b> In these women, menstrual attacks lasted on average nearly 11 hours longer, were significantly more often associated with severe nausea, and were on average treated with 1. 4 more doses of symptomatic drugs than non-menstrual attacks. In contrast, no differences between menstrual and non-menstrual attacks were found among the 25 women who had migraine without aura but who did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine.</b> The clinical interview included questions about the course of migraine during use of current hormonal contraception. Women with a history of <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> who developed contraception-induced amenorrhoea were more likely to report a reduction in their total migraine frequency compared women with a history of <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> who were not amenorrhoeic. Conclusion: <b>Menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> occurs in about one fifth of female migraineurs in the general population and in these women, menstrual attacks are associated with more severe symptomatology than non-menstrual attacks. The diagnosis can be made by a physician’s semi-structured interview and diaries should only be required in specific cases.

40|$|Introduction. The {{prevalence}} of migraine in {{childhood and adolescence}} has not changed to a great extent, but it increases in adolescence, especially in female adolescents. <b>Menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> – definition. There {{are two types of}} menstrual migraine: true <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> and menstrual related migraine. True <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> occurs predominantly around menstruation, whereas menstrual related migraine occurs during menstruation, but also at other times during the month. Causes. Exaggerated or abnormal neurotransmitter responses to normal cyclic changes in the ovarian hormones are probably the basic cause of menstrual migraines. The fall in estrogen levels during menstrual cycle is trigger for the <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine.</b> Symptoms. <b>Menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> has the same symptoms as other types of migraine, but the pain is stronger, IT lasts longer, AND IT IS more frequent than other types of migraines. Diagnosis. In order to make a diagnosis, women are asked to keep a headache diary for three months. If the migraine headache is severe and occurs regularly between two days before and three days after the start of menstrual bleeding, it is true <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine.</b> Therapy. Menstrual migraines are more difficult to treat than other types of migraines. Treatment principles for <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> are the same as for migraines in general, with certain particularities. Conclusion. Hormonally associated migraine is a specific clinical entity. It is important to diagnose the type of migraine, considering the fact that a decline in estrogen level at the end of menstrual cycle triggers migraine, so it can be treated by low levels of estrogen. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective—The primary {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to (1) contrast reproductive hormone levels and ratings of menstrual distress of female migraineurs with those of a control group in each menstrual cycle phase, (2) examine correlations between hormone levels and migraine frequency, severity, and migraine-related disability, and (3) examine correlations between <b>menstrual</b> distress and <b>migraine</b> frequency, severity, and migraine-related disability. A secondary objective was to evaluate the validity of a migraine disability measure modified to reflect 7 -day recall. Background—Further controlled, prospective study is needed regarding the temporal relationships between reproductive hormones at each stage of the menstrual cycle and fluctuations in migraine activity across the cycle. Methods—Twenty-three women (17 with migraine, 6 control participants) completed laboratory hormone assays and measures of menstrual distress and disability at each phase of one menstrual cycle, and monitored their headache activity daily during the same cycle. Results—The migraine group evidenced lower premenstrual luteinizing hormone and more menstrual distress symptoms at each phase of the menstrual cycle. Hormones were associated with migraine activity and disability within cycle phases, and across phases in a time-lagged manner. Menstrual distress was associated with ovulatory phase migraine activity and with migraine-related disability across the menstrual cycle. A retrospective 7 -day migraine disability measure appeared to be a consistently valid index. Conclusions—Both reproductive hormones and menstrually related distress appear to predict migraine activity and disability. These associations were evident not only for perimenstrual migraine, but also for migraine at each phase of the menstrual cycle...|$|R

40|$|Gianni Allais, Chiara Benedetto Department of Surgical Sciences, Women’s Headache Center, University of Turin, Turin, Italy Abstract: Migraine is {{a common}} {{neurovascular}} disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. Current guidelines recommend triptans as first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. Frovatriptan is a second-generation triptan with a longer terminal elimination half-life in blood than other triptans (~ 26 hours). Three double-blind, randomized crossover preference studies have been recently conducted, assessing efficacy and safety of frovatriptan versus rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, and almotriptan, respectively. Frovatriptan showed favorable tolerability and sustained effect, with a significantly lower rate of relapse over 48 hours versus the other triptans. These findings were confirmed {{in a series of}} analyses of patient subsets from the three studies, including patients with menstrually related and oral contraceptive-induced migraine, hypertension, obesity, weekend migraine, as well as patients with migraine with aura. In all patient subsets analyzed, lower headache recurrence rates were observed versus the comparator triptans, indicating a more sustained pain-relieving effect on migraine symptoms. A further randomized, double-blind study demonstrated that frovatriptan given in combination with the fast-acting cyclooxygenase inhibitor dexketoprofen provided improved migraine pain-free activity at 2 hours, and gave more sustained pain-free activity at 24 hours, versus frovatriptan alone. These benefits were observed both when the combination was administered early ( 1 hour after onset). Different pharmacokinetic, but synergistic, properties between frovatriptan and dexketoprofen may make the combination of these agents particularly effective in migraine treatment, with rapid onset of action and sustained effect over 48 hours. These benefits, together with potential cost-effectiveness advantages versus other triptans could drive selection of the most appropriate treatment for acute migraine attacks.

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons to suggest a link between {{headache}} and hormones. Migraine is three times common in women as compared to men after puberty, cyclic as well as non-cyclic fluctuations in sex hormone levels during the entire reproductive life span of a women are associated with changes in frequency or severity of migraine attack, abnormalities in the hypothalamus and pineal gland have been observed in cluster headache, oestrogens are useful {{in the treatment of}} <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> and the use of melatonin has been reported in various types of primary headaches.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{suppression}} of cyclical ovarian {{activity and the}} creation of constant oestradiol levels in blood by subcutaneous oestradiol implants has been used to treat 24 patients with <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> for up to five years. Twenty-three patients improved with treatment, 20 (83 %) became completely or almost completely headache-free. Regular monthly periods were induced with cyclical oral progestogens. The treatment was not associated with any problems. The results support the concept that oestrogen withdrawal in the late luteal and menstrual phases of the ovarian cycle is the important precipitating factor in <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine,</b> and such attacks can be prevented by suppressing the hormonal fluctuations associated with the ovarian cycle. Migraine occurs in approximately 19 % of women. ' In a significant number the migraine headaches appear to be influenced by hormone changes associated with the ovarian cycle, in that attacks usually commence after puberty, and in up to 60 % the headaches are related to menstruation. 2 Pre-gnancy is associated with total or partial cessation of attacks and the combined oral contraceptive pill may precipitate migraine during the week off inter-val. These observations, and the lack of consistent differences in the plasma concentrations of the ovarian hormones between women suffering from <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> and controls, 3 has led to the concept of hormone withdrawal in the premenstrual phase as the causative factor. Somerville 4 believed that falling oestradiol levels, rather than proges-terone were responsible, as he was able to abort <b>menstrual</b> <b>migraine</b> attacks by short-acting injec-tions of oestradiol but not by progesterone. He also attempted prophylaxis using oral and injectable oes-tragens but failed to maintain adequate plasma oes-tradiol level and did not influence the frequency of migraine attacks.

In every subject, blood samples were drawn during both follicular and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.
