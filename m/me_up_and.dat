25|$|Inspired by {{the events}} of May 1968 in France, Fo and Rame {{abandoned}} the official state theatre in Italy and set up Associazione Nuova Scena, a theatre collective operating outside the state structure. They asked the PCI for assistance and access to community centres and workers' clubs. In October 1968, they toured Fo's latest play Grande pantomima con bandiere e pupazzi piccoli e medi (Grand Pantomime with Flags and Small and Middle-sized Puppets), opening in Cesena. The play, which featured masks instead of characters—representing Capital, the Confederation of Industry, High Finance, the Church, the People, Rebels and Peasants—included a giant puppet representing fascism which gave birth to representatives of the Church, the Monarchy, the Army and Industrialism. L'operaio conosce 300 parole, il padrone 1,000: per questo lui è il padrone (The Worker Knows 300 Words, the Boss Knows 1000, That's Why He's the Boss), Legami pure che tanto io spacco tutto lo stesso (Chain <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> I'll Still Smash Everything) and Mistero Buffo (Comical Mystery Play), also date from this time. Though Fo himself had never been a Communist Party member, his open criticism of PCI methods and policies on the stage led to conflict with the Party.|$|E

The word 'damned' was removed from {{the final version of the}} album, at the request of two major Christian retailers.|$|E

500|$|Following the two sellout concerts, all the {{participants}} attended a celebratory party in a basement club known as Ungano's. Dylan was so elated, Harrison recalled 16 years later, [...] "He picked <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> hugged me and he said, 'God! If only we'd done three shows!'" [...] Like Harrison, the experience of playing at Madison Square that day {{did not lead to}} Dylan immediately re-embracing the concert stage; only a brief guest appearance with the Band on New Year's Eve 1971–72 and sitting in during a John Prine club gig eventuated before he returned to touring in January 1974.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{was well}} received by critics who praised the song for its [...] "dance-floor friendly" [...] sound. It was commercially successful peaking at number-one on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts, giving The Veronicas their first number-one single. The accompanying music video portrays Jessica and Lisa in {{a boarding school}} rebellion. [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] was performed at the 2008 Australia Day Live Concert {{as well as on}} the Hook <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Revenge Is Sweeter tours, in 2007 and 2009, respectively. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008, it was nominated for [...] "Highest Selling Single".|$|E
500|$|J.R. Rotem, who {{previously}} produced a track for Minaj's debut album, originally conceived [...] "Marilyn Monroe". According to Minaj, [...] "He hit <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> he said, 'I have {{a song that}} I think only an icon can sing'. I was like, 'Oh J.R., shut up!' We laughed {{a little bit on}} iChat." [...] It was written by Minaj, Daniel James, Leah Haywood, Ross Golan and Rotem. Rotem and Dreamlab produced the track, with vocal production handled by Nicholas Cooper. Ariel Chobaz & Gelly Kusuma recorded and mixed [...] "Marilyn Monroe" [...] with assistance from Jon Sher at Conway Studios and Beluga Heights Studio, both studios in Los Angeles.|$|E

[...] But they did not? [...] "No, {{not all of them}} did. In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end." [...] The Rebbe leaned forward as if to measure <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> said with more sorrow than anger: That means you are writing lies! I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense. Yet, I had to justify myself: [...] "Things are not that simple, Rebbe.

500|$|Van Gogh painted nature, {{the major}} subject for his {{works in the}} last 29 months of his life, to bring relief from his {{illnesses}} and emotional distress. Prior to this period he had rejected what he perceived as the narrow religion of his parents, and took an almost nihilistic stance, not unlike Nietzsche's, toward religion and God. [...] It was among the blossoming trees, the olive orchards and fields that van Gogh most often found [...] "profound meaning", because he saw in their cycles an analogy to human life. [...] He wrote to Theo that death, happiness and unhappiness are [...] "necessary and useful" [...] and relative, declaring [...] "Even faced with an illness that breaks <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> frightens me, that belief is unshaken." ...|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Chamberlain damaged his {{reputation}} in an April 1965 article with Sports Illustrated. In an interview entitled [...] "My Life in a Bush League", he criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later commented {{that he could}} see in hindsight how the interview could have been instrumental in hurting his public image. However, contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain. Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court [...] "comical", and when 6ft 11in 250-pound (in his early years) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier was asked about the most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: [...] "When Wilt Chamberlain lifted <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> moved me like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} a short call-and-response audio clip from The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour as Beyoncé asks the crowd [...] "Lemme hear you say 'Hayyy Ms. Carter!'". It then {{transitions}} into what Andrew Hampp of Billboard magazine called the [...] "lady thug anthem" [...] of [...] "Yoncé". Beyoncé delivers half-rapped verses on {{the first half of}} the song, in which the female protagonist teases male subjects in a club as she turns heads. In the first verse, she warns the other women in the club, [...] "Every girl on here gotta look <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down / All on Instagram cake by the pound". The singer adds on the second verse, [...] "I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker." [...] "Yoncé" [...] closes with the bridge as Beyoncé sings repeatedly, [...] "Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor", while an ascending siren echoes over a staccato bass that hits heavily and uniformly in the background.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} live {{performances}} of [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] was at the ARIA Music Awards of 2007, held on 21October. Clothed in costumes similar to the music video, Lisa and Jessica appeared from a yellow school bus. During the performance Lisa and Jessica sang vocals, while the latter also played the electric guitar, with their band, as opposed to using synthesised instruments in the original recording. At {{the end of the}} performance, two streamer cannons on opposite ends of the stage, shot out pink streamers. The duo promoted the track on Australian television, including Today and Rove Live. They also performed the song at the 2008 Australia Day Live Concert in Canberra, Australia's Funniest Home Videos, Take 40 Live Lounge, and on Video Hits in 2009. [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] was added to the set lists of both the Hook <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Revenge Is Sweeter tours in 2007 and 2009, respectively.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} he made several guest appearances, {{including}} a 1985 performance at {{a tribute to}} Carl Perkins titled [...] In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert, an event organised {{to raise money for}} the Birmingham Children's Hospital. The following year, he appeared at The Prince's Trust concert at London's Wembley Arena, performing [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". In February 1987 he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal. Harrison recalled: [...] "Bob rang <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?' But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{died at the}} Hôtel Idéal Séjour, in Menton, France, on 28 January 1939, aged 73. He {{was buried}} after a {{discreet}} and private funeral at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. Attempts had been made at Roquebrune to dissuade the family from proceeding with {{the removal of the}} remains to Ireland due to the uncertainty of their identity. His body had earlier been exhumed and transferred to the ossuary. Yeats and George had often discussed his death, and his express wish was that he be buried quickly in France with a minimum of fuss. According to George, [...] "His actual words were 'If I die bury me up there [...] and then in a year's time when the newspapers have forgotten me, dig <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> plant me in Sligo'." [...] In September 1948, Yeats's body was moved to Drumcliff, County Sligo, on the Irish Naval Service corvette LÉ Macha. The person in charge of this operation for the Irish Government was Sean MacBride, son of Maud Gonne MacBride, and then Minister of External Affairs. His epitaph is taken from the last lines of [...] "Under Ben Bulben", one of his final poems: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Austin, Texas renamed Second Street to Willie Nelson Boulevard. The {{city also}} {{unveiled}} a life-size statue to honor him, {{placed at the}} entrance of Austin City Limits new studio. The non-profit organization Capital Area Statues commissioned sculptor Clete Shields to execute the project. The statue was unveiled on April 20, 2012. The date selected by the city of Austin unintentionally coincided with the number 4/20, associated with cannabis culture. In spite of the coincidence and Nelson's advocacy for the legalization of marijuana, the ceremony was scheduled also for 4:20pm. During the ceremony, Nelson performed the song [...] "Roll <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Smoke Me When I Die". The same year, Nelson was honored during the 46th Annual Country Music Association Awards as the first recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award, which was also named after him. In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from the Berklee College of Music. The following year, {{he was part of the}} inaugural class inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame. Also included among the first inductees was his friend Darrell Royal, whose jamming parties that Nelson participated in were the source of inspiration for the show.|$|E
500|$|When {{speaking}} on the conceptual basis of Ready, Songz said, [...] "You think about a record like 'LOL Smiley Face,' it's something real simple, {{but when you look}} at the title or listen to the record, you're like, 'Wow.' That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A lot of people have hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit <b>me</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E

500|$|James Dinh of MTV {{noted that}} [...] "the pop star appears strong, bold {{and just a}} tad resentful after a breakup" [...] on the track. His {{analysis}} of the lyrics observed that [...] "The singer declares herself unbreakable after a breakup, evident in lines such as [...] "Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade/ 'Cause you chewed <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> spit me out/ Like I was poison in your mouth/ You took my light, you drained me down/ But that was then and this is now, now look at me." [...] Dinh pointed out similarities between [...] "Part of Me" [...] and Perry's previous single [...] "California Gurls", noting that [...] "the tune's steady beat amplifies" [...] as the chorus starts. Andrew Hampp of Billboard described the song as a [...] "dance-floor rave up", and compared the song's composition to Jessie J's [...] "Domino". Edna Gundersen from USA Today stated: [...] "Katy Perry could be addressing her ex or her detractors on this defiant slapdown, a gleaming [...] "Firework"-like pop torpedo propelled by slick beats and a brazen chorus." [...] Chris Ryan, also of MTV, inferred that the song was aimed at Perry's ex-boyfriend Travie McCoy, while New York magazine journalist Amanda Dobbis described it as [...] "another break-up anthem". Fans and media noted differences in the lyrics between the demo and the single, and claimed that the changes redirected the song's subject from McCoy to Perry's ex-husband Russell Brand, from whom she had recently divorced. Perry declared it was not about Brand, stating: ...|$|E
