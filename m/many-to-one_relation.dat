Using it, Frege provided a definition of the ancestral relation, of the <b>many-to-one</b> <b>relation,</b> and of mathematical induction.This period overlaps with the work of {{what is known as the}} [...] "mathematical school", which included Dedekind, Pasch, Peano, Hilbert, Zermelo, Huntington, Veblen and Heyting. Their objective was the axiomatisation of branches of mathematics like geometry, arithmetic, analysis and set theory. Most notable was Hilbert's Program, which sought to ground all of mathematics to a finite set of axioms, proving its consistency by [...] "finitistic" [...] means and providing a procedure which would decide the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement. The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the Peano axioms in his honor. Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols. While unaware of Frege's work, he independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of Boole and Schröder.|$|E
30|$|Based {{on these}} dimensions, our model differentiates six {{business}} models. At the hierarchy level, privately owned platforms typically facilitate the procurement or selling of its owner (a company) in closed systems and only allow for one-to-many or <b>many-to-one</b> <b>relations.</b> In between hierarchy and market, consortia-based platforms implement many-to-few {{or vice versa}} relations and are typically a collaboration of several companies in the same industry that seek to facilitate their sales or procurement processes. Those platforms are closed because the entry into the platform (into the consortium) is only theoretically possible.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the project}} Twenty-One, which aims at {{effective}} {{dissemination of information}} on ecology and sustainable development, a system is developed that supports cross-language information retrieval {{for any of the}} four languages Dutch, English, French and German. Knowledge of this application domain is neededto enhanceexisting translation resourcesfor the purpose of lexical disambiguation. This paper describes an algorithm for the automated acquisition of a translation lexicon from a parallel corpus. New about the presented algorithm is the statistical language model used. Because the algorithm is based on a symmetric translation model it becomespossible to identify one-to-many and <b>many-to-one</b> <b>relations</b> between words of a language pair. We claim that the presented method has two advantagesover algorithms that have been published before. Firstly, because the translation model is more powerful, the resulting bilingual lexicon will be more accurate. Secondly, the resulting bilingual lexicon can be used to translate in both directions between a language pair. Different versions of the algorithm were evaluated on the Dutch and English version of the Agenda 21 corpus, which is a UN document on the application domain of sustainable development. ...|$|R

50|$|If L is {{a regular}} language, then by {{definition}} there is a DFA A that recognizes it, with only finitely many states. If there are n states, then partition the set of all finite strings into n subsets, where subset Si is the set of strings that, when given as input to automaton A, cause it to end in state i. For every two strings x and y that {{belong to the same}} state, and for every choice of a third string z, automaton A reaches the same state on input xz as it reaches on input yz, and therefore must either accept both of the inputs xz and yz or reject both of them. Therefore, no string z can be a distinguishing extension for x and y, so they must be related by RL. Thus, Si is a subset of an equivalence class of RL. Combining this fact with the fact that every member of one of these equivalence classes belongs to one of the sets Si, this gives a <b>many-to-one</b> <b>relation</b> from states of A to equivalence classes, implying that the number of equivalence classes is finite and at most n.|$|E

40|$|The idea of extracting {{knowledge}} in process mining is {{a descendant of}} data mining. Both mining disciplines emphasise data flow and relations among elements in the data. Unfortunately, challenges have been encountered when working with the data flow and relations. One of the challenges is that {{the representation of the}} data flow between a pair of elements or tasks is insufficiently simplified and formulated, as it considers only a one-to-one data flow relation. In this paper, we discuss how the effectiveness of knowledge representation can be extended in both disciplines. To this end, we introduce a new representation of the data flow and dependency formulation using a flow graph. The flow graph solves the issue of the insufficiency of presenting other relation types, such as <b>many-to-one</b> and one-to-many <b>relations.</b> As an experiment, a new evaluation framework is applied to the Teleclaim process in order to show how this method can provide us with more precise results when compared with other representations...|$|R
40|$|The {{automated}} {{design of}} architectural floor plans satisfying given topological and dimensional constraints is a challenging field of research. In this paper ABSTRACTION is pointed {{out as an}} important conceptual tool of this field. A critical discussion of existing plan-design methods leads {{to the conclusion that}} the potentials of abstraction as a tool have not yet been fully recognized. The rest of the paper is an attempt to improve this situation by suggesting a new approach to automated floor-plan design. Theoretically, design is viewed as a one-to-many relation, a tree whose lines are directed from the root (the problem) towards the leaves (the solutions). Abstraction is viewed as the inverse <b>many-to-one</b> <b>relation.</b> A particular relation of abstraction is defined, such that the intermediate nodes of the tree (between root and leaves) are themselves floor plans, but are less detailed than the solutions. From the study of this concept of abstraction, it is concluded that the design algorithm based on it is likely to have certain useful propertie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} novel {{framework}} for learning many-to-many statistical mappings from musical measures to dance figures towards generating plausible music-driven dance choreographies. We obtain music-to-dance mappings {{through use of}} four statistical models: 1) musical measure models, repre-senting a <b>many-to-one</b> <b>relation,</b> each of which associates different melody patterns to a given dance figure via a hidden Markov model (HMM); 2) exchangeable figures model, which captures the diversity in a dance performance through a one-to-many relation, extracted by unsupervised clustering of musical measure segments based on melodic similarity; 3) figure transition model, which cap-tures the intrinsic dependencies of dance figure sequences via an-gram model; 4) dance figure models, capturing the variations in the way particular dance figures are performed, by modeling the motion trajectory of each dance figure via an HMM. Based on the first three of these statistical mappings, we define a discrete HMM and synthesize alternative dance figure sequences by employing a modified Viterbi algorithm. The motion parameters of the dance figures in the synthesized choreography are then computed using the dance figure models. Finally, the generated motion parameters are animated synchronously with the musical audio using a 3 -D character model. Objective and subjective evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to produce compelling music-driven choreographies.

30|$|In {{an early}} {{photorealistic}} 2 D visual speech synthesis system designed by Bregler et al. [4], the visual database is segmented in triphones using the phonetic annotation of the audio track. To create new unseen visual speech, the system creates {{a series of}} output frames by selecting the most appropriate triphones from the database. Other systems described by Ezzat and Poggio [5] and Goyal et al. [6] {{are based on the}} idea that the relation between phonemes and visemes can be simplified as a <b>many-to-one</b> <b>relation.</b> First they create a database of still images, one for each viseme-class. For each phoneme in the output audio, its representative still image is added to the output video track. To accomplish a smooth transition between these keyframes, image warping is used to create the appropriate intermediate frames. More recent systems use techniques similar to the unit selection strategy found in audio TTS systems. A general description of this strategy can be found in [7]. Cosatto and Graf [8], for example, have created a system where the new video track is constructed by using a visual speech database from which units consisting of a variable amount of original frames are selected and concatenated. This selection is based on how well the unit matches the ideal target speech fragment and how good it can be concatenated with the other selected units. Similar approaches can be found, for example, in [9, 10]. Finally, we should also mention the systems developed by Ezzat et al. [11] and Theobald et al. [12], where the visual speech database is projected onto a model space (e.g., shape and appearance parameters [13]) and where the output speech is constructed by selecting and concatenating model parameters instead of actual frames.|$|E
