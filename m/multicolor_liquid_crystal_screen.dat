40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the issue of {{accuracy}} estimating for the object location display in the geographic information systems and display systems of manned aircrafts navigation complexes. Application features of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>screens</b> with a different number of vertical and horizontal pixels are considered at displaying of geographic information data on different scales. Estimation display of navigation parameters values on board the aircraft is done in two ways: a numeric value is directly displayed on the screen of multi-color indicator, and a silhouette of the object is formed on the screen on a substrate background, which is a graphical representation of area map in the flight zone. Various scales of area digital map display currently used in the aviation industry have been considered. Calculation results of one pixel scale interval, depending on the specifications of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>screen</b> and zoom of the map display area on the multifunction digital display, are given. The paper contains experimental results of the accuracy evaluation for area position display of the aircraft based on the data from the satellite navigation system and inertial navigation system, obtained during the flight program run of the real object. On the basis of these calculations a family of graphs was created for precision error display of the object reference point position using the onboard indicators with <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>screen</b> with different screen resolutions (6 "× 8 ", 7. 2 "× 9. 6 ", 9 "× 12 ") for two map display scales (1 : 0, 25 km, 1 - 2 km).

40|$|DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF REAL TIME OPTICAL CORRELATOR. AN APPLICATION TO PATTERN RECOGNITION WITH DEFOCUS IMAGES BY MEANS WAVELET DECOMPOSITION Shape {{recognition}} through correlation {{in images}} allows {{determining whether a}} pattern or referential object is present or not in a scene. This means comparing the degree of similarity between the scene and a function, called filter, containing the information of the object to be detected. When the scene to be analysed features degradations such as defocus, {{the result of the}} recognition process gets worst and is not reliable. The solution to this problem proposed by the research group was to apply decomposition to the defocused input scene through a bank of filters, thus obtaining multiple information channels (correlation shots). Therefore, a study was conducted and compound filters were designed based on the wavelet multi-band decomposition that allows obtaining the multichannel decomposition with the aim of optimising the luminous signal and the recognition filter called Trade-off filter. This means that the luminous intensity of the Fourier optics transform of an image is weak in the zones of high frequencies, and it is in that zone where the information on details of the image is located. Behaviours of various Wavelet functions were studied. Morlet Wavelet was the most outstanding one due to its performance in the face recognition problem. On the other hand, designing compound filters based on wavelets and trade-off filters allowed studying shape recognition in the compressed domain. Usually, in order to conduct shape recognition with compressed images, the image must first be decompressed which involves taking time to do so. A methodology enabling digital shape recognition on compressed images without the need for a previous image decompression has been studied. Results show a good performance of the method proposed. There are many applications in which the decomposition process uses a filter bank. Also, this whole process is conducted in an experimental optical system called optical correlator. Efficiency of the process does not only depend {{on the quality of the}} methods used, on the design of appropriate filters, or on strategies for information use, but also on the speed at which the scene and/or the filter can be inserted into the optical system. In this project, spatial modulators of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> light were studied and characterized with the purpose of using them in the optical correlator in order to introduce scenes and/or filter banks at speeds of electronics, thus allowing granting a great power, versatility, automation and strength to a highly useful procedure. The determined optical implementation allows having a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>screen</b> modulating only in amplitude and another one modulating only in phase. Each of these requires their own optical implementation, which was determined in this project and is specific for each modulator. It must be highlighted that these process were carried out manually and every time a change was made the optical system had to be readjusted as it is easily misaligned. In order to use the previously designed compound filters, they must be implemented in the spatial light modulator. This was a problem that needed to be solved, as the filter information must be codified in a pure amplitude function or a pure phase function under the commitment of performance curves of modulators existing in the laboratory. Optical correlation has been conducted with previous results from: studies on compound filters, studies on characteristics of modulators, studies on the type of codification. The problem set up in the project is the recognition of defocused faces. Results were significant with a complete trade-off filter (TOF). To date, however, results obtained do not improve when using a multi-channel decomposition methodology through wavelets. The study of these <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>screens</b> made it possible to also study the diffraction produced by depolarized pupils in the Fourier domain. Result show the generation of intensity maps that vary according to conditions of input light and its detection. These studies were implemented on a spatial light modulator, obtaining results that match theoretically-obtained results. To sum up, this project solves the problem of invariant optical recognition in view of real time defocus through <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>screens</b> with codified filters as amplitude elements. The methodology of decomposition through compound filters based on wavelets does not feature a substantial improvement in view of non-decomposition methods.

We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} evaluation of chromaticity coordinates shift for image displayed on <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> panels with various properties on color reproduction. A mathematical model represents the color reproduction characteristics. The spread of the color characteristics of the screens has a statistical nature. Differences of color reproduction for screens are perceived by the observer {{in the form of}} different colors and shades that are displayed on the same type of commercially available screens. Color differences are characterized by numerical measure of the difference of colors and can be mathematically compensated. The solution of accounting problem of the statistical nature of the color characteristics spread for the screens has a particular relevance to aviation instrumentation. Method. Evaluation of chromaticity coordinates shift of the image is based on the application of the Grassmann laws of color mixing. Basic data for quantitative calculation of shift are the profiles of two different <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> panels defined by matrixes of scales for components of primary colors (red, green, blue). The calculation is based on solving the system of equations and calculating the color difference in the XY-plane. In general, the calculation can be performed in other color spaces: UV, Lab. The statistical nature of the spread of the color characteristics for the screens is accounted for in the proposed mathematical model based on the interval setting of coordinate values of the color gamut triangle vertices on the set of commercially available samples. Main Results. Carried outresearches result in the mathematical expressions allowing to recalculate values of chromaticity coordinates of the image displayed on various samples of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>screens.</b> It is shown that the spread of the color characteristics of the screens follows bivariate normal distribution law with the accuracy sufficient for practice.
