She was initially deployed in the Thames estuary {{as part of the}} deceptions to divert enemy attention away from Normandy, but on 8 June 1944, she was moved to Gooseberry 5, off Sword Beach at Ouistreham to provide repair facilities and supply anti-aircraft and bombardment support. Her allocation immediately followed the assault and coincided with the [...] "great storm" [...] that disrupted Allied plans. Her repair duties at Sword saved 79 craft from total loss and returned 132 more to service off the beachhead. In July, Albatross returned to Portsmouth for replenishment and to rest her crew and, on return to Normandy, she was reallocated to Juno Beach.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings of}} a land-use and land-cover (LULC) change mapping exercise conducted in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Nine LULC classes were mapped from multi-temporal Landsat data of 1974, 1986 and 2000. Special attention {{was given to the}} growth or otherwise of agricultural land in relation to other LULC classes. Conversion of one land-use/-cover type to the other was identified, and its effects discussed. <b>Major</b> <b>conversions</b> occurred between agricultural lands, grasslands, evergreen forest, built-up areas and barren land. Built-up areas increased by at least 140 % between 1974 and 2000, suggesting a high urbanization rate. About 882 ha (27 %) of agricultural lands in 1986 were converted to residential purposes in 2000, especially at the urban fringes, in response to an increase in population. Some 14 % of evergreen forest was found to have been converted to agricultural land. These <b>major</b> <b>conversions</b> suggest a strong linkage between urbanization, agriculture and deforestation...|$|R

Efforts to draw the Anglican communities closer to the Catholic Church experienced a setback when the Vatican announced in 1896, after a historical analysis, that the apostolic succession of Anglican Bishops was not completely secured, meaning that some Anglican bishops were not properly ordained.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} directionality of <b>major</b> total <b>conversion</b> in English, where <b>major</b> total <b>conversion</b> {{is defined as}} the process {{and at the same time}} as the result of deriving a new lexical item by altering the part of speech of the base without marking the alteration overtly, as in the presumed pair dry – to dry. The question is whether there is a reliable strategy for deciding which member of a pair is the base and which member is the converted counterpart. Various attempts had been made to resolve the controversial directional issue, but the results have been inconsistent. The investigation aims to discover whether or not there exists a coherent notion about how to decide directionality by considering four factors assumed in the literature to reflect directionality. A large corpus of potential examples of <b>major</b> total <b>conversion</b> was collected to act as test materials. The four factors were compared for each <b>major</b> total <b>conversion</b> pair to see to what extent there was agreement among them. Results showed the factors did not agree to the expected extent. The findings are discussed in detail and it is claimed the inconsistencies can often be explained with recourse to a few general principles. In conclusion, on the whole the four factors considered are consistent with one another. In other words, the notion about how to determine directionality in <b>major</b> total <b>conversion</b> is coherent and can be maintained for English...|$|R
