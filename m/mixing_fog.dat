40|$|Anaerobic {{co-digestion}} of fats, oils, {{and grease}} (FOG) for increased methane (CH 4) production {{has been of}} increasing interest to municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) due to the potential economic benefit of using the produced biogas for cogeneration of energy. FOG loading increase must be done carefully to mitigate the risk for anaerobic digester upset or failure. Batch anaerobic digesters, containing inoculum collected from either Gresham or Corvallis WWTPs, were {{used to test the}} effects of 7 FOG sources (bakery, cherry brine, mayonnaise, <b>mixed</b> <b>FOG,</b> vitamin, “Westside”, and yogurt wastes) at various FOG loadings on batch anaerobic digester performance. There were three goals of this study: (1) compare the ability of different FOG sources to increase biogas production and to find the optimal loading rate for each FOG source, (2) compare the success of inoculum from a facility with a FOG addition program (Gresham) with one that had never received FOG additions (Corvallis), (3) find signals of anaerobic digester upset through high FOG loadings. FOG addition was able to increase batch anaerobic digester biogas and CH 4 productions by up to 425 % and 333 %, respectively. Higher FOG loadings as compared to lower FOG loadings wer...|$|R
5000|$|At the 15 January {{hearing the}} {{manslaughter}} charges against Counsell were dropped. He instead {{was charged with}} a single count of failing {{to ensure the safety}} of others, under health and safety laws. His trial began on 19 November and concluded on 10 December when the judge directed the jury to find him not guilty of the charge, stating that Counsell had [...] "no case to answer" [...] and that there was not sufficient evidence that he should have foreseen smoke from the display might drift and <b>mix</b> with <b>fog</b> to form thick smog.|$|R
50|$|Hydrogen {{fluoride}} and {{sulfur dioxide}} emissions from U.S. Steel's Donora Zinc Works and its American Steel & Wire plant were frequent occurrences in Donora. What made the 1948 event more severe was a temperature inversion, {{a situation in}} which warmer air aloft traps pollution in a layer of colder air near the surface. The pollutants in the air <b>mixed</b> with <b>fog</b> to form a thick, yellowish, acrid smog that hung over Donora for five days. The sulfuric acid, nitrogen dioxide, fluorine, and other poisonous gases that usually dispersed into the atmosphere were caught in the inversion and accumulated until rain ended the weather pattern.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 December 1952, an {{anticyclone}} {{settled over}} a windless London, causing a temperature inversion with cold, stagnant air trapped under a layer (or [...] "lid") of warm air. The resultant <b>fog,</b> <b>mixed</b> with chimney smoke, particulates {{such as those}} from vehicle exhausts, and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, formed a persistent smog, which blanketed the capital the following day. The presence of tarry particles of soot gave the smog its yellow-black colour, hence the nickname [...] "pea-souper". The absence of significant wind prevented its dispersal and allowed an unprecedented accumulation of pollutants.|$|R
500|$|The TARDIS on {{the cloud}} was {{achieved}} through a <b>mix</b> of <b>fog</b> on the studio floor and post-production special effects. Director Saul Metzstein {{explained that it}} was difficult to achieve the desired look for the snowmen; the first ones he likened to Zippy from Rainbow which was too [...] "cute" [...] an appearance, and so the effects team created more menacing CGI faces. Clara's introduction to the TARDIS introduced two novel effects for the show. The first was a single-shot camera tracking from {{a few feet away from}} the TARDIS to its interior, with the implication of the TARDIS's trans-dimensional nature shown to the audience. In the following shot, the camera does a complete circle of the TARDIS console, an effect not seen since the early days of the show. Metzstein wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the [...] "bigger on the inside than the outside" [...] nature of the time machine.|$|R

25|$|Towards 1:00 pm, in {{the thick}} mix of gun smoke and fog {{covering}} the field, the king was separated from his fellow riders and suffered multiple shots. A bullet crushed his left arm below the elbow. Almost simultaneously his horse suffered a shot to the neck that {{made it hard to}} control. In the <b>mix</b> of <b>fog</b> and smoke from the burning town of Lützen the king rode astray behind enemy lines. There he sustained yet another shot in the back, was stabbed and fell from his horse. Lying on the ground, he received a final, fatal shot to the temple. His fate remained unknown for some time. However, when the gunnery paused and the smoke cleared, his horse was spotted between the two lines, Gustavus himself not on it and nowhere to be seen. His disappearance stopped the initiative of the hitherto successful Swedish right wing, while a search was conducted. His partly stripped body was found an hour or two later, and was secretly evacuated from the field in a Swedish artillery wagon.|$|R

5000|$|The {{forest type}} of Matheran is Semi {{evergreen}} forests. The trees are evergreen, making the plateau forests very dense and even congested in places. The luxuriant growth represents the climatic {{climax of the}} forest. The laterite, porous soil along with very heavy rainfall <b>mixed</b> with dense <b>fog</b> for 4-5 months has resulted in unique flora rich in diversity on the plateau. The forests show vegetation in top, middle and ground storey. The trees form a cover over large variety of shade loving herbs, climbers, ferns and mosses. The Forests of Matheran has attracted many botanists who have studied the flora Flora of Matheran. They are Smyth J.Y.(1871), Birdwood H.M. (1886) and (1896), Cooke T.( [...] 1887-1901), Woodrow G.M.

Matheran has {{a huge number of}} medicinal plants and herbs.Matheran has been declared an Eco-Sensitive zone (ESZ)by the Union Environment Ministry in 4 February 2003 and can be called a Health Sanatorium in itself.The declaration as ESZ has led to the stoppage of developmental activities and construction of hazardous industries.|$|R
40|$|How {{to design}} an inter-network that is {{flexible}} regarding its features and scalable {{at the same}} time? How can such an inter-network satisfy requirements from applications and subnetworks dynamically? Can routing be more flexible and balance the wishes from end user and network operators? Is there a better world beyond current IP-networks? This book answers these questions by presenting a new architecture called "Forwarding on Gates" (FoG). It exploits the advantages of a recursive reference model and does not follow the traditional OSI reference model. <b>FoG</b> <b>mixes</b> connection-oriented and connectionless aspects dynamically {{in order to increase}} its efficiency. It enables a scalable function provisioning by a flexible distribution of states between network participants. Its routing can adjust itself to an optimal trade-off between CPU and memory usage. Moreover, FoG supports new business cases and opens up a market for network-related functions, at which function provider can offer their functions to function users.

40|$|The source-oriented Weather Research and Forecasting {{chemistry}} model (SOWC) {{was modified}} to include warm cloud processes and {{was applied to}} investigate how aerosol <b>mixing</b> states influence <b>fog</b> formation and optical properties in the atmosphere. SOWC tracks a 6 -D chemical variable (X, Z, Y, size bins, source types, species) through an explicit simulation of atmospheric chemistry and physics. A source-oriented cloud condensation nuclei module was implemented into the SOWC model to simulate warm clouds using the modified two-moment Purdue Lin microphysics scheme. The Goddard shortwave and long-wave radiation schemes were modified to interact with source-oriented aerosols and cloud droplets so that aerosol direct and indirect effects could be studied. The enhanced SOWC model was applied to study a fog event that occurred on 17 January 2011, in the Central Valley of California. Tule fog occurred because an atmospheric river effectively advected high moisture into the Central Valley and nighttime drainage flow brought cold air from mountains into the valley. The SOWC model produced reasonable liquid water path, spatial distribution and duration of fog events. The inclusion of aerosol–radiation interaction only slightly modified simulation results since cloud optical thickness dominated the radiation budget in fog events. The source-oriented mixture representation of particles reduced cloud droplet number relative to the internal mixture approach that artificially coats hydrophobic particles with hygroscopic components. The fraction of aerosols activating into cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at a supersaturation of 0. 5  % in the Central Valley decreased from 94  % in the internal mixture model to 80  % in the source-oriented model. This increased surface energy flux by 3 – 5  W m − 2 and surface temperature {{by as much as}} 0. 25  K in the daytime...|$|R
