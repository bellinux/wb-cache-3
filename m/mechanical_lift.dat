25|$|The caisson lock can however be powered, and the caisson lifted, by {{buoyancy}} alone. Pumping {{ballast water}} {{in and out}} of the caisson is enough to float it up or down the lock chamber. The weight of ballast water is approximately that of the canal barge being lifted. The boat lift though needs a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lift</b> system. In most vertical lift systems, this must also lift or lower the weight of the caisson and its water contents as well. This is substantially more than the barge alone, and the power to lift it is supplied mechanically. At the time of their development, the steam engine was in its infancy. Steam engines had been developed as water pumps, but not yet for the supply of mechanical power (see rotative steam engine). Given the engineering constraints of the time, lifting an enclosed caisson by buoyancy was more practical than driving a boat lift.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} to draining deep mines {{was found by}} Thomas Newcomen who developed an [...] "atmospheric" [...] engine that also worked on the vacuum principle. It employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to {{one end of a}} rocking beam that worked a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lift</b> pump from its opposite end. At the bottom of each stroke, steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston. As the piston rose within the cylinder, drawn upward by a counterbalance, it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure. At the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed, and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam. This water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston. The atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder, thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder. The piston, attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the [...] "rocking beam", pulled down the end of the beam, lifting {{the opposite end of the}} beam. Hence, the pump deep in the mine attached to opposite end of the beam via ropes and chains was driven. The pump pushed, rather than pulled the column of water upward, hence it could lift water any distance. Once the piston was at the bottom, the cycle repeated.|$|E

50|$|As {{unsaturated}} air rises, its temperature drops at the {{dry adiabatic}} rate. The dew point also drops (as {{a result of}} decreasing air pressure) but much more slowly, typically about −2 °C per 1,000 m. If unsaturated air rises far enough, eventually its temperature will reach its dew point, and condensation will begin to form. This altitude {{is known as the}} lifting condensation level (LCL) when <b>mechanical</b> <b>lift</b> is present and the convective condensation level (CCL) when <b>mechanical</b> <b>lift</b> is absent, in which case, the parcel must be heated from below to its convective temperature. The cloud base will be somewhere within the layer bounded by these parameters.|$|E

50|$|Litherland {{remained}} a poor area until {{the arrival of}} the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1774, this brought the area into the modern world, originally providing a safe route through Lancashire from Liverpool to Wigan, and eventually in 1816 through to Leeds.

The outcome of all this activity was to bring prosperous businessmen from the city to the countryside, where they had a desire to live.

A seven-year lease between the Benjamin Brothers and Heckelmann was formalised from September of that year {{at an annual rate}} of £500. The premises, which cost £6,000 were designed by architect Andrea Stombuco and erected by W Watson.

5000|$|Coding was {{accomplished}} via <b>mechanical</b> <b>lift</b> arms and latching bails {{added to the}} typewriter's existing mechanical linkages in place for print-action. When a key was depressed, up to 8 affiliated lift arms were [...] "caught" [...] on latching bails which in turn connected 8 coding switches to the recording head. A commutator, powered by the internal drive motor, would momentarily complete the power circuit through the coding switches to the recording head before advancing the tape to the next recording position. When not encoding, a resistor balance network kept the recording head in an erase mode unless a rewind operation was commanded. This ensured a clearly defined magnetic space between bit patterns. Additional circuits prevented opening of the tape loading door once a tape was loaded.|$|E
5000|$|Thunderstorms {{form when}} air parcels are lifted vertically. Deep, moist {{convection}} requires a parcel {{to be lifted}} to the LFC where it then rises spontaneously until reaching a layer of non-positive buoyancy. The atmosphere is warm at the surface {{and lower levels of}} the troposphere where there is mixing (the planetary boundary layer (PBL)), but becomes substantially cooler with height. The temperature profile of the atmosphere, the change in temperature, the degree that it cools with height, is the lapse rate. When the rising air parcel cools more slowly than the surrounding atmosphere, it remains warmer and less dense. The parcel continues to rise freely (convectively; without <b>mechanical</b> <b>lift)</b> through the atmosphere until it reaches an area of air less dense (warmer) than itself.|$|E
5000|$|CAPE is {{effectively}} positive buoyancy, expressed B+ or simply B; {{the opposite of}} convective inhibition (CIN), which is expressed as B-, and {{can be thought of}} as [...] "negative CAPE". As with CIN, CAPE is usually expressed in J/kg but may also be expressed as m2/s2, as the values are equivalent. In fact, CAPE is sometimes referred to as positive buoyant energy (PBE). This type of CAPE is the maximum energy available to an ascending parcel and to moist convection. When a layer of CIN is present, the layer must be eroded by surface heating or <b>mechanical</b> <b>lifting,</b> so that convective boundary layer parcels may reach their level of free convection (LFC).|$|R
