5|$|Fatboy begins {{running the}} car lot when Charlie leaves Walford. His {{friendship}} with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) grows {{and they have}} a one-night stand, but, feeling it is making their friendship weird, he rejects her afterwards despite her thinking she might have deeper feelings for him. Things between them are awkward, and when Donna's foster brother Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) finds out, he confronts Fatboy and locks him a cupboard. He returns the next day to find that Fatboy has not been discovered, and from how scared Fatboy is, realises something is wrong. Fatboy opens up about the fact his <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> to lock him up for extended periods of time, which led to him assuming the comedic persona of 'Fatboy'. Vincent convinces him to use his real name, Arthur, again, and gives him a job as DJ at his bar The Albert as long as he no longer puts on a false persona, starting with admitting to Donna that he will now be showing his true self to her. Over the coming weeks, Fatboy gets tangled in Vincent's vendetta against the Mitchell family and trying to kill Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Fatboy repeatedly tries to convince Vincent to stop, and interrupts Vincent when as he is about to throttle Phil. Fed up with his interference, Vincent threatens Fatboy with violence against Dot if he does not leave Walford forever. Fatboy tells Dot {{that he is going to}} see his father for Christmas, and shares a final dinner with her before saying goodbye. He confronts Vincent one last time, demanding that he stay away from Dot, and leaves Walford.|$|E
5|$|When Marge and the {{children}} arrive at El Chemistri, Homer unknowingly arrives at an illegal meth lab that he thinks is the actual restaurant. While the trio eat their meal (deconstructed Caesar salad) with other foodies, Marge feels guilty about misdirecting Homer. Meanwhile, Homer meets the meth dealer and other drug addicts, whom he believes to be food hipsters. Just as {{he is about to}} have a taste of the meth (which he thinks is food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy), the police burst in and a gunfight ensues between them and the drug addicts. At El Chemistri, Marge receives a panicked text message from Homer requesting help, and she asks the other foodies to help save her husband. They refuse, so she, Bart, and Lisa head by themselves towards the meth lab after receiving doggie bags from the chef who is angry that they are leaving. After arriving, Marge throws apple pie from her doggie bag into the mouth of the meth dealer. This causes a flashback inside his mind to his childhood days when his <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> to make apple pie. With the help of this distraction, the police subdue him. After Marge apologizes to Homer, they and their children decide to have fun together as a whole family from now on.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} cross-cultural differences in <b>mother?s</b> <b>use</b> of internal state language and behavior references {{and its effects}} on children?s emotion situation knowledge. Results indicated that, as hypothesized, European American mothers made more references to thoughts and emotions, while Chinese immigrant mothers focused more on behavior. <b>Mother?s</b> <b>use</b> of internal state language was found to predict children?s emotion understanding, however, behavioral references was negatively related. Finally, <b>mothers?</b> <b>use</b> of internal state language mediated the cultural differences in children?s emotion situation knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Conversational {{styles of}} mothers and their pre{{adolescent}} and middle adolescent daughters were examined and compared with the styles that <b>mothers</b> <b>use</b> with their friends. Middle-class Caucasian women (12 mothers of 8 - to 10 -year-olds; 12 mothers of 14 - to 16 -year-olds) participated in separate discussions with their daughters and adult friends. Rates of overlaps, simultaneous speech, and successful interruptions were coded. <b>Mothers</b> <b>used</b> different conversational styles when talking with the two partners. With friends, <b>mothers</b> <b>used</b> a high involvement style with high rates of overlaps and simultaneous speech. With daughters, <b>mothers</b> <b>used</b> a high considerateness style with low rates of overlaps and simultaneous speech, even though daughters used a high involvement style. Therefore, mothers and daughters experienced a 2 ̆ 2 clash 2 ̆ 2 in conversational styles...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Insulin analogues are {{commonly}} used in pregnant women with diabetes. It is not known if the use of insulin analogues in pregnancy is associated with any higher risk of congenital anomalies in the offspring compared with use of human insulin. METHODS: We performed a literature search for studies of pregnant women with pregestational diabetes using insulin analogues in the first trimester and information on congenital anomalies. The studies were analyzed to compare the congenital anomaly rate among fetuses of <b>mothers</b> <b>using</b> insulin analogues with fetuses of <b>mothers</b> <b>using</b> human insulin. RESULTS: Of 29 studies we included 1286 fetuses of <b>mothers</b> <b>using</b> short-acting insulin analogues with 1089 references of <b>mothers</b> <b>using</b> human insulin and 768 fetuses of <b>mothers</b> <b>using</b> long-acting insulin analogues with 685 references of <b>mothers</b> <b>using</b> long-acting human insulin (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn; NPH). The congenital anomaly rate was 4. 84 % and 4. 29 % among the fetuses of <b>mothers</b> <b>using</b> lispro and aspart. For glargine and detemir the congenital anomaly rate was 2. 86 % and 3. 47 % respectively. No studies {{on the use of}} insulin glulisine and degludec in pregnancy were found. There was no statistically significant difference in the congenital anomaly rate among fetuses exposed to insulin analogues (lispro, aspart, glargine or detemir) compared to those exposed to human insulin or NPH insulin. CONCLUSION: The total prevalence of congenital anomalies was not increased for fetuses exposed to insulin analogues. The small samples in the included studies provided insufficient statistical power to identify a moderate increased risk of specific congenital anomalies. This article is protected by copyright.

25|$|Dahl also {{features}} in his books characters {{who are very}} fat, usually children. Augustus Gloop, Bruce Bogtrotter and Bruno Jenkins {{are a few of}} these characters, although an enormous woman named Aunt Sponge is featured in James and the Giant Peach and the nasty farmer Boggis in Fantastic Mr Fox is an enormously fat character. All of these characters (with the possible exception of Bruce Bogtrotter) are either villains or simply unpleasant gluttons. They are usually punished for this: Augustus Gloop drinks from Willy Wonka's chocolate river, disregarding the adults who tell him not to, and falls in, getting sucked up a pipe and nearly being turned into fudge. In Matilda, Bruce Bogtrotter steals cake from the evil headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, and is forced to eat a gigantic chocolate cake in front of the school. Featured in The Witches, Bruno Jenkins is lured by the witches into their convention with the promise of chocolate, before they turn him into a mouse. Aunt Sponge is flattened by a giant peach. Dahl's <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> to tell him and his sisters tales about trolls and other mythical Norwegian creatures and some of his children's books contain references or elements inspired by these stories, such as the giants in The BFG, the fox family in Fantastic Mr Fox and the trolls in The Minpins.|$|E

500|$|His {{first job}} that {{involved}} ladders {{was given to}} him while he still worked as a joiner. [...] He was asked to point a garden wall and then the gable end of the customer's house. [...] He used several short ladders, lashed together with rope and hardboard. [...] This gave Dibnah valuable experience and his employer expanded the business to include property repairs. [...] Aged about 17–18 he climbed the [...] chimney at Barrow Bridge, for a 10shilling bet. During the night he took two Union flags {{to the top and}} secured each to the lightning conductors there. The Bolton Evening News reported the incident, with a photograph of Dibnah's feat, but attributed it to the activities of students from Manchester University. At about the same time, Dibnah decided to replace the chimney stack at his mother's house on Alfred Street with one of his own design, as his <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> only one fireplace—leaving four of the five chimney pots redundant. As the single opening {{at the top of the}} new stack was only about [...] wide, the flue needed regular maintenance. On one occasion, he was cleaning the flue using a sack of bricks tied to a rope when the sack ripped open, breaking several lead pipes and flooding his mother's kitchen. After the death of his mother, the house was sold and the council placed a preservation order on the chimney, which remains to this day.|$|E

In another source, Tricky was reported as saying Quaye had also been his mother's surname. According to Greg Kot, his mother's name provided the album its title while her suicide, along with his father abandoning him and Tricky's lack of moral sense as a youth, helped inform his [...] "unsentimental grasp on reality", which was reflected in Maxinquayes [...] "collision of beauty and violence".
