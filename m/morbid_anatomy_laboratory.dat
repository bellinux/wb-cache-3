40|$|Summary:. It is {{difficult}} to put forward a strategy {{for the treatment of}} nasal clefts due to the rarity and diversity of anatomical aberrations of these cases contrary to the common nasal affection in cleft lip and palate patients, which differ in severity rather than differing in the <b>morbid</b> <b>anatomy.</b> This simple strategy for correction of these nasal clefts will hopefully help surgeons to achieve better results. In the mean time I intended to describe the <b>morbid</b> <b>anatomy</b> of these cases by choosing examples of each <b>morbid</b> <b>anatomy...</b>|$|R
