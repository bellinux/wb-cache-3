Then I start working on the most basic thing— the look. It's very important that the physical appearance of the character gets decided because if I look the character, it <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more believable. Once that is achieved, I go into the finer nuances of what the girl is like, her background. And then from there [...] I have to get the accent right".|$|E

500|$|Mr. Nobody is a {{tale about}} choice. Nemo, a nine-year-old boy, has been thrust into a {{position}} where he must make an impossible decision – to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future) once solved <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more difficult – [...] "I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one." [...] The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality, is epitomized by the constant change in storyline, between young boy, adolescent, and mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalists view of the nature and existence of life in the universe. Each decision thus branching off creating an entirely separate alternative universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time. How actions have universal consequences, how the past inevitably shapes the future in a very impacting way – every single choice, no matter its simplicity or complexity can make, alter or change a lifetime.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Wirtualna Polska {{ranked the}} [...] "visionary" [...] Another World as the 15th best {{game for the}} Amiga, remembering it for a {{cinematic}} feel and [...] "uncommonly" [...] high difficulty (for a first-time player) and calling it [...] "one {{of the most important}} titles in the history of electronic entertainment." [...] In 2012, 1UP.com ranked this [...] "short-but-sweet cinematic action game" [...] as the 99th most essential video game of all time, commenting: [...] "Especially in an age of entertainment where fans cry out for pages upon pages lore and glossaries for the tiniest minutiae of their fiction, Out of this Worlds dimension contains a sense of mystery that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more lonely, and often, quietly beautiful. The game can be brutal and heartbreaking, but Chahi's amazing vision makes [...] a thoroughly gripping experience." [...] That same year, Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar named it as number one top [...] "cult-classic franchise" [...] that should be rebooted in a way Prince of Persia was, commenting that [...] "despite a small cast of characters, minimalist gameplay, and some truly grueling difficulty, Another World... resonated with gamers in ways they weren't expecting. The game's vivid vector graphics were utterly stunning at the time, and the pacing of the heavy, nicely animated platforming naturally melded with taking in the sights of the sublime alien landscape," [...] and adding that [...] "slowly adapting to the hostile surroundings offered a hard-earned satisfaction and a surprisingly moving story." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Man from Jupiter" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. In his A- review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{felt that the}} episode contained many great moments and {{felt that it was}} a strong opening for the season. VanDerWerff wrote: [...] "Archer has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every so often, the show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with these big action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump." [...] VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Malory Archer was the highlight of [...] "The Man from Jupiter"; [...] "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and not just his mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs—some of them sexual—he’s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. Archer isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> better when it does do so. The show usually nails those little moments, and this was no exception." [...] Creative Loafing journalist Scott Harrel asserted, [...] "If the debut episode is any indication, you can expect another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] further established greater expectations for the series.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{the return}} of Kat's father Charlie, Wallace said that this will provide a [...] "big boost" [...] to her character. Talking to We Love Telly, asked whether it's {{important}} for Kat to see Charlie again, Wallace replied: [...] "Yes, definitely.

Although they cleared the air before he left, things weren't right between them, so to have him back with her now <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more special.

2500|$|Shillong Golf Course: Shillong {{has one of}} {{the largest}} golf courses (the world's wettest) in Asia: Gleneagles of the East. It enjoys the rare {{distinction}} of being one of the few natural golf courses in Asia. Not only is the Shillong Golf Course scenic and enjoyable, it is also challenging. A group of British civil service officers introduced golf to Shillong in 1898 by constructing a nine-hole course. The present 18-hole course was inaugurated in 1924. The course is set in a valley covered with pine and rhododendron trees. The tight fairways, carpeted with a local grass which hardens the soil, are difficult to negotiate. The number of out-of-bounds streams that criss-cross every fairway <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more trying. Obstructions {{come in the form of}} bunkers, trees and rain. The longest hole is the 6th, which is a grueling 594 yards. Shillong Golf Course is considered to be the [...] "Glen Eagle of the East" [...] at the United States Golf Association Museum. It was set in a valley at an altitude of 5200ft in 1898 as a nine-hole course and later converted into an 18-hole course in 1924 by Captain Jackson and C. K. Rhodes.|$|E
