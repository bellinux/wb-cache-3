[...] Both Most and Mahaffey were so funny during the shooting of their sequence {{that she had to}} apologize for causing a portion to have to be reshot, telling them, [...] "I'm so sorry, the back of <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> were shaking because I was laughing so hard." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 21, 2011, Alice in Chains {{announced}} that {{they were working on}} a fifth studio album, and both Cantrell and Inez later made statements that they had begun the recording process. The album was expected to be finished by summer of 2012 and released by the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013. While Alice in Chains were writing for the album in 2011, Cantrell required surgery, which delayed recording the new material. In an interview published in May 2012, Cantrell explained, [...] "The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [...] cartilage issues in <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> I had the same issue in the other shoulder about six years ago so I've had them both done now. It's a repetitive motion injury from playing." ...|$|E

The Islamic Prophet Muhammad reportedly in Sahih Muslim had hair that [...] "hung over his shoulders and earlobes". Sahih Bukhari, regarded the most authentic of hadith, also supports this using {{a prime example of}} the prophet Isa (Jesus). The Prophet Muhammad has also described Jesus as [...] "having long hair reaching his ear lobes." [...] Malik's Muwatta 51.2.6 reported, Yahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said that Abu Qatada al-Ansari said to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, [...] "I have a lot of hair which comes down to <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> shall I comb it? The Messenger of Allah. may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, [...] "Yes, and honour it."

500|$|K. K. Senthil Kumar scouted for {{locations}} in Gujarat, looking for dry, open lands {{to shoot the}} chariot race sequence. They found salt lands with white sands in Dholavira. To shoot the sequence there, they wanted a light weight vehicle to follow the horses; they bought a Maruti van, removed the vehicle's top and mounted the camera along with a jimmy jib atop it. A part of the song Dheera Dheera was also shot there, requiring filmmakers to plant a dry tree {{and a couple of}} oxen for use in the song's backdrop. An item number featuring Kim Sharma and Ram Charan was shot in late June 2008 in a specially erected fisherman colony. It was set up {{on the first floor of}} Annapurna Studios and cost less than 3 million. Ravinder explained, [...] "The set should look like an outdoor location, but need to be constructed in an indoor floor. I constructed exteriors of around 28 houses in that floor with detailed interior plan for the house of Srihari. I also constructed a small boat and a big wheeled fish with thermocol.

500|$|Throughout all this, Gladstone was {{supported}} {{not only by}} the popular and charismatic Rosebery but also by an array of well-dressed women including Lady Rosebery and Gladstone's daughter Mary. These fashionable people– the celebrities of their day (newspapers at the time gave many column inches each day to the doings of the upper classes)– were as much a crowd-puller as the political speakers, and Rosebery's planning used that to full effect. One meeting was so packed that many were fainting: 70,000 people applied for tickets in a hall capable of holding 6,500. Lady Rosebery reported, [...] "I had never heard Archie (Lord Rosebery) speak in public politically before, but after the first minute I felt I could never be nervous at his making a speech the audience show him great affection." [...] However it was not just Gladstone and Rosebery the huge crowds had come to see, but also the dutifully supporting and smiling families. Lady Rosebery went on to describe how [...] "They (the crowds) patted me on the back till <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> were sensitive." [...] Thus in Rosebery's first serious involvement in politics, Disraeli was defeated and the newly elected MP for Midlothian became Prime Minister for the second time (the caretaker liberal leader Lord Hartington retired in favour of Gladstone). It was also obvious that Lady Rosebery was a very evident and valuable political electioneering asset. As the Marquess of Crewe put it [...] "she had cut her spurs." ...|$|E
500|$|Strindberg wooed Bosse {{by sending}} her books about {{theosophy}} and the occult, {{by attempting to}} mould her mind, and by furthering her career. Throwing himself into writing plays with central parts he considered suitable for her, he tried to persuade her to act them, and the Dramaten management to cast her in them. [...] Bosse asserts in her edition of the Letters that she tended to hang back, as did the management, being in agreement that she lacked the experience for major and complex roles. Strindberg, a power in the theatre, nevertheless often prevailed. The role of Eleonora in Easter (1901), which intimidated Bosse by its sensitivity and delicacy, but which she finally undertook to play, {{turned out to be}} Bosse's most successful and beloved role, and a turning-point in Bosse's and Strindberg's relationship. They became engaged in March 1901, during the rehearsals of Easter, in what in Bosse's narrative may be the best-known incident of the Strindberg legend. Bosse relates how she went to see Strindberg to ask him to give the part to a more experienced actress, but he assured her she would be perfect for it. [...] "Then he placed his hands on <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> looked at me long and ardently, and asked: 'Would you like to have a little child with me, Miss Bosse?' I made a curtsey and answered, as though hypnotized: 'Yes, thank you!'—and we were engaged." ...|$|E

I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E

[...] In a match against the Mountaineers in November, Horton scored his first T20 half-century, beating his previous best of 44. He set another personal best two months later in a match against Southern Rocks; Horton scored his maiden first-class double-century. The innings of 209 beat his previous highest score of 173.|$|E

In May 2012, Cantrell revealed that, prior to the recording sessions of The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, he had another surgery in 2011, this time in his right shoulder. He explained, [...] "The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [...] cartilage issues in <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> I had the same issue in the other shoulder {{about six years ago}} so I've had them both done now.

2500|$|After his death, Kharlamov's {{teammates}} with CSKA {{decided that}} no one at any level of the organization would wear Kharlamov's #17 sweater, until his son Alexander {{was old enough to}} wear it. Alexander wore #17 until he was a teenager, but later switched to #22, feeling that the expectations that went along with his father's sweater number were too great. When he found himself playing for Tikhonov with the Central Red Army club in 1992, the decision was taken away from him, and he was issued the #17 sweater. After initially being reluctant, Alexander said [...] "Now I am used to it. I felt an additional burden on <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> But now I don't feel anything like that." [...] The #17 is not worn by any member of the Russian national team at senior international competitions.
