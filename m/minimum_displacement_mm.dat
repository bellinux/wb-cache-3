40|$|Progressive {{addition}} lenses (PALs) are {{an increasingly}} preferred mode for the correction of presbyopia, gaining an increased {{share of the}} prescription lens market. Sales volumes are likely to increase {{over the next few}} years, given the increasing cohort of presbyopic patients in the population. This research investigated adaptation to PAL wear, investigating head movement parameters with and without progressive lenses in everyday visual tasks, and examined symptoms of spatial distortions and illusory movement in a crossover wearing trial of three PAL designs. <b>Minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> thresholds in the presence and absence of head movement were also investigated across the lens designs. Experiment 1 investigated head movements in two common visual tasks, a wordprocessing copy task, and a visual search task designed to replicate a natural environment task such as looking for products on supermarket shelving. Head movement parameters derived from this experiment were used to set head movement amplitude and velocity in the third experiment investigating <b>minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> thresholds across three PAL designs. Head movements were recorded with a Polhemus Inside Track head movement monitoring system which allows real time six degrees of freedom measurement of head position. Head position in azimuth, elevation and roll was extracted from the head movement recorder output, and data for head movement angular extent, average velocity (amplitude/duration) and peak velocity were calculated for horizontal head movements Results of the first experiment indicate a task dependent effect on head movement peak and average velocity, with both median head movement average and peak velocity being faster in the copy task. Visual task and visual processing demands were also shown to affect the slope of the main sequence of head movement velocity on head movement amplitude, with steeper slope in the copy task. A steeper slope, indicating a faster head movement velocity for a given head movement amplitude, was found for head movements during the copy task than in the search task. Processing demands within the copy task were also shown to affect the main sequence slopes of velocity on amplitude, with flatter slopes associated with the need for head movement to bring gaze to a specific point. These findings indicate selective control over head movement velocity in response to differing visual processing demands. In Experiment 2, parameters of head movement amplitude and velocity were assessed in a group of first time PAL wearers. Head movement amplitude, average and peak velocity were calculated from head movement recordings using the search task, as in Experiment 1. Head movements were recorded without PALs, on first wearing a PAL, and after one month of PAL wear to assess adaptation effects. In contrast to existing literature, PAL wear did not alter parameters of head movement amplitude and velocity in a group of first time wearers either on first wearing the lenses or after one month of wear: this is due to task related effects in this experiment compared to previous work. Task demand in this experiment may not have required wearers to use the progressive power corridor to accomplish identification of visual search targets, in contrast to previous studies where experimental conditions were designed to force subjects to use the progressive corridor. In Experiment 3, <b>minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> thresholds for random dot stimuli were measured in a repeated measures experimental design for a single vision lens as control, and three PAL designs. Thresholds were measured in central vision, and for two locations in the temporal peripheral field, 30 ° temporal fixation and 10 ° above and below the horizontal midline. Thresholds were determined with and without the subjects' head moving horizontally in an approximate sinusoidal movement at a frequency of about 0. 7 Hz. <b>Minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> thresholds were not significantly affected by PAL design, although thresholds with PALs were higher than with a single vision lens control. Head movement significantly increased <b>minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> threshold across lens designs, by a factor of approximately 1. 5 times. Results indicate that the local measures of <b>minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> threshold determined in this experiment are not sensitive to lens design differences. Sensitivity to motion with PAL lenses may be more a global than a localized response. For Experiment 4, symptoms of spatial distortion and illusory movement were investigated in a crossover wearing trial of three PAL designs, and related to optical characteristics of the lenses. Peripheral back vertex powers of the PALs were measured at two locations in the right temporal zone of the lenses, 15. 6 mm temporal to the fitting cross, and 2. 7 m above and below the horizontal to the fitting cross. These locations corresponded to the zones of the lenses through which <b>minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> thresholds were measured in the previous experiment. The effect of subjects' self movement on symptoms is able to discriminate between PAL designs, although subjective symptoms alone were not related to the lens design parameters studied. Subjects' preference for one PAL design over the other designs studied in this experiment is inversely related to the effect on subject movement on their symptoms of distortion. An optical parameter, blur strength, derived from the power vector components of the peripheral powers, may indicate preference for particular PAL designs, as higher blur strength values are associated with lower lens preference scores. Head movement amplitude and velocity are task specific, and are also influenced by visual processing demands within tasks. PALs do not affect head movement amplitude and velocity unless tasks are made demanding or performed in less natural situations designed to influence head movement behaviour. Both head movement and PALs have large effects on <b>minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> thresholds; these effects may be due in part to complexity of the subjects' task within the experiment. <b>Minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> thresholds however were not influenced by PAL design. The most sensitive indicator for subject's preference of PALs was the effect of subjects' self movement on their perception of symptoms, rather than the presence of actual symptoms. Blur strength should be further investigated for its role in PAL acceptance...|$|R

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to {{identify}} key marine areas for conservation, particularly in the high seas. A range of techniques have been applied to tracking data from higher predators, particularly seabirds and pinnipeds, to determine the areas of greatest use. This study compared three commonly used methods—kernel, first-passage time and state-space modelling—and a new approach, <b>minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> rate, {{for the analysis of}} data from the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans of Bird Island, South Georgia, tracked during the chick-rearing period. Applied to a single track, these four models identified similar marine areas as important. The greatest similarity in areas identified occurred when model assumptions were shared (such as slow speed indicating spatial preference) even when methods modelled these assumptions differently (e. g. Bayesian inference versus cumulative density surface). A gridded overlap approach applied to all tracks revealed core areas not apparent from results of any single analysis. The gridded approach also revealed spatial overlap between methods based on different assumptions (e. g. <b>minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> rate and kernel analysis) and between individuals. Although areas identified as important by kernel and first-passage time analysis of a single track were biased towards resting locations during darkness, this does not negate the requirement for their protection. Using the gridded overlap approach, two distinct core regions were identified for the wandering albatross; one close to the breeding colony and another 800 km to the North–West in the high seas. This convenient and pragmatic approach could be applied to large data sets and across species for the identification of a network of candidate marine protected areas in coastal and pelagic waters...|$|R

40|$|Detailed mapping in {{the central}} Indio Mountains in west Texas, reveal a complex {{stacking}} of thrust sheets that record inversion of the Mesozoic Chihuahua Trough rift basin. Important newly recognized structural complexities include both folding of older thrust sheets and development of younger, out-of-sequence thrusts that cut across older folds; detachment fold horizons within thrust sheets; and a regional anticlinorium that exposes the Squaw thrust in a structural half-window bounded on the west by the Neogene Indio normal fault. The Chihuahua trough originated {{as part of the}} late Mesozoic border rift system and was inverted during Laramide thrusting. Remnants of Mesozoic rifting are preserved in Cretaceous strata as facies and stratigraphic thickness variations between different thrust sheets. Statigraphic thickness variations are particularly prominent in the Yucca Formation. A well exposed transgression divides the upper yucca into a fluvial lower interval and a coastal upper interval. The Upper Yucca is 650 m thick in the hanging wall of the Squaw thrust and 280 m in the structurally lowest footwall of the thrust system. Reported klippe-fenster relationships indicate a <b>minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> of 7 - 10 km for the structurally highest thrust (Squaw thrust). However, after evaluating the newly identified duplex and incorporating a lower decollement, balanced cross-section reconstructions give a new <b>minimum</b> <b>displacement</b> of 17. 3 km. Section reconstruction also indicates that a cryptic basin margin normal fault is carried in the hanging wall of the Squaw Peak thrust to account for both stratigraphic variations and hanging-wall cutoff relationships. Similarities between the structures and models of the Atlas Mountains to those presented in this study suggest the Atlas Mountains and its continuous deformation could be a modern analog for the Indio Mountains. ...|$|R
