25|$|After {{the success}} of One Life to Live, a series Nixon created in 1968, ABC asked her to create another soap opera for them. She used the story bible for All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> <b>to</b> create the new program. The Erica {{character}} officially debuted in 1970 once All My Children made it onto the air.|$|E
25|$|On July 7, 2011, ABC {{announced}} that it had licensed the rights to One Life to Live and All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> <b>to</b> television, film and music production company Prospect Park, allowing both series to continue producing new first-run episodes beyond the conclusion of their television runs on ABC, with the series moving to a new Hulu-style online channel currently in development by Prospect Park; {{as a result of}} the company's acquisition of the two soap operas, One Life to Live and All My Children, would become the first soap operas to transition their first-run broadcasts from traditional television to internet television.|$|E
25|$|On August 4, 2009, it was {{announced}} that One Life to Live, which taped in New York City, would move from ABC Studio 17 at 56 West 66th Street to Studio 23 at 320 West 66th Street, Manhattan in early 2010. This studio was made available by the move of sister serial All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> <b>to</b> a production facility in Los Angeles, where that series began taping on January 4, 2010. The new studio was 30% larger than One Life to Live previous one, and both One Life to Live and All My Children were to be taped and broadcast in high-definition (HD) after their moves.|$|E

25|$|The first exotic {{location}} shoot {{was made}} by All <b>My</b> <b>Children,</b> <b>to</b> St. Croix in 1978. Many other soap operas planned lavish storylines after {{the success of the}} All My Children shoot. Soap operas Another World and Guiding Light both went to St. Croix in 1980, the former show culminating a long-running storyline between popular characters Mac, Rachel and Janice, and the latter to serve as an exotic setting for Alan Spaulding and Rita Bauer's torrid affair. Search for Tomorrow taped for two weeks in Hong Kong in 1981. Later that year, some of the cast and crew ventured to Jamaica to tape a love consummation storyline between the characters of Garth and Kathy.|$|E
25|$|Former All My Children {{writer and}} {{producer}} Ginger Smith returned {{as the new}} executive producer and creator Agnes Nixon served as consultant. The new episodes were 30 minutes long and aired on Hulu, Hulu Plus, and iTunes. Initially, 220 episodes of the show were ordered. The production company planned to shop the reboot to cable distributors beginning September 2013. The show schedule was {{four days a week}} (Monday-Thursday) with a Friday recap show, MORE All <b>My</b> <b>Children,</b> <b>to</b> feature behind the scenes footage as well as interviews with the cast and to be hosted by Leslie Miller. The revival show began on April 29, 2013, and production began on February 25, 2013, in Connecticut, with All My Children and One Life to Live taping in five-week rotations for 17 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Prospect Park {{initially}} {{intended for}} All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> <b>to</b> begin its {{run on the}} internet on September 26, 2011, but ran into challenges. One challenge cited in was a need to negotiate a new contract with the union representing the actors of All My Children. On September 27, 2011, Prospect Park announced that All My Children along with its sister soap One Life to Live would be relaunched in January 2012 on the company's new internet channel, The Online Network. But on November 10, 2011, several sources reported that Prospect Park had indefinitely suspended its plans to relaunch All My Children and that the company would concentrate solely on the higher-rated One Life to Live. Reasons given for this decision were lack of funding coupled with Prospect Park {{not being able to}} sign enough cast members from All My Children.|$|E

25|$|On April 14, 2011, it was {{announced}} that ABC canceled All My Children after 41 years on the air due to low ratings. On July 7, 2011, ABC sold the licensing rights of All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> <b>to</b> third-party production company Prospect Park with the show set to continue on the internet as a series of webisodes. The show taped its final scenes for ABC on August 30, 2011, and its final episode on the network aired on September 23, 2011, with a cliffhanger. On September 26, 2011, the following Monday, ABC replaced All My Children with a newly debuted talk show The Chew. Prospect Park had suspended its plan to revive the series on November 23, 2011, due to lack of funding and unsuccessful negotiation with the union organizations representing the actors and crews. On January 7, 2013, Prospect Park officially brought back its project to restore All My Children as a web series. The show taped its first scenes for Prospect Park TOLN on February 18, 2013, and its first episode on the network aired on April 29, 2013. However, the new series faced several behind-the-scene obstacles throughout its run. On November 11, 2013, several All My Children cast members announced that Prospect Park had closed production and canceled the series again. ABC regained the rights to All My Children in December 2016.|$|E
500|$|After Beebo Brinker, Bannon {{said the}} energy {{to write about the}} {{characters}} left her, but she got so good at her [...] "obsessive fantasies" [...] that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. [...] "I realize now that I was in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for <b>my</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University. She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.|$|E

He had expected {{to be buried in}} St Mary's churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton. The funeral was held on Wednesday 26 April and was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.|$|E

6000|$|Let us lead forth, by all means. But let us {{not have}} mental {{knowledge}} before us as {{the goal of the}} leading. Much less let us make of it a vicious circle in which we lead the unhappy child-mind, like a cow in a ring at a fair. We don't want <b>to</b> educate <b>children</b> so that they may understand. Understanding is a fallacy and a vice in most people. I don't even want <b>my</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> know, much less to understand. I don't want <b>my</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> know that five fives are twenty-five, any more than I want <b>my</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> wear <b>my</b> hat or my boots. I don't want <b>my</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> know. If he wants five fives let him count them on his fingers. As for his little mind, give it a rest, and let his dynamic self be alert. He will ask [...] "why" [...] often enough. But he more often asks why the sun shines, or why men have mustaches, or why grass is green, than anything sensible. Most of a child's questions are, and should be, unanswerable. They are not questions at all. They are exclamations of wonder, they are remarks half-sceptically addressed. When a child says, [...] "Why is grass green?" [...] he half implies. [...] "Is it really green, or is it just taking me in?" [...] And we solemnly begin to prate about chlorophyll. Oh, imbeciles, idiots, inexcusable owls! ...|$|R

Toby Goldstein of The Orlando Sentinel stated that Victor {{is one of the}} characters contributing to the soap opera's longtime popularity. Shelley Fralic of the Winnipeg Free Press named Braeden along with Susan Lucci (who portrayed Erica Kane on All <b>My</b> <b>Children)</b> <b>to</b> be the soap opera genre's biggest icons. Fralic stated that he is the [...] "eye of the Genoa City hurricane" [...] and that [...] "the thought of Y without Victor Newman – his character is recovering from a heart transplant and was going to [...] "disappear" [...] to Belgium for rehabilitation – is hard to imagine, rather like Dallas without J.R. Ewing, or The Sopranos without Tony." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, André 3000 and Big Boi {{abandon the}} [...] "hard-partying playa characters" [...] of their debut album {{in favor of}} more spacey, funky, and futuristic personas on ATLiens. [...] With their lyrics, the duo hoped to reflect on {{maturity}} {{in the wake of the}} birth of Big Boi's daughter.

I want <b>my</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> say, 'Daddy really said something, he wasn't just trying to brag on himself.'" [...] Many songs on ATLiens feature more unconventional subject matter for hip hop. [...] The lyrical content ranges from addressing urban life as hustlers and pimps to extraterrestrial life and space travel. The title track's chorus expresses Southern pride, while its verses feature André 3000 explaining his newly adopted drug-free lifestyle.|$|E

Their son, Joe, was born later that year. The family divided their time in New York with frequent visits to their estate at Cotswolds in England, and describing her family routine in 2009, she said, [...] "we go to the park, kick a ball around, go to a museum, watch a movie together or just hang out at home playing Monopoly". Amidst intense media speculation of an affair between Mendes and the actress Rebecca Hall, the couple announced their separation in 2010 and were divorced a year later. Winslet admitted to being heartbroken by the split, but remarked that [...] "there's no way I'm going to allow <b>my</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> be fucked up because my marriages haven't worked out".|$|E
