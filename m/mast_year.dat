In this study, we use long stand-level records of annual seed production, radial growth (tree ring width) and meteorological conditions to analyse {{the relative importance of}} summer drought and reproductive effort in controlling the growth of Fagus sylvatica L., a typical masting species. We show that both summer drought and reproductive effort (masting) influenced growth. Importantly, the effects of summer drought and masting were interactive, with the greatest reductions in growth found in years when high reproductive effort (i. e., <b>mast</b> <b>years)</b> coincided with summer drought. Conversely, <b>mast</b> <b>years</b> that coincided with non-drought summers were associated with little reduction in radial growth, as were drought years that did not coincide with <b>mast</b> <b>years.</b> The results show that the strength of an inferred trade-off between growth and reproduction in this species (the cost of reproduction) is dependent on environmental stress, with a stronger trade-off in years with more stressful growing conditions.

40|$|Mast seeding is a {{reproductive}} {{strategy in}} some perennial plants defined as synchronous production of large seed crops at irregular intervals. One widely accepted theory {{to explain this}} behaviour is the predator satiation hypothesis, which states that the synchronous and variable production of seeds within a population will maximize the probability of seed survival through satiation of seed predators. Although some short-term studies have documented the influence of variable and synchronized production of seeds on herbivore attack rate during one or few <b>mast</b> <b>years,</b> long-term data including multiple <b>mast</b> seeding <b>years</b> and patterns of cone production and herbivore attack on individual trees are needed to assess (i) how cone production, variability and synchrony affect individual plant fitness and (ii) the functional responses of seed predators to mast seeding events. We tested these objectives, collecting long-term (29 years) data on female seed cone production and rates of seed predator attack from 217 individual contiguous trees within a Pinus ponderosa population. Our results support the predator satiation hypothesis. First, we found high interannual synchrony and variability in seed cone production and a type II functional response of seed predators to available cones. Secondly, years with high cone production (<b>mast</b> <b>years)</b> had markedly lower rates of seed predator attack than years of low production (i. e. a population-level satiation effect). Thirdly, within <b>mast</b> <b>years,</b> individuals with high cone production had markedly lower rates of attack than individuals with low cone production (i. e. an individual-level satiation effect). Finally, individual trees with greater synchrony and more variable cone production suffered lower rates of attack. Synthesis: Our long-term data on individual trees lend strong support to the hypothesis that mast seeding in Pinus ponderosa has evolved in response to natural selection from insect seed predators. Pinus ponderosa escapes its seed predators in time by reproducing at irregular intervals (<b>masting).</b> In <b>years</b> when many cones are available, trees suffer markedly lower rates of seed predator attack than years of low production: white dots = non-mast years, grey dots = intermediate years, black dots = <b>mast</b> <b>years.</b> These data provide evidence that mast seeding in this species evolved in response to natural selection from insect seed predators. © 2014 British Ecological Society.

50|$|American red {{squirrels}} {{are primarily}} granivores, but incorporate other food items into their diets opportunistically. In Yukon, extensive behavioral observations suggest white spruce seeds (Picea glauca) comprise over 50% {{of a red}} squirrel's diet, but squirrels have also been observed eating spruce buds and needles, mushrooms, willow (Salix sp.) leaves, poplar (Populus sp.) buds and catkins, bearberry (Arctostaphylos sp.) flowers and berries, and animal material such as bird eggs or even snowshoe hare leverets (young). White spruce cones mature in late July and are harvested by red squirrels in August and September. These harvested cones are stored in a central cache and provide energy and nutrients for survival over the winter and reproduction the following spring. The fallen scales from consumed seed cones can collect in piles, called middens, more than a meter across. White spruce exhibits two- to six-year masting cycles, where a year of superabundant cone production (<b>mast</b> <b>year)</b> is followed by several years in which few cones are produced. American red squirrel territories may contain one or several middens.|$|E
50|$|The fruit {{production}} tends to occur irregularly with some years producing larger crops than others (see <b>mast</b> <b>year).</b> Fruiting may begin when {{the tree is}} 4-6 years old, however large crops take 20 years. Total lifespan of J. nigra is about 130 years. Black walnut does not leaf out until late spring when the soil has warmed and all frost danger is past. Like other trees of the order Fagales, such as oaks, hickories, chestnuts, and birches, it is monoecious, with wind-pollinated catkins. Male and female flowers are in separate spikes, and the female flowers typically appear before the male on a single tree (dichogamy). As a consequence, self-pollination is unlikely. However, individual trees usually are not self-sterile; {{if they are not}} pollinated by neighboring trees, they may set self-fertilized seeds. For maximum seed germination, the seeds should be cold-moist stratified for 3-4 months, although the exact time depends on the seed source. The seedlings emerge in April or May and typically grow 90 cm their first year and even more in the 2nd year. Black walnut often loses its leaves earlier than other deciduous trees growing in the same area after having a growing period of 115-135 days.|$|E
50|$|Spatially {{explicit}} {{population dynamics}} models {{were used by}} Bertolini et al. 2008 to predict {{the spread of the}} grey squirrel populations present in Italy in 1996: the Piedmont, Genoa, and Ticino populations. The models examined potential corridors that would allow grey squirrels to invade France and Switzerland and the time scale of such invasions. In a scenario based on a random pattern of good, poor, and <b>mast</b> <b>year</b> seed crops (vegetation produces significant abundance of food resources), in the “best case” scenario, grey squirrels will reach the Western Alps between 2026 and 2036, France between 2066 and 2071, and Switzerland between 2051 and 2066. In a scenario where poor year seed crops were not included, the “worst case” scenario, grey squirrels will reach the Western Alps by 2015, France by 2026, and Switzerland between 2031 and 2041. Along the border between France and Italy, the forest cover is mainly composed of mixed broadleaf trees; this represents a likely corridor to France for the grey squirrel. Mixed deciduous woodland lines the Ticino river; this area connects with contiguous hardwood on the side of Lake Maggiore in Switzerland, making the area along the Ticino river a likely corridor for the grey squirrel to invade Switzerland. The upper portion of the Alps is covered largely by coniferous forest. Grey squirrels, which are heavier than native red squirrels, have a higher energy requirement than red squirrels. It may be difficult for the grey squirrels to attain their higher energy requirement in this environment because they may have difficulty reaching the small seeds contained in the conifers’ cones; for this reason, grey squirrel performance in this habitat will affect the spread of the species. Eventually, if populations are left unchecked, the grey squirrel will spread through a large portion of continental Europe and Eurasia, potentially invading the entire global distribution of the red squirrel.|$|E

40|$|How {{different}} functional {{responses of}} consumers exploiting pulsed resources affect community dynamics {{is an ongoing}} question in ecology. Tree masting is a common resource pulse in terrestrial ecosystems that can drive rodent population cycles. Using stable isotope (d 13 C, d 15 N) analyses, we investigated the dietary response of two fluctuating rodent species, the yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis and the bank vole Myodes glareolus, to mast events in Białowiez_a Forest (NE Poland). Rodent hair samples were obtained non-invasively from faeces of their predators for an 11 -year period that encompassed two mast events. Spectacular seed crops of deciduous trees, namely oak Quercus robur and hornbeam Carpinus betulus, occur after several intermediate years of moderate seed production, with a post-mast year characterised by a nil crop. While a Bayesian isotopic (SIAR) mixing model showed a variety of potential vegetation inputs to rodent diets, the isotopic niche of the yellow-necked mouse was strongly associated with mast of deciduous trees (. 80 % of diet), showing no variation among years of different seed crop. However, bank voles showed a strong functional response; in <b>mast</b> <b>years</b> the vole shifted its diet from herbs in deciduous forest (, 66 % of diet) to mast (, 74 %).

40|$|To {{elucidate}} broad-scale environmental {{controls of}} coniferous forest reproduction in the Sierra Nevada, California, we monitored reproduction for 5 years in 47 plots arrayed across a steep elevational (climatic) gradient. We {{found that both}} absolute seedling densities (stems < 1. 37 m) and seedling densities relative to overstory parent tree basal area declined sharply with elevation. Rates of seedling turnover (the average of birth and death rates) also declined with elevation. In contrast, seed production was not predicted by elevation and was highly variable from year to year. During a <b>mast</b> <b>year</b> of seed production, the intensity of masting was uneven among plots. Seedling densities were elevated only during the single year immediately following the <b>mast</b> <b>year,</b> suggesting reproduction in our forests may be primarily limited by abiotic {{factors such as the}} availability of suitable sites and weather. Disturbance also clearly affected reproduction; plots that had recently burned had significantly higher seedling to parent tree ratios for Abies species, suggesting that even though established Abies concolor may be relatively susceptible to fire, the species can recover rapidly through prolific reproduction. Since reproductive failures may be our earliest signal of changing forest conditions, seedling dynamics could provide a sensitive, if variable, indicator of environmental changes. # 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Synchronous {{production}} of large seed crops, or mast years (MYs), {{is a common}} feature of many Fagus species, which is {{closely linked to the}} dynamics of forest ecosystems, including regeneration of canopy trees and changes in animal population densities. To better understand its climatic controls and check for the presence of long-term temporal trends in MY frequencies, we reconstructed MY record of the European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) for the southern Swedish province of Halland over 1753 - 2006. We used superimposed epoch analysis (SEA) to relate MY (a) to summer temperature fields over the European subcontinent and (b) to the patterns of 500 mb geopotential heights over the 35 - 75 degrees N. For the MY reconstruction, we used newly developed regional beech ring-width chronology (1753 - 2006), an available summer temperature reconstruction, and a discontinuous historical MY record. A Monte Carlo experiment allowed identification of the thresholds in both growth and summer temperature anomalies, indicative of historical MYs, which were verified by dividing data into temporally independent calibration and verification sub-periods. MYs were strongly associated with both the 500 mb height anomalies and average summer temperatures during two years preceding a MY: a <b>mast</b> <b>year</b> (t) followed a cold summer two years (t- 2) prior to the <b>mast</b> <b>year</b> and a warm summer one year prior (t- 1) to the <b>mast</b> <b>year.</b> During t- 2 years, the geographical pattern of 500 mb height anomalies exhibited a strong height depression in the region centered in the Northern Sea and extending toward eastern North America and statistically significant (p< 0. 05) temperature anomalies covering predominantly southern Scandinavia (area below 60 N) and British Isles. A year immediately preceding a <b>mast</b> <b>year</b> (t- 1) was characterized by a strong regional high pressure anomaly centered in southern Scandinavia with significant temperature anomalies extended mostly over southern Scandinavia and Germany. The long-term mean MY return interval was 6. 3 years, with 50 and 90 % probabilities of MY occurrence corresponding to 6 and 15 years, respectively. Periods with intervals significantly shorter than the long-term mean were observed around 1820 - 1860 and 1990 - 2006 (means 3. 9 and 3. 2 years, respectively). However, the difference in return intervals between two sub-periods themselves was not significant. Geographically large and temporally rapid changes in atmospheric circulation among years, responsible for summer temperature conditions in the Northern Europe, are likely primary environmental drivers of masting phenomenon. However, decadal and centurial variability in MY intervals is difficult to relate directly to temperature variability, suggesting the presence of conditions "canceling" would-be MYs. Long-term MY reconstruction demonstrates high variability of reproductive behavior in European beech and indicates that a period with shorter MY intervals at the end of 20 th may be not unique in a multi-century perspective...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Masting, i. e. {{synchronous}} {{but highly}} variable interannual seed production, {{is a strong}} sink for carbon and nutrients. It may, therefore, compete with vegetative growth. It is currently unknown whether increased atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will affect the carbon balance (or that of other nutrients) between reproduction and vegetative growth of forest species. In this study, reproduction and vegetative growth of shoots of mature beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees grown at ambient and elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations were quantified. It was hypothesized that within a shoot, fruiting has {{a negative effect on}} vegetative growth, and that this effect is ameliorated at increased CO 2 concentrations. Methods Reproduction and its competition with leaf and shoot production were examined during two masting events (in 2007 and 2009) in F. sylvatica trees that had been exposed to either ambient or elevated CO 2 concentrations (530 ¬µmol mol?àí 1) for eight consecutive years, between 2000 and 2008. Key Results The number of leaves per shoot and the length of terminal shoots was smaller or shorter in the two <b>masting</b> <b>years</b> compared with the one non-masting year (2008) investigated, but they were unaffected by elevated CO 2 concentrations. The dry mass of terminal shoots was approx. 2 -fold lower in the <b>masting</b> <b>year</b> (2007) than in the non-masting year in trees growing at ambient CO 2 concentrations, but this decline was not observed in trees exposed to elevated CO 2 concentrations. In both the CO 2 treatments, fruiting significantly decreased nitrogen concentration by 25 % in leaves and xylem tissue of 1 - to 3 -year-old branches in 2009. Conclusions Our findings indicate that there is competition for resources between reproduction and shoot growth. Elevated CO 2 concentrations reduced this competition, indicating effects on the balance of resource allocation between reproduction and vegetative growth in shoots with rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations...|$|R

A total of ca. 13 000 hm 2 of plantations are dominated by this species in this region. Our objective was to assess (a) potential for natural regeneration and (b) critical factors limiting regeneration of this tree species in spruce plantations. Methods We conducted field studies on the seed rain, soil seed bank dynamics and seedling establishment in a 65 -year spruce plantation in Miyaluo subalpine coniferous forest of western Sichuan, China from 2002 to 2008. We used seed traps, sieved to determine the soil seed bank, and recorded seedlings. Important findings Pinus asperata seed rain commonly lasted from early October to the end of January or early February. There was a large annual variation in seed production, with <b>mast</b> <b>years</b> at 4 -year intervals. We concluded that seed availability was not a limiting factor for natural regeneration, at least in <b>mast</b> <b>years.</b> The seed bank was transient, with losses from seed decay and seed predation being the two most important factors affecting seed bank dynamics. Only a small fraction of seeds germinated and produced seedlings, e. g., 3. 6 % in 2002. Higher seedling mortality greatly reduced the total number of germinated seedlings, and few seedlings survived after one growing season. Deep litter and moss were the most common substrates for P. asperata regeneration, having 93 % of all germinated seedlings. Most surviving seedlings occurred with a substrate depth of 0 – 2 cm, and seedling mortality increased with greater depth, suggesting substrate depth is an important constraint on natural regeneration. Seedlings on moss substrate had greater root collar diameter, number of green shoots, estimated dry weight and annual dry weight increment but less height than those on litter substrate. In conclusion, despite a substantial seed production, high depletion of soil seed, low germination and high seedling mortality limit natural regeneration of P. asperata...|$|R

40|$|We {{model and}} compare the {{biological}} and financial constraints of four prescriptions that serve as alternatives to conventional clearcutting followed by planting in eastern and western boreal mixedwood stands. These alternative prescriptions for full or partial conifer stocking are (1) reliance on advance regeneration with or without augmentation by fill-planting; (2) understory scarification during a mast year; (3) direct seeding either aerially or with a scarifier-seeder; and (4) underplanting. Our main conclusions concerning the biological constraints are that (1) advance regeneration, mainly of balsam fir {{in the east and}} white spruce in the west, requires > 26 000 and > 4000 trees/ha (because of different distributions), respectively, to achieve full conifer stocking; (2) reliance on a <b>mast</b> <b>year</b> requires at least 6 m 2 /ha of mature conifer basal area, but much less if some advance regeneration is present or only moderate stocking is desired; (3) aerial seeding with 35 % scarification requires about a half-million seeds/ha to achieve full conifer stocking, while a scarifier-seeder would require only a third of this application rate; and (4) underplanting is constrained to aspen stands with > 25 % incident light at planting height. In all cases, alternative prescriptions become more feasible if only moderate or minimal stocking is the silvicultural objective. A costing exercise for the four prescriptions in comparison with a clearcut followed by planting shows that reliance on advance regeneration or understory planting are the cheapest alternatives to achieve full or partial conifer stocking. With the exception of full conifer stocking in situations where there is little advance regeneration (and where herbicides can be used), conventional plantations are never the cheapest approach. In such cases, fill planting and use of a scarifier-seeder become viable options. Aerial seeding and reliance on a <b>mast</b> <b>year</b> are the most expensive of the alternatives. We conclude, tentatively, that there is enough conifer basal area in most of the eastern boreal mixedwood of Canada to allow for the use of either or both a <b>mast</b> <b>year</b> and advance regeneration to achieve full or partial conifer stocking. By contrast, in the west conifer basal area will seldom be sufficient for natural seeding, and the density of advance regeneration is likewise often too low.

Since then, more samples from Craigieburn Forest Park and from the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, have been collected, and a method of determining the actual ages of adult stoats has been developed. The extended samples are here examined for a relationship between infestation and age, which could not previously be tested. Prevalence generally increases with age, significantly so at Craigieburn. Stoats which had lived through one or more beech (Nothofagus solandri) <b>mast</b> <b>years</b> at Craigieburn {{were significantly more likely}} to be infested, when the effects of age were allowed for. The hypothesis is advanced that the paratenic host for S. nasicola in New Zealand is the feral house mouse, Mus musculus, which is more numerous after a heavy beech seed fall...|$|R
