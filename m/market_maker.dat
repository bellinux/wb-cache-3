40|$|We {{present a}} model of <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> subject to recent banking regulations: {{liquidity}} and capital constraints {{in the style of}} Basel III and a position limit {{in the style of the}} Volcker Rule. Regulation causes <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> to reduce their intermediation by refusing principal positions. However, it can improve the bid-ask spread because it induces new <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> to enter. Since <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> intermediate less, asset prices exhibit a liquidity premium. Costs of regulation can be assessed by measuring principal positions and asset prices but not by measuring bid-ask spreads...|$|R

25|$|Online brokers in the US {{are often}} {{referred}} to as discount brokers but in Europe and Asia many so-called online brokers work with high-net-worth individuals. Their popularity is attributable to the speed and ease of their online order entry, and to fees and commissions significantly lower than those of full service brokerage firms within the US. Two types of online brokerages have emerged in the US in the mid-2000s: those offering direct-access trading on exchanges, and those that route orders to <b>market</b> <b>maker</b> firms to have their orders filled.|$|E

Four key qualities for automated <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> {{have appeared in}} the artificial intelligence literature: (1) bounded loss, (2) the ability to make a profit, (3) a vanishing bid/ask spread, and (4) unlimited market depth. Intriguingly, <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> that satisfy any three of these desiderata {{have appeared in the}} literature. However, it is an open question as to whether there exist <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> which can simultaneously satisfy all four of these properties; the issue is not simple to resolve because several of the qualities are oppositional, particularly in tandem. In this paper, we answer the open question in the affirmative by constructing <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> that satisfy all four qualities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTrading in FX {{markets is}} {{dominated}} by two microstructures: exchanges with <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> and OTC-markets without <b>market</b> <b>makers.</b> Using laboratory experiments we test whether {{the impact of a}} Tobin tax is different in these two market microstructures. We find that (i) in <b>markets</b> without <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> an unilaterally imposed Tobin tax (i. e. a tax haven exists) increases volatility. (ii) In contrast, in <b>markets</b> with <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> we observe a decrease in volatility in unilaterally taxed markets.

Specifically, the paper discusses three types of strategy constraints on the <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> and their implications for the equilibria.

25|$|There is no unified or {{centrally}} cleared {{market for}} the majority of trades, and there is very little cross-border regulation. Due to the over-the-counter (OTC) nature of currency markets, there are rather a number of interconnected marketplaces, where different currencies instruments are traded. This implies {{that there is not a}} single exchange rate but rather a number of different rates (prices), depending on what bank or <b>market</b> <b>maker</b> is trading, and where it is. In practice, the rates are quite close due to arbitrage. Due to London's dominance in the market, a particular currency's quoted price is usually the London market price. Major trading exchanges include Electronic Broking Services (EBS) and Thomson Reuters Dealing, while major banks also offer trading systems. A joint venture of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, called Fxmarketspace opened in 2007 and aspired but failed to the role of a central market clearing mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Other U.S. exchanges, most {{prominently}} the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, employ several competing official <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> in a security. These <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> {{are required to}} maintain two-sided markets during exchange hours and are obligated {{to buy and sell}} at their displayed bids and offers. They typically do not receive the trading advantages a specialist does, but they do get some, such as the ability to naked short a stock, i.e., selling it without borrowing it. In most situations, only official <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> are permitted to engage in naked shorting. Recent changes to the rules have explicitly banned naked shorting by options <b>market</b> <b>makers.</b>|$|R
40|$|We use the NASDAQ {{market making}} context {{to study the}} role of {{geographic}} proximity in the price discovery of a firm's stock. We show that <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> closer to the firm's headquarters spend more time at the inside bid and ask quotes, initiate larger changes in the quotes, and account for greater information share when compared to non-local <b>market</b> <b>makers.</b> Examining a sample of relocating firms, we also find that <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> moving {{farther away from the}} firm after relocation experience a reduction in their contributions to price discovery. Our results suggest that some (local) <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> possess superior information relative to other (non-local) <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> and they trade strategically on this information, a finding that challenges the traditional assumptions in market microstructure theory.

[...] To bolster its trading initiative, in 1992, SBC acquired O'Connor & Associates, a Chicago-based options trading firm, with an expertise in [...] financial derivatives. [...] O'Connor was founded in 1977 by mathematician Michael Greenbaum and was named for Edmund (Ed) and Williams (Bill) O'Connor. [...] The O'Connor brothers had made a fortune trading grain on the Chicago Board of Trade and founded a First Options, a clearing house business.

Firms with active participation of local dealers enjoy lower quoted and effective spreads, as well as more informative prices. The beneficial effects from local <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> are not confined to a few "top" local dealers and they cannot be attributed to their participation in the firm's IPO syndicate or industry specialization. Further, we find that days with aggressive bidding from local <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> relative to their non-local counterparts are associated with significant positive abnormal returns, consistent with local <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> possessing information advantages.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays examining the market-making process in dealership markets. The first essay examines <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> 2 ̆ 7 quoting behavior for a sample of Nasdaq-listed stocks. The evidence indicates that <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> frequently revise their quotations but rarely post competitive prices on the Nasdaq system. Rather, they tend to post competitive prices on the Electronic Communication Network (ECN) systems. With a simultaneous equation model adopted to capture the interdependence between bid and ask quotes, this study demonstrates that the adverse selection {{is a major factor}} in explaining <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> 2 ̆ 7 quote revising processes on the Nasdaq system, while the role of inventory control is insignificant. Further analysis suggests that preferenced trading greatly reduces the effectiveness of competitive quotations in <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> 2 ̆ 7 inventory control processes, while the ECN systems provide Nasdaq <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> with an effective alternative tool to manage their inventory imbalances and even execute customer orders without posting competitive quotes on the Nasdaq system. The second essay investigates the competitiveness of the London market on the basis of trading activities of different <b>market</b> <b>makers.</b> The results show that London <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> can obtain relative larger shares of public order flows through posting more competitive prices with greater quote depths. No evidence is found to support that preferenced trading distort the market shares of trading among <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> because it is limited to small-sized trades. However, this study does suggest that those <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> who take more trading risks are not only rewarded with larger market shares of public order flow but also compensated with higher spread profit margins. The overall findings from the study indicate that the LSE is a competitive dealership market. ...|$|R
40|$|Trading {{data from}} the {{gambling}} market for the 2002 World Cup provide a unique window through which to test theories of market efficiency. The contracts we study trade in real time as the game is played. The evidence concerning market efficiency is mixed. Although markets respond strongly to goals being scored, {{there is some evidence}} that prices continue to trend higher for 10 - 15 minutes after a goal. We also observe systematically negative returns for bets on the pre-game favorite, consistent with the biases seen in wagering on other sports. We document the endogenous emergence of <b>market</b> <b>makers.</b> These <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> are involved in a large share of trades. Increasing from two active <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> to five or more <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> does not appear to dramatically improve the functioning of the market.

40|$|We {{focus on}} the extent of information-driven trading sourced from the {{behavior}} of <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> on an emerging market. We develop a methodology based on the Easley et al.

Based on the high percentage of block trades in the years 2003 - 05, the <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> focusing on large customers may have a significant source of private information on the PSE. Significant differences in the behavior of <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> lead us to conclude that these differences remarkably affect the extent of information-driven trading. Under current regulation, <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> are able to protect their private information and not reveal it for a surprisingly long period of time.
