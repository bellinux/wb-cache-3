500|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} Irwin's death, {{at least ten}} stingrays were found dead and mutilated on the beaches of Queensland, with their tails cut off, prompting speculation {{as to whether they}} might have been killed by fans of Irwin as an act of revenge, although, according to the chairman of the Queensland fishing information service, anglers regularly cut the tails off of accidentally caught stingrays to avoid being stung. Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin and executive director of his Wildlife Warrior fund, condemned any revenge killings, saying that [...] "We just want to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that we will not accept and not stand for anyone who's taken a form of retribution. That's the last thing Steve would want." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued in recent years, mainly by foreign commentators, that the CPC {{does not have an}} ideology, and that the party {{organization}} is pragmatic and interested only in what works. This view is considered wrong by some in many ways, since official statements <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> the party does have a coherent worldview. For instance, Hu Jintao stated in 2012 that the Western world is [...] "threatening to divide us" [...] and that [...] "the international culture of the West is strong while we are weak ... Ideological and cultural fields are our main targets". The CPC puts a great deal of effort into the party schools and into crafting its ideological message. Before the [...] "Practice Is the Sole Criterion for the Truth" [...] campaign, the relationship between ideology and decision-making was a deductive one, meaning that policy-making was derived from ideological knowledge. Under Deng this relationship was turned upside down, with decision-making justifying ideology and not the other way around. Lastly, Chinese policy-makers believe {{that one of the reasons}} for the dissolution of the Soviet Union was its stagnant state ideology. They therefore believe that their party ideology must be dynamic to safeguard the party's rule, unlike the Soviet Union's communist party, whose ideology they believe became [...] "rigid, unimaginative, ossified, and disconnected from reality." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} widespread acclaim. Kate Stables {{wrote in}} Sight & Sound: [...] "Elegant restraint is the film’s watchword ... In this enjoyably deliberate film, each shot and scene is carefully composed {{to pay homage}} to 50s cinema, yet infused with an emotional ambiguity which feels decidedly contemporary." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said: [...] " [...] has made a serious melodrama about the geometry of desire, a dreamy example of heightened reality that fully engages emotions despite the exact calculations with which it's been made... 'Carol's' lush but controlled visual look is completely intoxicating. This is filmmaking done by masters, an experience to savor." [...] A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, 'Carol' is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows." [...] Amy Taubin from Film Comment said: [...] "The narrative, precisely chiseled by Phyllis Nagy from the ungainly novel, is deceptively simple ... What's remarkable about Carol is that it seems to exist entirely in the present moment—to be precise, in that electric, elastic, heart-stopping/heart-racing present of romantic desire. It is a film composed of gestures and glances, its delicacy a veiled promise of abandon. And it could not exist without the extraordinary performances of Blanchett and Mara." [...] David Stratton of The Australian wrote: [...] "The meeting of these two women is an electrifying scene; their eyes make contact, and nothing of significance is said, apart from the usual interaction between shopper and shop assistant, but Haynes and his wonderful actors <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that something momentous has occurred — love at first sight." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Dr. Orit Kamir, {{the most}} {{effective}} way to avoid sexual harassment in the work place, and also influence the public’s state of mind, is for the employer to adopt a clear policy prohibiting sexual harassment and to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to their employees. Many women prefer to make a complaint and to have the matter resolved within the workplace rather than to [...] "air out the dirty laundry" [...] with a public complaint and be seen as a traitor by colleagues, superiors and employers, adds Kamir.|$|E
2500|$|In a February 15, 2007, interview, Pelosi {{noted that}} Bush {{consistently}} said he supports a diplomatic resolution to differences with Iran [...] "and I take {{him at his}} word". At the same time, she said, [...] "I do believe that Congress should assert itself, though, and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> {{that there is no}} previous authority for the president, any president, to go into Iran". [...] On January 12, 2007, Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina introduced a resolution requiring that– absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces– the President must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran. This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by Pelosi on March 13, 2007.|$|E

2500|$|The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) {{examined}} {{an allegation}} {{by a former}} senior police officer that a criminal prosecution of a brothel keeper, Myra Forde (who was convicted in a later case), for supplying underage girls to clients was not pursued by Wiltshire police after she reportedly [...] "threatened to expose" [...] that Heath {{may have been involved}} in offences concerning the abuse of children. There was a question as to whether the force properly investigated the claims of abuse, which had been made in the 1990s. In August 2015 Forde denied having any such knowledge or making any threat. Forde's counsel from that time issued a statement: [...] "My former client wishes me to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that at no stage did she state that Ted Heath was a client and at no stage did she threaten to expose him as a client of hers if the prosecution was continued." [...] The counsel for the prosecution in the case confirmed in a letter to The Times that the case was dropped because three prosecution witnesses had refused to testify, not because of any allegations against Heath. The Times reported in May 2016 that the IPCC had decided the claims of the former senior police officer were without foundation.|$|E
2500|$|Wagner {{uses the}} metaphor of Day and Night in the second act to {{designate}} the realms inhabited by Tristan and Isolde. The world of Day {{is one in which}} the lovers are bound by the dictates of King Marke's court and in which the lovers must smother their mutual love and pretend as if they do not care for each other: it is a realm of falsehood and unreality. Under the dictates of the realm of Day, Tristan was forced to remove Isolde from Ireland and to marry her to his Uncle Marke – actions against Tristan's secret desires. The realm of Night, in contrast, is the representation of intrinsic reality, in which the lovers can be together and their desires can be openly expressed and reach fulfilment: it is the realm of oneness, truth and reality and can only be achieved fully upon the deaths of the lovers. The realm of Night, therefore, becomes also the realm of death: the only world in which Tristan and Isolde can be as one forever, and it is this realm that Tristan speaks of at the end of act 2 ("Dem Land das Tristan meint, der Sonne Licht nicht scheint"). In act 3, Tristan rages against the daylight and frequently cries out for release from his desires (Sehnen). In this way, Wagner implicitly equates the realm of Day with Schopenhauer's concept of Phenomenon and the realm of Night with Schopenhauer's concept of Noumenon. While none of this is explicitly stated in the libretto, Tristan's comments on Day and Night in acts 2 and 3, as well as musical allusions to Tristan in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg and Parsifal <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that this was, in fact, Wagner's intention.|$|E

The event showed {{that it was in}} the former capacity that they intended to receive her, though they were probably willing that she should understand that it was in the latter. At all events, the proposition itself did not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> what her position would be; and the poor queen, distracted by the difficulties which surrounded her, and overwhelmed with agitation and fear, could not press very strongly for precise stipulations. In respect to Bothwell, they compromised the question by agreeing that, as he was under suspicion in respect to the murder of Darnley, he should not accompany the queen, but should be dismissed upon the field; that is, allowed to depart, without molestation, wherever he should choose to go. This plan was finally adopted. The queen bade Bothwell farewell, and he went away reluctantly and in great apparent displeasure. He had, in fact, with his characteristic ferocity, attempted to shoot Grange pending the negotiation. He mounted his horse, and, with a few attendants, rode off and sought a retreat once more upon his rock at Dunbar.|$|E
