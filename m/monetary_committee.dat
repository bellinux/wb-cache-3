40|$|This paper explores {{an optimal}} {{personnel}} organization problem of <b>monetary</b> policy <b>committees.</b> First, I construct an analytically tractable model for monetary policy analysis which starts from decision-making in the <b>monetary</b> policy <b>committee.</b> Using the model, I investigate {{the relationship between}} preference heterogeneity among the committee members and the optimal structure of the <b>monetary</b> policy <b>committee.</b> The result shows that it is optimal in general cases to appoint not only inflation-minded (hawkish) persons but also output-minded (dovish) persons. This is a theoretical justification {{for the fact that}} the actual <b>monetary</b> policy <b>committees</b> (e. g., MPC of Bank of England and FOMC) usually consist of both type members as the empirical researches suggest. It also explains why the committees have replaced the single policy makers in the actual central banks. <b>monetary</b> policy, <b>committee,</b> delegation, imperfect information, higher order expectations...|$|R
