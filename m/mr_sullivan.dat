[...] The Daily Telegraph wrote: [...] "With the public no doubt the musical gem will be a ballad called 'Cousin Robin'—pathetic and tender words, with a dreamy and somewhat Gounodish air. So sweetly was this sung by Mdlle. Clary that another encore was inevitable." [...] The Observer agreed that the song [...] "...will cause most delight on account of the quaint simplicity and tenderness of the words, the charming singing of Mdlle. Clary, and the really exquisite setting by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sullivan....</b> This is a musical gem".|$|E
500|$|Moffat has {{integrated}} many {{references to}} secondary characters and locations in Press Gang {{in his later}} work.

The name [...] "Talwinning" [...] appears as the name of streets in [...] "A Quarter to Midnight" [...] and Joking Apart, and as the surname of the protagonist in [...] "Dying Live", an episode of Murder Most Horrid written by Moffat, {{as well as the}} name of a librarian in his Doctor Who prose short story, [...] "Continuity Errors", which was published in the 1996 Virgin Books anthology [...] The name [...] "Inspector Hibbert", from [...] "The Last Word", is given to the character played by Nick Stringer in [...] "Elvis, Jesus and Jack", Moffat's final Murder Most Horrid contribution.

The first two choruses feature messages from the military to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Sullivan</b> regarding the enlistment and status of her sons; {{the last line of}} each encourages <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Sullivan</b> to [...] "keep her Blue Star in the window."

As the intensity returns, a third chorus informs <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Sullivan</b> of their death in the same fashion as those prior, suggesting that she [...] "change her Blue Star to Gold." ...|$|R

2500|$|In February 1924, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} {{that the number of}} feature films produced from the original stories or adaptations of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sullivan</b> totaled 311 in eight years. [...] The Times noted: [...] "This record undoubtedly is unrivaled among screen authors. [...] Mr. Sullivan's work is all the more remarkable because of the recognition which it has achieved for unvarying quality and variety." [...] At that time, Sullivan described the rule he applied in the selection of a story for the screen:"Is it human, is it true to life, is it sincere? If you can conscientiously satisfy yourself on these things, you won't have to worry as to whether the public will like the story or not. [...] If you are genuinely moved by it, you may be sure that the public will respond in like manner. ... Give the public a story that touches the heart and is true to life, and, to paraphrase Emerson, 'the world will make a beaten path to the theater box office.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|There were {{discussions about}} an 1867 {{professional}} production under {{the management of}} Thomas German Reed, but instead Reed commissioned Sullivan and Burnand to write a two-act comic opera, The Contrabandista, which was less well received. Cox and Box had its first professional production under Reed's management at the Royal Gallery of Illustration on Easter Monday, 29 March 1869, with Gilbert and Frederic Clay's No Cards preceding it on the bill. The occasion marked the professional debut of Arthur Cecil, who played Box. German Reed played Cox and F. Seymour played Bouncer. Cox and Box ran until 20 March 1870, a total of 264 performances, with a further 23 performances on tour. The production was a hit, although critics lamented the loss of Sullivan's orchestration (the Gallery of Illustration was too small for an orchestra): [...] "The operetta loses something by the substitution... of a piano and harmonium accompaniment for the orchestral parts which <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sullivan</b> knows so well how to write; but the music is nevertheless welcome in any shape." ...|$|E

Diddley {{had been asked to}} sing Tennessee Ernie Ford's hit [...] "Sixteen Tons", which he agreed. But when he appeared on stage, he forgot his cue and instead sang his #1 R hit song that bears his name. Diddley later recalls, [...] "Ed Sullivan says to me in plain words: 'You are the first black boy—quote—that ever double crossed me!' I was ready to fight, because I was a little young dude off the streets of Chicago, an' him callin' me 'black' in them days was as bad as sayin' 'nigger'. My manager says to me 'That's Mr. Sullivan!' I said: 'I don’t give a shit about <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sullivan,</b> e don't talk to me like that!' An' so he told me, he says, 'I'll see that you never work no more in show business. You'll never get another TV show in your life!'"

2500|$|The concerto {{was first}} {{performed}} on 24 November 1866 at the Crystal Palace, London, with August Manns conducting. Reviewing the first performance, The Times called the work not a concerto, but a concertino, {{and although the}} paper looked forward to further performances, it added, [...] "meanwhile we warn <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sullivan</b> that the present hopes of musical England rest in him." [...] There were few cello concertos in the repertoire in the 1860s. Those by Dvořák (1895), Saint-Saëns (1872 and 1902), Elgar (1919) and Shostakovich (1959 and 1966) were yet to come; concertos from earlier centuries {{such as those of}} Vivaldi and Haydn had fallen into neglect. Even the Schumann, composed sixteen years before Sullivan's, was far from a regular repertoire piece at the time. [...] Nonetheless, there were only two more complete performances of Sullivan's concerto during his lifetime. Piatti played the work in Edinburgh on 17 December 1866, and there was an amateur performance in London in February 1887. The first two movements were played at a Covent Garden promenade concert in October 1873, conducted by the composer, with Walter Pettit as soloist. Sullivan's biographer Arthur Jacobs considers it remarkable that the work fell into neglect, surmising that Sullivan or Piatti, or both, decided that it was unsatisfactory, possibly because of the brevity of the first movement.|$|E

The Doctor, who was disturbed at church by a terrible storm, hurried home, {{and on the way}} met the devil, who asked for work. He immediately set him to make 'thumb symes' of river sand.
