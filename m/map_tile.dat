The game board consists {{of a number of}} modular map tiles, which, with the exception of each civilization's unique starting <b>map</b> <b>tile,</b> are placed face-down on the board. At the start of the game, each player begins with a capital city in the centre of their own <b>map</b> <b>tile,</b> and an army and scout unit that begins in a space bordering their capital city. Each player also has a specific national power and a starting technology, depending on the civilization chosen.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, frequent network requests {{can generate}} very high energy cost and {{even have a}} long response time when the network is congested in typical positioning scheme. Although several offline applications have been proposed (e.g., big planet tracks [26]) to solve this problem, the effect of them is not ideal. So, {{in this paper we}} propose a cache mechanism based on <b>map</b> <b>tiles,</b> using geographic features to divide the map into many <b>map</b> <b>tiles</b> and maintain a local database cache.|$|R

50|$|During {{each summer}} month, the active player first calculates {{subsistence}} costs for each army.

50|$|The army {{could then}} {{move into the}} <b>map</b> <b>tile</b> if desired, {{provided}} there was no blocking terrain.Since a scouting roll was required every time an army wished to move, {{it was possible that}} the army could head in the wrong direction or not move at all, even if the target tile had been previously explored.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{scenario}} instructions, players find the relevant <b>map</b> <b>tile</b> boards and arrange them together forming the game board (battlefield). Battlefields often comprise terrain {{that is a}} mix of rough, clear, buildings, woods, hills, etc. Roads and streams can meander through particular areas either easing or obstructing vehicle and troop movement but may also provide cover. Furthermore, entrenchments, razor wire, pill boxes, tank traps, minefields and other obstructions often abound, creating a variety of tactical considerations. For instance, tank traps will impede movement of tanks, but infantry squad movement is unaffected while actually providing them some cover.|$|E
50|$|Fjords is a tile-based German-style {{board game}} {{designed}} by Franz-Benno Delonge {{and published in}} 2005 by Hans im Glück and Rio Grande Games. Unlike some other games in the genre, Fjords is strictly limited to two players. The game is played in two phases: exploration and expansion. In the first phase, the players draw random hexagonal tiles and place them on the gaming table in alternating sequence to form a <b>map.</b> <b>Tile</b> edges must consistently match with respect to terrain types (clear land, mountain, and water). On some of the tiles they place their four villages. In the second phase, they expand from their villages by placing tokens of their colour on the tiles. The player who succeeds in placing the most tokens (by cutting off the other player's access to tiles) wins the game.|$|E
