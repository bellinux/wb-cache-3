50|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have shown}} reliability issues when operated under high electric field or temperature gradients. Avalanche breakdown occurs in semiconducting CNT and joule breakdown in metallic CNT. Unlike avalanche behavior in silicon, avalanche in CNTs is negligibly temperature-dependent. Applying high voltages beyond avalanche point results in Joule heating and eventual breakdown in CNTs.This reliability {{issue has been}} studied, and it is noticed that the <b>multi-channeled</b> structure can improve {{the reliability of the}} CNTFET. The <b>multi-channeled</b> CNTFETs can keep a stable performance after several months, while the single-channeled CNTFETs are usually out of work after a few weeks in the ambient atmosphere. The <b>multi-channeled</b> CNTFETs keep operating when some channels break down, this wonâ€™t happen in the single-channeled ones.|$|R

40|$|What do {{broadcasters}} {{need to do}} {{to protect}} and reinforce their position in the value chain? Today, existing and to-be players are weighing {{the costs and benefits of}} investing significant dollars into new digital channels distributed over old fashioned broadcast networks. For all the hype about high definition, the fact is that this still linear distribution that may soon be out-dated. Surely pumping money into on-demand content delivered by broadband is a better bet? The truth is that despite audiences fragmenting across a growing number of channels (free-to-air and pay), linear commercial broadcasting still generates the majority of advertising revenue in Australia. Deloitte sees investment in new linear channels as both a necessary defensive tactic for broadcasters and, if done properly, a positive positioning move: ? as a defensive tactic, <b>multi-channelling</b> increases a broadcaster?s ability to retain share of total viewers as the audience fragments ? as a positioning tactic, <b>multi-channelling</b> provides an opportunity to establish digital identities, more loyal audiences and more sophisticated advertising capabilities. The way we watch analyses the opportunity for digital <b>multi-channels</b> and internet-based distribution platforms to allow broadcasters to blend mass audience reach with a deeper understanding of the multiple niches that individual viewers occupy. It describes two distinct stages of anticipated evolution within the Australian television market: the development of <b>multi-channelling,</b> and the shift to internet based television. The Way We Watch identifies success factors for broadcasters at each stage, and offers suggestions on how to make <b>multi-channelling</b> investments support success in the internet based television future...|$|R

5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Authority's response, titled Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting, {{recommended}} that the Australian Government support the early introduction of digital broadcasting as a free-to-air service with the loan of a 7MHz channel for each broadcaster, in order to enable high-definition television from the outset. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations supported this, as well as freedom for its members to launch <b>multi-channel</b> services. At the same time, the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, questioned the commercial viability of HDTV, was opposed {{to the idea of}} multi-channeling, and argued for a competitive system that would allow the entry of new players.|$|E

40|$|We {{elucidate}} {{the origin and}} nature of the D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation in a quantum wire structure, showing (analytically) that there are three necessary conditions for it to exist: (i) transport must be <b>multi-channeled,</b> (ii) there must be a Rashba spin orbit interaction in the wire, and (iii) there must also be a Dresselhaus spin orbit interaction. Therefore, the only effective way to completely eliminate the D'yakonov-Perel' relaxation in compound semiconductor channels with structural and bulk inversion asymmetry is to ensure strictly single channeled transport. In view of that, recent proposals in the literature that advocate using <b>multi-channeled</b> quantum wires for spin transistors appear ill-advised...|$|R
