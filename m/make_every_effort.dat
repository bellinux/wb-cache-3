The margrave {{acknowledged}} {{the right of}} Charles's son, Louis, to inherit Poland if CasimirIII died without a son in exchange for Charles's promise to persuade CasimirIII not to invade Silesia. Two leading Polish lords, Zbigniew, chancellor of Cracow, and Spycimir Leliwita, also supported this plan and persuaded CasimirIII, who lost his first wife on 26May 1339, to start negotiations with Charles. In July, Casimir came to Hungary and designated his sister (Charles's wife), Elizabeth, and her sons as his heirs. On his sons' behalf, Charles promised that they would <b>make</b> <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> to reconquer all lands that Poland had lost {{and that they would}} refrain from employing foreigners in Poland.|$|E

25|$|As {{the chief}} {{advantage}} of the Collins Line over its competitor the Cunard Line was speed, it was considered imperative to <b>make</b> <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> to ensure this advantage was maintained regardless of cost. This policy frequently resulted in costly repairs as the ships' engines were continually pushed to the limit. By 1852 {{it was clear to}} the owners that the existing government mail subsidy of $19,250 per voyage was insufficient, and the Line returned to Congress to request an increase in the subsidy to $33,000 per voyage. The government granted this request, and it was additionally decided {{to increase the number of}} voyages from 20 to 26 per annum, resulting in a total increase of the annual subsidy from $385,000 to $858,000. Competition between the two Lines had reduced freight rates considerably however, and even this new subsidy was not sufficient to prevent the company from continuing to lose money.|$|E

The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months, beginning in December 1942. [...] The report recommended official censure for only one officer, Captain Howard D. Bode of the Chicago, for failing to broadcast a warning to the fleet of encroaching enemy ships. The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers, including Admirals Fletcher, Turner, McCain, and Crutchley, and Captain Riefkohl. Vice Admiral Ghormley was relieved not long afterward. [...] Vice Admiral Fletcher and Rear Admiral Noyes were relieved of their commands. The careers of Turner, Crutchley, and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it. Riefkohl, however, never commanded ships again. Captain Bode, upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions, shot himself in his quarters at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on April 19, 1943, and died the next day. Crutchley was gazetted with the Legion of Merit (Chief Commander) in September 1944.
