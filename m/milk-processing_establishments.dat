40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to study the {{prevalence}} of Salmonella spp., Listeria spp., Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli in the raw cow milk. In this study 133 milk-tank samples from several milk collecting points were analysed. After the tests the following prevalence was detected: for Listeria spp. 13 positive samples (9. 77 %), with 9 Listeria monocytogenes samples confirmed (6. 76 %). Salmonella spp. was not detected in any of the the samples. The biggest presence was detected for Staphylococcus spp. with 113 positive samples (85. 0 %). Further testes has shown prevalence of coagulase-positive staphylococci of 73 % (97 positive samples). Escherichia coli was confirmed in 57 samples (46. 0 %). The results from this study clearly indicate that pathogen microorganisms which are important for the human health can be found in the raw cow milk and their presence can be potential hazard for contamination of the <b>milk-processing</b> <b>establishments...</b>|$|E
