40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} topic of three-level menu structures, now commonly found in e-commerce web sites, by measuring the performance and preference effects of different menu location combinations. Two studies were conducted, each using 16 different participants. The first study compared combinations of left and top menu positions across three menu levels. The results indicated a benefit when the first (primary) <b>menu</b> <b>level</b> was located {{on the left side}} of the screen, and when second and third menu levels were grouped in the same plane, opposite from the primary menu. The second study included a comparison of right-side menus. The results confirmed the benefit of grouping the second and third menu levels in the same plane, and suggest the value of locating the primary <b>menu</b> <b>level</b> on the right side. Finally, users preferred primary menus that were located in the left or right planes rather than the top plane. The results have important implications for the design of multi-level web site menu structures and represent a first-step towards providing empirical-based guidelines to site designers...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the ways}} of {{decreasing}} selection times in displayed menus is {{through the use of}} radial layouts which shorten distances to the items and increase the item sizes. Previous work on radial menus does not demonstrate that radial layouts are beneficial for menu hierarchies. The paper focuses on this topic. We compare two main characteristics of radial and linear layouts: a) {{the time it takes to}} find an item (i. e. visual search time), b) the time it takes to navigate to an item (i. e. pointing time). We use objective and subjective measures, two menu sizes, three <b>menu</b> <b>levels,</b> one linear and three radial layout variations. We also present requirements and the Compact Radial Layout (CRL) design which supports menu hierarchies. We assess its performance for novice and expert users...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} that models of hierarchical menu selections {{should include a}} component that accounts for additive factors (AF) associated with sub-selections (selections on each <b>menu</b> <b>level).</b> Examples of such AF are dwell time, mouse clicks, or reaction time of pointing movements. We collect empirical data from 28 participants using two considerably different hierarchical menu designs. The {{results show that the}} effects of AF associated with sub-selections are substantial and models not accounting for it lose their value because they cannot explain the sources of the differences between tested designs. We also use the collected data to compare performance of the designs and propose a simple measure of performance stability assessing the degree of navigation problems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Flower menu, a {{new type}} of Marking menu that does not only support straight, but also curved gestures for any of the 8 usual orientations. Flower menus make it possible to put many commands at each <b>menu</b> <b>level</b> and thus to create as large a hierarchy as needed for common applications. Indeed our informal analysis of menu breadth in popular applications shows that a quarter of them have more than 16 items. Flower menus can easily contain 20 items and even more (theoretical maximum of 56 items). Flower menus also support within groups as well as hierarchical groups. They can thus favor breadth organization (within groups) or depth organization (hierarchical groups) : as a result, the designers can lay out items in a very flexible way in order to reveal meaningful item groupings. We also investigate the learning performance of the expert mode of Flower menus. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{small screen}} sizes of mobile phones can create {{problems}} for users. There {{is a need}} for acceptable user interfaces that enable a better, more maximised use of the limited screen size while still providing high levels of usability. One method of maximising a limited display area is translucency. To examine the effect of translucency on interface usability we created a fully functioning simulation of a third generation mobile phone user interface, containing a translucent menu system. In this study translucency was implemented at 50 % alpha, and two <b>menu</b> <b>levels</b> deep. Objective and subjective aspects of usability and acceptance were gathered. Within the focus of the research the study yielded interesting findings positively relating translucency to perceived usability and measures of acceptance of small screen information systems.

40|$|Protein {{structures}} are flexible, changing their shapes not only upon substrate binding, but also during evolution {{as a collective}} effect of mutations, deletions and insertions. A new generation of protein structure comparison algorithms allows for such flexibility; they go beyond identifying the largest common part between two proteins and find hinge regions and patterns of flexibility in protein families. Here we present a Flexible Structural Neighborhood (FSN), a database of structural neighbors of proteins deposited in PDB as seen by a flexible protein structure alignment program FATCAT, developed previously in our group. The database, searchable by a protein PDB code, provides lists of proteins with statistically significant structural similarity and on lower <b>menu</b> <b>levels</b> provides detailed alignments, interactive superposition of structures and positions of hinges that were identified in the comparison. While superficially similar to other structural protein alignment resources, FSN provides a unique resource to study not only protein structural similarity, but also how protein structures change.

40|$|The breadth/depth {{trade-off}} in {{menu structure}} refers to {{advantages and disadvantages}} of menu breadth (having fewer levels/pages of menu selections with more selections per level) and depth (having more levels/pages with fewer selections per level). Several studies (Snowberry, Parkinson & Sisson, 1983; Landauer & Nachbar, 1985) demonstrate enhanced user performance with increased breadth. However, other studies (Miller, 1981; Kiger, 1984; Tullis, 1985) fail to show an advantage in user performance with increased depth. Complicating the breadth/depth issue is the issue of the ordering of selections within each <b>menu</b> <b>level.</b> Snowberry et al. found superiority of breadth only with consistent ordering of selections within levels. Card (1982) reported that alphabetical ordering of selections is superior to functional ("logical") ordering, which in turn is superior to random ordering. Do users perceive and utilize menu structure independently of ordering, perhaps by first appraising which level must be accessed, then by determining where in that level the goal selection is? Or are structure and ordering interrelated considerations? These hypotheses were tested in an experiment in which menu breadth and ordering were covaried...|$|E

40|$|Website {{design and}} {{structure}} is constantly evolving at a rapid rate producing navigation schemes that become common practice {{even though they may}} not necessarily improve user's ability to locate information on the site. The type of navigation to be implemented for a website should depend on how the user will navigate the website to find content (Kalbach, 2007). Interactive menus may help resolve issues of cluttering a webpage, but they can also create more problems for the user (Nielsen, 2000). This study investigated how global menu design and left-side local menu design would affect time it would take participants to complete several tasks and accuracy of the answers to the tasks. The global menu design included a version with a rollover submenu and a version without. The left-side local menu design included a version that had secondary <b>menu</b> <b>levels</b> collapsed or secondary <b>menu</b> <b>levels</b> fully expanded. Sixty-three university students participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two global menu conditions (with and without global rollover) and to one of the two left-side local menu conditions (expanded or collapsed). The participants read the tasks to themselves, answered the questions, and rated how confident they were that their answers were correct. After completing the tasks, participants answered subjective questions about their impressions of the design of the website. The first hypothesis predicted that the global menu with a rollover submenu would increase the time it took users to complete the tasks and would increase the number of errors as compared to a global menu without a rollover submenu. The second hypothesis predicted that the collapsed left-side local menu would increase the time to complete tasks and also increase the number of errors as compared to an expanded leftside local menu. The third hypothesis predicted no interaction between the global menu design and left-side local navigation on time and accuracy. Overall findings were inconclusive. There was some indication that global rollover menus may increase the time to navigate to a page when it is the third-level in a website and it may decrease the time it takes to navigate to a page when the page is a second-level item. Left-side menus that have sublevel items take longer to navigate when the menu is collapsed and the sublevel items are not visible. A few possible design changes were identified that might address some of the limitations that were believed to influence the study...|$|R

Many interventions targeting prepared-food sources have been initiated with the goal of promoting healthful options. The objective of this study was to provide a systematic review of interventions in prepared-food sources in community settings. MethodsWe used PubMed and Google Scholar and identified 13 interventions that met these criteria: 1) focused on prepared-food sources in public community settings, 2) used an impact evaluation, 3) had written documentation, and 4) took place after 1990. We conducted interviews with intervention staff to obtain additional information. Reviewers extracted and reported data in table format to ensure comparability. ResultsInterventions mostly targeted an urban population, predominantly white, in a range of income levels. The most common framework used was social marketing theory. Most interventions used a nonexperimental design. All made use of signage and menu labeling to promote healthful food options. Several promoted more healthful cooking methods; only one introduced new healthful <b>menu</b> options. <b>Levels</b> of feasibility and sustainability were high; sales results showed increased purchasing of healthful options. Measures among consumers were limited but in many cases showed improved awareness and frequency of purchase of promoted foods.
