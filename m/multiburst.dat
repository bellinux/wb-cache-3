50|$|A <b>multiburst</b> {{signal is}} an {{electronic}} waveform {{used to test}} analog transmission, recording, and display systems. The test pattern consists of several short periods of specific frequencies. The contrast of each may be measured by inspection and recorded, giving a plot of attenuation vs. frequency. The NTSC3.58 <b>multiburst</b> pattern consists of 500 kHz, 1 MHz, 2 MHz, 3 MHz, and 3.58 MHz blocks. 3.58 MHz {{is important because it}} is the chrominance frequency for NTSC video.|$|E

50|$|A <b>multiburst</b> {{waveform}} is {{a useful}} test pattern used to quickly ascertain the frequency response of a video system. The name derives from the multiple bursts of sine wave in the active video section of the waveform which are generated with (usually) increasing frequency, but identical in amplitude. The test pattern is usually input {{at the start of}} the signal chain and analysed at the end. By measuring the amplitude of each of the 'bursts' of waveform at the end of the video chain, spot measurements of the frequency response of the system can be obtained and errors in the response quickly identified.|$|E
40|$|Although Digital Video Broadcast-Handheld (DVB-H) is {{currently}} {{considered to be}} a mature technology, new <b>multiburst</b> forward error-correction (FEC) schemes such as multiprotocol encapsulation-interburst FEC (MPE-iFEC) and application-layer FEC (AL-FEC) can be applied to mobile TV streaming services to increase the robustness of the transmission. Compared with the conventional intraburst approach MPE-FEC, <b>multiburst</b> encoding provides protection across several bursts rather than within a single burst because it is possible to recover from completely erroneous bursts. The robustness of the transmission can be enhanced, keeping the capacity devoted for error repair (code rate or FEC overhead) and thus increasing the number of interleaved bursts. This paper describes a methodology for estimating the coverage for <b>multiburst</b> FEC DVB-H mobile TV streaming services in realistic scenarios based on dynamic system-level simulations. Furthermore, it presents illustrative performance-evaluation results with field measurements, and it presents simulation results quantifying the reduction in the fading margin required to cope with fast fading and shadowing that can be achieved with <b>multiburst</b> FEC, compared with MPE-FEC...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we present}} a {{modified}} full-aperture imaging algorithm that includes scalloping correction and spike suppression for sliding-Mosaic-mode Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). It is innovational to correct the azimuth beam-pattern weighting altered by radar antenna rotation in the azimuth during the deramping preprocessing operation. The main idea of spike suppression is to substitute zeros between bursts with linear-predicted data extrapolated from adjacent bursts to suppress spikes caused by <b>multiburst</b> processing. We also integrate scalloping correction for the sliding mode into this algorithm. Finally, experiments are performed using the C-band airborne SAR system with a maximum bandwidth of 200 MHz to validate {{the effectiveness of this}} approach...|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} 8 {{months of the}} Magellan mission, the radar {{altimeter}} has made some three million measurements of the surface of Venus covering the latitude range from 85 deg N to 80 deg S. Methods involving range correlation, Doppler filtering, <b>multiburst</b> summation, and range migration are used to focus the observations and to achieve high surface resolution. Results are presented as maps of the global distribution of topography, meter-scale roughness, and power reflection coefficient. The results {{are similar to those}} reported in previous experiments (surface heights exhibit a unimodal distribution with more than 80 percent of the surface lying within 1 km of the 6051. 84 -km mean radius) but the higher resolution of the Magellan altimeter has disclosed several surprisingly steep features, e. g., the southwest face of the Maxwell Montes, the southern face of the Danu Montes, and the chasmata to the east of Thetis Regio, where average kilometer-scale slopes of greater than 30 deg are not uncommon. This conclusion is corroborated by close inspection of synthetic aperture radar imagery...|$|E
40|$|In this experiment, {{listeners}} detected sequential tonal patterns {{embedded in}} multitone <b>multiburst</b> random maskers. The maskers consisted of eight 30 ms bursts of random-frequency tones. The signal, when present, occupied the central six bursts and was centered at 1000 Hz. The six sequential signal tones formed several spectro-temporal patterns: an equal-frequency pattern, three ascending patterns with frequency ranges spanning 0. 5 -, 1 -, and 2 -equivalent rectangular bandwidths (ERBs), and a random pattern with frequencies drawn at random from {{the range of}} 925 – 1075 Hz. The total number of tones in each burst, m, was varied to determine detection threshold. The detectability of the signal pattern declined as the frequency range of the signal pattern increased, and when the signal was random. Relative weights {{as a function of}} time and frequency, interpreted as listeners’ internal templates, depended systematically on the properties of the signal pattern tested. The templates indicated that when sensitivity was poor, listeners integrated increasingly broad spectro-temporal regions around the signal frequencies, and sometimes integrated energy from the final burst even though the signal tones never occupied the final burst...|$|E
40|$|Broadband {{wireless}} channels {{observed at}} a receiver cannot fully exhibit dense nature {{in a low}} to moderate signalto- noise ratio (SNR) regime, if the channels follow a typical propagation scenario such as Vehicular-A or Pedestrian-B. It is hence expected that ℓ 1 regularized channel estimation methods can improve channel estimation performance in the broadband wireless channels. However, it is well-known that the ℓ 2 <b>multiburst</b> (MB) channel estimation achieves the Cram´er-Rao bound (CRB) asymptotically. This is because the ℓ 2 MB technique formulated as a {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) problem improves the mean squared error (MSE) performance by utilizing the subspace projection. Performance analysis shows that ℓ 1 regularized channel estimation does not improve the MSE performance significantly over the ℓ 2 MB technique so far as the subspace channel model assumption is correct. We demonstrate, however, a receiver with ℓ 1 regularized channel estimation can improve bit error rate (BER) performance if the assumption is not always correct. For this purpose, we focus on intermittent transmission (TX) scenario which is defined as a generalized TX sequence having arbitrary length interruption between two continuous TX bursts. A receiver with the ℓ 2 MB method suffers from BER deterioration in an intermittent TX scenario having abrupt channel changes. As a solution to the problem, we propose a new algorithm which is a hybrid of ℓ 1 regularized least square (LS) and ℓ 2 MMSE channel estimation techniques. Simulation results show that the receiver with the proposed algorithm achieves a significant BER gain over that of the ℓ 2 MB technique in the intermittent TX scenario...|$|E
