When asked about why his recent novels had been shorter, DeLillo replied, [...] "Each book tells <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> wants or what it is, and I'd be perfectly content to write another long novel. It just has to happen." [...] While DeLillo is open to the idea of returning to the form of the long novel, the interview also revealed that he currently has no interest in doing as many of his literary contemporaries have done and writing a memoir. DeLillo also made some observations on the state of literature and the challenges facing young writers: ...|$|E

[...] He asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was, and I told him it was the white man’s religion which was discussed in that room. [...] He came in and sat with us boys. [...] During the preaching he sat very reverently and listened attentively to all that was said, although he could not understand a single word. [...] His attention to the service pleased Captain Pratt exceedingly. [...] When my father was ready to depart, he was presented with a well-made top-buggy and a set of harness, all of which were made at the school.

2500|$|Presidents {{have also}} {{discussed}} {{the role of}} endowment, correlating a high ranking on the survey with institutional wealth. President of Muhlenberg College, Peyton Helm, argued that [...] "most of the other factors weighted by U.S. News in their rankings (in a secret formula they will not reveal, that is changed every year, and that independent researchers {{have been unable to}} replicate) are based, ultimately, on institutional wealth [...] A trustee once asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would take for Muhlenberg to be ranked in the top five by U.S. News. My answer was simple: A check for $800 million placed directly in the endowment would do it -- even if we never changed another thing we were doing." [...] Helms also noted that, [...] "what you won't read in U.S. News {{is that most of the}} data they use is public information, readily available on the Web sites of most colleges and universities, as well as on the U.S. Department of Education Web site. There is no single formula for weighting these factors -- they will have different significance for different students and families. So, next year I and many other leaders of our nation's best colleges and universities will be working on a new and better Web-based tool for families engaged in the college search." [...] Millsaps College president, Frances Lucas, further noted that, [...] "she previously had paid little attention to the rankings debate because her own institution was rated highly in U.S. News. But after learning more about the magazine's methodology and discussing the issue with colleagues at this week's meeting, she concluded that the rankings were based too heavily on measurements determined by institutional wealth." ...|$|E
