40|$|The paper {{describes}} a methodology {{for the design}} of helicopter rotors with improved brownout char-acteristics. A brownout metric is introduced, based on the density of the sediment cloud in the field of view of the pilot. The metric becomes the objective function of a procedure in which blade chord, rotor radius, and blade twist rate are optimized to minimize brownout in a representative landing ma-neuver. The analysis includes a free-vortex wake model and simulates the dynamics of the sediment particles immersed in the rotor downwash. The results show that the optimized configurations have im-proved visibility within 2 – 3 rotor radii from the pilot, as desired, because the rotor generates increased groundwash that pushes the dust cloud away from the pilot. The clouds, however, do not necessarily become smaller or less dense further away from the pilot’s field of view. Simple polynomial expres-sions are provided that quantify brownout mitigation in terms of rotor design parameters, within the assumptions used in the derivation, and can be used in preliminary design applications.

The investigation team conducted intensive diagnostic procedures and deployed equipment to provide long-term data on indoor radon concentrations and several other building and environmental parameters. Analyses of these data indicated extraordinary fluctuations in soil gas and indoor radon concentrations primarily related to outdoor temperature. Other investigators had previously described the same phenomena in geologically similar areas characterized by extreme karst development. It is probable that the extensive network of solution cavities provides pathways for significant bulk flow of soil gas over great horizontal and vertical distances, and in areas with elevation differences, enables pressure-driven flow through these pathways caused by stack effect developed due to temperature differences between the ground and outdoor air.

The agents play the role of market participants by formulating bids to maximize their profits.

In congested networks, congestion rents can be fleeting when suppliers are able to equalize prices across zones through strategic bidding.

40|$|Alkali-silica {{reaction}} (ASR) is a deleterious mechanism {{known to}} affect several concrete structures worldwide. During this process, alkali ions {{present in the}} pore solution react with reactive components of the aggregate particle and, as a result a hygroscopic gel is formed.

Lithium ions are known to combine with the alkalisilica gel, forming a non-expansive gel. In fresh mixtures, they may be incorporated {{by the use of}} lithium based admixtures. However, in existing concrete structures, the ions need to be transported into the cementitious matrix.

40|$|In {{order to}} find experts, {{different}} approaches build rankings of people, assuming that they are ranked by level of expertise, and use typical Information Retrieval (IR) measures to evaluate their effectiveness. However, we figured out that expert rankings (i) tend to be partially ordered, (ii) incomplete, and (iii) consequently provide more an order rather than absolute ranks, which is not what usual IR measures exploit. To improve this state of the art, we propose to revise the formalism used in IR to design proper measures for comparing expert rankings. In this report, we investigate a first step by providing <b>mitigation</b> <b>procedures</b> for the three issues, and we analyse IR measures {{with the help of}} these procedures to identify interesting revisions and remaining limitations.

Up to 1983, no such single modeling formalism existed that could fill such requirements.

We investigated the effectiveness of ramp-up procedures in reducing the area within which changes in hearing thresholds can occur. We modeled the level of sound killer whales (Orcinus orca) were exposed to from a generic sonar operation preceded by different ramp-up schemes. In our model, ramp-up procedures reduced the risk of killer whales receiving sounds of sufficient intensity to affect their hearing. The effectiveness of the ramp-up procedure depended strongly on the assumed response threshold and differed with ramp-up duration, although extending the duration of the ramp up beyond 5 min did not add much to its predicted mitigating effect. The main factors that limited effectiveness of ramp up in a typical antisubmarine warfare scenario were high source level, rapid moving sonar source, and long silences between consecutive sonar transmissions.

The proposed procedure adjusts the RSSI measurements based on estimates of their variability caused by RF interference. For estimating the variability in RSSI measurements, the procedure leverages information about the spectrum power levels in the frequency band on which the fingerprinting algorithm performs.

40|$|In {{several major}} {{deregulated}} electricity generation markets, the market operator uses an "automatic mitigation procedure" (AMP) {{to attempt to}} suppress the exercise of market power. A leading type of AMP compares the offer price from each generation unit with a recent historical average of accepted offer prices from that same unit during periods {{when there was no}} transmission-system congestion to impede competition. If one or more units' offer prices exceed the recent historical average by more than a specified margin, and if these offer prices raise the market-clearing price by more than a specified margin, the market operator replaces the offending offer prices with lower ones. In an experiment, we test an AMP of this type. We find that it keeps market prices close to marginal cost if generation owners have low market power in uncongested periods. However, with high market power in uncongested periods, a condition that may apply {{in many parts of the}} world, the generation owners are able to gradually raise the market price well above short-run marginal cost in spite of the AMP.
