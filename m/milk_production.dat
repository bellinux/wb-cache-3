5|$|The Gram-negative {{bacterial}} disease brucellosis occasionally affects elk in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{the only place}} in the U.S. where the disease is still known to exist. In domesticated cattle, brucellosis causes infertility, abortions and reduced <b>milk</b> <b>production.</b> It is transmitted to humans as undulant fever, producing flu-like symptoms which may last for years. Though bison are more likely to transmit the disease to other animals, elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horses in Wyoming and cattle in Idaho. Researchers are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccinations and herd management measures, which are expected to be successful. Nevetheless, research has been ongoing since 2002, and a successful vaccine has yet to be developed as of 2016.|$|E

5|$|N. lasiopterus is understudied {{due to its}} rarity; {{very little}} is known of its mating habits, {{reproductive}} pattern, life cycle and sex ratio. N. lasiopterus, as a Nyctalus species, has an outstanding capability for migration which can possibly result in considerable seasonal changes in sex ratio. The studies in North-East Hungary indicates that the sex-ratio differs greatly depending on the location. Males were exceedingly dominant in Greece and the Czech Republic while females were dominant in NE Germany, the Moscow-region, Voronezh, and NE Hungary. This sexual segregation is due to difference in sex-specific thermoregulatory and energetic requirements. The females are dominant in warmer locations because it is optimal for fetal development and <b>milk</b> <b>production.</b> On the other hand, males are dominant in cooler locations because of lower energetic demands. These results verified that N. lasiopterus have nursing colonies located in Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Production {{is still}} {{specialized}} in horticultural goods, {{but most of}} the masseiras were substituted by greenhouses and a significant share of the production is exported to other Western European markets.

In agriculture, the masseira farm fields were developed. This technique increases agricultural yields by using large, rectangular depressions dug into sand dunes, with the spoil piled up into banks surrounding the depression. Grapes are cultivated on the banks to the south, east and west, and trees and reeds on the northern slope act as a windbreak against the prevailing northern wind. Garden crops are grown in the central depression.|$|E

40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the role of insulin in <b>milk</b> protein <b>production</b> in pasture-fed lactating ruminants (ewes and cows), using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (HEC) technique. Three experiments were carried out. In the first 2 experiments, the response of pasture-fed ewes and dairy cows to the HEC were established and compared to concentrate-fed ruminants (dairy cows and goats). Use of the HEC technique in pasture-fed ruminants did not result in an increase in milk protein yield or concentration. However, a reduction in feed intake along with maintenance of milk protein yield resulted in a change in efficiency of utilisation of dietary crude protein for <b>milk</b> protein <b>production.</b> This indicated that changes in blood insulin could result in changes in nutrient partitioning to maintain <b>milk</b> protein <b>production.</b> In Experiment 3, mechanisms were examined that could maintain <b>milk</b> protein <b>production</b> despite a reduction in feed intake. The arterio-venous concentration difference technique and a leucine tracer infusion were used to measure amino acid (AA) uptake and subsequent metabolism for <b>milk</b> protein <b>production</b> under conditions imposed by the HEC. This experiment demonstrated that the HEC reduced AA supply to the mammary gland and there was a decrease in the uptake of some AA. There was no increase in mammary blood flow to compensate for this. The deficit in the ratio of AA uptake to their secretion in milk protein suggests the use of plasma free AA concentrations underestimates uptake of AA by the mammary gland and there are contributions by alternative sources such as peptide AA and erythrocytes. There was no decrease in leucine oxidation in the mammary gland, indicating that AA were not conserved for <b>milk</b> protein <b>production</b> through an alteration in this mechanism. These results support the theory that the mammary gland has the ability to respond to modified precursor supply to maintain milk protein output...|$|R

25|$|The next 30 to 60 {{days of the}} {{lactation}} {{cycle is}} characterized by peak <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> levels. The amount of milk produced per day during this period varies considerably by breed and by individual cow depending on her body condition, genetics, health, and nutrition. During this period the body condition of the cow will suffer because the cow will draw on her body stores to maintain such high <b>milk</b> <b>production.</b> Food intake of the cow also will increase. After peak lactation, the cow’s <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> levels will slowly decline {{for the rest of}} the lactation cycle.

The observation was carried out on the seminatural grass stand and on the grass stand with additional sowing of grass and clover enriched by artificial fertilizer. The capacity of dry matter consumption of milk cows was used for evaluation of quality of <b>production</b> <b>milk</b> potential. The <b>production</b> <b>milk</b> potential of feeding ration was calculated {{on the basis of}} energy and nitrogenous substances. Higher values of <b>production</b> <b>milk</b> potential PDI on the perennial grass stands (figure 1) with the maximum 21. 27 l. head. day- 1 resulted from the comparison of observed grass stands. The evaluated index of the renewed grass stands was lower than the values obtained on the perennial grass stands (in the first usage by 1. 40 l, in the second one by 1. 94 l and in the third one by 1. 16 l. head. day- 1).
