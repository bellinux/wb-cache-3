40|$|Canine elbow {{dysplasia}} (CED) is {{a complex}} of diseases resulting in osteoarthritis (OA). CED includes ununited anconeal process (UAP), fragmented medial coronoid process (FMCP), osteochondritis (OC) of the <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle,</b> and elbow incongruity. A patient with OC of the <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> and FMCP was treated by arthroscopy for micro-fractures of subchondral bone and removal, respectively, and received intra-articular doses of autologous platelet concentratres (APC). The patient was evaluated by clinical examination, synovial fluid cytology, radiographic assessment and platform force evaluation, before surgery and at 30, 60 and 90 th postoperative days. The patient reached full clinical recovery at 60 th postoperative day with improvement in the synovial fluid cytology and the kinematic findings.

40|$|Twenty canine elbows were {{examined}} by low-field MRI. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare five magnetic resonance sequences: High Resolution Gradient Echo in the sagittal plane, XBONE T 2 in the sagittal plane, Spin Echo T 1 in the sagittal plane, Spin Echo T 1 in the dorsal plane and 3 D SST 1 and XBONE T 1 in the transverse plane, and to determine which sequences have the highest diagnostic value in imagining the canine elbow. High Resolution Gradient Echo, XBONE T 2 and Spin Echo T 1 sequences in the sagittal plane proved to be very useful in evaluations of osseous structures such as the medial coronoid process, the anconeal process of the ulna and joint surfaces. The above sequences facilitate evaluations of radial extensor muscle of the wrist, biceps brachii muscle, triceps brachii muscle and the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. 3 D SST 1 and XBONE T 1 se-quences in the transverse plane produce high-quality images of the <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> and surfaces of the elbow joint. Those sequences are also useful for evaluating the surrounding muscles: extensor digitorum communis muscle, extensor carpi radialis muscle, deltoid muscle, biceps brachii muscle, pronator teres muscle and flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. The Spin Echo T 1 sequence in the dorsal plane facilitates assessments of joint surfaces, <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle,</b> superficial digital flexor muscle, deep digital flexor muscle, triceps brachii muscle and extensor digitorum lateralis muscle.

40|$|Background/Aim of Study: Fractures of {{the medial}} condyle of humerus are {{uncommon}} in adults. The aims {{of this study}} were (i) to highlight the rarity of this injury, (ii) to focus on the problems in management of cases which present late, and (iii) to compare the results of surgical excision of medial condyle with those of internal fixation. Methods: Seven adult <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> fractures were seen over a 10 -year period. Four cases were surgically fixed within three weeks of the injury; one case refused operation. Two cases which presented late, one with an isolated trochlear fracture, and another Milch type I fracture comminution and compounding, were treated by excision of the condyle and supervised post excision physiotherapy. Results: All six operated cases regained good function. The two patients with excised condyle had no significant instability and had good range of movements. The results were comparable to those managed by open reduction and internal fixation. Conclusions: Medial condyle fractures presenting early (within 3 weeks), should be managed by accurate open reduction and rigid fixation: non operative management leads to relatively poor results. In late/neglected cases, or those with extensive comminution, open reduction and fixation may lead to stiff and painful elbow, whereas excision of the condylar fragment does not lead to instability...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the role of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) andapoptosis in normal articular cartilage and in the pathogenesis of dyschondroplasia, adisease characterized by a failure of chondrocyte differentiation. Four normal and eightdyschondroplastic <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> <b>condyles</b> of abattoir pigs, were processed forhistopathological and histochemical (Alcian Blue, Masson's trichrome) investigations. Immunohistochemical expression of HSP 27, 72 and 73 was determined using astreptavidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. Apoptosis was evaluated performing TUNELmethod. A strong HSP 27 immunoreactivity was detected within the hypertrophiedchondrocytes, in normal and dyschondroplastic articular cartilage, in clusters ofproliferating chondrocytes adjacent to areas of chondrolysis, as well as islands ofpersisting denatured cartilage. None or weak immunoreactivity was detected againstHSP 72 and HSP 73.

40|$|Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{clinically}} {{important and}} common disease of older cats. The pathological changes and molecular mechanisms which underpin the disease {{have yet to}} be described. In this study we evaluated selected histological and transcriptomic measures in the articular cartilage and subchondral bone (SCB) of the <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> of cats with or without OA. Results: The histomorphometric changes in <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> were concentrated in the medial aspect of the condyle. Cats with OA had a reduction in articular chondrocyte density, an increase in the histopathological score of the articular cartilage and a decrease in the SCB porosity of the medial part of the <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle.</b> An increase in LUM gene expression was observed in OA cartilage from the medial part of the <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle.</b> Conclusions: Histopathological changes identified in OA of the feline <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> appear to primarily affect the medial aspect of the joint. Histological changes suggest that SCB is involved in the OA process in cats.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionDistal humerus condyle {{fracture}} in children is rare. These fractures often mislead the emergency physician or surgeon. However, treatment {{adapted to the}} degree of displacement achieves excellent clinical and radiographic results. The objective {{of this study was to}} clarify indications for conservative treatment of lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> fracture in children. Materials and methodsTwenty-two children who had sustained lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> fracture between January 2007 and January 2010 were reviewed in April 2010. At this consultation, the children underwent clinical and radiological examination. The Hardacre functional score was used to determine objective clinical outcome. ResultsConservative treatment was exclusive to cases of lateral condyle displacement equal to or less than 1 mm. All other fractures were managed by surgical open reduction and fixation using cross-pinning. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical or radiological outcome between conservative and surgical management. DiscussionLateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> fracture is difficult to diagnose in children. The majority of poor results reported in literature relate to inadequate initial treatment. Given a radiological aspect of hemarthrosis of the elbow, the emergency physician prescribes multiple X-ray views of the affected elbow (anteroposterior, lateral and internal oblique). The clinical aspect of lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> fracture is often characteristic (ecchymosis facing the head of the radius). Nondisplaced or minimally displaced lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> fracture can be managed conservatively under close survey. However, secondary displacement under the cast is often difficult or impossible to detect, and outpatient surgery is therefore being increasingly indicated in our department.

40|$|In {{this case}} report, an {{incomplete}} ossification of the <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> in a Dogue de Bordeaux of eight months old is described. As a puppy, {{the dog had}} already been intermittently lame on the right front leg. Because of the breed and the clinical and radiographic findings, elbow dysplasia was primarily diagnosed. However, after computer tomographic examination, an incomplete ossification of the <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> was found. This condition is less common than elbow dysplasia, and does not always cause limping. The dog was treated conservatively because of the mild clinical symptoms, and recovered spontaneously. The special features of this case include primarily the breed of the dog and his history. Incomplete ossification occurs mainly in Spaniels, and lameness is usually not observed in puppies. The evolution of the disease in this dog is atypical. This dog recovered spontaneously. This condition often causes persistent lameness.

40|$|Fracture of {{the lateral}} <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> is a {{relatively}} common injury in children. In the displaced type most authors advise open reduction and internal fixation, although Kini (1942) and McLearie and Merson (1954) reported good results by closed manipulation. Controversy still exists {{as to whether the}} fixation should be by soft-tissue suture (Badger 1954, Crabbe 1963) or by pin or screw (Wilson 1955, Jeffery 1958). It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to review a series of fractures of the lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> in children which were treated by a specially designed screw. The mechanism of injury and the indications for internal fixation are discussed. CLINICAL MATERIAL In the eight years from 1961 to 1968 thirty-nine children with displaced fractures of the lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> attended the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow. There were thirty-four boys and five girls with an average age of six years. The youngest was aged three and the oldest ten years. In thirty-one cases the injury was to the left elbow. All except two were caused by a fall on the outstretched hand. FIG. 1 FIG. 2 Figure I-A fracture of the lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> with slight displacement. Figure 2 -A fracture of the lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> with severe displacement. The metaphysial fragment is no more than a flake in this instance. The degree of displacement was classified as slight or severe (Figs. 1 and 2). All but three were severely displaced. The size of the metaphysial fragment varied but in only three cases could it be described as a flake (Fig. 2). The shadow of soft-tissue swelling on the lateral side of the elbow was a constant finding on the initial radiographs. In ten children there was similar swelling on the medial side, suggesting more extensive soft-tissue injury. Five elbows were dislocated postero-laterally at the time of admission to hospital.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the frequency and}} radiographic aspect of <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> epicondylar lesions as a primary or concomitant finding and to evaluate the association with osteoarthritis. Methods: Medical records of dogs diagnosed with elbow lameness were reviewed. Inclusion criteria {{for this study were}} a complete clinical examination, a complete set of digital radiographs and a final diagnosis made by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopy. Changes of the <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> epicondyle were recorded and correlated with the radiographic osteoarthritis and final diagnosis. Results: Eighty of the 200 elbows showed changes of the <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> epicondyle. In 12 of these 80 elbows, changes of the medial epicondyle were the only findings within the joint, and these elbows were diagnosed with primary flexor enthesopathy. In the remaining 68 elbows, other concomitant elbow pathologies were found. In those cases of concomitant epicondylar changes, high grades of osteoarthritis were recorded, while most elbows with primary flexor enthesopathy showed a low grade of osteoarthritis. Clinical significance: Changes of the <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> epicondyle are often considered clinically unimportant and are regarded as an expression of osteoarthritis. This study showed the relatively frequent presence of epicondylar changes of which the majority were considered concomitant to a primary elbow problem.

30|$|Lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> {{fractures}} {{account for}} 17  % of the distal <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> fractures.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to review the results of patients with a displaced lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> fracture treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). We retrospectively reviewed children treated with ORIF of lateral <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> fractures at a single institution over a period of 13  years. All cases were identified through the trauma register. Case notes and radiographs were retrieved. Fracture classification, mode of fixation, time to union, and final outcomes at the latest follow-up were reviewed. One hundred and five lateral condyle fractures were identified in 76 male and 29 female patients. Average age was 6.2  years. Ninety-two were Milch type II and 13 Milch type I. According to the Jacob’s classification, 38 were type II and 67 type III. All fractures were treated with open reduction and fixation with K-wires. Average time to radiological union was 33  days. Follow-up ranged between 2 and 8  years (average 3.2  years). Radiological hypertrophy of the lateral condyle was present in 45 cases (42  %). Three patients developed a pseudo-cubitus varus deformity. Further four patients developed a true cubitus varus. There was one case of superficial infection of the K-wires and one case of delayed union. At the latest follow-up, 96  % of the patients achieved an excellent final result and 4  % a good final result. Our results demonstrate that fracture union and excellent final outcomes can be expected in all patients using our protocol, whereby all patients with a displaced fracture are managed by ORIF with K-wire fixation, with the wires only being removed after there is evidence of radiological union. Compared to recent reports of closed reduction internal fixation, this series demonstrates good results with no complications directly relating to the open reduction technique.

40|$|Growth and {{developmental}} disorders of the elbow joint are frequent causes of lameness of the thoracic limb of the dog. Golden Retriever {{is one of}} the mainly affected breeds. Two different computer-aided methods of measurement will be compared in this study. The aim is to find out whether one of these measurement methods is more suitable to distinguish affected from unaffected joints and to recognize a possible predisposition for elbow dysplasia (ED). X-Rays of the elbow joints in the medio-lateral view of 216 Golden Retriever are examined with measurement methods from VIEHMANN (1998) and MUES (2001). In this study male dogs are more affected from elbow dysplasia than female dogs. Seven parameters were measured with the procedure of VIEHMANN (1998). Three of them describe the shape of the trochlear notch of the ulna. Dogs with a more pronounced elbow dysplasia show an elliptic shape of the trochlear notch. A parameter for the size of the area of the <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> which is included in the trochlear notch was measured. No correlation was found between a progressive cranial displacement of the <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> and a higher degree of arthrotic alteration. However the surface of the <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> located in the trochlear notch diminishes when the dogs gets older. The height of the step between radius and ulna was measured with two different parameters. There was no relation between the step and an increasing degree of arthrotic changes. The radius of the <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle</b> was measured by both methods and {{is considered to be a}} measure of the size of the elbow joint. The radius of male dogs is larger than for female dogs. The degree of arthrotic alteration of the joint is not influenced by the size of the radius of the <b>humeral</b> <b>condyle.</b> MUES (2001) method led to similar findings. Four angles, arranged around the centre of the elbow joint were measured with MUES (2001) method. The size of two of these angles (angle PA and RA) increase when the arthrotic alteration of the joint gets more pronounced. Both are defined by points of the elbow joint, which are affected early by the formation of osteophytes, the anconeal process and the cranial point of the radius. These angles seems to be suitable to characterize secondary arthrotic changes in the joint. But they don´t describe changes in the morphology of the elbow. This would be necessary to detect a predisposition for elbow dysplasia before arthrotic alterations become visible. The angle UL of this measurement method includes the shape of the trochlear notch. The size of these angle has no clear connection with the degree of elbow dysplasia. By describing the shape of the trochlear notch with three parameters of the method of VIEHMANN (1998) it is possible to detect a predisposition for elbow dysplasia early. An elliptic trochlear notch of ulna is considered to benefit the development of elbow dysplasia...|$|R

These criteria {{have been used in}} several other studies for assessing outcomes in lateral condyle fractures [2, 9, 13]. In the author’s opinion, this grading system as {{used in the present study}} was easy to utilise and corresponded well with the patient’s clinical outcome.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{management}} of fractures of the <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> epicondyle is controversial, but the primary {{issue is the}} relationship of outcomes {{to the extent of}} fracture displacement. This study compares the use of radiographs and three-dimensional computed tomography for determining the amount of displacement in <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> epicondylar injuries deemed to be minimally displaced (< 5 mm) or nondisplaced. Methods: A retrospective review was performed on the cases of all patients with a fracture of the <b>medial</b> <b>humeral</b> epicondyle that had been diagnosed as minimally displaced or nondisplaced who were seen over a one-year period at our institution. Measurements of medial and anterior displacement on both the radiographs and three-dimensional computed tomography scan were recorded. Measurements of displacement were also recorded on internal oblique radiographs of the elbow, if available. Demographics, treatment, and any additional findings by computed tomography scans were noted. Means and Student t tests were utilized for statistical analysis. Results: The eleven patients whomet the inclusion criteria had amean age of 12. 2 years (range, 7. 3 to 15. 4 years). One fracture that involved the medial condyle on the computed tomography scan was excluded from the analysis. Anterior displacementwas immeasurable on all but one lateral radiograph and recorded as 0 mm; themeanwas 0. 9 mm,whichwas significantly less than the anterior displacement on the three-dimensional computed tomography scan (mean, 8. 8 mm; range, 0 to 15 mm) (p £ 0. 001). Conversely, mean medial displacement on anteroposterior radiographs was 3. 5 m...|$|R
