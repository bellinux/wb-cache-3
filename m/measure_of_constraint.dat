40|$|Waiver of State Immunity from <b>Measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>Constraint</b> and Access to Justice in Some Recent Judgments of the French Cour de Cassation. The French Supreme Court {{in three}} recent {{judgments}} of 28 March 2013 has interpreted restrictively {{the rules of}} general international law concerning waiver of State immunity from <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>constraint.</b> Assuming that those rules were to be considered as mirrored by {{the provisions of the}} United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property adopted on 2 December 2004, which is not yet in force, and providing a particularly narrow reading of the relevant rules which is not supported by a consistent State practice, the Cour de cassation considered a general waiver of immunity from execution, as contained in contracts for the issue of Argentine bonds subscribed by private investors, as inapplicable in respect of property of a foreign State to be used for governmental purposes, absent a specific mention of such property within the waiver clause. In extending to any category of State property to be used for governmental purposes a rule which is generally observed only in respect of specific categories of property, such as property pertaining to diplomatic or consular missions and military assets, the French Supreme Court unduly extended the scope of State immunity from <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>constraint,</b> thereby facing the risk of having France being held liable for a violation of the right of access to a court, as guaranteed by Article 6, par. 1, European Convention of Human Rights.

For example, it is a partial order and forms a lattice over the set of constraint satisfaction problems. We illustrate the value of this measure by proving some properties about arc-consistency. For instance, we prove that enforcing arc-consistency either causes a domain wipeout or there exists an unique arcconsistent extension which is minimal with respect to our measure. We then extend these result to backtracking algorithms like MAC and FC which maintain (some level of) arc-consistency. For instance, we prove that MAC visits no more nodes on a tighter problem than on a looser problem. Finally we show how this tightness measure can be generalized to soft constraints. ...|$|E

A particular case {{is the study of}} combined optimal design and optimal control, or co-design, of smart artifacts where the artifact design and controller design objectives often compete. In the system-level co-design problem, the objective is usually the weighted sum of these two objectives. The preferred practice is to solve co-design problems in a sequential manner: design first, control next. The success of this approach depends on the form of coupling between the two subproblems. In this paper, the coupling vector derived for a system problem with unidirectional coupling is shown {{to be related to the}} alignment of competing objectives, as measured by the polar cone of objective gradients, in the bi-objective programming formulation.

We theoretically compare, {{with respect to}} arc-consistency, the proposed models of injection problems by using the <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>constraint</b> tightness parameterized by {{the level of the}} level of consistency being enforced [3].

These problems can be scheduling problems, combinatorial graph problems, cryptarithmetic puzzles, etc. For instance, the sport scheduling problem (modelled in [2] for even number of teams) with an odd number of teams amounts to finding, for each week, an injection from the set periods Θ slots into the set of teams. To model the graceful graph problem [1], an injection from the set of vertices into the set of labels, as well as a permutation of the set of edges ought to be found.

40|$|Abstract: In {{rigorous}} constrained global optimization, upper bounds on {{the objective}} function help {{to reduce the}} search space. Obtaining a rigorous upper bound on the objective requires finding a narrow box around an approximately feasible solution, which then must be verified to contain a feasible point.

In this paper we show that even when the verification of an approximate feasible point fails, the information extracted {{from the results of}} the local optimization can still be used in many cases to reduce the search space.

40|$|The {{global credit}} crisis of 2008 {{provides}} {{a unique opportunity}} to study the e¤ects of financing constraints on corporate behavior. Based on standard economic priors, we investigate whether this credit supply shock has a differential impact on the real and financial policies of credit constrained firms. In contrast to previous research, which has used proxies such as firm size and credit ratings to measure constraint, we survey 1, 050 CFOs in the U. S., Europe, and Asia and directly assess whether their firms are credit constrained. Our evidence shows that the impact of the financial crisis is severe on credit constrained firms, leading to deeper cuts in planned R&D, employment, and capital spending. These firms also burn through more cash, draw more heavily on lines of credit for fear banks will restrict access in the future, and sell more assets to fund their operations. Using our direct <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>constraint,</b> we also find that the inability to borrow externally causes many firms to bypass attractive investment projects, with 86 % of constrained U.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{primarily}} {{motivated by the}} dramatic shift over time in the investment propensities of U. S. firms away from capital expenditures and toward R&D. In analyses of corporate investment determinants, this shift prompts the need to account for individual firm's ex ante propensities to make alternative types of investment. We develop and test two modified 'q ' models of investment that account for such propensities. We also glean and test novel hypotheses from financial constraint theory about: (a) R&D intensity (lagged cash balance) as a determinant (measure) of constraint; and (b) the coefficients of internal cash flow and external financing variables in investment regressions. Empirically, we have four principal findings. First, two common practices in prior empirical studies, (a) scaling capital expenditure investment by PP&E, and (b) using samples of 'manufacturing ' firms for capital expenditure regressions without adjusting for R&D as an alternative investment type, result in severe biases. Second, our analysis of cash dynamics indicates that R&D intensity (lagged cash balance) is an important determinant (<b>measure)</b> <b>of</b> <b>constraint,</b> and constrained firms generally hoard cash from internal cash flow and external equity issues, but not from debt issues. Third, propensity regression provides stronger support for both 'q' and constraint theory than OLS/GLM regression alternatives.

An important channel for this correlation is the use of cash flow-based financial covenants by banks that supply credit lines. Firms must maintain high cash flow to remain compliant with covenants, and banks restrict firm access to credit facilities in response to covenant violations.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we first}} {{develop a new}} method called penalty {{function}} with memory (PFM). PFM consists of a penalty parameter and a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>constraint</b> violation and it converts a discrete optimization via simulation (DOvS) problem with stochastic constraints {{into a series of}} DOvS problems without stochastic constraints. PFM determines a penalty of a visited solution based on past results of feasibility checks on the solution. Specifically, assuming a minimization problem, a penalty parameter of PFM, namely the penalty sequence, diverges to infinity for an infeasible solution but converges to zero almost surely for any strictly feasible solution under certain conditions. For a feasible solution located on the boundary of feasible and infeasible regions, the sequence converges to zero either with high probability or almost surely. As a result, a DOvS algorithm combined with PFM performs well even when optimal solutions are tight or nearly tight. Second, we design an optimal water quality monitoring network for river systems. The problem is to find the optimal location of a finite number of monitoring devices, minimizing the expected detection time of a contaminant spill event while guaranteeing good detection reliability. When uncertainties in spill and rain events are considered, both the expected detection time and detection reliability need to be estimated by stochastic simulation. This problem is formulated as a stochastic DOvS problem with the objective of minimizing expected detection time and with a stochastic constraint on the detection reliability; and it is solved by a DOvS algorithm combined with PFM. Finally, we improve PFM by combining it with an approximate budget allocation procedure. We revise an existing optimal budget allocation procedure so that it can handle active constraints and satisfy necessary conditions for the convergence of PFM. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Historically, {{intimate}} partner {{violence has}} been ignored and minimized, despite its seriousness and widespread prevalence in our culture. In {{the past three}} decades, many studies have addressed {{the question of the}} impact of intimate partner violence on physical or mental health for victims (spouses, ex-partners and children). But, what about authors? Currently, due to the multifactorial character of the phenomenon of domestic violence, it is still difficult to estimate the impact of the existing therapeutic programs which offer a support for the authors of this violence. The current study sought to examine the association between trait impulsivity, alexithymia and depression and the perpetration of physical and psychological intimate partner violence. We focused on particular psychological characteristics that would seem to have much potential as an aid to understand this phenomenon and its prevention and/or treatment. Patients and methods Fifty-three male offenders were surveyed using self-report questionnaires to assess emotional distress (BDI), impulsive behavior (BIS- 11) and alexithymia (TAS- 20), the inability to experience and express subjective emotions, prior to therapeutic program participation. Results Findings indicated that both alexithymia and depression were significantly associated with violence perpetration. Analyses showed that male intimate partner violence offender reported more depressive feelings and more difficulties to express his emotions than did general population. Furthermore, there are positive and significant correlations between alexithymia, impulsivity and depression. Therefore, if male offenders have difficulties to describe and identify their emotions, they will tend to have more depressive symptoms and also more impulsive behavior. However, we do not observe a difference between men who consult voluntarily therapeutic programs and those who have been forced by legal <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>constraint.</b> Conclusions The present findings continue to suggest a strong link between alexithymia and domestic violence as showed by others studies. Additional researches are clearly needed and may lead not only {{to a better understanding of}} aggression but also to the development of better therapeutic interventions. À l’heure actuelle, de par le caractère multifactoriel du phénomène de violence conjugale, il est encore difficile d’évaluer l’impact des programmes thérapeutiques existants qui offrent un accompagnement pour les auteurs de cette violence. Cinquante-trois hommes, consultant de manière volontaire ou sous contrainte de justice, ont été approchés afin d’évaluer la présence de caractéristiques psychologiques spécifiques (alexithymie, dépression et impulsivité) ainsi que leurs liens, pour constater une éventuelle fragilité qui pourrait expliquer le passage à l’acte violent. Nos analyses révèlent que, comparés à la population générale, l’alexithymie et la dépression sont majorées chez ces hommes. En outre, des corrélations positives et significatives se dessinent entre les trois dimensions psychologiques étudiées.

We make two main contributions: i) we introduce two new behaviorally-based <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> credit constraint; ii) we apply lessons learned from the parallel literature on borrowing by firms by using <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> balance-sheet condition and borrower-lender relationships to improve standard models <b>of</b> credit <b>constraints</b> and lending. Our findings on the determinants <b>of</b> credit <b>constraints</b> for consumers are generally consistent across the various proposed <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> the <b>constraints...</b>|$|R
