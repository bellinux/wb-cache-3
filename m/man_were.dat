5|$|Although {{sales for}} Mega <b>Man</b> <b>were</b> unimpressive, Capcom allowed the Rockman team {{to create a}} sequel. They worked {{concurrently}} on other Capcom projects, using their free time to develop the game. Unused content from the previous title was integrated into Mega Man 2. Takashi Tateishi composed the soundtrack, with Yoshihiro Sakaguchi serving as a sound programmer.|$|E
5|$|As {{little as}} 15lb (7kg) of {{uranium-235}} {{can be used}} to make an atomic bomb. The first nuclear bomb used in war, Little Boy, relied on uranium fission, but the very first nuclear explosive (the Gadget used at Trinity) and the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki (Fat <b>Man)</b> <b>were</b> both plutonium bombs.|$|E
5|$|Following his graduation, Breckinridge {{returned}} to Kentucky {{with no clear}} direction in his life. He began to amuse himself by attending various parties and other social engagements. During {{a visit to the}} state capital, he so offended one man that he was challenged to a duel. Though he obtained two pistols, he never accepted the man's challenge, and was branded a coward. The dispute was later settled in the Masonic Lodge of which both Breckinridge and the other <b>man</b> <b>were</b> members.|$|E

50|$|The law {{holds for}} the A and E {{proposition}}s of the Aristotelian square of opposition. For example, the A proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' and the E proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' cannot both be true {{at the same}} time, since {{no one can be}} honest and not honest at the same time. But both can be false, if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, and some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not. For if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, the proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false. And if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not honest, the proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false also.|$|R
50|$|A {{universal}} affirmative proposition, such as, 'Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' and {{a universal}} negative proposition {{having the same}} subject and predicate, such as, 'No <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white,' are called contrary. A universal affirmative proposition ("Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white") and the non-universal denial of that proposition in a way ("Some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not white") are called contradictories. Of contradictories, one must be true, the other false. Contraries cannot both be true, although they can both be false, and hence their contradictories are both true (for example, both, 'Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest,' and 'No <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest,' are false. But their contradictories, 'Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not honest,' and, 'Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest,' are both true.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the ill-fated}} 1263 {{expedition}} of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides {{along with the}} Isle of <b>Man,</b> <b>were</b> yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland {{a result of the}} 1266 Treaty of Perth. Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and placenames, the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited. The best known find from this time is the Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real <b>Man,</b> <b>were</b> quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to an hour a day.|$|E
5|$|The Mega Man series from Archie Comics went on hiatus {{before it}} could reach an {{adaptation}} of Mega Man 5, but some characters and elements from the game were foreshadowed. In particular, the final issue saw Dr. Light experience {{a vision of the}} events of this game, noting that it seemed as thought Proto <b>Man</b> <b>were</b> attacking but that something seemed wrong.|$|E
5000|$|Universal {{statements}} <b>are</b> contraries: 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just' and 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just' {{cannot be}} true together, although {{one may be}} true and the other false, and also both may be false (if at least one <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just, {{and at least one}} <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not just).|$|R

5|$|The Pittenweem witches {{were five}} Scottish women accused of {{witchcraft}} {{in the small}} fishing village of Pittenweem in Fife {{on the east coast}} of Scotland in 1704. Another two women and a <b>man</b> <b>were</b> named as accomplices. Accusations made by a teenage boy, Patrick Morton, against a local woman, Beatrix Laing, led to the death in prison of Thomas Brown, and, in January 1705, the murder of Janet Cornfoot by a lynch mob in the village.|$|E
5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a <b>man,</b> <b>were</b> called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Bróðir and Óspak of <b>Man</b> <b>were</b> two Danish {{brothers}} who {{were active in}} the Isle of Man and Ireland in the 11th century. They are mentioned in the 12th century Irish Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh and the 13th century Icelandic Njal's Saga as key leaders who fought on opposite sides in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. The latter account names Bróðir as the killer of Brian Boru, the High King of Ireland. Both Boru and Bróðir died in the battle, although accounts differ as to who killed whom. Óspak fought {{on the side of}} Boru, was injured, and lost his two sons in the battle.|$|E
50|$|Another logical {{opposition}} {{implied by}} this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is 'alternation' (alternatio), consisting of 'subalternation' and 'superalternation'. Alternation is a relation between a particular statement and a universal {{statement of the}} same quality such that the particular is implied by the other. The particular is the subaltern of the universal, which is the particular's superaltern. For example, if 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true, its contrary 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is false. Therefore the contradictory 'some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true. Similarly the universal 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' implies the particular 'not every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white'.|$|R

60|$|But, I say, what is {{the reason}} some so prize what others so despise, since they both stand in need of the same grace and mercy of God in Christ? Why, the one sees, and the other sees nothing, of this woeful miserable state. And thus have I showed you the {{necessity}} of a broken heart. 1. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> dead, and must <b>be</b> quickened. 2. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a fool, and must be made wise. 3. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> proud, and must <b>be</b> humbled. 4. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> self-willed, and must <b>be</b> broken. 5. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> fearless, and must be made to consider. 6. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a false believer, and must <b>be</b> rectified. 7. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a lover of sin, and must be weaned from it. 8. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> wild, and must <b>be</b> tamed. 9. <b>Man</b> disrelishes the things of God, and can take no savour in them, until his heart is broken.|$|R
5|$|Eventually, {{similarities}} between Pithecanthropus erectus (Java Man) and Sinanthropus pekinensis (Peking Man) led Ernst Mayr to rename both Homo erectus in 1950, placing them {{directly in the}} human evolutionary tree. To distinguish Java Man from other Homo erectus populations, some scientists began to regard it as a subspecies, Homo erectus erectus, in the 1970s. Other fossils found {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century in Java at Sangiran and Mojokerto, all older than those found by Dubois, are also considered part of the species Homo erectus. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery the fossils of Java <b>Man</b> <b>were</b> the oldest hominin fossils ever found. The fossils of Java Man have been housed at the Naturalis in the Netherlands since 1900.|$|E
5|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} the Columbia's watershed {{for more than}} 15,000years, with a transition to a sedentary lifestyle based mainly on salmon starting about 3,500years ago. In 1962, archaeologists found evidence of human activity dating back 11,230years at the Marmes Rockshelter, near {{the confluence of the}} Palouse and Snake rivers in eastern Washington. In 1996 the skeletal remains of a 9,000-year-old prehistoric man (dubbed Kennewick <b>Man)</b> <b>were</b> found near Kennewick, Washington. The discovery rekindled debate in the scientific community over the origins of human habitation in North America and sparked a protracted controversy over whether the scientific or Native American community was entitled to possess and/or study the remains.|$|E
5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} guilty verdict in Paine's trial {{as a sign}} that further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of <b>Man</b> <b>were</b> prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted as a prelude to the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring to bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E

50|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 21 September 1995, five local <b>men</b> <b>were</b> arrested on {{suspicion}} of murder in co-ordinated early morning raids.

5000|$|... 'Contrary' (medieval: contrariae) statements, {{are such}} that both cannot {{at the same time}} be true. Examples of these are the {{universal}} affirmative 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white', and the universal negative 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white'. These cannot be true at the same time. However, these are not contradictories because both of them may be false. For example, it is false that every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white, since some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not white. Yet it is also false that no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white, since there <b>are</b> some white <b>men.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces {{had already}} {{commenced}} work on improving the design. The North American B-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Martin XB-48, and Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers, {{then on the}} drawing boards, had bomb bays sized to carry the Grand Slam, which was much longer but not {{as wide as the}} Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat <b>Man</b> <b>were</b> the B-29 and the Convair B-36. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs. At the time there were only two sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design {{to make it easier to}} manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime Project W-47 was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in <b>Man</b> <b>were</b> subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} sound film {{released}} by Tan's, but far from {{the first in the}} Indies. The earliest sound films released in the Indies, Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow <b>Man,</b> <b>were</b> both shown in 1929. The following year, a domestic part-talkie, G. Krugers' Karnadi Anemer Bangkong, was also released, becoming the first domestic sound film. Two other directors had followed with full-talkies in 1931: The Teng Chun with Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang and the Wong brothers with Indonesia Malaise. In order to ensure the quality of the sound, Tan's hired Krugers and his single-system camera to do the cinematography and sound direction for this black-and-white film.|$|E

5|$|Von Koenigswald {{also made}} several discoveries in Sangiran, Central Java, where more fossils of early humans were {{discovered}} between 1936 and 1941. Among the discoveries was a skullcap of similar size to that found by Dubois at the Trinil 2 site. Von Koenigswald's discoveries in Sangiran {{convinced him that}} all these skulls belonged to early humans. Dubois again refused to acknowledge the similarity. Ralph von Koenigswald and Franz Weidenreich compared the fossils from Java and Zhoukoudian and concluded that Java Man and Peking <b>Man</b> <b>were</b> closely related. Dubois died in 1940, still refusing to recognize their conclusion, and official reports remain critical of the Sangiran site's poor presentation and interpretation.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of this period the boundaries of Alba contained only a small proportion of modern Scotland. Even when these lands were added to in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the term Scotia was applied in sources only to the region between the River Forth, the central Grampians and the River Spey and only began to be used to describe all of the lands under the authority of the Scottish crown from {{the second half of the}} twelfth century. By the late thirteenth century when the Treaty of York (1237) and Treaty of Perth (1266) had fixed the boundaries with the Kingdom of the Scots with England and Norway respectively, its borders were close to the modern boundaries. After this time both Berwick and the Isle of <b>Man</b> <b>were</b> lost to England, and Orkney and Shetland were gained from Norway in the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy {{took his}} men {{around the bend}} behind cover, then sent his American medic, Corporal John Alan Coey of Columbus, Ohio, {{out into the open}} {{streambed}} to render medical assistance. Though his prominent Red Cross flag was clearly visible, the hidden cadres immediately opened fire on Coey, who was killed almost instantly by a shot through the head. His body fell at du Plooy's feet. The stand-off continued {{for the rest of the}} day, during which time du Plooy and one other RLI <b>man</b> <b>were</b> wounded. The security forces were only able to gather their dead for evacuation when darkness fell. During the night, the Rhodesians deployed stops in ambush positions around the insurgents' position to prevent an escape. When the guerrillas attempted to sneak through the security force perimeter in the early hours, they ran into Corporal Jannie de Beer's RLI men and a fire fight ensued; the nationalists shot de Beer dead and wounded one of his troopers as they broke through and quickly left the area. The morale of 2 Commando's men took a noticeable hit after this unsuccessful Fireforce in which the cadres had killed four Rhodesian soldiers and wounded four more.|$|E
