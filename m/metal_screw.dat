25|$|Violins are tuned {{by turning}} the pegs in the pegbox under the scroll, or by {{adjusting}} the fine tuner screws at the tailpiece. All violins have pegs; fine tuners (also called fine adjusters) are optional. Most fine tuners consist of a <b>metal</b> <b>screw</b> that moves a lever attached to the string end. They permit very small pitch adjustments much more easily than the pegs. By turning one clockwise, the pitch becomes sharper (as the string is under more tension) and turning one counterclockwise, the pitch becomes flatter (as the string is under less tension). Fine tuners on {{all four of the}} strings are a practical necessity for playing steel-core strings, and some players use them with synthetic strings as well. Since modern E strings are steel, a fine tuner is typically fitted for that string. Fine tuners are not used with gut strings, which are more elastic than steel or synthetic-core strings and do not respond adequately to the very small movements of fine tuners.|$|E
2500|$|A screw spike, rail screw or {{lag bolt}} {{is a large}} (~ length, {{slightly}} under [...] diameter) <b>metal</b> <b>screw</b> used to fix a tie plate or to directly fasten a rail. Screw spikes are screwed into a hole bored in the sleeper.

40|$|Because of {{the good}} initial {{fixation}} strength of interfer-ence screws used in anterior cruciate ligament recon-struction, <b>metal</b> interference <b>screws</b> have become the standard method for fixation of bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts. To avoid some of the complications with <b>metal</b> <b>screws,</b> a bioabsorbable interference screw was developed. Data on fixation strength in older human cadavers indicate a similar failure strength between bioabsorbable and <b>metal</b> <b>screws.</b> We studied the fail-ure mechanisms, insertion torques, and fixation strengths of absorbable and <b>metal</b> interference <b>screws</b> in cadaveric knees from young and middle-aged do-nors.

40|$|The {{rigidity}} and firmness {{of wooden}} construction and furniture those {{are joined by}} <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> depend on corrosion rate of these metals. This paper examines the weight-loss percentage of <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> used in wood samples that have been treated with water-borne preser vative (i. e. 3 % borax boric acid and 3 % diffusol CB) and concurrently investigates the effect of brake fluid on preventing metal corrosion. Wood samples tested included three acacia and one eucalypts wood species which were grouped into sapwood and heartwood containing samples. Wood samples fastened with <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> were freely suspended in glass jars that contained 25 ml of sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) to keep the humidity rate above 90 %. After 12 months, the <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> lost their weight due to the corrosion {{brought about by the}} related factors either in separate individual or in combination, which comprised brake and fluid-dipping, wood species, wood portion (sapwood and heartwood), kinds of preser vatives used. Corrosion rates of <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> fastened in eucalypts wood sample as indicated by the screw-weight loss (i. e. 5. 8 %) was more severe than that fastened in acacia wood. Furthermore, corrosion rate of <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> as fixed firmly in sapwood sample proceeded faster than that in heartwood. This might be caused by the higher moisture content in sapwood. On the other hand, corrosion rate of the screws as fastened in waterborne-preser vative-treated wood samples was greater than that in non-preser ved wood due to electrokinetic characteristics and ionic potential exhibited by the preser vative thereby intensif ying the screw-corrosion process. Meanwhile, less severe corrosion was obser ved and recorded on the screws pre-dipped in brake fluid compared to those on the non-dipped screw...|$|R

40|$|In this research, {{effects of}} screw diameter, screw type, panel type, and end {{distance}} on lateral {{resistance of the}} joints made with drywall and sheet <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> were studied in bagasse particleboard {{and the results were}} compared to those obtained from commercial medium density fiberboard (MDF). The accuracy of EYM in prediction of lateral resistance was then investigated. The drywall screws comprised of size 8 with coarse thread and size 10 with fine thread; the sheet <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> comprised of size 8 and 10 with normal thread. Results indicated that lateral resistance increased with the increase in the diameter of both screw types, although not statistically significant. The lateral resistance obtained from MDF specimens was 20 % more than that of bagasse specimens. Increase in the end distance also resulted in an increase in the lateral resistance. In all cases, sheet <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> showed higher lateral resistance in comparison to those obtained from drywall screws. It can be concluded that Mode IIIs is more accurate than Mode Is in the prediction of lateral resistance in two-member screwed joints (single shear plane) for both MDF and bagasse boards...|$|R
25|$|Implant failure may occur; the <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> and plate can break, back out, or cut out superiorly {{and enter}} the joint.

5000|$|Sheet <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> (sometimes called [...] "sheet-metal self-tappers", or P-K screws {{from the}} brand name Parker Kalon - who pioneered the {{manufacture}} of, but did not invent, these screws) are a type of self-tapping screw despite the thread created in the sheet of metal being small. Pan-head PK Self-tapping screws are common in electrical equipment, while flatter-headed truss or flat countersunk headed self-tapping screws are more common in aviation applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{prepared}} piano, {{present in}} some contemporary art {{music from the}} 20th and 21st century is a piano with objects placed inside it to alter its sound, or has had its mechanism changed in some other way. The scores for music for prepared piano specify the modifications, for example instructing the pianist to insert pieces of rubber, paper, <b>metal</b> <b>screws,</b> or washers in between the strings. These either mute the strings or alter their timbre. A harpsichord-like sound can be produced by placing or dangling small metal buttons {{in front of the}} hammer. Adding an eraser between the bass strings produces a mellow, thumpy sound reminiscent of the plucked double bass. Inserting <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> or washers can cause the piano to make a jangly sound as these metal items vibrate against the strings. In 1954 a German company exhibited a wire-less piano at the Spring Fair in Frankfurt, Germany that sold for US$238. The wires were replaced by metal bars of different alloys that replicated the standard wires when played. A similar concept is used in the electric-acoustic Rhodes piano.|$|R
5000|$|After {{hundreds}} {{of the original}} TBF-1 models were built, the TBF-1C began production. The allotment of space for specialized internal and wing-mounted fuel tanks doubled the Avenger's range. By 1943, Grumman began to slowly phase out production of the Avenger to produce F6F Hellcat fighters, and the Eastern Aircraft Division of General Motors took over production, with these aircraft being designated TBM. The Eastern Aircraft plant was located in Ewing, NJ. Grumman delivered a TBF-1, held together with sheet <b>metal</b> <b>screws,</b> so that the automotive engineers could disassemble it, a part at a time, and redesign the aircraft for automotive style production. This aircraft {{was known as the}} [...] "P-K Avenger" [...] (P-K = Parker-Kalon, manufacturer of sheet <b>metal</b> <b>screws).</b> Starting in mid-1944, the TBM-3 began production (with a more powerful powerplant and wing hardpoints for drop tanks and rockets). The dash-3 was the most numerous of the Avengers (with about 4,600 produced). However, most of the Avengers in service were dash-1s until {{near the end of the}} war in 1945.|$|R
50|$|Professional bassists {{are more}} likely to have {{adjustable}} bridges, which have a <b>metal</b> <b>screw</b> mechanism. This enables the bassist to raise or lower the height of the strings to accommodate changing humidity or temperature conditions. The metal tuning machines are attached to the sides of the pegbox with metal screws. While tuning mechanisms generally differ from the higher-pitched orchestral stringed instruments, some basses have non-functional, ornamental tuning pegs projecting from the side of the pegbox, in imitation of the tuning pegs on a cello or violin.|$|E
50|$|The defi (sometimes called daire {{in other}} areas) {{is a fairly}} large frame drum with metal bangles. Similar to a {{tambourine}} in construction, the defi is made with a <b>metal</b> <b>screw</b> system so that the head can be tightened and tuned. It is popular in many forms all over Greece, especially in the mainland klarino music. The defi is particularly popular in the Epirus region of northwestern Greece, where they are still handmade today. They have a low tone, and the bangles are low pitched as well.|$|E
50|$|The <b>metal</b> <b>screw</b> did {{not become}} a common {{fastener}} until machine tools for their mass production were developed {{toward the end of}} the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s along two separate paths that soon converged: the mass production of wood screws screws made of metal to be used in wood in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, toolroom-style production of machine screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).|$|E
30|$|Graft {{fixation}} with interference screws {{is one of}} the standard procedures in ACL and PCL reconstruction. Owing to their sharp edges, <b>metal</b> interference <b>screws</b> can cause graft irritation [28] problems during potential revision procedures [11, 15] as well as MRI artefacts. Therefore, <b>metal</b> interference <b>screws</b> are no longer recommended for graft fixation in ACL reconstruction [28]. Revision rates of 5 – 10 % after ACL reconstruction [15] are another argument for bioabsorbable implants.|$|R

50|$|Sheet {{assembly}} of light aircraft is accomplished predominantly with rivets of alloys 2017-T4, 2117-T4, or 2024-T4. Self-tapping sheet <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> {{are available in}} aluminum alloys, but cadmium-plated steel screws are employed more commonly to obtain higher shear strength and driveability. Alloy 2024-T4 with an anodic coating is standard for aluminum screws, bolts, and nuts made to military specifications. Alloy 6262-T9, however, is superior for nuts, because of its virtual immunity to stress-corrosion cracking.|$|R
