The vacuum heads were not on at this time but the vacuum shell was on covering the piping penetrating into the inner vessel. Signal boxes with all feed through boards, the instrumentation box, and high voltage boxes were all installed with their pump outs capped. All 1 / 4 -inch instrumentation lines were terminated at their respective shutoff valves. All vacuum piping used for pumping down the inner vessel was isolated using o-ring sealed blind flanges. PV 215 A (VAT Series 12), the 4 -inch VRC gate valve isolating the cyropump, and the rupture disk {{had to be removed}} and replaced with blind flanges before pressurizing due to their pressure limitations. Stresses in plates used as blind flanges were checked using Code calcualtions. Before the CC test, vacuum style blanks and clamps were hydrostatically pressure tested to 150 % of the <b>maximum</b> <b>test</b> <b>pressure,</b> 60 psig. The Code inspector and Research Division Safety had all given their approval to the test pressure and procedure prior to filling the vessel with argon. The test was a major success. Based on the lack of any distinguishable pressure drop indicated on the pressure gages, the vessel appeared to be structurally sound throughout the duration of the test (approx. 3 hrs.). A major leak in the instrumentation tubing was discovered at half of the <b>maximum</b> <b>test</b> <b>pressure</b> and was quickly isolated by crimping and capping with a compression fitting. There were some slight deviations in the actual procedure used. The 44 psig relief valve located just outside the cleanroom had to be capped until the pressure in the vessel indicated 38 psi. This was to allow higher supply pressures and hence, higher flows through the pressurizing line. Also, in order to get pressure readings at the cryostat without exposing any personnel to the potentially dangerous stored energy near the <b>maximum</b> <b>test</b> <b>pressure,</b> a camera was installed {{at the top of the}} vessel to view the indicator mounted there. The monitor was viewed at the ante room adjacent to the cleanroom. The holding pressure of 32 psig (4 / 5 of the <b>maximum</b> <b>test</b> <b>pressure)</b> was only maintained for about 20 minutes instead of the half hour recommendation in the procedure. We felt that this was sufficient time to Snoop test and perform the pressure drop test. After the test was completed, the inspector for CBI Na-Con and the Research Divison Safety Officer signed all of required documentation...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 46 - 59 The current {{centrifugal}} compressor {{design for the}} Oil & Gas market {{is more and more}} challenging since the cost requirements and the presence of many competitors is pushing towards casing size reduction and rotational speed increase. The first requirement basically leads {{to increase the number of}} wheels per rotor and the second to cross more critical speeds requiring the proper degree of damping. The two consequences together lead also to increase the rotor flexibility ratio (defined as the ratio between the Maximum Continuous Speed and the first critical speed as per the Fulton diagram and API 617 7 th ed. [1 - 2]) and finally the rotordynamic stability is very much challenged. The {{centrifugal compressor}}s rotordynamic stability is then strictly related to the internal seals? dynamic behaviour and for this reason the authors? Company decided several years ago to develop internally a High Pressure Seal Test Rig to measure seals? stiffness and damping. The rig is now in operation. This paper aims to describe the main test rig capabilities, the applied identification procedures and the preliminary test results on a long labyrinth seal (smooth rotor - straight toothed stator). Due to the pressure level (500 bar design pressure), the test rig plant appears like a high-pressure industrial plant equipped with the testing cell (a 1 : 1 scale high pressure compressor) and all the relevant auxiliaries: a 400 kW electric motor (driven by a VFD), a speed increaser gear box, a high pressure reservoir (6 m 3) with a volumetric compressor to fill it, high pressure pipes and valves. The testing cell is composed of a high-pressure compressor casing with stator parts capable to regulate the seal inlet swirl and a rotor running on Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs), which serve as exciters (5 kN MAX Force over a 0 - 330 Hz frequency range per axis) and displacement transducers. Special instrumentation is installed into the testing cell in order to measure the main test parameters: seal upstream/downstream gas pressure, upstream temperature and swirl and mass flow. Industrial high-pressure instrumentation is installed on the plant for regulation and monitoring purpose. <b>Maximum</b> <b>test</b> <b>pressure</b> is 350 bar and maximum rotational speed is 15000 rpm. Test gas is nitrogen. The AMBs control-system capabilities have been tuned to define several alternative excitation patterns and the relevant state of the art identification techniques have been applied. The first seal tested is a long labyrinth seal to simulate a centrifugal compressor balance piston seal. Test results and comparison with a commercial bulk flow code predictions will be fully described. Finally, the future test program will be showed...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} to study boundary-layer transition on six axisymmetrical blunt bodies of revolution. Model shapes were selected with respect to the degree of favorable pressure gradient over the model surface. Tests were conducted at a Mach number of 2. 20 and over a range of free-stream Reynolds number per foot of about 1. 4 x 10 (exp 6) to 6. 5 x 10 (exp 6). The tests were made at an angle of attack of 0 deg. with zero heat transfer. For the hemisphere, the flow remained essentially laminar over the model surface length for the entire pressure range of the tests. For a strong favorable pressure gradient followed by any weak favorable, neutral, or adverse gradient, the tendency was for transition to occur at or immediately behind the shoulder. A single strip of three-dimensional roughness in the region of strong favorable pressure gradient did not fix transition on the models at the roughness location except at the <b>maximum</b> <b>test</b> <b>pressures,</b> whereas a second roughness strip added in a region of neutral or adverse pressure gradient did fix transition. Experimental pressure coefficients agreed closely with modified Newtonian theory except in the shoulder region...|$|R
40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} testing of the EC hydraulic drive cylinder. The test was done {{to insure that the}} cylinder could operate at the desired compression. The purpose of the test was to determine the deflection of the cylinder rod at a pressure of 7000 psi. This note includes an explanation of the procedure used and a summary of the result of the testing done on May 1, 1991 by Gary Trotter. The purpose for load testing the cylinder was to insure that it could operate at the pressures required. These pressures were calculated in EN 254, with the appropriate safety factors included. Another engineering note to refer to is note 3740. 510 -EN- 298, which explains {{the testing of}} the cylinder relief valve, and the effect of the difference in cross-sectional areas on the forces involved. The general result of this load test was that the cylinder could operate safely at the design pressures. Since the rod was tested in compression, calculations were required {{in order to determine the}} buckling force of the rod. The <b>maximum</b> cylinder <b>test</b> <b>pressure</b> was based on the allowable force on the rod for elastic buckling. This force was calculated using two methods, a simple Euler column calculation, and an AISC method...|$|R

They may also suffer from respiratory dysfunctions. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on pulmonary function and functional capacity of patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. Methods: Forty adult patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis were prospectively studied and randomized into two groups (control n = 20 and treatment n = 20). The treatment group underwent bilateral femoral quadriceps muscles electrical stimulation for 30 minutes during hemodialysis, three times per week, for two months. The patients were evaluated by pulmonary function <b>test,</b> <b>maximum</b> respiratory <b>pressures,</b> <b>maximum</b> one-repetition <b>test,</b> and six-minute walk test (6 MWT), before and after the treatment protocol. Results: The treatment group presented increased maximum inspiratory (MIP) (p = 0. 02) and expiratory pressures (MEP) (p < 0. 0001), muscular strength in <b>maximum</b> one-repetition <b>test</b> (p < 0. 001), and distance covered in the 6 MWT (p = 0. 03), and decreased systolic blood pressure (p < 0. 001) and respiratory frequency (p < 0. 001) when compared with the control group.

40|$|Consideration {{of plastic}} {{anisotropy}} {{is essential in}} accurate simulations of metal forming processes. In this study, finite element (FE) simulations have been performed to predict the plastic anisotropy of sheet metals using a texture- and microstructure-based constitutive model. The effect of crystallographic texture is incorporated {{through the use of}} an anisotropic plastic potential in strain-rate space, which give's the shape of the yield locus. The effect of dislocation is captured by use of a hardening model with four internal variables, which characterize the position {{and the size of the}} yield locus. Two applications are presented to evaluate the accuracy and the efficiency of the model: a cup drawing test and a two-stage pseudo-orthogonal sequential test (biaxial stretching in hydraulic bulging followed by uniaxial tension), using an interstitial-free steel sheet. The experimental results of earing behavior in the cup drawing <b>test,</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>pressure</b> and strain distribution in bulging, and transient hardening in the sequential test are compared against the FE predictions. It is shown that the current model is capable of predicting the plastic anisotropy induced by both the texture and the strain-path change. The relative significance of texture and strain-path change in the predictions is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In some areas, e. g., {{statistical}} genetics, it {{is common}} to apply a <b>maximum</b> <b>test,</b> where the <b>maximum</b> of several competing test statistics is used as a new statistic, and the permutation distribution of the maximum is used for inference.

The 30 -year old idea of adaptive statistical tests is more flexible than previously thought when permutation tests are used, and the selector statistic is calculated for every permutation. Because the independence between the selector and the test statistics is no longer needed, the test statistics themselves can be used as selectors. Then, the <b>maximum</b> <b>tests</b> fit into the concept of adaptive tests.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that useful bio-based amphiphilic polymers {{can be produced}} enzymatically at a mild temperature, in a solvent-free system and using renewably sourced monomers, by exploiting the unique properties of supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2). We present {{the use of a}} novel near-ambient temperature approach to prepare renewable amphiphilic ABA copolymers in scCO 2. Bio-based commercially available monomers have been polymerised to prepare chains with targeted molecular weight. The amphiphilic materials were prepared by end-capping the synthesised polymers with methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) chains in a one-pot high pressure reaction utilising Candida Antarctica Lipase B (CaLB) as a catalyst at a temperature as low as 35 °C. The block copolymers are characterised by 1 H-NMR, GPC and DSC in order to carefully assess their structural and thermal properties.

40|$|For the {{non-parametric}} two-sample location problem, adaptive tests {{based on}} a selector statistic are compared with a maximum and a sum test, respectively.

The sets of resistance exercise consisted of 15 repetitions at ~ 50 % of the estimated 1 repetition <b>maximum</b> <b>test.</b> Systolic blood <b>pressure</b> (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured at rest and during 1 h of recovery in both experimental sessions. After that, blood pressure reactivity (BPR) was evaluated using the Cold Pressor Test. Results: During 1 h of exercise recovery, there was a reduction in SBP (3 - 6 mmHg) and DBP (2 - 5 mmHg) in relation to pre-session rest (p< 0. 01), while this reduction was not observed in the control session. A decline in BPR (4 - 7 mmHg; p< 0. 01) was observed 1 h post-exercise session, {{but not in the}} control session. Post-exercise reductions in SBP and DBP were significantly correlated with BPR reductions (r= 0. 50 - 0. 45; p< 0. 05).
