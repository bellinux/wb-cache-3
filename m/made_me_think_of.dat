25|$|I {{knew all}} I {{needed to know}} for my {{appropriation}} of the concept to work for me. In my midtwenties I felt powerless and persecuted. What did the world want me for? The title <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{an entire generation of}} Lolitas: someone—our parents? God?—needed us to be there, but the need felt neurotic and uncompassionate. In “We Love You Carol and Alison” (my favorite Game Theory song) I'm trying to express that teen alienation thing that the kids go for, but I’m also fishing around for a basis of proper adulthood.|$|E
500|$|I really don't {{know where}} I'd be today if I {{had not gone}} to Mecca to make Hajj shortly after Malcolm was assassinated. ... That is what helped put me back on track. ... Going to Mecca, making Hajj, was very good for me because it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{all the people in}} the world who loved me and were for me, who prayed that I would get my life back together. I stopped {{focusing}} on the people who were trying to tear me and my family apart.|$|E
500|$|... "My mother {{growing up}} was really, really close friends with an Indian woman. She {{ended up having}} an {{arranged}} marriage oddly enough and I remember going to her wedding {{and it was one}} of the only weddings that I've EVER been to, besides my own mother's, and it was the biggest party, the most fun ever. So when I was doing 'Bounce', you know I don't actually drink or smoke so I thought I don't wanna do a video in a club like poppin' bottles and all this stuff, although the song's about partying. I [...] do a celebration... and it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that experience with my mother's friend going to an Indian wedding and having the most crazy and amazing time and I though I wanna do an Indian wedding! And I wanna do it in India! And I wanna do it properly...and I put an elephant in there for good luck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> more <b>of</b> Arthur than I did before. I couldn't {{be jealous}} of that far-away divinity {{that he used}} to worship, for I was going to have him myself. And I began to look upon him as a saint on earth, just as old lady Gurley did.|$|R
5000|$|The Guardian {{observed}} that [...] "In music, you only cover {{the work of}} an artist you admire. In Joke Thieves, you don't have that choice. The event <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> less <b>of</b> the opportunities for cover-version comedy than the obstacles to it - how possessive comics are of their material; how blurred is the line between a comic's material and their very soul." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, May, {{and poor}} Charlie {{was the first}} to make me feel as if I were a little selfish, though that as you know, is not one of my {{conspicuous}} failings! His straightforwardness angered me a little at first, but his kindness <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> much <b>of</b> what he said, and--well, the upshot of it all is that I am going to California." ...|$|R
500|$|During an {{interview}} for Rowland’s segment in the iheartradio concert series, {{it was revealed that}} [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] had made Rowland cry. [...] She said “the first time I heard the song it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> all of the relationships where I had to wear rose colored glasses,” in particular noting her past “toxic relationships” and “situations where I needed to leave” as the causes of her Rowland’s tears. Later it was revealed that the song had made Rowland’s vocals swell. During {{an interview}} for The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland spoke of the songs she had recorded for her third studio album. When speaking of [...] "Rose Colored Glasses", she said that it had taken its toll on her, “It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen." [...] She also expressed her pleasure at being able to sing about her experiences.|$|E
500|$|Both {{the public}} and critics were unnerved {{by the sight of}} the work. Russell {{describes}} being shocked by [...] "images so unrelievedly awful that the mind shut with a snap at the sight of them. Their anatomy was half-human, half-animal, and they were confined in a low-ceilinged, windowless and oddly proportioned space. They could bite, probe, and suck, and they had very long eel-like necks, but their functioning in other respects was mysterious. Ears and mouths they had, but two at least of them were sightless." [...] Writing for Apollo magazine, Herbert Furst recalled, [...] "I, I must confess, was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that I was glad to escape from this exhibition. Perhaps it was the red [...] background that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> entrails, of an anatomy or a vivisection and feel squeamish. [...] The triptych caused a sensation, and overnight turned Bacon into the most controversial painter in the country.|$|E
500|$|Individual {{episodes of}} the series contain {{additional}} references to the Sherlock Holmes tales. The main patient in the pilot episode is named Rebecca Adler after Irene Adler, a character in the first Holmes short story, [...] "A Scandal in Bohemia". In the season two finale, House is shot by a crazed gunman credited as [...] "Moriarty", the name of Holmes's nemesis. In the season four episode [...] "It's a Wonderful Lie", House receives a [...] "second-edition Conan Doyle" [...] as a Christmas gift. [...] In the season five episode [...] "The Itch", House is seen picking up his keys and Vicodin {{from the top of}} a copy of Conan Doyle's The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. In another season five episode, [...] "Joy to the World", House, in an attempt to fool his team, uses a book by Joseph Bell, Conan Doyle's inspiration for Sherlock Holmes. The volume had been given to him the previous Christmas by Wilson, who included the message [...] "Greg, <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> you." [...] Before acknowledging that he gave the book to House, Wilson tells two of the team members that its source was a patient, Irene Adler. [...] The series finale pays homage to Holmes's apparent death in [...] "The Final Problem", the 1893 story with which Conan Doyle originally intended to conclude the Holmes chronicles.|$|E
60|$|In {{the midst}} of this came Mrs. Henry into the room; she was very far gone, Miss Katharine being due in about six weeks, which <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> less <b>of</b> her beauty at the first sight; and she used me with more of condescension than the rest; so that, upon all accounts, I kept her in the third place of my esteem.|$|R
60|$|What <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> {{directly}} <b>of</b> Miss Staveley? What <b>made</b> <b>me</b> mad {{to know if}} she was {{the charming}} girl? I was bold enough to ask the question. Mrs. Staveley turned to me with that mischievous look which I have noticed already. I felt as if I had been running {{at the top of my}} speed, and had not got my breath again, yet.|$|R
6000|$|To-morrow {{comes the}} supper of the St. Martin’s Volunteers; and [...] after that I hope to close my lips until February. The scene last [...] night(97) was very {{different}} from that of Monday; but very [...] remarkable, and even more enthusiastic. I was the only layman [...] among five hundred lawyers; and it <b>made</b> <b>me,</b> wickedly, <b>think</b> <b>of</b> my [...] position when locked alone in the Naples gaol.|$|R
2500|$|... "her work is {{steeped in}} film theory and very skilfully edited. But it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> better film-artists {{who ought to}} have won." [...] - The Observer ...|$|E
2500|$|Lake's {{daughter}} Agnes Kirsopp Lake Michels was a noted classical scholar. [...] In {{later years}} she {{reflected on the}} impact he had on her life: [...] "my general interests should be attributed mainly {{to the influence of}} my father who was a New testament scholar with a classical education and a passionate love of beauty. [...] He told me the stories of the classics and, long before I could understand them, read to me a strange assortment of Browning and the Bible; Swinburne, Tennyson, and Josephus. [...] His attitude to his own work <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> scholarship as the opening to a world of adventure, not as a retirement from reality." [...] His grandson Anthony Lake is a diplomat.|$|E
2500|$|Ester Dean and Dr. Luke {{also worked}} on the album, {{respectively}} writing and producing the other US lead single [...] "Rose Colored Glasses". The song's lyrics portray [...] "the issues that arise when one plays the fool in a relationship." [...] During Rowland's concert series for iheartradio, the singer took time out {{to reflect on the}} song. She recalled, [...] "The first time I heard the song it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> all of the relationships where I had to wear rose-colored glasses." [...] It was also revealed that, during the studio recording session with Dean, she began to cry at the thought of all the [...] "toxic relationships" [...] she had been in [...] "where she needed to leave." [...] Later in an interview with The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland said that the song had taken its toll on her. She said [...] "It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen." [...] Dean also worked alongside Rowland during last minute studio sessions with producer Tricky Stewart, which spawned a female empowerment song called [...] "I'm Dat Chick". Although [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] was omitted from the US track listing, Dean's song [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] made the album appearing as the opening song. Written as a [...] "confidence-boosting" [...] anthem, [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] is built around an urban-electro club beat designed to get [...] "even shy women to come out of their shells" [...] according to Rap-Up magazine. Meanwhile, Dean's third contribution, [...] "Lay It on Me", features rapper Big Sean and centers on an up-tempo R melody with 808s and high NRG-led production. It features a [...] "tinkling piano" [...] melody and light R beat.|$|E
60|$|It was Christmas Eve, and I had to {{stir the}} pudding for next day, with a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with the load upon my leg (and that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> afresh <b>of</b> {{the man with the}} load on HIS leg), and found the {{tendency}} of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped away, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.|$|R
60|$|You {{should have}} seen those acres of people throw {{themselves}} down in that water and kiss it; kiss it, and pet it, and fondle it, and talk to {{it as if it}} were alive, and welcome it back with the dear names they gave their darlings, just as if it had been a friend who was long gone away and lost, and was come home again. Yes, it was pretty to see, and <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> more <b>of</b> them than I had done before.|$|R
60|$|Now I {{had heard}} {{much the same}} sort of story in other islands, and the same white powder always to the front, which <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> the less <b>of</b> it. For all that, I went over to Randall's place to see what I could pick up, and found Case on the doorstep, {{cleaning}} a gun.|$|R
60|$|The {{mention of}} a strong-bladed knife <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the dead seaman upon the brig.|$|E
6000|$|... "And while I {{worked it}} <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>Of</b> timber's varied doom; One inch where people eat and drink, The next inch in a tomb.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> everything. It made me work," [...] said Kate Cookham. She added, {{however, the}} next moment: [...] "But that's my story." ...|$|E
60|$|This oppressiveness, however, {{was broken}} by a far-distant cry, unlike any sound I had ever heard. Not sure of myself, I freed my ears from the {{blanketed}} hood and listened. It came again, a wild cry, that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> first <b>of</b> a lost child, and then of the mourning wolf of the north. It {{must have been a}} long distance off in the forest. An interval of some moments passed, then it pealed out again, nearer this time, and so human that it startled me. Moze raised his head and growled low in his throat and sniffed the keen air.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing would induce me," [...] {{the young}} man said to Maisie, [...] "to tell you what <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> so well <b>of</b> HER." [...] Having {{divested}} the child he kissed her gently and gave her a little pat to make her stand off. The pat was accompanied with a vague sigh in which his gravity of a moment before came back. [...] "All the same, if you hadn't had the fatal gift of beauty--" ...|$|R
6000|$|It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> shudder to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> so mutilating {{the body}} of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, {{beginning}} to shudder at the presence of this being, this UnDead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> South Africa {{was that}} novel of Olive Schreiner's, you know--'The Story of an African Farm.' Gregory Rose is so like you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't know, in a way, and yet I did. There was {{somebody}} about who <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> England, and then, you see, I heard you sing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} sky did it," [...] said Norman, {{in a low}} voice; [...] "it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her in a {{different}} way--and what you said too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have lost}} six days: a small tumour formed inside the ear {{about two inches}} from the outer ear, and the pain has been very considerable, and the {{annoyance}} great. Last night I slept {{for the first time}} for five nights, and I have been so weary with sleeplessness that I have been quite idle. The mischief is passing away now. That ear is quite deaf; it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> so <b>of</b> dear Father and Joan with their constant trial. I don't see any results from our residence here; and why should I look for them? It is enough that the people are hearing, some of them talking, and a few thinking about what they hear. All in God's own time!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... {{and early}} in the morning, with all my {{belongings}} on my back, I stole softly forth, glancing apprehensively {{in the direction of}} the kennel, and out on to the windy road. It was painful to me to have to decamp in this way; it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> meanly <b>of</b> myself; but if Jack could read this and could speak his mind I think he would acknowledge that my way of bringing the connection to an end was best for both of us. I was not the person, or dog on two legs, he had taken me for, one with a proper desire to kill things: I only acted according to my poor lights. Nothing, then, remains to be said except that one word which it was not convenient to speak on the windy morning of my departure--Good-bye Jack.|$|R
60|$|Having thus {{discussed}} {{my thoughts}} in the clearest manner, {{according to my}} weak understanding, I next proceeded to consider the wretched nature of those destroying savages, by seeming, though with great reverence, to enquire why God should give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity, even to brutality itself, to devour its own kind? but as this was rather matter of obstruse speculation, and as my miserable situation <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> this <b>of</b> mine the most uncomfortable situation in the world, I then began rather to inquire {{what part of the}} world these wretches lived in; how far off the coast was from whence they came; why they ventured over so far from home; what kind of boats conveyed them hither; and why I could not order myself and my business so, that I might be able to attack their country, as they were to come to my kingdom.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by that, Johnny?" [...] said Bill. [...] "It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a circus. The circus there'll be when Lime's woman finds out what he's been a-doin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{sight of}} all this <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him," [...] he went on, with his face near the glass [...] . and I could see another man, {{powerful}} and bearded, peering at him intently from amongst the dark and polished tubes that can cure so many illusions. [...] "Yes; it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him," [...] he continued, slowly. [...] "I saw a paper this morning; they are fighting over there again. He's sure to be in it. He will make it hot for the caballeros. Well, good luck to him, poor devil! He was perfectly stunning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This morning?" [...] She {{felt herself}} trembling, and she {{scarcely}} recognized Peter with such words on his lips. [...] "I am happy--indeed I am. Only--I am overwrought--seeing you again--and you <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In November," [...] {{our friend}} said, taking breath {{for a fresh}} spurt of praise, [...] "there were a good many {{sympathetic}} afternoons which lent themselves to motor-bus progress up that magnificent avenue, and if you mounted to your place on top, about three o'clock, you looked up or down the long vista of blue air till it turned mirk at either vanishing-point under a sky of measureless cloudlessness. That dimness, almost smokiness at the closes of the prospect, was something unspeakably rich. It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think,</b> quite out <b>of</b> relation or relevance, of these nobly mystical lines of Keats: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite true! I quite {{agree with}} you. It is {{probably}} that very feeling that has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> so highly <b>of</b> Griselda. But then--" [...] But then a young lady, though she need not jump down a gentleman's throat, or throw herself into his face, may give some signs {{that she is}} made of flesh and blood; especially when her papa and mamma and all belonging to her are so anxious to make the path of her love run smooth. That was what was passing through Lady Lufton's mind; {{but she did not}} say it all; she merely looked it.|$|R
5000|$|Hawley {{has also}} {{described}} the untimely and tragic death in February 2010 of his close friend, Sheffield guitarist Tim McCall, as the [...] "catalyst {{for a lot}} of musical activity" [...] and the reason for the change in musical style on the album, saying [...] "...the thing with Tim passing away... is that it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> kind <b>of</b> <b>think</b> musically is there anything I've left undone... and I thought, I haven't really ever just used the guitar as the only vehicle".|$|R
