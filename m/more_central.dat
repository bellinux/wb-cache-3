Eystein's activities were especially centered in Bergen, which became an important international trade hub for fish at the time, helped by his construction projects. His activities in Bergen included moving the royal seat to a <b>more</b> <b>central</b> location in the city and building a new royal palace, as well as constructing churches and the Munkeliv Abbey.|$|E

5|$|By 1986, Angola {{began to}} assume a <b>more</b> <b>central</b> role in the Cold War, with the Soviet Union, Cuba and other Eastern bloc nations {{enhancing}} support for the MPLA government, and American conservatives beginning to elevate their support for Savimbi's UNITA. Savimbi developed close relations with influential American conservatives, who saw Savimbi as a key ally in the U.S. effort to oppose and rollback Soviet-backed, undemocratic governments around the world. The conflict quickly escalated, with both Washington and Moscow seeing it as a critical strategic conflict in the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's {{style has}} {{developed}} into {{that of a}} more traditional winger; while being able to play on both wings, he is more comfortable on the right, {{where he has been}} known to utilise his pace, ball control, technical skills and trickery to create space and provide crosses for teammates. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague. Due to his offensive movement, he can also play in a more offensive role, as a forward, inverted winger, second striker, or even in a <b>more</b> <b>central</b> position, as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|Rocks have a {{porphyritic}} texture. Basaltic andesites typically contain {{less than}} 10% crystals while dacites generally {{have more than}} 20% crystals. The Alconcha group lavas of the first one million years are crystal-poor and lack biotite; later lavas contain biotite and more crystals. Based on geothermometric data, the highest temperatures occurred during phases of high activity and lower temperatures are associated with low output periods. It is likely that crustal feedback and increased deep crustal influx of mantle-derived basalts drive increased magmatic flux. During {{the time of the}} Polan eruption on the west flank, magma output was spatially segregated with the peripheral Miño Volcano generating andesite lavas and the <b>more</b> <b>central</b> volcanos generating dacites.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{election}} Theobald selected his brother Walter to be archdeacon of Canterbury, and in 1148 promoted {{him to be}} Bishop of Rochester. Theobald attended the council held by Stephen in June 1139 that deprived Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury, and his nephews Nigel, Bishop of Ely, and Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, of their castles. According to most historians, Theobald took little part in the controversy that followed the council, which eventually ended with Roger's death in 1139 and Nigel and Alexander's restoration to favour. Recently however, that view has been challenged by two historians who argue that Theobald took {{a more active role}} in the council. They base their view on a Vita, or Life of the 12th-century mystic Christina of Markyate, which narrates the events and gives a <b>more</b> <b>central</b> role to Theobald, instead of Henry of Blois, in challenging Stephen's arrest of the three bishops.|$|E
5|$|The spines of cacti {{are often}} useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, {{as well as}} in whether all the spines {{produced}} by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most spines are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened spines (e.g. Schlerocactus papyracanthus). Other cacti have hooked spines. Sometimes, one or <b>more</b> <b>central</b> spines are hooked, while outer spines are straight (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).|$|E

5|$|With {{unprecedented}} {{growth in}} the 1960s, particularly in undergraduate numbers, the Student's Union eventually acquired larger premises in a new building in the Clifton area of the city, in 1965. This building was more spacious than the Victoria Rooms, which were now given over to the Department of Music. The new Union provides many practice and performance rooms, some specialist rooms, as well as three bars: Bar 100; the Mandela (also known as AR2) and the Avon Gorge. Whilst spacious, the Union building is thought {{by many to be}} ugly and out of character compared to the architecture {{of the rest of the}} Clifton area, having been mentioned in a BBC poll to find the worst architectural eyesores in Britain. The university has proposed relocating the Union to a <b>more</b> <b>central</b> location as part of its development 'masterplan'. More recently, plans for redevelopment of the current building have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main lines 4.Bf4, 4.Nf3 and 4.e4, the only {{significant}} other fourth move is 4.e3 to continue by 4...Nxe5 5.Nh3 (or the other move-order 4.Nh3 and 5.e3) so that the white knight starts the journey Ng1–h3–f4–d5 reach its ideal d5-square. The idea with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3 was favorite of a leading Soviet coach and writer Mikhail Shereshevsky, who wrote in his 1994 book The Soviet Chess Conveyor that the line was first shown to him by a strong correspondence player Donatas Lapienis. Black has tried to prevent White's idea by the suitably strange-looking move 5...Ng6, taking the f4-square from the Nh3. Then White can develop along various setups, the most active being 6.Qh5 with the possibility Nh3–g5 in store to recycle the knight towards a <b>more</b> <b>central</b> position. Black can also ignore White's intentions and concentrate on his own play by placing the Nb8 on c5, {{in order to put}} pressure on the d3-square. After 5...g6 6.Nf4Bg7 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d6 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.Qd2 a5 11.b3 Nc5 the position of Black's knights is secured and Black's position is similar to the Leningrad variation of the Dutch Defence (once he has played f7–f5). White has no reason, however, to abandon the a1–h8 diagonal to Black, and he can try 5...g6 6.Bd2 d6 7.Nf4 Bg7 8.Bc3 0-0 9.Be2 Nbd7 10.Nd2 b6 and in one game White gained a minimal edge.|$|E
5|$|During the match, UEFA.com {{users were}} able to vote for their man of the match; the public vote went to the scorer of Barcelona's second goal, Lionel Messi. The UEFA Technical Study Group, however, chose the man who {{provided}} the cross for Messi's goal, Xavi, as their man of the match, citing his control of the tempo of the match {{as the reason for}} their decision. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola took the time to give special praise to Messi, whom he said he moved back into the midfield in order to increase the team's effectiveness when in possession of the ball. Messi had been withdrawn from his usual right-wing role into a <b>more</b> <b>central</b> position, while Samuel Eto'o, who had started the match as Barcelona's lone centre-forward, was moved out to the right. Guardiola also lauded the bravery of his entire team, stating that he believed that his team's victory hinged on their hard work and propensity for taking risks in attack, but he admitted that although his side had had the best season {{in the history of the}} club, they were not yet the best Barcelona team.|$|E

Manager Colin Walker confirmed that several enquiries had been made about signing Woolford during the January transfer window. Woolford was set a 20-goal target by Walker in April 2008, at which point he had scored 16 goals. He was watched by Crewe Alexandra's director of football Dario Gradi in April 2008, after which Walker insisted he was still a part of York's plans for the next season. He finished 2007–08 with 57 appearances and 17 goals. He rejected speculation linking him with a move away from York in June, saying he would only move to a club two divisions higher.|$|E
5|$|This later {{reform was}} presaged by a {{reform in the}} middle of the 1950s; the {{economic}} historian Jörg Roesler considers the NES in the 1960s as a continuation of this reform. The origin of the reform in the 1950s was a scientific study, commissioned by Rau's ministry in 1953, to assess the need for greater economic efficiency in the factories. The subsequent results from this study promised enhanced economic efficiency by shifting more responsibility from the National Planning Commission to the enterprises themselves. Thenceforward, already in spring 1954, Rau advocated such a planning reform, while planning boss Bruno Leuschner quite consistently opposed it. In August 1954, Rau's ministry sent a concept for such a reform to Leuschner's State Planning Commission. Eventually this reform got under way, after Ulbricht, perhaps under the influence of his new personal economic adviser Wolfgang Berger, had approved such a policy at the end of 1954 too. Subsequently, the reform accelerated until 1956. It found however its early end in the generally aggravated political atmosphere in 1957. Unrests in other Eastern Bloc countries during the previous year 1956, in particular in Hungary, had awoken the desire for <b>more</b> <b>central</b> control again. The subsequent unsatisfying economic development, however, during the following years eventually led in the 1960s to the concept of a new planning reform, the NES.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan's {{character}} is <b>more</b> <b>central</b> to StarCraft: Brood War (1998), {{as in the}} wake of the Overmind's death at the hands of Tassadar in the conclusion of StarCraft, Kerrigan regains her independence from the Zerg hive mind and dedicates her efforts to becoming the sole leader of the Zerg Swarm. She presents herself on the Protoss colony world Shakuras, where she informs Zeratul and the Protoss of a new Overmind growing on Char, manipulating them into destroying Zerg forces running rival to her goals. She also gains an ally in an apparently infested Samir Duran, who infiltrates the newly arrived forces of the United Earth Directorate (UED) and attempts to sabotage their mission to enslave the Zerg and seize control of the sector of the galaxy. However, the UED is successful in capturing the new Overmind, and Kerrigan exploits the threat of the UED to forge an alliance with Mengsk, Raynor and his new Protoss allies, turning around the war against the UED. However, Kerrigan quickly betrays this alliance and strikes at the armies of Raynor and Mengsk, heavily damaging both groups. Accompanied by Duran, Kerrigan returns to Shakuras to abduct the Protoss leader Raszagal, using her to blackmail Zeratul into killing the new Overmind on Char, after which all Zerg fall under Kerrigan's control—around this time, she begins her self-proclamation as the Queen of Blades. Zeratul attempts to rescue Raszagal, but kills her when he realizes her mind has been destroyed by Kerrigan's brainwashing. Kerrigan, surprised by his actions, allows him to live. Soon after, Kerrigan's position on Char is attacked by a vengeful Protoss fleet, the remnants of the UED's invasion force and a mercenary fleet commanded by Mengsk. Despite being outnumbered, Kerrigan's forces prevail, crippling her enemies and eradicating the UED fleet, thereby securing a dominant position in the sector.|$|E
