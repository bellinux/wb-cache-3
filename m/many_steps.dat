5|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented the}} {{mechanical}} calculator in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as <b>many</b> <b>steps</b> as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E

40|$|After giving how to {{construct}} the gauge invariant perturbation variable in an arbitrarily high order and in the arbitrary background spacetime, we consider the manifestly gauge invariant theory of the cosmological perturbations in the long wavelength limit with the spatially flat homogeneous isotropic universe being the background spacetime. In the previous paper, the physical laws become manifestly gauge invariant, by writing {{them in terms of}} only the single time background/scalar like objects. In the present paper, by extending our definition of the background/scalar like objects from the single time case to the many time case and by writing the solution of the physical law in the form where many time background/scalar like objects are vanishing, the solutions become the manifestly gauge invariant. We derive the formula changing the bases of the many time background/scalar like objects by which we can change the time slices for many times appearing in the solution including the initial time and the final time. We use this formula to our treatment of the evolution of the several slow rolling scalar fields using the τ function. In the manifestly gauge invariant manner, we discuss the solution of the <b>many</b> <b>step</b> reheating, that is, the reheating with the arbitrarily <b>many</b> energy transfer <b>steps.</b> By using the useful parametrization of the <b>many</b> <b>step</b> reheating, we manifestly prove that in the <b>many</b> <b>step</b> reheating system the prominent fluctuation generation process the nearest to the present time erases all the fluctuations generated by the previous fluctuation generation processes. Therefore in order to know the first/second order Bardeen parameters at the present time it is sufficient to calculate only the effects of the the prominent fluctuation generation processes such as curvaton and the modulated reheating the nearest to the present time...|$|R
