Don't Tell <b>Me!,</b> <b>where</b> she appears as a regular panelist, and her July 20, 2015 column.|$|E

Smith voluntarily retired from GM, and later toured the new Saturn facility in Tennessee, which he brought to fruition, in 1991.|$|E

500|$|The {{launch of}} the Absolute Garbage promotional {{campaign}} began {{at the end of}} May 2007, when Geffen Records updated Garbage's Myspace profile streaming audio player to include the album's lead single [...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>Where</b> It Hurts" [...] and the remix of [...] "Bad Boyfriend", while the music video for [...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>Where</b> It Hurts" [...] was premiered on UK Channel 4's Video Exclusive slot. Radio edits of the Guitars Up and Orchestral versions of [...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>Where</b> It Hurts" [...] were distributed to radio at the beginning of June. In the United Kingdom, the song was playlisted by XFM Scotland Upfront, Radio Forth and was C-Listed on BBC Radio 2 for five weeks.

[...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>Where</b> It Hurts" [...] was released by A Records on 7" [...] vinyl, DVD and CD single (featuring [...] "Betcha" [...] as the B-side) on July 16 in the United Kingdom, where it debuted at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart. Manson complained that the release was [...] "shoved out with no promotion whatsoever", declaring that it was the moment the band [...] "realized how crazy and out of whack things had gotten", inspiring them to work independently afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Eschewing the Midwestern {{location}} of their Wisconsin-based Smart Studios, Garbage chose to record new {{material for the}} album in GrungeIsDead, Vig's California-located home recording studio. The band members had been sharing ideas over the internet prior to the sessions, and were keen to record them; vocalist Shirley Manson {{had come up with}} the song title [...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>Where</b> It Hurts" [...] a few years previously, and had matched newly written lyrics with a Burt Bacharach-style string arrangement that the band had created via email correspondence. After producing an electric guitar-heavy version of [...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>Where</b> It Hurts", Garbage recorded a second mix of the track with more emphasis on the strings and recruited their former touring bassist, Daniel Shulman, to perform bass guitar on the song. The band completed another three songs during the sessions, including [...] "Betcha" [...] (Vig: [...] "it's fuzzed up"), [...] "Girls Talk Shit" [...] ("pretty cool sounding, lots of fast pizzicato guitars and cellos"), and [...] "All the Good in This Life", which Vig described as [...] "kinda Pink Floyd-y".|$|E
500|$|No [...] "John Doe #2" [...] {{was ever}} identified, nothing {{conclusive}} was ever reported regarding {{the owner of}} the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: [...] "You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?" [...] On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written [...] "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show <b>me</b> <b>where</b> I needed anyone else.

500|$|While the album's predecessor, Use Your Fingers, {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{in a more}} hip hop-oriented style, featuring distinct rap beats, One Fierce Beer Coaster featured a more alternative-oriented sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described The Bloodhound Gang's sound as, [...] "smarmy, smirky alternative funk-metal, complete with junk culture references and [...] "ironic" [...] musical allusions."

500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] is a midtempo electropop song; {{the song}} {{utilizes}} synthesizers and drum machines in its production. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, the single {{is set in}} compound time with a moderate beat rate of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of D minor and Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the note of D3 to the note of D5. Lyrically, [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] depicts a woman who would rather have sex than listen to a man speak as the singer finds talkative men annoying; blatant come-ons such as [...] "show <b>me</b> <b>where</b> your dick's at" [...] and [...] "I wanna be naked" [...] leave this literal meaning unambiguous. Kesha herself has been frank about this straightforward interpretation of the lyrics. The lyrics have been interpreted as {{a shot at the}} way men objectify women by speaking about them the way that they do in the music industry. [...] " [...] Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH felt that the line [...] "I don't really care where you live at, just turn around boy, let me hit that. Don't be a little bitch with your chit-chat; just show <b>me</b> <b>where</b> your dick's at" [...] was a way of belittling her male peers. Fraser McAlpine of BBC noted that it was cultural progress that a woman can now [...] "sing a song as dirty [...] as her male peers".|$|E
500|$|Since [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" [...] {{was not a}} {{song that}} McCartney's bandmates enjoyed recording, the motive behind Harrison's {{appropriation}} of the title has invited speculation. Author Jeffrey Roessner considers it significant that Harrison mispronounces the title; in addition, he contends that the full statement – [...] "We all know Ob-la-di-bla-da / But can you show <b>me</b> <b>where</b> you are?" [...] – serves {{as an example of}} Harrison, like Lennon, mocking those listeners who obsessively scanned the Beatles' lyrics for [...] "clues". Music journalist Robert Fontenot interprets the lines as an expression of distaste for [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", since Harrison and Lennon were openly critical of McCartney's composition.|$|E

Absolute Garbage was released on CD and a special edition two-CD set which included a second disc of remixes.

500|$|Jonny Greenwood {{described}} [...] "Scatterbrain (As Dead as Leaves)" [...] as [...] "very {{simple and}} sort of quite pretty, but there's something about the music for me, the chords for <b>me,</b> <b>where</b> it never quite resolves." [...] The NME described the album's final track, [...] "A Wolf at the Door (It Girl. Rag Doll.)" [...] as [...] "a pretty song, with a sinister monologue {{over the top of}} it"; Greenwood likened its lyrics to a Grimms' fairy tale. Yorke described the song's placement {{at the end of the}} album as [...] "sort of like waking you up at the end... it's all been a nightmare and you need to go and get a glass of water now." ...|$|E
500|$|Vernon was sampled {{on another}} {{song from the}} album, [...] "Lost in the World" [...] and appears on vocals on [...] "Monster".

He watched Minaj record her verse, and he too, expressed admiration for Minaj's performance on the song, however he noted that initially {{he had no idea}} who she was. Vernon described the process as highly artistic, stating that the fourteen-hour day recording schedule allowed for a lot of fun and creativity. West, talking about recording the song with Vernon, stated that he was [...] "similar to <b>me,</b> <b>where</b> he just does shit just so people would be like, 'Oh shit, how did you do that?

500|$|Lyrically, Madonna pleads the {{listener}} {{to stop for}} a moment, {{to get away from}} the world through music, with the lines going as: [...] "I don't know how I got to this stage / Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying / Turn up the radio, turn up the radio / Don't ask <b>me</b> <b>where</b> I wanna go, we gotta turn up the radio." [...] During the intermediate verses, Madonna sings about making speakers blow, which is accompanied by a subtle sound of an actual speaker blowing up. It also talks about the need to relax as well as the need to have fun. According to NMEs Priya Elan, [...] "the song continues [...] career-spanning themes of getting into the groove, of uniting the bourgeoisie and rebelling."

Koch described two further unusual incidents, one in which Cho stood in the doorway of his room late at night taking photographs of him, and another in which Cho repeatedly placed harassing cell phone calls to Koch as [...] "Cho's brother, 'Question Mark'," [...] a name Cho also used when introducing himself to girls. Koch and Eide searched Cho's belongings and found a pocket knife, but they did not find any items that they deemed threatening.|$|E
