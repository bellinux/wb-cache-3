We start by calculating a gradient field which encompasses the details found in the exposure image series. This gradient field is then integrated to result in the final within dynamic range image. The resulting algorithm achieves high image contrast due to a non-linear thresholding of gradients. ...|$|E
40|$|Fringe {{patterns}} are usually analyzed using a predefined window {{due to the}} difficulty associated with finding their edges. This is because, the fringes usually have <b>minimum</b> <b>intensities</b> {{similar to that of}} the background and it is difficult to determine where a fringe starts or ends. The presence of the fringes can therefore lead to error in detecting the edges of the object when using existing edge detection techniques. This paper presents a practical approach towards the automatic detection of the edges of a noisy fringe pattern having different noise levels. The technique uses the dilation and erosion morphological operators combined with a simple neighborhood binary edge detector. The threshold required for the binarization operation is determined from a linear relationship between the threshold value and the standard deviation of Gaussian noise from a simulation study. The proposed technique has been successfully applied to fringe patterns on real objects obtained using the fringe projection method. Some of the limitations of the technique are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Sunspot {{observations}} inspired solar dynamo {{theory and}} continue to do so. Simply counting them established the sunspot cycle and its period. Latitudinal distributions introduced the tough constraint {{that the source of}} sunspots moves equator-ward as the cycle progresses. Observations of Hale's polarity law mandated hemispheric asymmetry. How much more can sunspots tell us about the solar dynamo? We draw attention to a few outstanding questions raised by inherent sunspot properties. Namely, how to explain sunspot rotation rates, the incoherence of follower spots, the longitudinal spacing of sunspot groups, and brightness trends within a given sunspot cycle. After reviewing the first several topics, we then present new results on the brightness of sunspots in Cycle 24 as observed with the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI). We compare these results to the sunspot brightness observed in Cycle 23 with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI). Next, we compare the <b>minimum</b> <b>intensities</b> of five sunspots simultaneously observed by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope Spectropolarimeter (SOT-SP) and HMI to verify that the minimum brightness of sunspot umbrae correlates well to the maximum field strength. We then examine 90 and 52 sunspots in the north and south hemisphere, respectively, from 2010 - 2012. Finally, we conclude that the average maximum field strengths of umbra 40 Carrington Rotations into Cycle 24 are 2690 Gauss, virtually indistinguishable from the 2660 Gauss value observed at a similar time in Cycle 23 with MDI. ...|$|E

We analyze a 40 min time sequence of full Stokes spectropolarimetric 630. 25 nm data from a plage region near the Sun center. We use line-of-sight velocities and magnetic field measurements obtained using Milne-Eddington inversion techniques with and without stray-light compensation along with measured continuum and line <b>minimum</b> <b>intensities.</b> We discuss the results in relation to earlier observations and simulations. We present eight cases involving strong downflows and magnetic field intensification. All cases studied are associated with the formation of a bright point in the continuum. In three out of the eight cases we find the presence of weak opposite polarity field in close proximity to the downflow. Our data are consistent with earlier simulations describing flux tube collapse, but the transition to a state with stronger field appears transient and short-lived, rather than resulting in a permanent field intensification. Three cases of weak opposite polarity field found adjacent to the downflows do not appear related to reconnection but may be related to overturning convection pulling down some field lines and leading to up/down "serpentine" field, as seen in some simulations.

40|$|Context: The {{convective}} {{origin of}} supergranulation is highly controversial. Past measurements of intensity variations inside supergranules {{have often been}} influenced by the brightness enhancement at the cell boundaries due to the magnetic network. Aims: We conduct a precise determination of intensity variations inside supergranules. Methods: We determine the supergranule cell boundary from smoothed divergence maps derived from horizontal flow maps. We derive these flow maps from intensity maps obtained by MDI/SOHO in high resolution mode. We discuss the different possible approaches {{to take into account the}} influence of the magnetic field which can be used to determine the intensity variations inside supergranules. Results: We observe a significant decrease of the intensity from the center to the boundary of supergranules. We also obtain additional clues from the behavior of the maximum intensities and <b>minimum</b> <b>intensities</b> around each pixel, which are related to granules and intergranules: the maximum intensity decreases from center to boundary, while the minimum intensity is constant or increases depending how restrictive the selection is. The difference between intensity profiles versus divergence and relative distance to cell center also provides complementary information. The corresponding temperature differences between cell center and boundary are in the range 0. 8 - 2. 8 K. The intensity enhancement (for the magnetic network) or deficit (for intranetwork fields) depends on the localisation inside the cell. Conclusions:. It is the first time that such a detailed analysis of intensity variations inside supergranulation is performed. Our results are compatible with a convective origin of supergranulation, as the intensity decreases toward the boundary of the cells. However, new simulations of supergranulation are necessary to verify whether the compared behavior of granule and intergranule intensity variations is in close agreement with convection...|$|E

Monthly mean water vapor transports {{associated with the}} transient eddies were calculated and the annual evolution of fields were analyzed, using daily wind components and humidity data for 195882 period. Transient eddy fluxes {{are associated with the}} rapidly developing and decaying weather disturbances of midlatitudes, which generally move eastward with the prevailing flow and contribute much of the variations of wind, temperature and humidity, especially during winter. Results are shown for transient eddy zonal and meridional transport. Through analysis of fields of transient eddy zonal transport, it is observed the occurrence of negative values (westward transport) over southern central Argentina and Northern Patagonia from late spring to early autumn, indicating an increase of humidity when cir-culations are from Atlantic Ocean. Westerly transport is observed in summer over Northeastern subtropical and central Argentina, otherwise over southern Patagonia westerly transports are dramatically intensified during early autumn. During winter easterly transport are only found over northwestern Argentina and over the rest of the region, humidity transports are mainly due to the westerly transient eddies, with maximum values over Northeast Argentina. In mean latitudes, the transient eddy zonal transport of water vapor presents a considerable degree of east-west detail with centers of eastward transport alternating with centers of westward eddy transport; these characteristics (negative transports) are noticeable over southern Patagonia during winter (July).

40|$|Summary The EEG of six {{subjects}} was recorded from {{two pairs of}} symmetrically positioned electrodes (O 1 -P 3 and O 2 -P 4). The interhemispheric synchrony of the filtered alpha rhythms was determined by an on-line compilation of Pearson's correlation coefficient r. The positive values of r {{were used to determine}} the loudness of a tone which was fed back to the subject. Maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>intensities</b> corresponded respectively to r = + 1 and r = 0. For all subjects a sustained maximum loudness (corresponding to a well developed alpha rhythm on both sides) appeared when they succeeded to voluntarily maintain a stabilized field of awareness and to allow them-selves to be deeply absorbed in this cognitive act. On the contrary, the sound disappeared (blockage of alpha) when subjects mode an intense effort at focussing their attention on such activities as performing a mental arithmetical computation or clenching the fist. A tone of a medium and variable intensity corresponded to the usual fluctuations of the alpha rhythm of a subject with eyes closed and in a state of mental relaxation. The results suggest a distinction, from the EEG point of view {{as well as from the}} subjective one, between the effort of attention to an object and the effortless cognitive experience which results from it. One can hypothesize that to each mental content corresponds a pattern of neuronal excitation and inhibition. Selecting and stabilizing a mental representation would then result in favouring and stabilizing the corresponding functional pattern. Consequently the diminution of the functional noise determining synchronization phenomena and development of alpha rhythm would in turn favour the formation of the selected pattern of nervous activity.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis paper first {{presents}} {{a summary of}} several old and new methods of measuring birefringence, indicating their limitations in respect to large optical glass blanks, and then explains in considerable detail the writers' new radiation method, which is free {{of many of these}} limitations. The procedure and theory of this new method are given here briefly. Procedure: A collimated beam of monochromatic (yellow - green) light is passed through a circular polarizer and then through the specimen to be measured, that is, a large optical glass blank, which is held stationary. The beam next passes through a plane-polarized analyzer, which may be rotated to permit maximum and minimum transmissions of the elliptically polarized light emerging from the specimen. The intensity of this transmitted light is indicated on an ammeter by means of a sensitive photocell and amplifier. Using a variac, the maximum intensity is adjusted to indicate a predetermined maximum position on the ammeter scale. The corresponding minimum position will then indicate the birefringence in terms of degrees of phase difference {{with the help of a}} special scale to be used in conjunction with the ammeter scale. The circular light emerging from the circular polarizer enables the optical blank under test to be placed in any arbitrary azimuth in respect to its principal directions thus eliminating the necessity for lining up the heavy optical blank. The necessity for lining up is one of the chief objections to previous methods as far as their use with large optical blanks is concerned. Theory: When the circular light from the circular polarizer passes through the specimen, the additional birefringence of the latter causes the beam to become elliptically polarized. Mathematical analysis of this elliptic light shows that the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>intensities</b> emerging from the rotatable plane analyzer determine by their ratio the birefringence of the specimen by the simple formula. SinÎÏ=(A-B) /(A+B) =((A/B) - 1) /((A/B) + 1) where A is the maximum intensity, and B is the minimum, and ÎÏ is the birefringence of the specimen in terms of phase difference. This device is to be used to measure birefringence in optical blanks between 0 Â° and 300 Â° of phase-difference. Therefore, to distinguish between the four possible phase-differences associated with each absolute sine value on the scale, advantage is taken of the fact that the major axis of our birefringence ellipse is orientated in the first 180 Â° (0 Â° - 180 Â°) of specimen phase difference in a direction perpendicular to its orientation in the second 180 Â° (180 Â° - 360 Â°) of specimen phase-difference. Thus, if we note that our maximum intensity position occurs with the analyzers indicator clockwise to the specimen's "fast" axis in the one group (0 Â° - 180 Â°) and anti-clockwise in the other group (180 Â° - 360 Â°), we can distinguish between these two groups. Also, by inserting a rotatable 60 Â° - retardation plate in the beam's path, we can determine the sum of the retardations, and on subsequent subtraction of the known 60 Â° - retardation, this will leave only one sensible answer, thus distinguishing between the (0 Â° - 90 Â°) group and the (90 Â° - 180 Â°) group, or their equivalent groups between 180 Â° and 360 Â°. By dividing the birefringence scale properly into upper and lower double groups of 90 Â° span each, this procedure can be made reasonably simple. The "fast" axis of the optical blank at any point can be determined closely enough for the above purpose by the geometry of the round blank, (since principal directions are almost always radial and tangential), or else by previous qualitative examination. Due to light-leakage through Polaroid plates at "extinction" positions, zeroing of the device may be accomplished by means of a shutter with only fair accuracy (relative inaccuracy around 90 Â° of phase-difference). However, by zeroing the ammeter through crossed plane-Polaroids, we allow for most or all of this leakage at all phase-differences. The principal advantage of the new method is the one previously suggested, namely, that we do not have to line up the heavy, bulk-y optical glass blank at each point to make the principal directions of the specimen coincide with those of the polarizer or analyzer. A second advantage over previous radiation methods is its full wave-length range. Another advantage is its simplicity of operation, at least for birefringence known to lie between 0 Â° and 90 Â° of phase-difference...|$|E
