50|$|How {{available}} {{is the model}} to audience? Availability depends on distributability, especially {{when members of the}} audience are geographically dispersed. Then, a model which is an electronically distributable format will be more easily distributed than one which must be printed on paper and sent by <b>ordinary</b> <b>mail</b> or fax. It may also matter exactly what is distributed, e.g. the model in an editable form or merely in an output format.|$|R

40|$|The {{anomalous}} {{part of the}} NMR relaxation rate of coppernuclei in {{the normal}} state of copper-oxide metals is calculated using the orbital magnetic parts of the fluctuations derived in a recent theory to explain the long wavelength transport anomalies. Oxygen and Yttrium reside on lattice sites at which the anomalous contribution is absent at all hole densities. The frequency, momentum dependence, and the form-factor of the fluctuations is predicted,which is verifiable by inelastic neutron scattering experiments.

Four Mailsort products were available - known as 70, 120, 700 and 1400 - each based on the customer's ability to sort into increasingly smaller geographical areas. A further Walksort product was available to those who wished to post to many of the addresses in an area and who could present mail sorted first by mailsort code and then by walk number (the second half of the postcode).|$|R

His own vessel was entirely out of his control, and even if he chose to try his guns on the spring armour of the repeller, it would probably result in the repeller turning her fire up on the transport.|$|R
