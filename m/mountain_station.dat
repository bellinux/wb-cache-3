5|$|The {{station was}} opened on 10 June 1908, {{along with the}} rest of the central portion of the Bergen Line. The station {{building}} was of the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Station</b> Variant 1 type, designed by Paul Due. This made it identical to Mjølfjell Station, and with only slight variations to Haugastøl Station, Finse Station and Myrdal Station. During construction, NSB built several buildings for their staff. Two of the houses and an assembly building have been preserved. They were built in 1900 and represent an example of buildings from the construction time. One is partially built in stone, partially in wood, while the other two are entirely in wood. All are now used as cabins. The sick ward for the navvys was bought by Kari Maristuen in 1909 converted to a hotel, named Fjellstova.|$|E
25|$|The area is also {{dotted with}} casinos run by local Indian tribes {{as well as}} resort hotels and spas with natural mineral water wells, making it a {{vacation}} destination as well. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway takes visitors from the valley floor to the San Jacinto Peak <b>mountain</b> <b>station</b> 8516 feet (2595 m) above sea level.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 a fire {{destroyed}} the ridge hotel by the <b>mountain</b> <b>station</b> of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway. The 1976 Friuli earthquake was also felt particularly strongly on the Zugspitze: the duty meteorologist {{feared that the}} observation tower might collapse. In 1981 a chapel was founded on the Zugspitze, which was consecrated by the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, Joseph Ratzinger, in October on the feast of Visitation. On 25 March, an automated teller machine was installed at the summit station; it has since been removed. In 1995, a 450 square metre exhibition area was opened at the summit, in which artists present their work for six months, before the exhibition is changed. In 1995, the border between Germany and Austria at the summit was opened.|$|E

25|$|The opening {{attracted}} newspapermen, photographers, newsreel cameramen and syndicated writers {{from across}} the nation.

2500|$|From 1877 to 1878, {{the area}} {{suffered}} {{a rash of}} stagecoach robberies. Most notable, however, were the two holdups committed by masked road-agent William Whitney Brazelton. Brazelton held up two stages {{in the summer of}} 1878 near Point of <b>Mountain</b> <b>Station</b> approximately [...] northwest of Tucson. John Clum, of Tombstone, Arizona fame was one of the passengers. Brazelton was eventually tracked down and killed on Monday August 19, 1878, in a mesquite bosque along the Santa Cruz River [...] south of Tucson by Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell and his citizen posse. Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery not only in the Tucson area, but also in the Prescott region and Silver City, New Mexico area as well. Brazelton's crimes prompted John J. Valentine, Sr. of Wells, Fargo & Co. to send special agent and future Pima County sheriff Bob Paul to investigate. Fort Lowell, then east of Tucson, was established to help protect settlers from Apache attacks. In 1882, Frank Stilwell was implicated in the murder of Morgan Earp by Cowboy Pete Spence's wife, Marietta, at the coroner's inquest on Morgan Earp's shooting. The coroner's jury concluded that Spence, Stilwell, Frederick Bode, and Florentino [...] "Indian Charlie" [...] Cruz were the prime suspects in the assassination of Morgan Earp.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} dusk when, with a scream of brakes, the cars lurched into a desolate <b>mountain</b> <b>station,</b> and Millicent shivered as she alighted in the frost-dried dust of snow. A nipping wind sighed down the valley. The tall firs on the {{hillside}} were fading into phantom battalions of climbing trees, and above them towered a dim chaos of giant peaks, weirdly awe-inspiring under the last faint glimmer of the dying day. A few lights blinked among the lower firs, and Millicent, hurrying towards them at the station agent's direction, was greeted by the odors of coarse tobacco as she {{pushed open the door}} of the New Eldorado saloon.|$|E
