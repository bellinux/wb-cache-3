It has also been observed that individual lipid molecules rotate rapidly around their own axis. Moreover, phospholipid molecules can, although they seldom do, migrate {{from one side of the}} lipid bilayer to the other (a process known as flip-flop).

5000|$|Under these {{particular}} conditions, although the enzyme {{may be in}} excess of the substrate (first-order regime), the enzyme is effectively locally saturated with substrate due to the multiple binding sites, leading to switch-like responses. This mechanism of ultrasensitivity is independent of enzyme concentration, however the signal is significantly enhanced depending on the number of binding sites on the substrate. [...] Both conditional factors (limited diffusion and inactivation) are physiologically plausible, but have yet to be experimentally confirmed. Dushek’s modeling found increasing Hill cooperativity numbers with more substrate sites (phosphorylation sites), and with greater steric/diffusional hindrance between enzyme and substrate. This mechanism of ultrasensitivity based on local enzyme saturation arises partly from passive properties of slow <b>membrane</b> <b>diffusion,</b> and therefore may be generally applicable.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{membrane}} paradigm {{approach to}} black hole physics introduces {{the notion of}} a stretched horizon as a fictitious time-like surface endowed with physical characteristics such as entropy, viscosity and electrical conductivity. We show that certain properties of the stretched horizons are encoded in the quasinormal spectrum of black holes. We compute analytically the lowest quasinormal frequency of a vector-type perturbation for a generic black hole with a translationally invariant horizon (black brane) in terms of the background metric components. The resulting dispersion relation is identical to the one obtained in the membrane paradigm treatment of the diffusion on stretched horizons. Combined with the Buchel–Liu universality theorem for the <b>membrane's</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient, our result means that in the long wavelength limit the black brane spectrum of gravitational perturbations exhibits a universal, purely imaginary quasinormal frequency.

Here, we propose how sphingolipid domains, protein rings, and morphological changes of the nucleus may coordinate to restrict protein exchange between nuclear lobes. Our spatial stochastic model is based on several lines of experimental evidence and predicts that, while a sphingolipid domain and a protein ring could constitute the barrier during early anaphase; a sphingolipid domain spanning the bridge between lobes during late anaphase would be entirely sufficient. Additionally, we explore the structural organization of plausible diffusion barriers.

50|$|Dialysis {{works on}} the {{principles}} of the diffusion of solutes and ultrafiltration of fluid across a semi-permeable <b>membrane.</b> <b>Diffusion</b> is a property of substances in water; substances in water tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Blood flows by one side of a semi-permeable membrane, and a dialysate, or special dialysis fluid, flows by the opposite side. A semipermeable membrane is a thin layer of material that contains holes of various sizes, or pores. Smaller solutes and fluid pass through the membrane, but the membrane blocks the passage of larger substances (for example, red blood cells, large proteins). This replicates the filtering process that takes place in the kidneys, when the blood enters the kidneys and the larger substances are separated from the smaller ones in the glomerulus.The two main types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, remove wastes and excess water from the blood in different ways. Hemodialysis removes wastes and water by circulating blood outside the body through an external filter, called a dialyzer, that contains a semipermeable membrane. The blood flows in one direction and the dialysate flows in the opposite. The counter-current flow of the blood and dialysate maximizes the concentration gradient of solutes between the blood and dialysate, which helps to remove more urea and creatinine from the blood. The concentrations of solutes (for example potassium, phosphorus, and urea) are undesirably high in the blood, but low or absent in the dialysis solution, and constant replacement of the dialysate ensures that the concentration of undesired solutes is kept low {{on this side of the}} membrane. The dialysis solution has levels of minerals like potassium and calcium that are similar to their natural concentration in healthy blood. For another solute, bicarbonate, dialysis solution level is set at a slightly higher level than in normal blood, to encourage diffusion of bicarbonate into the blood, to act as a pH buffer to neutralize the metabolic acidosis that is often present in these patients. The levels of the components of dialysate are typically prescribed by a nephrologist according to the needs of the individual patient.|$|E

Here, we use single nanoparticle imaging to measure the local H 2 O 2 concentration and reveal regulation of the ROS response dynamics and organization to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling.
