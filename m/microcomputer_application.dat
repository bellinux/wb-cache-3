It concluded, [...] "VisiCalc is the first program available on a microcomputer that {{has been responsible for}} sales of entire systems". Creative Computings review the same year similarly concluded, [...] "for almost anyone in business, education, or any science-related field it is ... reason enough to purchase a small computer system in the first place". Compute! reported, [...] "Every Visicalc user knows of someone who purchased an Apple {{just to be able to}} use Visicalc". Antic wrote in 1984, [...] "VisiCalc isn't as easy to use as prepackaged home accounting programs, because you're required to design both the layout and the formulas used by the program. Because it is not pre-packaged, however, it's infinitely more powerful and flexible than such programs. You can use VisiCalc to balance your checkbook, keep track of credit card purchases, calculate your net worth, do your taxes—the possibilities are practically limitless." [...] The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the application an overall A+ rating, praising its documentation and calling it [...] "indispensable ... a straight 'A' classic".|$|E

40|$|Given the {{increased}} use of microcomputers in school library media centers to perform a wide variety of tasks, library educators should address the integration of microcomputers into the library media curriculum. Therefore, {{the purpose of the study}} was to describe how library educators were integrating <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> such as word processing, database management, spreadsheets, and other applications into the library education curriculum. A secondary purpose was using the results of the study as a framework for the integration of <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> in appropriate areas of library media core courses at Armstrong State College, Georgia. Savannah. The specific research questions addressed in the study were as follows: How were library media educators currently providing instruction in microcomputers? How many undergraduate level library programs used <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications?</b> What types of microcomputers were being used? How were <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> being used? Which courses used <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications?</b> What kinds of <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> were being used by library media educators? How many library educators used locally produced applications? What were the content areas of locally produced applications? What provisions had been made for the availability of microcomputers? What factors had limited the extent to which library media educators were able to introduce <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications?</b> What relationships existed between geographic region and program type and providing instruction in microcomputers as a part of the undergraduate library education program? In an effort to ascertain the extent to which library educators were using microcomputers, a survey questionnaire was mailed to 357 library educators representing 213 undergraduate library education programs in the United States. Of the 357 library educators mailed questionnaires, there were 202 returns or a 57 percent rate of return. Of this number, 92 responses were excluded from consideration because some institutions were no longer offering undergraduate library education programs, others offered only graduate programs, some library educators had retired or moved, other library educators had checked the First box on the questionnaire indicating that the teaching of library education courses was not one of their current responsibilities, and one respondent did not participate because the school had closed. These questionnaires were eliminated from the study; only 110 questionnaires were used. The nature of the data suggested the use of descriptive percentages. Statistics, primarily frequencies and However, chi-square analysis was used to determine whether a significant relationship existed between geographic region of library educators or program type and current use of microcomputers in library education. Results of the survey showed that 87, or 79. 1 percent of the library educators representing 75 undergraduate programs were introducing <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> into the library education curriculum. Perhaps the most significant fact was that the majority of library educators were currently providing instruction in microcomputers by using a separate course or integrating <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> in library education courses. Cataloging was the course that most frequently incorporated <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications.</b> Complementing lectures was the instructional method most frequently identified. In-class instruction was used to prepare and train students to use microcomputers. Word processing was the application most frequently used and Word Perfect was the word processing program of choice. Apple and IBM were the predominant brands used by library educators. Most microcomputers were located in a room designated as a computer lab or in the library. Finally, a lack of funds was the reason most cited as the greatest barrier in integrating <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> in library education courses. It was concluded that most library educators were introducing microcomputers in the library education curriculum. Recommendations were suggested for ways to integrate <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> into the library education curriculum. It was recommended that library educators introduce microcomputers into their curricula or existing core courses so that <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> could be an integral part of the library education program. It was recommended that a separate required introductory computer course be required for all students. That, in addition to the separate required course, <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> should be integrated into all core courses where appropriate. A systematic plan was developed that would serve as a guide for implementing the integration of <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> into library media core courses at Armstrong State College, Savannah, Georgia...|$|R

40|$|Major {{research}} studies demonstrating {{the impact of}} computers on organizational structure have been conducted in business and industry. However, no comprehensive study has determined the impact of microcomputer utilization on the organizational structure of higher education institutions. ^ The major {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the impact of microcomputer utilization on three organizational structure components [...] personnel, office operations, and office systems [...] in higher education student service units. The study measured microcomputer utilization in hours per week of use and, from the survey questionnaire written and tested by the author, derived scores for the personnel, office operations, and office systems variables. Controlling factors in the data analysis were student service unit and institution type. ^ A secondary {{purpose of this study was}} to document the types of <b>microcomputer</b> <b>applications</b> in higher education student service units.

40|$|For {{the past}} 20 years or more, {{the issue of}} {{computer}} literacy {{has been on the}} forefront of educa-tion and employment. Since the evolution of the personal computer, human resource recruiters have identified computer literacy as a viable skill essential for prospective employees. Computer literacy necessitates understanding and knowledge of computer usage with the ability to retrieve, organize, analyze, describe, and present various types of information in an appropriate manner. Research dating back to the early 1990 ’s conveyed overwhelmingly a lack of computer literacy skills found in college students and graduates. It is important to understand how today’s growing population of students are progressing with technological advances relative to computer applica-tions. By common consent, nearly every job seeker needs basic computer skills and the ability to use such applications as word processors, spreadsheets, database programs and presentation soft-ware to function in today’s job market.
