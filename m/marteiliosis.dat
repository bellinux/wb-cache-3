50|$|Marteilia refringens is a {{unicellular}} parasite {{affecting the}} digestive {{system of the}} flat oyster, Ostrea edulis. Other species that can be infected include the Australian mud oyster (O. angasi), the Argentinean oyster (O. puelchana), the Chilean flat oyster (O. chilensis), the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the Mediterranean mussel (M. galloprovincialis). Early stages {{of the life cycle}} occur in the epithelia of the digestive ducts and possibly the gills of the host. Later the parasite migrates to the epithelial cells of the digestive tubules. There may be no symptoms of infection. The factors triggering a pathogenic response are unclear but may be related to environmental stress. The gross signs of <b>marteiliosis</b> include the visceral tissues losing their pigmentation and becoming pale yellow. In some cases the mantle become translucent and shell growth may cease. Affected shellfish can become emaciated and in heavy infections tissues appear shrunken and slimy. Mortality seems {{to be related to the}} sporulation of the parasite. The parasite was first observed in France in 1979 and has since spread to other countries in Europe.|$|E
40|$|<b>Marteiliosis</b> is {{a disease}} of {{molluscs}} caused by Marteilia refringens in Europe and M. sydneyi in Australia. During routine examination of cultured mussels Mytilus galloprovinciallis in the northern Adriatic, the occurrence of Marteilia sp. was recorded with a prevalence of 5 %. This parasite was not detected in flat oysters reared in the same area. The affiliation of the detected parasite in M. galloprovinciallis was confirmed by in situ hybridization using a M. refringens probe, specific at the genus level. DNA of these infected mussels originating from the same area {{will be used to}} clarify the taxonomic position of this species within the genus Marteilia using a molecular approach.

40|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} of cultivating shells in Croatia, and the shell industry has a good perspective of further development. Since shells are delicate organisms that require special breeding conditions and climate, they are also subject to many diseases. Bonamiosis, haplospioridiosis, <b>marteiliosis,</b> microcytosis and perkinsosis are stated by the International Bureau for Epizootics as shell diseases that, in keeping with law, must be reported, and iridovirosis as a disease of a potential international importance. The same diseases are regulated by the Veterinary Law from 1997 as infectious diseases prevention of which is of an interest for the Republic of Croatia. Although, according to the law, it {{does not have to be}} prevented, in this article the disease Mytilicola is also described. According to the Health Department Statute from 1994, eatable part of shells are being tested for toxins of some marine dinoflagelates that can damage human health, and these are PSP (Paralytic Shellfish Poison), DSP (Diarrhoeic Shellfish Poison) and NSP (Neuroparalytic Shellfish Poison) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Marteiliosis</b> is a {{notifiable}} disease {{according to}} European Regulation and {{included in the}} list of the Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in order to be managed and its transfer prevented. Marteilia refringens, is molluscan parasite protozoa belonging to the phylum Cercozoa, order Paramyxida with cell-inside-cell development. It causes filtration and nutrients absorption disorders, gametogenesis impairment and in severe infections it can result in death of the host species, affecting cultured mussels in terms of socio-economics impact. In this study, in view of importance of the mussel farming, was investigated the sanitary and zootechnical impact of M. refringens infection in Mytilus galloprovincialis in 11 farms of Campania. Prevalence and intensity of M. refringens type M infection, identified by PCR-RFLP, were evaluated by histological and cytological examinations. It was assessed M. refringens impact on health, gametogenesis, physiological state and commercial quality of mussels. It was evaluated the association between M. refringens prevalence and mussel farming area, temperature, heavy metals concentration and organic pollution. M. refringens was detected in winter and in autumn consistently with not exceeding temperatures 17 째C. In the Flegrean area, infection prevalence was increased to 16 째C, was maximum at 24 째C and was decreased to 28 째C. All M. refringens stages of development were detected in winter, located in the epithelium of digestive tubules. The finding of sporangia containing mature spore has indicated that the sporulation was occurred. The infection grade was severe but M. refringens did not affect gametogenesis and it caused no pathological damage in digestive gland, however, M. refringens infection influenced negatively the condition index and the resistance of the shell. M. refringens did not reduce the energy absorption but infected mussels used the energy reserves for the immune response induced by the parasite infection and the poor environmental quality...|$|E
40|$|The French {{network for}} the {{surveillance}} and monitoring of mollusc health (REPAMO) was officially {{set up in}} 1992 to control the shellfish status along the French coasts according to the European directives 91 / 67 /EEC and 95 / 70 /EC. The objectives are 1) the surveillance of notifiable diseases present in France (Bonamiosis and <b>Marteiliosis</b> of flat oysters Ostrea edulis), 2) the surveillance of health status of cultured and wild populations of molluscs, 3) the study of abnormal mortality and 4) the control of exchanges from European and third countries. In this context, a new surveillance programme, called Active Targeted Survey, part of the REPAMO, was applied in 2004 {{in order to improve}} the monitoring of the health status of the French mollusc populations (objective 2). The objective is to provide evidence of freedom regarding notifiable exotic diseases (OIE list and directive 95 / 70 /EC annexe D) in susceptible host species. The new strategy, designed from data collected between 1990 and 2002 on the main harvested and farming species, is an active surveillance approach targeting a new mollusc species every two years. The sampling strategy including sampling method, sampling points, frequency, is defined according to the objective, the mollusc species and the targeted pathogen. In the context of this new strategy we have chosen to start with perkinsosis in clams along the French coasts. We present the theoretical approach and the data collected in 2004 - 2005 for clam species (Ruditapes decussatus and R. philippinarum) regarding infection with the protozoan Perkinsus olseni. Five areas, located along the French coasts, were investigated in autumn. In 2004, data demonstrated that no clam area was disease free and that prevalence and intensity of Perkinsus infection were higher in the South of France than in the English Channel...|$|E
