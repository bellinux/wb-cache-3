5|$|Until the 1980s FGM {{was widely}} known in English as female circumcision, {{implying}} an equivalence in severity with male circumcision. From 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council {{referred to it}} as the sexual <b>mutilation</b> of women, following the lead of Marion Scott Stevenson, a Church of Scotland missionary. References to the practice as <b>mutilation</b> increased throughout the 1970s. In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term female genital <b>mutilation</b> in the title of a paper in American Ethnologist, and four years later Fran Hosken, an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it <b>mutilation</b> in her influential The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual <b>Mutilation</b> of Females.|$|E

5|$|Various {{cases for}} rape, {{physical}} abuse and murder were prosecuted in court. Women, although usually having fewer rights by custom, {{were allowed to}} level civil and criminal charges against men. While suspects were jailed, convicted criminals were never imprisoned. Instead, punishments were commonly monetary fines, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, and the penalty of death by beheading. Early Han punishments of torturous <b>mutilation</b> were borrowed from Qin law. A series of reforms abolished <b>mutilation</b> punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado.|$|E

A {{restriction}} has been made for only those <b>mutilations</b> that are of importance for the Netherlands. These are beak treatments, toe clipping, despurring and dubbing. Also only the most common species that undergo <b>mutilations</b> are dealt with, being laying hens, layer- and broiler breeders (including breeding flocks) and turkeys...|$|R
25|$|Biochemist Colm Kelleher, who has {{investigated}} several purported <b>mutilations</b> first-hand, {{argues that the}} <b>mutilations</b> are most likely a clandestine U.S. Government effort to track the spread of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow disease") and related diseases, such as scrapie.|$|R

5|$|The breed is robustly healthy {{with few}} issues and adapts well to wet weather conditions. A {{dermatological}} condition known as acral <b>mutilation</b> and analgesia may affect French Spaniels. It is a newly recognised disorder, with symptoms becoming apparent {{between three and}} a half months and a year of age. It was first reported in thirteen dogs in Canada and shares symptoms with the acral <b>mutilation</b> syndromes of the German Shorthaired Pointer, English Pointer and English Springer Spaniels. Dogs who are affected will lick, bite and mutilate their extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infections. Self amputation of claws, digits and footpads can happen in extreme cases. The majority of the initial dogs identified were euthanised within days to months of being diagnosed.|$|E
5|$|Amin {{became the}} subject of rumours and myths, {{including}} a widespread belief that he was a cannibal. Some of the rumours, such as the <b>mutilation</b> of one of his wives, were spread and popularised by the 1980 film Rise and Fall of Idi Amin and alluded to in the film The Last King of Scotland in 2006, a movie which earned actor Forest Whitaker an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Amin.|$|E

5|$|Female genital <b>mutilation</b> (FGM), {{also known}} as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of {{some or all of}} the {{external}} female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.|$|E
5|$|Fonda {{has been}} a {{longtime}} supporter of feminist causes, including V-Day, a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit The Vagina Monologues, of which she is an honorary chairperson.

5|$|Several writers omit key {{details of}} the story. According to Pausanias, Tereus was so remorseful for his actions against Philomela and Itys (the nature of the actions is not described) that he kills himself.

5|$|The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children began {{referring}} {{to it as}} female genital <b>mutilation</b> in 1990, and the World Health Organization (WHO) followed suit in 1991.

5|$|There are {{intentional}} and unintentional modifications {{concerning the}} clitoris, including female genital <b>mutilation</b> (FGM), sex reassignment surgery, clitoris enlargement and genital piercings. For example, use of anabolic steroids by bodybuilders and other athletes {{can result in}} significant enlargement of the clitoris in concert with other masculinizing effects on their bodies. Abnormal enlargement of the clitoris may also {{be referred to as}} clitoromegaly, but clitoromegaly is more commonly seen as a congenital anomaly of the genitalia.|$|E
25|$|Closely {{related to}} the deviant {{hypothesis}} is the hypothesis that cattle <b>mutilations</b> {{are the result of}} cult activity.

25|$|It is {{alternatively}} hypothesised that cattle <b>mutilations</b> are {{the result}} of two unrelated deviant phenomena. The bulk of <b>mutilations</b> {{are the result}} of predation and other natural processes, and those with anomalies that cannot be explained in this way are the work of humans who derive pleasure or sexual stimulation from mutilating animals.|$|R

5|$|After {{a series}} of civil wars, Ladislaus's main focus was the {{restoration}} of public safety. He introduced severe legislation, punishing those who violated property rights with death or <b>mutilation.</b> He occupied almost all Croatia in 1091, which {{marked the beginning of}} an expansion period for the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Ladislaus's victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom's eastern borders for about 150 years. His relationship with the Holy See deteriorated during the last years of his reign, as the popes claimed that Croatia was their fief, but Ladislaus denied their claims.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, French art of {{the period}} often {{depicted}} women with low necklines and slender corsets; however, the <b>mutilation</b> by the French royal family of the Correggio depiction of Leda and the Swan and their apparent destruction of the famous Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo paintings of the same subject, show that nudity could be controversial in France also. In northern Europe it was seen as acceptable to portray artfully draped nudes. Examples include Rubens's Minerva Victrix, of 1622–25, which shows Marie de' Medici with an uncovered breast, and Anthony van Dyck's 1620 painting, The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham as Venus and Adonis.|$|E
5|$|Kikuyu girls {{cut each}} other's vulvas in the 1950s {{as a symbol}} of defiance, {{in the context of the}} {{campaign}} against female genital <b>mutilation</b> in colonial Kenya. The movement came to be known as Ngaitana ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.|$|E

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{at birth}} {{is estimated to}} be 54.71 years in 2012, among the lowest in the world. Endemic diseases include dengue fever, filariasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, meningitis, schistosomiasis, and sleeping sickness. The HIV/AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5.4% for those aged 15–49, although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low. Breast ironing, a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon, may affect girls' health. Female genital <b>mutilation</b> (FGM), while not widespread, is practiced among some populations; according to a 2013 UNICEF report, 1% of women in Cameroon have undergone FGM. Traditional healers remain a popular alternative to evidence-based medicine.|$|E
5|$|Motivations for {{clitoral}} modification and <b>mutilation</b> vary. Those taking hormones {{or other}} medications {{as part of}} female-to-male transition usually experience dramatic clitoral growth; individual desires and the difficulties of phalloplasty (construction of a penis) often result in the retention of the original genitalia with the enlarged clitoris as a penis analogue (metoidioplasty). However, the clitoris cannot reach {{the size of the}} penis through hormones. A surgery to add function to the clitoris, such as metoidioplasty, is an alternative to phalloplasty that permits retention of sexual sensation in the clitoris.|$|E
