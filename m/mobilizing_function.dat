This relations can resemble duality since the super-id functions are both present in the ego functions of the other partner. However, these relations are somewhat less fulfilling than dual relations. Each partner's dominant function is the others <b>mobilizing</b> <b>function.</b> Activation relationships are often romantic if both partners find each other attractive. These relationships are often very easy to start, as both partners share either extraversion or introversion.

5000|$|In dual relations, {{the leading}} {{function}} of one partner is the suggestive {{function of the}} other, and the creative function of one partner is the <b>mobilizing</b> <b>function</b> of the other. Thus, the ego functions (the strongest and most socialized) of each correspond to the super-id functions of the other (the area where the person needs and expects assistance). Likewise, the super-ego block of one corresponds to the id of the other. In this relation, just 1 of 4 Jungian dichotomies is shared—rationality/irrationality. Duality interaction is generally rewarding and satisfying for both parties, providing inspiration and support. Duality is a central theme of the philosophy of socionics study: Augusta often stated her position {{that a person who}} is estranged from contact with a dual partner must cope by unnaturally distorting their personality, a phenomenon called [...] "type masking". Relationships with conflictor types are cited as particularly troublesome: {{it is not uncommon for}} a person in a close relationship with their conflictor to develop an acute neurotic condition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aim: The aim of {{this essay}} is to study the global {{communication}} strategies of Red Cross/Red Crescent designed to help stop the hiv/aids-pandemic. The essay {{is also part of}} a cooperational project with the comprehensive purpose to investigate the relationship between the global and the local. Material and method: The study draws on different materials and methods. Four interviews with Red Cross/Red Crescent coworkers, and a qualitative text analysis of different text documents of relevance for the global communication strategies have been carried out. These constitute the main material and methods, but two occasions of direct observations at seminars have also been carried out. Main results: Due to the many differences between the localities of the world, the external global communication strategies of the Red Cross/Red Crescent are ment to be further developed at national level. The internal global communication strategies have an important <b>mobilizing</b> <b>function,</b> where the coworkers at national level are urged to commit to the fight against hiv/aids related stigma. The communications strategies at global level are constructed on basis of very broad and generalised conceptions about the target groups. The global dimensions of a global arena, global consciousness and global planning still appears important in the fight against the hiv/aids-pandemic.

50|$|Tucker practiced what he preached. Not {{only did}} he compare Soviet and tsarist Russian {{political}} leaders, but he also compared various types of political leadership in various contexts. In Politics as Leadership (1981), he argued that leadership is “the essence of politics”. He analyzed the diagnostic, prescriptive, and <b>mobilizing</b> <b>functions</b> of leadership. He surveyed “the process of political leadership,” “leadership through social movements,” and “leadership and the human situation”. He underscored that a leader’s definition of a situation could be self-fulfilling and must be communicated effectively to different audiences. And he elaborated on the key sociopsychological maxim that “situations defined as real are real in their consequences”:The political process is influenced by many a material factor, but it has its prime locus in the mind. Not only is it a mental process when leaders learn about and analyze the causes of circumstances that have arisen, when they interpret the circumstances’ meaning in relation to various concerns, when they define the problem situation for their political communities and decide on what seems the proper prescription for collective action. Mental processes are also pivotally involved—now {{in the minds of}} followers or potential followers—when leadership appeals for positive response to its policy prescription.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} Tn 916 -dependent mobilization of plasmids, donors were grown in the presence and absence of tetracycline in the mating medium. The pregrowth of donor in medium containing tetracycline increased conjugative transposition of Tn 916 and the transposon-dependent mobilization of pC 194 19 - to 119 -fold in matings between Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. Tn 916 and pC 194 transferred independently under these conditions. During inter-species matings using isogenic strains, the transfer of Tn 916 and plasmid pE 194 was detected at a frequency of 1. 4 x 10 [superscript]- 5 and 3. 2 x 10 [superscript]- 7 transconjugants/donor. Similar frequencies were observed for Tn 925 -dependent pE 194 mobilization. The process of plasmid mobilization by Tn 916 and Tn 925 is rec-independent. Neither transposon was able to transfer the plasmid pC 194 from the recipient (B. thuringiensis) to the donor containing a single chromosomal insertion of the conjugative transposon (B. subtilis). Both plasmids pUB 110 and PUB 110 [delta] m (a mob[superscript]-derivative of pUB 110) were mobilized by Tn 916. The data suggest that conjugal and <b>mobilizing</b> <b>functions</b> are enhanced {{by the presence of}} tetracycline. The mobilization of pC 194 does not occur by the complete mixing of the cytoplasm between the donor and the recipient cells. The data also suggest that mobilization of plasmids by Tn 916 does not require a functional mob region. Tn 916 and Tn 925 are functionally similar conjugative transposon...|$|R
40|$|International audienceResponsiveness of {{maturing}} natural killer (NK) {{cells to}} chemotactic molecules directly affect their retention and relocation in selected bone marrow (BM) microenvironment during development, {{as well as}} their localization at sites of immune response during inflammatory diseases. BM is the main site of NK cell generation, providing microenvironmental signals required to sustain cell proliferation and differentiation. Drastic changes of expression and function of several chemoattractant receptors can be observed during progression from precursor NK cells to immature and mature NK cells. Indeed, the gradual decrease of CXCR 4 expression parallels the increased expression of CXCR 3, CCR 1, and CX 3 CR 1 and S 1 P(5) (Sphingosine- 1 -phosphate receptor 5) on mature DX 5 (+) NK cells. The chemokine CXCL 12 is produced constitutively in the BM and, acting via CXCR 4, is critical for retaining immature and mature NK cell subsets in the BM. During steady-state, the maintenance of NK cells into BM parenchyma depends on the equilibrium of CXCR 4 retention and S 1 P(5) <b>mobilizing</b> <b>functions,</b> as the gradient of S 1 P coming from the sinusoids facilitates mature NK cell egress into circulation via S 1 P(5), when CXCR 4 /CXCL 12 -mediated retention decreases. Chemoattractants are also key factors for the response to inflammatory or infection conditions that promote mobilization of effector NK cells from storage compartments (including BM) to sites of disease or for NK cell recruitment/response during pathological conditions that affect BM integrity, including hematopoietic malignancies. In this review, we summarize what is known about the requirement for NK cell localization and exit from BM and how chemokine-mediated functions may affect BM NK cell development and immune responses...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid {{organizational}} forms combine {{values and}} practices from different institutional domains, rendering them difficult to fit neatly into {{the structures of}} extant organizational forms. Since the work required to institutionalize a new hybrid organizational form may be beyond the resources and capabilities of individual organizations acting alone, we shift the focus to inter-organizational collective action. Using empirical data from a study of a European network of renewable energy cooperatives, we find that, in order to institutionalize the new hybrid organizational form, the network can contribute to overcome the legitimacy challenges inherent in organizational hybridity. In particular, the network builds field-level receptivity to institutional pluralism, collectively codifies the hybrid organizational form, and consolidates legitimation towards plural field-level audiences. In order to perform these institutionalization roles, the network itself becomes increasingly formalized and <b>mobilizes</b> mediating <b>functions</b> involving different types of resources, legitimacy and target audiences. The research advances knowledge of hybrid organizational forms and their collective institutionalization through inter-organizational networks. Peer reviewe...|$|R

We have hypothesized that the correlation exists but varies in individuals with different levels of hypnotizability. Participants and methods: We invited 72 individuals with high (HIGH group) and 47 individuals with low (LOW group) hypnotic susceptibilities to undertake tests of NEO-PI-R and the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form C (SHSSC). Results: The HIGH group {{scored significantly higher than}} the LOW group did on openness to experience and its facet openness to feelings. In the LOW group, SHSSC total was positively predicted by openness to ideas; age regression was positively predicted by openness to experience and negatively predicted by extraversion; anosmia to ammonia was negatively predicted by agreeableness; and negative visual hallucination was positively predicted by openness to experience.

40|$|Today’s Ukrainian {{society is}} in the process of active {{building}} of democracy. It is connected with the growth of influence of the elite. Elite is a group of people which elaborates decisions which are the most important for the state. Any society can be divided into mass and elite. Ukrainian society is not an exception. Democracy building is connected with ability of a society to formulate the main principles of its development independently. It is impossible without dialogue and mutual understanding between elites. During the 20 th centuries Ukraine and other post-soviet states were transformed «from the top». It objectively increased the role of elite in the society. In the 20 th– 21 st centuries this political strategy failed. It caused growth of separatism and political, economical and cultural crises. On the one hand, prestige and authority of the elite became lower. But, on the other hand, the elite faced the question of how to be a factor of social stabilization. In the context of the difficult situation of modern Ukrainian elite where every group has a separate view on the country’s development, the scientists should pay great attention on the role of the elite in the process of democratization. The aim of this paper is a socially-philosophical analysis of the phenomenon of the elite in the context of democratic transformations. The methodological background of the article includes the ideas of classic and non-classic theories of the elites, transit and synergetic paradigms. Methodological instruments include also a number of methods, such as phenomenological, dialectical, method of idealization, and logical methods. Different methods and principles were used on the grounds of the principle of complimentarily. The problem of elite has been analyzed in the works of the following authors: O. Asmolov, М. Veber, А. Galechyan, Е. Durkheim, F. Ivanyuk, Ye. Кopayev, І. Kukolev, P. Leshukova, М. Мatrynova, R. Millse, L. Ruban, Ye. Samoylov, К. Syerdobintsev and others. In the functioning modern society, the state, political regime and economical order much depend upon the type of national and political elite. Elite (from Latin eligo — «to choose», from French elite — «the best one») can be defined as a small group of people who control a disproportionate amount of wealth or political power. National elite is a wider notion than a political elite. It includes spirituallyintellectual, economic, military, and political and other types of elites. Political elite is a social layer which maintains power, preserves political values and reproduces political system as a whole purposely to satisfy the requirements of some social groups or the whole society. To achieve these aims the political elite uses advantages of its status. Elite is a relatively closed community with limited number of members which has the most influence on important political decisions. There are different classifications of political leaders. The most general and widely used classification was formulated by M. Weber. According to Weber, leadership in a political system is spearheaded by the three types of leaders: traditional leaders, charismatic leaders and bureaucrats. They operate under either a transactional or transformational political leadership model. According to Weber’s political leadership theory, transactional political leaders use their knowledge or legal authority to achieve results. On the other hand, transformational leaders utilize their personal charisma to achieve their objectives. The main functions of political leaders are the following: a) diagnostic function, which means that the people wait for the leader’s estimation of political and social situation; b) prescriptive function, the leaders formulate political strategies and directions of movement which correspond to the group’s interests; and, c) <b>mobilizing</b> <b>functions,</b> meaning that the leaders gain social support of their views and programs and motivate other people to act according with them. Generally, elite may be both the factor of progressive social development and the obstacle for such a development because of domination of manipulative technologies which prevent normal political communication between people and authorities. Элита рассмотрена как фактор, который оказывает сильное влияние на общественное развитие. Исследованы терминологический и типологический аспекты элиты. Сделан вывод о том, что элита — это социальная общность, которая отличается от остальной массы и занимает руководящую позицию в политической, экономической, научно-интеллектуальной и других сферах социального бытия. Она может быть как фактором демократических трансформаций, так и преградой для них...|$|R
40|$|Background: Aedes albopictus is a vector of arboviruses {{that cause}} severe {{diseases}} in humans such as Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika fevers. The vector competence of Ae. albopictus {{varies depending on}} the mosquito population involved and the virus transmitted. Wolbachia infection status in believed to be among key elements that determine viral transmission efficiency. Little {{is known about the}} cellular <b>functions</b> <b>mobilized</b> in Ae. albopictus during co-infection by Wolbachia and a given arbovirus. To decipher this tripartite interaction at the molecular level, we performed a proteome analysis in Ae. albopictus C 6 / 36 cells mono-infected by Wolbachia wAlbB strain or Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and bi-infected. Results: We first confirmed significant inhibition of CHIKV by Wolbachia. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, we identified 600 unique differentially expressed proteins mostly related to glycolysis, translation and protein metabolism. Wolbachia infection had greater impact on cellular functions than CHIKV infection, inducing either up or down-regulation of proteins associated with metabolic processes such as glycolysis and ATP metabolism, or structural glycoproteins and capsid proteins in the case of bi-infection with CHIKV. CHIKV infection inhibited expression of proteins linked with the processes of transcription, translation, lipid storage and miRNA pathways. Conclusions: The results of our proteome profiling have provided new insights into the molecular pathways involved in tripartite Ae. albopictus-Wolbachia-CHIKV interaction and may help defining targets for the better implementation of Wolbachia-based strategies for disease transmission control...|$|R
