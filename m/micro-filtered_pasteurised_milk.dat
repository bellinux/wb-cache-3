40|$|The overall aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the differences between raw/farm <b>milk</b> and <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> with respect to potential immune modifying effects following consumption and investigate the bacterial composition of raw <b>milk</b> compared to <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk.</b> Furthermore, in this thesis, panels of potential probiotic bacteria from the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera were investigated. The overall bacterial composition of raw milk was compared with <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> using samples obtained from commercial milk producers around Ireland using next generation sequencing technology (454 pyrosequencing). Here the presence of previously unrecognised and diverse bacterial populations in unpasteurised cow’s milk was identified. Futhermore the bacterial content of <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> was found to be more diverse than previously thought. The global response of the adenocarcinoma cell line HT- 29 to raw <b>milk</b> and <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> exposures were also characterised using whole genome microarray technology. Over one thousand differentially expressed genes were identified which were found to be involved in a plethora of cellular functions. Interestingly a reduction in immune related activity (e. g. Major histocompatability complex class II signalling and T and B cell proliferation) was identified in cells exposed to <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> compared with raw milk exposures. Further studies comparing human cell response to raw versus <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> was performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors. A reduction in CD 14 was identified following raw milk exposures compared with <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> and the pattern of cytokine production may indicate that gram positive bacteria in the raw milk were contributing to the differences in the cellular response to raw versus <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk.</b> Panels of potentially probiotic bacteria (comprising of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) were further assessed for immunomodulatory capabilities using cell culture based models. Gene expression and cytokine production were used to evaluate stimulated and unstimulated (LPS) cellular responses as well as interaction mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For {{different}} reasons, {{the amount}} of food loss for developing and developed countries is approximately equivalent. Altogether, these losses represent approximately 1 / 3 of the global food production. Significant amounts of <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> are lost due to bad smell and unpleasant taste. Currently, even under the best cold chain conditions, psychrotolerant spore-forming bacteria, some of which also harbour virulent factors, limit the shelf life of <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk.</b> N 2 gas-based flushing has recently been of interest for improving the quality of raw milk. Here, we evaluated the possibility of addressing bacterial growth in <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> during cold storage at 6 °C and 8 °C. Clearly, the treatments hindered bacterial growth, in a laboratory setting, when N 2 -treated milk were compared to the corresponding controls, which suggests that N 2 -flushing treatment constitutes a promising option to extend the shelf life of <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{effects of}} the {{indigenous}} raw milk flora on the chemical composition of Austrian Bergkâse was evaluated by means of repeated cheesemaking experiments from raw or <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk.</b> GeneraIly, changes caused by the pasteurisation of raw milk did not significantly affect the gross com-(position of the resulting cheeses but, as monitored by sampIing during maturation, systematically showed effects on proteolysis, Whereas degradation of ast-casein proved to be delayed in cheeses made from <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> due to effects caused by heat treatment and partial eIimination of the raw milk flora, an enhanced cIeavage of l 3 -casein was found in cheeses from <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk.</b> These differences were also evident in the water-soluble fraction and, partly, in fractions containing smaller breakdown products and were presumably caused by heat-induced changes in the plasmin/plas-minogen complex.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine whether}} the effects of farming systems on the cheese sensory properties are reduced when the milk used to make cheese is <b>pasteurised.</b> The <b>milk</b> of cows reared under two grazing systems (extensive and semi-extensive) was processed into raw and <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> cheeses. These grazing systems were mainly differentiable by the milk fatty acid (FA) composition and, to a lesser extent, by their levels of lactic acid bacteria, which were higher in milk from the extensive grazing system. In cheese, the different FA composition persisted and affected the texture of the cheese regardless of the milk treatment. The effects of each grazing system were indistinguishable in several cheese characteristics (proteolysis, texture, and aroma) after pasteurisation. In contrast, among <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> cheeses, those resulting from an extensive system had greyer rinds, while no difference in rind colour was observed among raw milk cheeses...|$|R

40|$|The {{milk market}} {{is covered in}} Italy almost {{completely}} by UHT milk and by the different categories of <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk.</b> Whereas various laws protect the quality and genuineness of fresh <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk,</b> {{in the case of}} UHT milk there is not any regulation about minimal quality requirements. With the aim to determine the level of heat-damage of UHT milk marketed in Italy the following indices were quantified by HPLC techniques: furosine (Ministerial Decree 16 - 05 - 1996), lactulose (ISO 11868 : 2007 /IDF 147 : 2007) and b-lactoglobulin (ISO 13875 : 2005 //IDF 178 : 2005). A total of 43 samples of UHT milk (24 at the purchase time and 19 at the best before date) from 8 different producers, among which 2 foreign ones, was analysed. The same parameters were also determined in 15 samples of <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> (fresh and microfiltered) and in 13 samples of high-pasteurised milk from 4 italian producers. In the case of UHT milk the following results were obtained: 163, 91 ± 62, 48 mg/ 100 g of protein for furosine, 338, 05 ± 173, 56 mg/l for lactulose and 445, 21 ± 221, 14 mg/l for b-lactoglobulin. In the case of furosine, as expected, statistically significant differences were registered between values from samples analysed at the purchase time and values from samples analysed at the best before date. The results obtained revealed wide ranges of values for the examined parameters, showing that for the UHT milk marketed in Italy there is not an homogeneous level of quality. <b>Pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> samples, even if in limited number, revealed a very narrow variability range, with mean values of 7, 54 ± 1, 75 and 14, 77 ± 3, 70 mg/ 100 g of protein (furosine), 3071, 67 ± 236, 34 and 1409, 31 ± 616, 90 mg/l (b-lactoglobulin), respectively for <b>pasteurised</b> and high-pasteurised <b>milk...</b>|$|R

After incubation at 7 °C until the total aerobic plate count reached 106 to 107 cfu/ml, {{or the number of}} GPS exceeded 104 cfu/ml isolates were picked randomly and identified. All GNP present in the raw milk were properly killed during pasteurisation. A recontamination by GNP was observed in 40 % of the consumer packages. This recontamination was focused to the filling procedure, and Pseudomonas was the dominating GNP in all packages. Environmental samples, as water from different water sources in the dairy plant, air collected by a RCS-sampler on water-agar strips, and empty, formed and sealed packages taken from the filling machines, were inoculated with sterile milk. GNP isolates were randomly picked and identified after incubation at 7 °C. Samples of water and air collected in the immediate surroundings of the filling machine contained large numbers of GNP causing growth in refrigerated milk. GNP isolates from the milk samples and from the environmental samples were genomically typed by the PCR-based method Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The RAPD-typing showed that there are many different RAPD-types involved in the recontamination of <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk.</b> Several of the milk contaminating RAPD-types were found in condensed water on the filling nozzles, in waste-water {{at the bottom of the}} filling machine, and in air surrounding the filling machine. Some contaminating RAPD-types were present inside the filling machine over long periods, especially at the bottom of the filling machine. The effect on post-pasteurisation contamination by reducing the usage of water around the filling machine was studied. A clear link between the usage of water inside the machine and the frequency of consumer packages contaminated by GNP was found. B. cereus were involved in, and sometimes solely responsible for, the spoilage of <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk.</b> The B. cereus infection can originate from heat-resistant spores present in the raw milk, but B. cereus can also enter the milk at the dairy plant.

Intervention: In addition to a fully controlled diet, the subjects consumed each day 500 ml of <b>pasteurised</b> or UHT <b>milk,</b> either fortified or not with 200 μg folic acid. Results: Consumption of fortified milk increased folate concentrations in serum and in red blood cells (RBQ by 6. 6 - 7. 0 nmol/l (P< 0. 001) and 32 - 36 nmol/l (P< 0. 01), respectively. Similarly, plasma homocysteine concentrations were lowered 0. 88 - 0. 89 μmol/l (P = 0. 001) in subjects who consumed fortified milk. The bioavailability of folic acid from <b>pasteurised</b> <b>milk</b> relative to that of folic acid from UHT milk was 74 - 94 % (NS), depending on the parameter used. Conclusions: Milk fortified to supply an additional 200 μg of folic acid/s substantially increased folate status, and decreased plasma total homocysteine concentrations in young, healthy subjects. Milk is therefore a suitable matrix for fortification to enhance the folate status in humans. No significant effect of endogenous FBP was found on the bioavailability of folic acid from milk. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved...|$|R
