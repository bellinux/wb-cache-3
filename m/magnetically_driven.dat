The flexomagnetoelectric effect appears in spiral multiferroics or micromagnetic structures like domain walls and magnetic vortexes. Ferroelectricity developed from micromagnetic structure can appear in any magnetic material even in centrosymmetric one.

Existing symmetry classification of magnetic domain walls was applied for predictions of electric polarization spatial distribution in their volumes.

40|$|A concise {{review of}} {{observations}} of the alpha dynamo effect in laboratory plasmas is given. Unlike many astrophysical systems, the laboratory pinch plasmas are <b>driven</b> <b>magnetically.</b> When the system is overdriven, the resultant instabilities cause magnetic and flow fields to fluctuate, and their correlation induces electromotive forces along the mean magnetic field. This alpha-effect drives mean parallel electric current, which, in turn, modifies the initial background mean magnetic structure towards the stable regime. This drive-and-relax cycle, or the so-called self-organization process, happens in magnetized plasmas in a timescale much shorter than resistive diffusion time, thus it is a fast and unquenched dynamo process. The observed alpha-effect redistributes magnetic helicity (a measure of twistedness and knottedness of magnetic field lines) but conserves its total value. It can be shown that fast and unquenched dynamos are natural consequences of a driven system where fluctuations are statistically either not stationary in time or not homogeneous in space, or both.

40|$|A <b>magnetically</b> {{dominated}} plasma <b>driven</b> by motions on boundaries {{at which}} magnetic field lines are anchored {{is forced to}} dissipate the work being done upon it, {{no matter how small}} the electrical resistivity. Numerical experiments have clarified that dissipation is achieved through the formation of a hierarchy of electrical current sheets. The probability distribution function of the local winding of magnetic field lines is nearly Gaussian, with a width of the order unity. The dissipation is highly irregular in space and time, but the average level of dissipation is well described by a scaling law that is independent of the electrical resistivity. If the boundary driving is suspended {{for a period of time}} the magnetic dissipation rapidly drops to insignificant levels, leaving the magnetic field in a nearly force-free state. Renewed boundary driving leads to a quick return to dissipation levels compatible with the rate of boundary work, with dissipation starting much more rapidly than when starting from idealized initial conditions with a uniform magnetic field. Application of these concepts to the solar corona lends credibility to realistic, three-dimensional numerical models that predict emission measures, coronal structures, and heating rates compatible with observations.
