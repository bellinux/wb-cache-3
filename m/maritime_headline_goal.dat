50|$|The <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> {{was built}} upon an earlier {{bilateral}} Franco-British Joint Declaration adopted at St. Malo in December 1998. The St. Malo Declaration {{said that the}} European Union {{ought to have the}} capability for “autonomous action backed up by credible military forces” as part of a common defence policy. The St. Malo Declaration laid the political foundation between France and the Great Britain, which in turn facilitated the launch of the European Security and Defence Policy and the formulation of the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> Catalogue is {{a listing}} of rapid {{reaction}} forces composed of 60,000 troops managed by the European Union, but under control of the countries who deliver troops for it.|$|R
5000|$|The European Union {{made its}} first {{concrete}} step to enhance military capabilities, {{in line with the}} ESDP, in 1999 when its member states signed the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal.</b> They include the creation of a catalogue of forces, the 'Helsinki Force Catalogue', to be able to carry out the so-called “Petersberg Tasks”. The EU launched the European Capabilities Action Plan (ECAP) at the Laeken Summit in December 2001. However, {{it became clear that the}} objectives outlined in the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> were not achievable quickly. In May 2004, EU defence ministers approved [...] "Headline Goal 2010", extending the timelines for the EU's projects. However, it became clear that the objectives cannot be achieved by this date too. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé espressed his desperation: “The common security and defense policy of Europe? It is dead.” ...|$|R

50|$|The Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> was a {{military}} capability target set for 2003 during the December 1999 Helsinki European Council meeting {{with the aim of}} developing a future European Rapid Reaction Force. There was much interest in the idea of a single EU military force, and inexact characterisations of the initiative (which was not much more than some headquarters arrangements and a list of theoretically available national forces) led to imprecise journalistic depictions about a unified European Army. Following the initial declaration in December 1999, the formal agreement on the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> was reached on November 22, 2004 and according to statements made by EU officials the first units will be deployable in 2007. Since January, 1st of 2007 60,000 soldiers have been available for a possible European Rapid Reaction Force who are potentially deployable for at least a year.|$|R

However, some EU states may and do make multilateral agreements about defence issues outside of the EU structures.|$|R
5000|$|As the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> became fulfilled, the European Council of June 2004 {{approved}} to further develop the EU’s military crisis management capability {{and a new}} target was set: the [...] "Headline Goal 2010". EU members made the commitment {{that by the year}} 2010, at the latest, they would be capable of responding [...] "with swift and decisive action applying a fully coherent approach" [...] to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty of the EU and the 2003 EU Security Strategy (i.e. humanitarian and rescue tasks, disarmament operations, support to third countries in combating terrorism, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, and peacemaking). The EU also aims to address the shortfalls from the previous <b>headline</b> <b>goal</b> (e.g. gaps related to strategic airlift and sealift) which are still considered to be a limiting factor to the operability of the designated forces, especially in more demanding crisis management operations.|$|R
50|$|Inequality and inequities have {{significantly}} increased in recent decades, possibly {{driven by the}} worldwide economic processes of globalisation, economic liberalisation and integration. This has led to states ‘lagging behind’ on <b>headline</b> <b>goals</b> such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and different levels of inequity between states have been argued to {{have played a role}} in the impact of the global economic crisis of 2008-2009.|$|R
50|$|The Battlegroups {{project is}} not to be {{confused}} with the projected Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> force, which concerns up to 60,000 soldiers, deployable for at least a year, and take one to two months to deploy. The Battlegroups are instead meant for more rapid and shorter deployment in international crises, probably preparing the ground for a larger and more traditional force to replace them in due time.|$|R
5000|$|The SDGs {{have been}} criticized for being contradictory, because in seeking high levels of global GDP growth, they will {{undermine}} their own ecological objectives.

To that end, a number of {{efforts were made to}} increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500personnel.|$|R
50|$|The EUMC was {{formally}} established in December 2000 by the European Council of Nice, {{and is one}} of several defence and security-related bodies established {{as a result of the}} Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal,</b> which was decided in December 1999. EUMC is composed of the Chiefs of Defence of the EU Member States who are represented on a regular basis by their permanent military representatives in Brussels, who often are two- or three-star flag officers. A similar committee also exists within NATO, and those countries which are members of both EU and NATO have in most cases chosen to use the same person as permanent military representative to both organisations.|$|R
5000|$|Battlegroups as a {{combined}} arms military unit, based around an infantry battalion or armoured regiment, {{are not a}} new concept. However, the initial ideas for specific EU Battlegroups began at the European Council summit on 10-11 December 1999 in Helsinki. The Council produced the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> 2003 and specified {{the need for a}} rapid response capability that members should provide in small forces at high readiness. The idea was reiterated at a Franco-British summit on 4 February 2003 in Le Touquet which highlighted as a priority the need to improve rapid response capabilities, [...] "including initial deployment of land, sea and air forces within 5-10 days." [...] This was again described as essential in the [...] "Headline Goal 2010".|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> 2010 and the decision to create rapidly deployable ‘battlegroups’ are proof of the continued dynamism of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). Yet, although major progress has been booked in recent years, and further important achievements can be expected in the short term, not all questions relating to ESDP have already been addressed by policy-makers. All EU Member States are engaged in the transformation of their armed forces. Because of budgetary constraints, this is necessarily a gradual process. Furthermore, {{for most of the}} Member States it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the traditional wide range of capabilities in army, navy and air force. This paper will set out to assess whether cooperation, pooling and specialisation in the framework of the EU can offer an answer to these challenges...|$|R
50|$|The Military Staff has {{supervised}} {{a number}} of deployments since its establishment.

EUFOR is a temporary military deployment, not a permanent military force, and {{should not be confused with}} the Eurocorps, Eurofor or the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> Force Catalogue, sometime misleadingly known as the 'European Rapid Reaction Force'. The name 'EUFOR' probably was patterned in imitation of NATO's IFOR, SFOR, and KFOR.|$|R

40|$|This {{project has}} {{examined}} the question of; “how has the Lisbon Treaty changed the way the EU is able to apply force” through a breaking down of key concepts and categories inspecting EU’s role in or use of power, peacekeeping and global actorness in relation to how the Lisbon Treaty has changed the EU’s relation to these. The project has utilized leading authors {{on the field of}} EU studies to as a theoretical framework grounding the analysis in the conceptions of these authors. The project concludes that the innovations of the Lisbon Treaty has empowered a militarisation of the EU in its peacekeeping effort, but has not changed the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goals</b> of the EU foreign policy as reflected in the Petersberg Tasks. This implies that the Lisbon Treaty might not have changed the EU’s normative power, and further fuels the debate of whether the EU is or still is not a global actor...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, poverty {{has been}} {{high on the}} agenda of the European Union and the 27 Member States. They have engaged in {{considerable}} activities to tackle poverty and social exclusion in Europe. The Member States agreed upon a broad range of sophisticated methodologies to measure poverty and exclusion. At the heart of these methodologies is the EU-SILC approach, which provides the most relevant and “visible” data on income and living conditions across Europe including those of millions of households in (income) poverty. A sign of the prominent place of the poverty agenda {{is the fact that the}} year 2010 was declared the “European Year Against Poverty and Social Exclusion”, a year dedicated to programmes and events aiming to raise academic, political and public awareness regarding poverty and to combat social exclusion more forcefully. Furthermore, one of the five high-profile <b>headline</b> <b>goals</b> of the EU 2020 process was dedicated to the containment of poverty and social exclusion, including explicit quantitative targets. It goes without saying that these efforts and intentions are commendable, and in the interest of future social cohesion in Europe.|$|R
40|$|The {{announcement}} of the establishment of rapid response European Battlegroups (EUBG) in the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> of 2004, functioning as the first European military capabilities, was marked as the start {{for the establishment of}} a common defence and security policy in the European Union. It is argued that the EUBG were a logical consequence of de further deepening of the European integration process at the end of the 1990 s and would prove that even on such a sensitive issue the member states were able to contribute without only pursuing the national interest. This research focuses on the implementation and impact of the EUBG concept and shows that there must be a clear distinction between paper reality and the military feasibility of supranational cooperation. Subject to many determining factors the EUBG have never been deployed and are not recognized as common support until today. As such, this research seeks for the substantiation why the EUBG did not succeed in their primary task as accelerator of the integration process. This research suggests that without a policy-based embedding, a military executive organization misses not only the right facilities, but it is also insufficiently supported to be successful in the end...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. In December 1998, French and British leaders {{declared that the}} European Union (EU) must develop the capacity for autonomous military action to respond to international crises. In December 1999, EU leaders meeting in Helsinki established the Headline Goal-defined as the autonomous ability to deploy 60, 000 troops in 60 days for an operation lasting {{as long as one}} year to conduct the "Petersberg Tasks" of humanitarian intervention, peacekeeping, and peacemaking. The deadline for the operational capability of the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> is December 2003. Although in December 2001 the EU declared that it had "some" operational capability, it remains unable to conduct certain Petersberg Tasks, especially "upper" level missions such as peacemaking on the model of NATO's Kosovo intervention. Despite the current military force structures of EU member states, significant capability shortfalls, and stagnant or declining defense budgets in most EU countries, it appears that the EU will be able to conduct lower-level Petersberg Tasks in permissive environments by December 2003. However, capabilities needed for upper level tasks, such as strategic airlift, will take several years to develop and acquire-far beyond the deadline of December 2003.

40|$|The Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, {{during the}} first {{semester}} of 2002, came at a singular time {{for the development of}} the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). Despite the important progress achieved by previous presidencies, numerous challenges remained, and the work towards the achievement of the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> by 2003 was obviously the most notable one. The declaration of the European Council at Laeken in December 2001, making ESDP operational, immediately encouraged some member states to put forward the need to commit in the shortest term the EU’s crisis management capabilities in the Balkans. But the disagreement of some countries on the issue of the participation of NATO’s European allies in ESDP continues to hinder progress in this direction. Nevertheless, Spain has conducted a very fruitful Presidency, achieving very substantial progress in many aspects and launching initiatives that complement the mandate received in Laeken. In order to have a clear picture of the achievements of the Spanish Presidency in the field of ESDP, it is important to begin with a very brief description of the situation at the end of the Belgian Presidency...|$|R

40|$|The European Union and {{its member}} states have moved with {{considerable}} speed towards {{the creation of}} a European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). Whether what has been achieved so far adds up to a revolution remains a moot point. The Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Maastricht Treaty has not always been noted for its binding character, and too often the debate over security and defence has degenerated into an artificial, zero-sum-type game between Atlanticists and Europeanists. What is required for the success of the ESDP is not simply continued commitment to achieving the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goals</b> set out at Helsinki in 1999, but also the development of what the authors call a ‘strategic culture’, i. e. an institutional confidence and processes to manage and deploy military force as part of the effective range of legitimate policy instruments of the Union. The authors argue that political commitment at the highest levels has been underpinned by the institutionalization, within the Council Secretariat, of the ‘military option’ {{in the form of the}} Military Committee and a Directorate General for the EU’s Military Staff (DGEUMS). Even more importantly, there are already signs, especially through such concepts as ‘security sector reform’ and ‘structural stability’, that the EU, through its development and humanitarian programmes, has already recognized the necessity of military solutions...|$|R

By comparing these approaches with the current modus operandi in security research planning at EU level (i. e.

Bearing in mind that the realities of EU security research planning (at the moment) do not allow for an optimum, "truly" demand-driven planning solution, we present a pragmatic approach to develop a framework for a capability-based planning on EU level and possibly, e. g. as a reference, also for national security research, potentially contributing to a harmonisation of security application requirements at EU and Member State level...|$|R

40|$|The European Security and Defence Policy or ESDP is {{considered}} a major element of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, {{the second of the}} three so-called ?pillars? of the European Union (EU).

When the Cologne European Council in June 1999 appointed Javier Solana as the High representative of the CFSP they also declared that ?the EU must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO?.

40|$|The thesis {{will define}} Italian {{contribution}} to European {{integration in the}} field of Security and Defence Policy. The first objective of this research is to describe how Italy placed itself in the debate on the development of ESDP if compared to the Franco‐German couple and the British approach: two opposing views dominated this debate: Atlanticism and the “autonomous” approach to European Defence. The former has been supported by the UK and other countries; The latter has been supported by the Franco‐German couple and other countries. Italy has often placed in between, by assuring conformity of the European initiatives with NATO, while promoting a stronger cooperation in a European framework. The thesis analyses in depth the Italian defence policy, the contribution to the European military and civilian capabilities and operations, the participation of Italian high brass in ESDP and NATO structures, the industrial interests in European defence industry and in the intergovernmental cooperation in armaments. The research utilise the Foreign Policy Analysis method, by means of a three level: transatlantic level (relations between US and European allies through NATO); European (relation between Anglo‐ Italians and Franco‐German approaches) internal (the interests of main Italian stakeholders: Politicians, Military, Diplomats and Industry). The main findings are that Italy had given to the ESDP a more sound contribution than expected. This is mainly due to the cooperation with the UK and the bureaucratic interests of the internal administrative actors. Italy is together with France is the first troops contributor for the EU military capabilities. The British‐Italian cooperation has led to new concepts for the ESDP, such as the <b>headline</b> <b>goal</b> and has boosted the military operation in the bilateral, NATO, and ESDP framework. Italy has been leading in the civilian capabilities and operations, in particular in Police Missions and Civil Protection. The Italian defence industry is emerging as a key actor in the European and US markets. The lack of a consistent national security and defence policy, because the ruling class is not interested, boosts the bureaucratic interests of the administrative élites that are shaping the role of Italy in the development of ESDP...|$|R

The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is a technology demonstrator aimed in the mid-frequency range, and achieves instantaneous wide-area imaging through the development and deployment of phased-array feed systems on parabolic reflectors. The large field-of-view makes ASKAP an unprecedented synoptic telescope that will make substantial advances in SKA key science.

40|$|Introduction. The {{following}} {{paper is}} based on the author’s "Conditions and options for an autonomous 'Common European Policy on Security and Defence' in and by the European Union in the post-Amsterdam perspective opened at Cologne in June 1999 ", written after the decisions by the European Council in June 1999 and published by the Center for European Integration Studies in Bonn. In addition, it is supplemented by a new analysis of the problems raised by the later agreements {{in the context of the}} EU summit decisions at Helsinki and Nice on European security and defence policy, the European crisis reaction forces and the "Headline Goal" for their strength and composition. The question is asked, whether these decisions and guidelines as well as the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> for the forces meet the conditions posed by the European security situation, the requirements of the European military contribution to Nato as well as those for an independent European military crisis response. This paper discusses the main aspects of the planned security, defence and crisis response policies in the limited European context against the background of crisis and conflict realities on the European periphery and beyond. It deals in particular with six central issues and problems of a general nature: the issue of political-military structures and intergovernmental decisionmaking in the EU, the problem of force structuring between participants for military operations outside Nato, the issue of standardisation, interoperability and readiness of crisis response forces, the problem of "European options" for independent use of EU forces in crisis and conflict, the issue of "European Armed Forces" and European military integration in the EU - the problem of harmony in the Atlantic alliance for an enlarged "European role". These six subjects are interrelated and must be seen in the general context. They are being dealt with in this discussion paper in three parts: I. The necessary political-military structures and political decision-making in the EU on security and defence policy for crisis response, including the requirements for flexibility in exercise of international missions and mandates under changing conditions. II. The requirements for force structuring, including interoperability and standardisation, readiness of forces and sustainability of deployments in crisis contingencies as conditions for "European" options of crisis response. III. The problems of harmony within the alliance, compatibility with US forces und of the creation of "European Armed Forces" for a "European defence" within the alliance as the hidden agenda behind the EC programme of 1999 / 2000...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary. CSDP: Strategy Needed. Why does Europe {{develop the}} {{military}} and civilian capabilities that it does? Why does it undertake {{the military and}} civilian operations that it does? And why in other cases does it refrain from action? The {{answers to these questions}} would amount to a civilian-military strategy for the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Starting from the EU’s vital interests, an analysis of the threats and challenges to these interests, and the EU’s foreign policy priorities, a CSDP strategy would outline the priority regions and issues for CSDP and, in function of the long-term political objectives and the appropriate political roadmap for those regions and issues, scenarios in which launching an operation could be appropriate. Without strategy, we can never be sure that the operations that we do are actually the most relevant and important that we could undertake. We cannot direct the operations that we do undertake to achieve the desired strategic effect. And we cannot focus capability development if we do not know our strategic priorities. Many of the building-blocks of a CSDP strategy already exist. What remains to be done is to connect the dots and render explicit: (1) for which priority regions and issues we must plan and prepare, (2) for which possible scenarios that may require a CSDP operation, and (3) identify the implications for our capabilities and a roadmap to meet those requirements. Priority Regions and Issues. The regions and issues on which CSDP ought to focus are those where our vital interests are most directly at stake: • Defence against any military threat to the territory of the Union. • Open lines of communication and trade (in physical as well as in cyber space). • A secure supply of energy and other vital natural resources. • A sustainable environment. • Manageable migration flows. • The maintenance of international law (including the UN Charter and the treaties and regulations of the key international organizations) and of universally agreed rights. • Preserving the autonomy of the decision-making of the EU and its Member States. That {{does not mean that the}} EU will disregard other regions and issues, but it does provide the focus for early warning and prevention, and for permanent contingency planning for: • The Eastern Neighbourhood (the Baltic to the Black Sea). • The Southern Neighbourhood (the Dardanelles to Gibraltar). • The Gulf. • Central Asia. • Sub-Sahara Africa. • Maritime security. • Collective security under the UN, notably the Responsibility to Protect. If the main focus of CSDP is on the external security of the Union, it does have a complementary role to play in our internal security as well, notably in the implementation of the Solidarity Clause, and including perhaps, in the future, in our collective defence. Scenarios for Operations. For the purpose of military planning, as well as to guide military capability development, the EU military bodies have elaborated five illustrative scenarios. These no longer cover all operations that the EU already is undertaking. Five new scenarios ought to be added: • A Maritime Security Scenario. • A Cyber Security Scenario. • A Support Operations Scenario. • A Counter-Terrorism Scenario. • An Internal Security Scenario. Capability Implications. In order to stay in tune with today’s higher level of crisis management activity, the existing military <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> has to be interpreted broadly. The aim to be able to sustain a corps level deployment (50 to 60, 000 troops) for at least one year should be understood as a deployment which EU Member States must be able to undertake at any one time over and above ongoing operations. Then the EU would be able to deal with every eventuality. Generating the necessary capabilities requires an ambitious approach to pooling & sharing, but also to go beyond it and create a Permanent Capability Conference as a durable strategic-level platform for harmonization of national defence planning as such, rather than project-by-project coordination only. With regard to civilian capabilities, achieving the original civilian <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> would already constitute a significant improvement, but there is a lack of implementation and follow-through by the Member States. If decentralised civilian capacity-building does not work, the EU should have recourse to sizeable standby pools of civilian personnel which are pre-identified, trained, and ready for deployment. There is scope for combining military and civilian capability development in at least five areas: communications, information, transport, protection and logistics. The EU could be the first to create a permanent civilian-military Operational Headquarters (OHQ), in Brussels, which could plan for and conduct both civilian and military operations and, allowing for close interaction with all relevant EU actors, could implement a truly comprehensive approach to crisis management. Information gathering, analysis and dissemination are strategic enablers for any military or civilian operation or mission. A real Intelligence Fusion and Analysis Centre should replace the scattered poles of intelligence within the EU institutions. From Strategy to Action. Adopting a strategy for CSDP will not in itself guarantee resolute action in each and every crisis. But forging a consensus on priority regions and issues and drawing the conclusions from that for our capabilities, including planning and conduct, will focus our preventive, long-term efforts, and will certainly make us better prepared for action in any contingency. Being more prepared and knowing in advance what our priority regions and issues are, and why, will then hopefully also strengthen the political will to generate action under the EU flag by the able and willing Member States, and will thus make for an EU that carries its weight on the global stage...|$|R
