However, no information has been published regarding the <b>minimum</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> (MID) of PEDV in different pig models. The main objective of this study was to determine the oral <b>minimum</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> of PEDV in naïve conventional neonatal piglets and weaned pigs. A U. S. virulent PEDV prototype isolate (USA/IA 19338 / 2013) with known infectious titer was serially ten-fold diluted in virus-negative cell culture medium, and inoculated into 5 -day-old and 3 -week-old pigs. Our data showed that PEDV is infectious in an age-dependent manner with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs. Furthermore, it showed that, once an infection was established in pigs, the initial dose of PEDV administered did not affect the extent of fecal viral shedding, severity of histopathologic lesions, or magnitude of antibody titer subsequently developed. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results, designing a PEDV bioassay model, as well as emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms...|$|E

Primary hepatocytes were infected in tissue culture following isolation by collagenase treatment of liver wedge biopsy material. Viral replication was monitored by a highly strand-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, which could detect the positive- and negative-strands of HEV RNA independently in a sensitive and specific manner.

40|$|Dose–response {{experiments}} {{characterize the}} relationship between infectious agents and their hosts. These experiments are routinely used to estimate the <b>minimum</b> effective <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> for an <b>infectious</b> agent, which is most commonly characterized by the dose at which 50 per cent of challenged hosts become infected—the ID 50. In turn, the ID 50 {{is often used to}} compare between different agents and quantify the effect of treatment regimes. The statistical analysis of dose–response data typically makes the assumption that hosts within a given dose group are independent. For social animals, in particular avian species, hosts are routinely housed together in groups during experimental studies. For experiments with non-infectious agents, this poses no practical or theoretical problems. However, transmission of infectious agents between co-housed animals will modify the observed dose–response relationship with implications for the estimation of the ID 50 and the comparison between different agents and treatments. We derive a simple correction to the likelihood for standard dose–response models that allows us to estimate dose–response and transmission parameters simultaneously. We use this model to show that: transmission between co-housed animals reduces the apparent value of the ID 50 and increases the variability between replicates leading to a distinctive all-or-nothing response; in terms {{of the total number of}} animals used, individual housing is always the most efficient experimental design for ascertaining dose–response relationships; estimates of transmission from previously published experimental data for Campylobacter spp. in chickens suggest that considerable transmission occurred, greatly increasing the uncertainty in the estimates of dose–response parameters reported in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that accounting for transmission in the analysis of dose–response data for Campylobacter spp. challenges our current understanding of the differing response of chickens with respect to host-age and in vivo passage of bacteria. Our findings suggest that the age-dependence of transmissibility between hosts—rather than their susceptibility to colonization—is the mechanism behind the ‘lag-phase’ reported in commercial flocks, which are typically found to be Campylobacter free for the first 14 – 21 days of life...|$|R

OCN 008 was grown in pure culture, recreated signs of disease in experimentally infected corals, and could be recovered after infection.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologySteven S. DritzCassandra K. JonesBiological hazards {{in animal}} feed are {{a growing concern}} for the feed industry. Porcine {{epidemic}} diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the first viral pathogen confirmed to be transmissible in swine feed and feed ingredients. This led to investigations identifying the magnitude of transmissible risk PEDV imposes and strategies to mitigate infectivity in contaminated diets. The objective of the first experiment was to evaluate the <b>minimum</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> of PEDV in virus-inoculated feed. Pigs became infected when PEDV concentrations at or above 5. 6 × 10 ¹ 50 % tissue culture infectious dose/g (TCID₅₀/g); corresponding feed cycle threshold (Ct) of 37 or below was utilized. Evaluation of a mitigation strategy for PEDV contaminated diets is also important since cross-contamination during feed manufacturing is possible. Therefore, the objective of the second experiment was to determine the effectiveness of feed batch sequencing as a method to minimize the risk of PEDV cross-contamination. This method was effective to reduce but not eliminate infectious PEDV carryover risk. Furthermore, feed that lacked detectible PEDV RNA as analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR assay (qPCR) was infectious. The third study was an observational study complementary to the previous experiment where the magnitude of virus contamination in the feed manufacturing facility was characterized during feed batch sequencing. Widespread contamination of the facility occurred and surfaces remained contaminated until chemically cleaned. The final experiment was conducted to assess PEDV RNA detection in feed and spray dried porcine plasma (SDPP) when analyzed by qPCR across 5 diagnostic laboratories. Overall, it appears qPCR PEDV RNA detection in feed and SDPP was precise as quantified by low coefficient of variation across laboratories, {{with the exception of one}} %CV from SDPP inoculated with low virus load from one laboratory.

C 3 H/He mice developed severe arthritis at all <b>infectious</b> <b>doses,</b> with 100 % infection requiring 200 spirochetes.

Spirochete levels in rear ankle joints of C 3 H/HeJ and C 3 H/HeN mice were relatively high, as detected by PCR, and did not increase with <b>infectious</b> <b>dose.</b> Spirochete levels in joints from BALB/cAnN mice increased with increasing <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> to levels found in severely arthritic C 3 H/He mice.

40|$|Viral Nervous Necrosis (VNN) is a {{globally}} distributed {{disease that}} affects {{a large number}} of finfish species, causing significant economic losses on affected farms. The causative agent is a small single stranded RNA virus called Nervous Necrosis Virus (NNV) from the genus Betanodavirus. NNV is neurotropic; clinical signs involve abnormal behaviour and high mortality associated with histopathological findings of vacuolating necrosis in the central nervous system and retina. In Australia, NNV has been isolated from Australian bass (Macquaria Novemaculeata) and barramundi (Lates calcarifer) populations recurrently for the past 10 and 25 years, respectively. However, the prognosis of NNV infection is highly variable. Although NNV became notorious for mass mortalities in marine fish hatcheries, it is often detected in apparently healthy individuals in the absence of clinical signs or histopathological lesions. Current knowledge on NNV epidemiology and pathogenesis is fragmentary. It is still unclear how the virus is transmitted between hosts and why some individuals are susceptible to VNN while others are not. The aim of this work was to study the epidemiology and pathogenesis of NNV in Australian native species with a focus on transmission and disease determinants to provide a basis for the development of prevention and control strategies. In Chapter 3, a partially retrospective study was conducted on the occurrence of NNV at the Darwin Aquaculture Centre (DAC), a barramundi hatchery. Observations on NNV detection frequency and distribution provided clues to the possible transmission pathways of the virus, including the potential role of broodstock as reservoirs, and the age-dependency of the disease. To assess the NNV exposure distribution among populations of adult fish, an indirect antibody detection ELISA was developed (Chapter 4). The assay was optimized and compared with a competitive ELISA format to provide the best discriminatory power between sera from immunized and non-immunized populations. After defining the best antibody detection protocol (the indirect ELISA), the diagnostic accuracy of the assay was assessed in naturally exposed subjects using a Bayesian approach {{in the absence of a}} gold standard (Chapter 5). After validation of the ELISA, a single point and repeated cross sectional analysis of NNV seroprevalence was conducted on native Australian adult fish populations (barramundi, Australian bass and groupers Epinephelus sp.) (Chapter 6). Survey results discredited the role of broodstock as NNV reservoirs based on the lack of correspondence between NNV seroprevalence and the occurrence of NNV outbreaks at the hatchery level. Results also suggested that the exposure of adult fish to NNV antigens must be progressive as seroconversion was often observed and the seroprevalence tended to be higher in older fish populations. From this and previous accumulated epidemiological evidence, horizontal transmission of NNV was considered most likely. An environmental reservoir outside the hatcheries has yet to be investigated. In Chapter 7, the factors influencing the pathogenesis of NNV in barramundi were explored. Juveniles of different ages were challenged by immersion to analyse the influence of the age of the host on VNN disease expression. Additionally, to test the influence of the virus isolate, juveniles were challenged with two inoculums obtained from NNV outbreaks in barramundi populations with different disease presentation (clinical and subclinical). Results showed that fish from all the age groups tested (range 20 to 63 days post hatch) were susceptible to NNV infection. However, the survival of the fish following NNV challenge was highly influenced by the age of the host. Juveniles of 5 weeks of age and older showed no clinical signs and their survival odds were the same as the non-challenged controls, whereas younger fish developed clinical disease. No significant effect on disease severity was noted between different NNV isolates. In Chapter 8, the factors influencing the pathogenesis of NNV in Australian bass were explored. In addition to the age of the host and the isolate factor, the influence of the dose of the virus and the water temperature on VNN expression was examined. As with barramundi, the disease expression in Australian bass was age dependent. The severity of the disease was affected by the water temperature in younger fish but it did not affect the outcome in fish above 5 weeks of age. The dose of the virus influenced the incidence of infection but not the severity of the disease expression. Again, no significant effect on disease severity was noted between the two isolates tested. From the experimental challenge of barramundi and Australian bass, further observations on NNV pathogenesis were provided: incubation period, <b>minimum</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>dose,</b> tissue distribution, shedding and humoral immune response. The results from this study narrow the knowledge gap on NNV transmission mechanisms and provide important insights into the virus pathogenesis in barramundi and Australian bass. The virus is most likely being transmitted horizontally and VNN disease expression as distinct from infection with NNV is highly age dependent. From this evidence, recommendations are made on the direction of efforts to control VNN at the farm level. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|European foulbrood {{is a major}} {{disease of}} the larval honey bee (Apis mellifera) that {{is caused by the}} {{bacterium}} Melissococcus pluton. In Australia, antibiotic treatment with oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC) is usually required to control the disease and prevent colony population and production losses. To investigate OTC residues in honey following the medication of colonies, several field and laboratory studies were conducted. Post-treatment residues in surplus honey following the application of 1 g of OTC in a dry sugar carrier ranged from 0. 050 - 0. 093 mg/kg and 0. 28 - 0. 41 mg/kg when a sugar syrup carrier was used. Residues were not detected {{in the second and third}} extraction of surplus honey from the medicated colonies. Over a 12 month sampling period, OTC residues in stored honey at ambient temperature from the first extraction post-treatment degraded by 0. 035 mg/kg (50. 9 %) following a dry sugar application and 0. 153 mg/kg (43. 6 %) for residues originating from a sugar syrup application. Degradation of OTC in duplicate samples of the same honey, but in a 22 C controlled temperature environment, saw a decline in residue from a dry sugar application of 0. 058 mg/kg (92. 5 %) and 0. 225 mg/kg (63. 8 %) for a sugar syrup application. OTC residues (0. 017 mg/kg) were detected in broodnest honey of treated colonies 142 days post-treatment. Temperature was shown to have a dramatic effect on the degradation of OTC in honey. However, correlations were not strongly determined between OTC degradation and the honey pH (r 2 -= 0. 20, - 0. 35) or moisture content (r 2 = 0. 74, 0. 38) at 22 C and 35 C respectively. OTC residues were determined for a considerably longer period in stored honey than has previously been reported. The efficacy of medication with three different OTC doses (0. 3, 0. 4 and 0. 5 g OTC) to clinically EFB-infected colonies was established. The number of larvae showing clinical symptoms of EFB was significantly reduced (P< 0. 05) post-treatment. OTC medicated extender patties were shown not to reduce clinical symptoms of EFB in colonies. Experiments were conducted to determine the concentration of OTC in honey bee larvae following its application to colonies. The application of 0. 3 g, 0. 5 g and 1. 0 g OTC in caster sugar was administered to single- and double-storey colonies. The mean OTC concentration was above the minimum inhibitory concentration of OTC to M. pluton for 2 to 6 days post-treatment, depending upon the dose. The daily rate of change of concentration of OTC in larvae sampled from treated colonies ranged from 0. 423 to 0. 672. Application of 0. 3 g and 0. 5 g OTC in distilled water gave equal to or higher OTC levels in larvae on the first two days post-treatment when compared to the same doses applied in caster sugar. The current dosing regime in Australia (0. 5 g for single-storey and 1 g for double-storey colonies) was confirmed as being appropriate for effective control of EFB. A hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was further developed for the detection of M. pluton in adult bees and honey bee products. A chloroform:isoamyl alcohol DNA extraction method was used to provide template from 169 samples of adult bee components, broodnest honey, pollen, whole larvae and comb cells. All 36 honey bee products tested from a diseased colony were shown to contain M. pluton by hemi-nested PCR and sub-clinical infections were detected in adult bees, larvae and honey collected from ten apparently healthy colonies. Of 80 bulk honey samples from six Australian states, 57 of 80 (68. 8 %) samples were shown to contain M. pluton by hemi-nested PCR, with culture techniques detecting the bacteria in 22 of 80 (27. 5 %) samples tested. M. pluton was detected in honey from all states except Western Australia in which EFB has never been reported. The hemi-nested PCR assay was shown to detect 20 fg of genomic M. pluton DNA and to be specific when tested against 13 bacterial species including phylogenetically-related bacteria or those commonly found in honey bee colonies. The hemi-nested PCR was established as the most sensitive technique for the detection of M. pluton in honey bees and their products. Larvae were successfully reared in vitro with an average mortality of 6. 4 % and an estimated intake of 164 til of larval food. Clinical evidence of EFB was not determined following the inoculation of larvae with artificially cultured M. pluton, even though large populations of the bacteria were identified in the midgut by microscopy and culture. However, EFB was successfully transmitted to larvae in vitro for the first time using M. pluton isolated from the midguts of diseased larvae. EFB was confirmed in these larvae using microscopy, histology and culture. A maximum larval mortality from EFB was observed in 15 of 16 (93. 8 %) larvae fed a diet containing 2. 0 x 105 M. pluton organisms/ml. A clear dose-relationship (r 2 = 0. 96) was demonstrated between the concentrations of M. pluton in the larval diet and mortality. A relationship (r 2 = 0. 92) was also demonstrated between the duration of feeding a contaminated diet (2 x 105 M. pluton organisms/ml) and mortality. A mean lethal dose was estimated to be LD 50 = 1. 08 x 105 M. pluton organisms/ml and the <b>minimum</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> was calculated to be 33 M. pluton organisms or a larval diet of 2. 0 x 102 M. pluton organisms/ml. The ability to transmit EFB to in vitro larvae provides the first assay for EFB, which will be invaluable in the future research of the disease. A 120 colony commercial apiary was employed to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation and prophylactic OTC treatment on the incidence of EFB over two years. In the second year of the trial when EFB was common, OTC application in late winter resulted in a significantly lower (P< 0. 05) incidence of EFB. however, no significant differences were observed between control colonies and those dietary supplemented. There were no significant differences between colonies in each treatment in spring honey production (P= 0. 862) or adult protein levels (P= 0. 815) at the completion of the trial. No relationship (r 2 =- 0. 121, P= 0. 632) was found between the mean daily temperature and the incidence of EFB. However, a relationship was found with the mean monthly number of days with precipitation and the increased incidence of EFB in treatment 2 (r 2 = 0. 583) and 3 (r 2 = 0. 590), and this was significant (P< 0. 05). The average adult bee populations of EFB infected colonies at the completion of spring 2001 were 7. 9 frames of bees, which is 5. 6 (41. 5 %) frames of bees lower than the trial average of 13. 5. Average honey production in diseased colonies was 2. 63 kg, which is 8. 67 kg (77 %) lower than the trial average of 11. 3 kg per colony.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections and accelerated immune senescence is controversial. Whereas some studies reported a CMV-associated impaired capacity to control heterologous infections at old age, other studies could not confirm this. We hypothesized that these discrepancies might {{relate to the}} variability in the <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> of CMV occurring in real life. Here, we investigated the influence of persistent CMV infection on immune perturbations and specifically addressed {{the role of the}} <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> on the contribution of CMV to accelerated immune senescence. We show in experimental mouse models that the degree of mouse CMV (MCMV) -specific memory CD 8 + T cell accumulation and the phenotypic T cell profile are directly influenced by the <b>infectious</b> <b>dose,</b> and data on HCMV-specific T cells indicate a similar connection. Detailed cluster analysis of the memory CD 8 + T cell development showed that high-dose infection causes a differentiation pathway that progresses faster throughout the life span of the host, suggesting a virus–host balance that is influenced by aging and <b>infectious</b> <b>dose.</b> Importantly, short-term MCMV infection in adult mice is not disadvantageous for heterologous superinfection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). However, following long-term CMV infection the strength of the CD 8 + T cell immunity to LCMV superinfection was affected by the initial CMV <b>infectious</b> <b>dose,</b> wherein a high <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> was found to be a prerequisite for impaired heterologous immunity. Altogether our results underscore the importance of stratification based on the size and differentiation of the CMV-specific memory T cell pools for the impact on immune senescence, and indicate that reduction of the latent/lytic viral load can be beneficial to diminish CMV-associated immune senescence...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> {{required}} to infect mosquito vectors {{when they take}} a blood meal from a viremic person is a critical parameter underlying the probability of dengue virus (DENV) transmission. Because experimental vector competence studies typically examine the proportion of mosquitoes that become infected at intermediate or high DENV <b>infectious</b> <b>doses</b> in the blood meal, the minimum blood meal titer {{required to}} infect mosquitoes is poorly documented. Understanding the factors influencing the lower infectiousness threshold is epidemiologically significant because it determines the transmission potential of humans with a low DENV viremia, possibly including inapparent infections, and during the onset and resolution of the viremic period of acutely infected individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared the susceptibility of two field-derived Aedes aegypti populations from Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand when they were orally exposed to low titers of six DENV- 2 isolates derived from the serum of naturally infected humans {{living in the same}} region. The <b>infectious</b> <b>dose,</b> time-point post-blood feeding, viral isolate and mosquito population, were significant predictors of the proportion of mosquitoes that became infected. Importantly, the dose-response profile differed significantly between the two Ae. aegypti populations. Although both mosquito populations had a similar 50 % oral <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> (OID 50), the slope of the dose-response was shallower in one population, resulting in a markedly higher susceptibility at low blood meal titers...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here that}} in the rabbit ocular model of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) latency, {{spontaneous}} reactivation of the HSV- 1 ICP 34. 5 deletion mutant d 34. 5 increased significantly in response to increasing <b>infectious</b> <b>doses.</b> At the highest <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> of d 34. 5, the spontaneous reactivation rate was indistinguish-able from that of wild-type virus (average spontaneous reactivation rates for d 34. 5, 0. 3 to 1. 4 % at 2 3 105 PFU per eye, 3. 4 % at 23 106 PFU per eye, and 6. 3 to 11. 5 % at 13 108 PFU per eye; average spontaneous reactivation rates for marker-rescued virus, 7. 7 to 19. 6 % at 2 3 105 PFU per eye). The percentage of latency-associated transcript (LAT) RNA-positive neurons in sections from trigeminal ganglia (TG) of rabbits latently infected with d 34. 5 demonstrated a similar dose-response effect as estimated by in situ hybridization (0. 05 % LAT RNA-positive neurons at 2 3 105 PFU per eye and 0. 1 % LAT RNA-positive neurons at 1 3 108 PFU per eye; P 5 0. 002). In contrast, even at the highest <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> (1 3 108 PFU per eye), d 34. 5 was less virulent (23 of 23 survivors) than the normal <b>infectious</b> <b>dose</b> (2 3 105 PFU per eye) of marker-rescued virus (14 of 27 survivors; P < 0. 0001).
