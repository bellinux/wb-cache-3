25|$|MacInnis {{first met}} Pierre Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, in late 1969. Trudeau and MacInnis would make {{approximately}} fifty dives together over the years. In 1970 Trudeau asked MacInnis to help write Canada's first national ocean policy. MacInnis {{began a series}} of ten research expeditions to study techniques for working under the Arctic Ocean. Also in 1970, MacInnis founded the James Allister MacInnis Foundation for underwater research and education in Canada. In March 1971 MacInnis {{was a member of a}} Canadian Broadcasting Corporation crew filming Harp seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, resulting in the first photographs ever taken of the seals in their underwater environment. Author and conservationist Farley Mowat was another member of the expedition. Mowat also helped encourage MacInnis to write. Also in 1971, MacInnis helped oversee the successful decompression of Ocean Systems diver Bill <b>Maltman</b> after he was fouled in wreckage while taking part in salvage operations in the wake of the crash of a B-52 into Lake Michigan. The same year, MacInnis published Underwater Images, a book of poetry accompanied by photographs of undersea life taken by MacInnis.|$|E

50|$|The churchyard {{belongs to}} South Leith Parish Church a {{building}} of great antiquity, and {{covered by a}} separate article. The churchyard was only used for burial from the mid 17th century, earlier interments being inside the church, beneath the parishioners usual seating position (or threaded in the rafters {{if you had a}} balcony position). The churchyard is split into trades: <b>maltmen</b> (brewers); porters; mariners etc. reflecting the layout of altars within the church in pre-Reformation days. In 2009 an excavation linked {{to the creation of the}} Edinburgh tram unearthed several bodies just outside the churchyard wall A planning application to demolish the wall in its entirety was approved in January 2012 following no public comment despite this very radical proposition. This was necessitated by the proposed tram works, which was considered to threaten the stability of the wall. Demolition is required in order to provide a good new foundation to the wall (which is to be then rebuilt). However, this work will also clearly require the exhumation of hundreds of bodies within the churchyard, and is a complex matter in terms of Scottish burial law. The irony of this planning consent is that it post-dated the abandonment of the Leith section of the Edinburgh Tram Project in June 2011.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR BOB,--I {{must make}} out a letter this mail or perish in the attempt. All the same, I am deeply stupid, {{in bed with a}} cold, {{deprived}} of my amanuensis, and conscious of the wish but not the furnished will. You may be interested to hear how the family inquiries go. It is now quite certain that we are a second-rate lot, and came out of Cunningham or Clydesdale, therefore British folk; so that you are Cymry on both sides, and I Cymry and Pict. We may have fought with King Arthur and known Merlin. The first of the family, Stevenson of Stevenson, was quite a great party, and dates back to the wars of Edward First. The last male heir of Stevenson of Stevenson died 1670, Â£220, 10s. to the bad, from drink. About the same time the Stevensons, who were mostly in Cunningham before, crop up suddenly in the parish of Neilston, over the border in Renfrewshire. Of course, they may have been there before, but there is no word of them in that parish till 1675 in any extracts I have. Our first traceable ancestor was a tenant farmer of Mure of Cauldwell's--James in Nether Carsewell. Presently two families of <b>maltmen</b> are found in Glasgow, both, by re-duplicated proofs, related to James (the son of James) in Nether Carsewell. We descend by his second marriage from Robert; one of these died 1733. It is not very romantic up to now, but has interested me surprisingly to fish out, always hoping for more--and occasionally getting at least a little clearness and confirmation. But the earliest date, 1655, apparently the marriage of James in Nether Carsewell, cannot as yet be pushed back. From which of any number of dozen little families in Cunningham we should derive, God knows! Of course, it doesn't matter a hundred years hence, an argument fatal to all human enterprise, industry, or pleasure. And to me it will be a deadly disappointment if I cannot roll this stone away! One generation further might be nothing, but it is my present object of desire, and we are so near it! There is a man in the same parish called Constantine; if I could only trace to him, I could take you far afield by that one talisman of the strange Christian name of Constantine. But no such luck! And I kind of fear we shall stick at James.|$|R

Three violent deaths in about seventy years, against which we can only put the case of Thomas, servant to Hume of Cowden Knowes, who was arraigned with his two young masters for the death of the Bastard of Mellerstanes in 1569. John ("in Dalkeith") stood sentry without Holyrood while the banded lords were despatching Rizzio within.

[...] John got a maid with child to him in Biggar, and seemingly deserted her; she was hanged on the Castle Hill for infanticide, June 1614; and Martin, elder in Dalkeith, eternally disgraced the name by signing witness in a witch trial, 1661. These are two of our black sheep.[2] Under the Restoration, one Stevenson was a bailie in Edinburgh, and another the lessee of the Canonmills. There were at the same period two physicians of the name in Edinburgh, one of whom, Dr. Archibald, {{appears to have been a}} famous man in his day and generation. The Court had continual need of him; it was he who reported, for instance, on the state of Rumbold; and he was for some time in the enjoyment of a pension of a thousand pounds Scots (about eighty pounds sterling) at a time when five hundred pounds is described as [...] "an opulent future." [...] I do not know if I should be glad or sorry that he failed to keep favour; but on 6th January 1682 (rather a cheerless New Year's present) his pension was expunged.[3] There need be no doubt, at least, of my exultation at the fact that he was knighted and recorded arms. Not quite so genteel, but still in public life, Hugh was Under-Clerk to the Privy Council, and liked being so extremely.
