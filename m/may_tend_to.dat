25|$|Although mongrels exhibit great variation, {{generations of}} {{uncontrolled}} breeding and environmental pressures <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> shape them toward certain general average body types and characteristics known as landraces, {{some of which}} may be developed by people into new breeds such as the Alaskan husky.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{twist drill}} bits <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> wander when started on an {{unprepared}} surface. Once a bit wanders off {{course it is}} difficult to bring it back on center. A center drill bit frequently provides a reasonable starting point as it is short and therefore has a reduced tendency to wander when drilling is started.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{children}} from differing communities may treat their toys {{in different ways}} based on their cultural practices. Children in more affluent communities <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be possessive of their toys, while {{children from}} poorer communities may {{be more willing to}} share and interact more with other children. The importance the child places on possession is dictated by the values in place within the community that the children observe on a daily basis.|$|E
25|$|When {{large amounts}} of weight are needed, a harness {{may be used to}} carry the load on the diver's shoulders, rather than around the waist, where it <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> slip down into an uncomfortable {{position}} if the diver is working in a vertical posture, which is often the case. Sometimes this is a separate harness, worn under the safety harness, with pockets at the sides to carry the weights, and sometimes it is an integrated system, which carries the weight in pockets built into or externally attached to the safety harness.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{disagreement}} over {{what constitutes a}} [...] "significant" [...] cultural divergence creates difficulties of categorization, [...] "cross-cultural" [...] is nevertheless useful in identifying writers, artists, works, etc., who <b>may</b> otherwise <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> fall between the cracks of various national cultures.|$|R

25|$|Being {{the weakest}} {{of the weak}} {{chemical}} forces, with a strength between 0.4 and 4kJ/mol they may still support an integral structural load when multitudes of such interactions are present. Such a force results from a transient shift in electron density. Specifically, as the electrons are in orbit of the protons and neutrons within an atom the electron density <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> shift more greatly on a side. Thus, this generates a transient charge to which a nearby atom can be either attracted or repelled. When the interatomic distance of two atoms is greater than 0.6 nm the force is {{not strong enough to}} be observed. In the same vein, when the interatomic distance is below 0.4 nm the force becomes repulsive.|$|E
25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E
25|$|Scuba demand valves {{which are}} set to breathe lightly (low {{cracking}} pressure, and low work of breathing) <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> free-flow relatively easily, particularly if the gas flow in the housing {{has been designed to}} assist in holding the valve open by reducing the internal pressure. The cracking pressure of a sensitive demand valve is often less than the hydrostatic pressure difference between the inside of an air-filled housing and the water below the diaphragm when the mouthpiece is pointed upwards. To avoid excessive loss of gas due to inadvertent activation of the valve when the DV is out of the diver's mouth, some second stages have a desensitising mechanism which causes some back-pressure in the housing, by impeding the flow or directing it against the inside of the diaphragm.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} chords which <b>may</b> or <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> precede the {{dominant}} the subdominant diatonic function {{acts as a}} dominant preparation or predominant. In theories after Hugo Riemann it is considered to balance the dominant around the tonic (being as far below the tonic as the dominant is above).|$|R

5000|$|Character {{evidence}} is admissible {{in a criminal}} trial if offered by a defendant as circumstantial evidence—through reputation or opinion evidence—to show {{his or her own}} character, as long as the character evidence the defendant seeks to introduce is relevant to the crime with which the defendant is charged. [...] For example, if a defendant is charged with a crime involving dishonesty, defendant <b>may</b> introduce evidence <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> show defendant's honest character. If defendant is charged with a violent crime, defendant <b>may</b> introduce evidence <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> show defendant's peaceful character.|$|R
25|$|It is {{important}} that the gas mixture in a cylinder is thoroughly mixed before analysing or the results will be inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not moving fast enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure complete mixing. However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, mechanical agitation is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder on a flat surface and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends.|$|E
25|$|Debate {{over the}} {{specific}} cause or {{causes of the}} Bengali famine hinges {{on a series of}} interlinked questions: when the nature and scope of the disaster were recognized, whether enough food was available at the provincial or national level (or via international food aid arranged by Great Britain) to feed the population of Bengal, and whether the failure of the colonial rulers to alleviate the crisis was due to incompetence or insensitivity to Bengal's needs. The relative impact of each of these factors as a cause or contributing factor to the levels of death and economic devastation is still a matter of controversy. In addition to the complexity of the issues and the questionable accuracy of much of the statistical data that could resolve the debates, a potentially complicating factor is that the conclusions are highly politicised, which <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> predispose the content and tone of the conclusions reached.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the jacket}} of a suit, between the outer fabric {{and the inner}} lining, there is a layer of sturdy {{interfacing}} fabric to prevent the wool from stretching out of shape; this layer of cloth is called the canvas after the fabric from which it was traditionally made. Expensive jackets have a floating canvas, while cheaply manufactured models have a fused (glued) canvas. A fused canvas is less soft and, if poorly done, damages the suppleness and durability of the jacket, so many tailors are quick to deride fused canvas as being less durable, particularly since they <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> permanently pucker along the jacket's edges after some use or a few dry cleanings. However, some selling this type of jacket claim that the difference in quality is very small. A few London tailors state that all bespoke suits should use a floating canvas.|$|E

25|$|Although parasites are {{generally}} considered to be harmful, the eradication of all parasites would not necessarily be beneficial. Parasites account for at least half of life's diversity; they perform an important ecological role (by weakening prey) that ecosystems would take some time to adapt to; and without parasites, organisms <b>may</b> eventually <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> asexual reproduction, diminishing the diversity of sexually dimorphic traits.|$|R

25|$|Coin tossing is {{a simple}} and {{unbiased}} way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as {{which side of the}} field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.|$|E
500|$|In 1669 Mariana, the Queen Regent of Spain, ordered {{attacks on}} English {{shipping}} in the Caribbean.

In response Modyford commissioned Morgan [...] "to do and perform all manner of exploits, which <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> the preservation and quiet of this island". By December Morgan was sailing toward the Spanish Main with a fleet of over 30 English and French ships carrying {{a large number of}} privateers. Zahedieh observes that the army of privateers was the largest that had gathered in the Caribbean at the time, which was [...] "a mark of Morgan's renown".|$|E
500|$|Gawain's {{refusal of}} the Lady Bertilak's ring has major {{implications}} {{for the remainder of}} the story. While the modern student <b>may</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by the lady, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in Pearl. This is especially true of the lady's ring as scholars believe it to be a ruby or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a [...] "brygt sunne" [...] (line 1819), a [...] "fiery sun." [...] This red colour can be seen as symbolizing royalty, divinity, and the Passion the Christ, something that Gawain as a knight of the Round Table would strive for, but this colour could also represent the negative qualities of temptation and covetousness. Given the importance of magic rings in Arthurian romance, this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm just as Lady Bertilak claims the girdle will.|$|E

2500|$|The {{process of}} {{identifying}} a suitably comprehensive decision criteria set is also vulnerable to being skewed by pressures arising {{at the political}} interface.
