25|$|Unlike {{marriage}} {{which has}} an international recognised legal status, there are no international treaties on recognition of unmarried couple's legal status. If an unmarried couple change residence to different countries, then the local law on where the couple is last domiciled is applied to them. This covers legal status of the relationship, rights, obligations, and all worldwide movable and immovable property. To otherwise interpret the law would <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> the unmarried couple had assets in several different countries, they would then need separate legal cases in each country to resolve all their movable and immovable property.|$|E

25|$|Two {{hypothesis}} {{tests are}} particularly widely used. First, {{one wants to}} know if the estimated regression equation is any better than simply predicting that all values of the response variable equal its sample <b>mean</b> (<b>if</b> not, it is said to have no explanatory power). The null hypothesis of no explanatory value of the estimated regression is tested using an F-test. If the calculated F-value is found to be large enough to exceed its critical value for the pre-chosen level of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis, that the regression has explanatory power, is accepted. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of no explanatory power is accepted.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{points out}} that beliefs and {{meanings}} are inseparable. A person holds a sentence true {{based on what he}} believes and what he takes the sentence to <b>mean.</b> <b>If</b> the interpreter knew what a person believed when that person held a sentence to be true, the meaning of the sentence could then be inferred. Vice versa, if the interpreter knew what a person took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred. So Davidson doesn't allow the interpreter to have access to beliefs as evidence, since the interpreter would then be begging the question. Instead, Davidson allows that the interpreter can reasonably ascertain when a speaker holds a sentence true, without knowing anything about a particular belief or meaning. That will then allow the interpreter to construct hypotheses relating a speaker and an utterance to a particular state of affairs at a particular time.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch has two {{children}} with Wendi Deng: Grace (b. New York, 19 November 2001) and Chloe (b. New York, 17 July 2003). It was revealed in September 2011 that Tony Blair is Grace's godfather. There {{is reported to be}} tension between Murdoch and his oldest children over the terms of a trust holding the family's 28.5 percent stake in News Corporation, estimated in 2005 to be worth about $6.1 billion. Under the trust, his children by Wendi Deng share in the proceeds of the stock but have no voting privileges or control of the stock. Voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch on the one side and his children of his first two marriages. Murdoch's voting privileges are not transferable but will expire upon his death and the stock will then be controlled solely by his children from the prior marriages, although their half-siblings will continue to derive their share of income from it. It is Murdoch's stated desire to have his children by Deng given a measure of control over the stock proportional to their financial interest in it (which would <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> Murdoch dies while {{at least one of the}} children is a minor, that Deng would exercise that control). It does not appear that he has any strong legal grounds to contest the present arrangement, and both ex-wife Anna and their three children are said to be strongly resistant to any such change.|$|E

500|$|A {{modified}} and fictionalized {{account of}} the Baird nomination formed the core of Wendy Wasserstein's 1996 play An American Daughter, which was later made into a 2000 television film. [...] Wasserstein saw the episode, {{as well as what}} happened to Wood, as an example of double standards and sexism, and used it as a vehicle to explore the nature and status of American feminism as of the 1990s. [...] She said of its role in illustrating feminist issues, [...] "I <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> Nannygate hadn't existed, what a great thing to make up as a way of talking about it."

Not on record anyway... Like peeking through the windows of the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I find it a mite frustrating." [...] White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as [...] "all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out", and calling I Want You [...] "simply the explorative aftermath of Let's Get It On. The sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating [...] "was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice?

He's going to leave. You know, in a couple of years' time when his contract is going to finish. So we have to give him the opportunity to see how he can do in the first-team and he's got great ability." [...] Pogba was promoted to the club's reserve team permanently for the 2011–12 season and made his first appearance of the season on 15 August 2011 in the team's opening Premier Reserve League match against Arsenal. On 25 August, in the team's second league match against Swansea City reserves, Pogba scored the second goal in a 6–0 rout. On 19 September, he was named to the first team to participate in their Football League Cup tie against Leeds United the following day, with Ferguson proclaiming, [...] "I intend to play him [...] against Leeds United." [...] Pogba appeared as a half-time substitute to make his professional debut as Manchester United won the match 3–0. Pogba made his second appearance against Aldershot Town in the Fourth Round of the League Cup on 25 October 2011.|$|E
500|$|With {{the film}} {{seemingly}} continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered [...] "to {{what extent the}} whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron.

What does it <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be at a point where we really can’t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?" [...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing {{on the other side of}} that wall.

500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like nothing else in the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The odd thing is that it was left in there. I <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E
