50|$|Compared {{to water}} (or steam), sodium has a {{relatively}} low vapor pressure at the operating temperatures of the reactor. The Sodium Reactor Experiment design utilized sodium as a coolant so high-pressure water systems would not be required. The reactor {{did not have a}} containment pressure vessel, because the <b>maximum</b> <b>credible</b> <b>accident</b> would not release enough gas volume to require pressure containment. It was designed to retain gases at about atmospheric pressure and reduce diffusion leakage from potentially contaminated gas. The Sodium Reactor Experiment included a complex of buildings, workshops and support systems. The reactor was housed in the main reactor building, which consisted of a high bay area and a hot cell facility. Three cleaning cells were located in the main building. The cleaning cells were designed to wash sodium from the fuel elements with water in an inert atmosphere. The cleaning allowed examination of the fuel rods after they were removed from the reactor. Because sodium reacts violently with water, the wash cell was sealed off and flooded with inert gas to minimize the reaction during washing. Operators worked behind thick walls to limit their exposure to radiation emitted from the fuel elements, which were loaded into the cell through a ceiling entrance hole (normally covered with a heavy shield plug).|$|E

50|$|The name Event Tree {{was first}} {{introduced}} during the WASH-1400 nuclear power plant safety study (circa 1974) where the WASH-1400 team needed an alternate method to fault tree analysis due to the fault trees being too large. Though not using the name event tree the UKAEA first introduced ETA in its design offices in 1968. Initially to try to use whole plant risk assessment to optimize {{the design of a}} 500MW Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor. This study showed ETA condensed the analysis into a manageable form. ETA was not initially developed during WASH-1400, {{this was one of the}} first cases in which it was thoroughly used. The UKAEA study used the assumption that protective systems either worked or failed, with the probability of failure per demand being calculated using fault trees or similar analysis methods. ETA identifies all sequences which follow an initiating event. Many of these sequences can be eliminated from the analysis because their frequency or effect are too small to affect the overall result. A paper presented at a CREST symposium in Munich,Germany in 1971 shows how this was done. The conclusions of the US EPA study of the Draft WASH-1400 acknowledges the role of Ref 1 and its criticism of the <b>Maximum</b> <b>Credible</b> <b>Accident</b> approach used by AEC. MCA sets the reliability target for the containment but those for all other safety systems are set by smaller but more frequent accidents and would be missed by MCA.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} {{the adequacy of the}} storage ring bulk shielding for reducing the radiation hazard outside of secured areas, due to errant particle beam losses. The hazard class (Low, Medium or High) of an accelerator is determined by the onsite and offsite effective dose equivalent under the assumption of a maximal <b>credible</b> <b>accident</b> occurring. The <b>credible</b> maximal <b>accident</b> condition is that which produces at the weakest part of the shielding at full power the greatest amount of radiation at the subject position outside the secured area during one hour. For the hazard class to be Low, the onsite radiation level must be between 1 and 25 rem in the one hour duration of the maximal <b>credible</b> <b>accident.</b> The safety envelope defines the bounding conditions for the safe operation of a DOE accelerator facility. The measured dose rate results at each location showed wide variations, which tends to indicate that the missteered beam may not have hit at the same point for each repeat of a given loss scenario. However, all measured results were comfortably below the calculated values. It appears the use of semi-empirical calculational methods are generally quite conservative, which is desirable for perceived beam loss accidents at the safety envelope. With respect to the disagreement between the calculated dose rates and the measured values for the maximal <b>credible</b> <b>accident,</b> the authors suspect that the actual showering which takes place is more distributed along the beamline than the 4 -m-long beam spill assumed in the calculations. Since the distribution is not known this adds further to the difficulty in correlating the measured results with the calculated values. In all controlled loss studies, it appears that the measured results were obtained for showers that may not have been fully developed...|$|R

The environmental survey of the Jülich Nuclear Research Center serves as an example to demonstrate, which methods can be applied in practice to solve the problems, arising in monitoring waste air.

The inner ring {{as the most important}} sub-system is discussed in some more detail. By evaluations of the activity emissions in the case of reactor accidents and of the dispersion depending on the meteorological conditions, the magnitude of environmental contamination is estimated and reasons are given for number and location of the measuring stations of the inner monitoring ring.

40|$|Moderator Reactor (VMR), a reactor concept under {{investigation}} by American-Standard for the AEC. The VMR is light-water moderated and cooled and is fueled with slightly enriched uranium dioxide pellets loaded into aluminum tubes. The core consists of 37 hexagonal fuel cans each loaded with 61 fuel pins. The cooling water, which flows upward around the pins inside the fuel can, boils in passing through the core. Reactor control in the prototype will be achieved by varying the moderator height. The site, laboratory, and the critical assembly, including control and safety mechanisms, are described in detuil. Special characteristics of the assembly pentinent to safety were calculated. The nuclesr energy released and the average and maximum fuel temperatures resulting from step reactivity increases up to 2 % DELTA k/k are presented graphically for two cases. In the first case, fuel-temperature effects {{are considered to be}} the oniy shutdown mechanism; in the second radiolytic gas is considered to contribute to shutdown, in addition to fuel-temperature effects.

40|$|As well known, risk is a {{combination}} of probability and consequences of an accident. Different concepts were developed in evaluating accident consequences. First, the worst-case concept, meaning that the most negative consequences imaginable are described. A more applied approach is the reference to the <b>maximum</b> <b>credible</b> <b>accident</b> scenario. In analyzing the consequence of accidental hydrocarbon fires and the potential for domino effects, the evaluation of the flame extent and temperature are of the utmost importance. The primary effects of pool fires are due to thermal radiation and issues of interplant/tank spacing employees' safety zones, fire wall specifications are to be addressed {{on the basis of a}} proper consequence analysis. In order to avoid too conservative results, imposing anti-economic geometric constraints, for example in term of spacing, a realistic scenario evaluation is therefore needed. By means of real scale experimental tests it was verified that both the thermal power and the flame temperature T increase as the pool area increases, up to reach maximum values in connection with a "critical pool dimension". Dealing with pool areas higher than the critical one, experimental results, performed by different researchers at different scales, show a decrease of T. An in-depth analysis of the different concurring phenomena connected to a pool fire development allowed identifying the limiting step controlling the flame temperature In fact, the trend of T is mainly determined by the increasing difficulty of oxygen diffusion within the internal bulk of gaseous hydrocarbons. In this paper, we propose a pool fire model suitable: • to provide a theoretical insight into the above-mentioned experimental trends; • to obtain the maximum values of the flame temperature and of the thermal power, considering the pool size and the chemico-physical characteristics of the hydrocarbon...|$|E

The purpose of this research reactor is to make pumped loop studies of aircraft reactor fuel elements and other reactor components, radiation effects studies on aircraft reactor materials and equipment, shielding studies, and nuclear and solid state physics experiments. The reactor is light water cooled and moderated of the MTR-type with a primary beryllium reflector and a secondary water reflector. The core initially will be a 3 by 9 array of MTR-type fuel elements and is designed for operation up to a power of 60 megawatts. The reactor facility is described in general terms.
