An ideal biomaterial will be cytocompatible – it will not cause an adverse response in the body – and will have similar physical properties to the material it is replacing. Group 2 metal phosphates make good biomaterials as they are chemically similar to bone and teeth. The synthesis and structure of <b>magnesium</b> <b>acid</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> MgH_ 2 P_ 2 O_ 7 is reported. Attempts to dope calcium and magnesium acid pyrophosphates with metal cations to alter their physical and biological properties are described. The properties of a material can be modified by producing a composite. The interactions between a naturally occurring polymer, polyhydroxybutrate and calcium polyphosphate were investigated {{to see if a}} composite could be formed. It was found that polyhydroxybutrate decomposed at too low a temperature for a calcium polyphosphate composite to occur. The small piezoelectric properties of bone may assist the healing of any damage. γ-calcium polyphosphate may exhibit a piezoelectric effect. To measure this aligned crystals are required. γ-calcium polyphosphate was synthesised in magnetic and electric fields in an attempt to produce alignment.

40|$|Batter {{ingredients}} and mixing process parameters determine the flow and viscoelastic {{properties of the}} batter. These structural changes impact the baking performance and thus {{the quality of the}} final baked product in terms of cake volume and texture. A complex experimental design was performed to study a cake batter system, using a limited number of observations. Flour type, leavening acid type and one process variable, namely mixing time, were varied. Two flour types (standard and pregelatinized flour) and three leavening acids with fast to slow action (Monocalcium Phosphate, Sodium <b>Acid</b> <b>Pyrophosphate</b> 28 and Sodium <b>Acid</b> <b>Pyrophosphate</b> 10) were used. Three responses were measured in this experiment: rheological properties of the batter, cake volume and cake texture. The flow and viscoelastic properties were obtained using rotational and oscillatory tests, respectively. The linear viscoelastic region was determined by an amplitude sweep for each batter and the apparent viscosity was determined as a function of shear rate. To study the properties of the batter during baking, a temperature sweep was performed. To characterize cake texture, hardness was calculated by Texture Profile Analysis. Long mixing times resulted in a decrease of both apparent viscosity and cake volume. In general, viscosity was positively correlated to cake volume. However, the replacement of standard flour with pregelatinized flour caused an increase of viscosity and a decrease of cake volume. This outcome was attributed to the larger elastic component of the viscoelastic behavior. Although large proportions of pregelatinized flour led to harder cakes, small proportions, improved the cake properties. Batter apparent viscosity decreased with large proportion of fast acting leavening acid. Moreover, the temperature sweep indicated that the batter involving a large proportion of slow acting acid set later at higher temperature during baking. Therefore, these cakes were able to rise for longer time, resulting in a higher cake volume. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Calcium dihydrogen {{phosphate}} {{is used in}} {{the food}} industry as a leavening agent, i.e., to cause baked goods to rise. Because it is acidic, when combined with an alkali ingredient, commonly sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate, it reacts to produce carbon dioxide and a salt. Outward pressure of the carbon dioxide gas causes the rising effect. When combined in a ready-made baking powder, the acid and alkali ingredients are included in the right proportions such that they will exactly neutralize each other and not significantly affect the overall pH of the product. AMCP and MCP are fast acting, releasing most carbon dioxide within minutes of mixing. It is popularly used in pancake mixes. In double acting baking powders, MCP is often combined with the slow acting <b>acid</b> sodium <b>acid</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (SAPP).|$|R
