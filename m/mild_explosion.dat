Although there have been recently some claims that the delayed detonation mechanism lacks a physical background, there are still unexplored mechanisms by which the transition from deflagration to detonation could occur (see García-Senz & Bravo, this volume).

40|$|Industrially chipped {{wood chips}} of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were {{subjected}} to mild steam explosion (115 - 160 degrees C) in a small-scale steam explosion reactor. This was followed by kraft cooking or extraction in alkali at 130 degrees C for two hours, or by an enzymatic treatment with a culture filtrate in order to investigate {{the efficiency of the}} process in opening wood structure. The results demonstrated that <b>mild</b> <b>explosion</b> has an effect on opening wood structure, shown by increased release of glucomannans during alkaline extraction and faster delignification in kraft cooks for steam-exploded samples. The effect was also shown by analysis of the released reducing sugars of enzymatic treated wood chips, which showed that the wood structure became accessible for enzymes even at very modest mild steam explosion conditions. This was not observed in untreated wood chips, used as reference. The enzyme activity increased with increased temperature during mild steam explosion, and the effect {{did not seem to be}} linear. The mechanical effect of steam explosion seems to be of great importance at lower temperatures, and both chemical and mechanical effects are important at higher steam explosion temperatures.

50|$|Rootless cones, {{also called}} pseudocraters, are {{volcanic}} cones {{that are not}} directly associated with a conduit that brought magma to the surface from a deep-seated magma reservoir.

A new method to study the dynamics of Strombolian eruptions is proposed here, based on the acquisition and elaboration of high-speed videos at Stromboli Volcano. The analysis of high-speed videos of Strombolian explosions reveals previously unreported processes, including pre- and post- explosion crater floor deformation and multiple jet pulses within a single explosion, different explosive styles at individual vents, deformation and fragmentation of in-flight scoria clasts. Video frame elaboration allows us to measure the mass flux, velocity and exit angle of ejecta. In addition, particle velocity trends, in the light of shock tube fragmentation/ejection experiments, may provide information on the source depth of single explosion pulses. These results should be useful for future researches and may help describe quantitatively the dynamics and energetics of Strombolian eruptions, with implications on related hazard assessment...|$|R

40|$|Eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano {{began on}} 18 July 1995 {{after three years}} of {{elevated}} seismic activity. Four months of increasingly vigorous phreatic activity culminated in mid-November 1995 with the initiation of dome growth. Growth rates increased unevenly through early March 1996, with fluctuations on time-scales from hours to months. Since March 1996, gravitational collapse of the unstable dome flank has affected an ever-increasing area with pyroclastic flows, surges and ashfalls. Major collapse of the eastern flank on 17 September 1996 resulted in a sub-Plinian explosive eruption later that day. By February 1997, the dome had outgrown the confines of the crater and begun to spill into the surrounding valleys. A large collapse on 25 June 1997 caused pyroclastic flows and surges on the northern flanks and resulted in the only deaths of the eruption. In August, September and October 1997, vulcanian explosions followed further collapses on the western and northern flanks. The largest event of the eruption occurred on 26 December 1997 with failure of the southwestern flank of the volcano producing a debris avalanche and large dome-collapse pyroclastic flows. Dome growth ceased in early March 1998, but residual volcanic activity has continued and consists of ash venting, <b>mild</b> <b>explosions</b> and dome-collapse pyroclastic flows...|$|R
40|$|The {{nuclear energy}} supply {{of a typical}} star like the Sun would be ~ 1052 erg if all the {{hydrogen}} could be incinerated into iron peak elements. Since the gravitational binding energy is ~ 1049 erg, {{it is evident that}} the nuclear energy content is more than enough to blow up the Sun. However, stars are stable thanks to the fact that their matter obeys the equation of state of a classical ideal gas that acts as a thermostat: if some energy is released as a consequence of a thermal fluctuation, the gas expands, the temperature drops and the instability is quenched. The first researchers to discuss the scenario under which stars could explosively release their nuclear energy were Hoyle and Fowler (1960). They showed that this could occur under conditions of dynamic compression, as a consequence of collapse, or under electron degeneracy. They also pointed out in their seminal paper that hydrogen could only be responsible for <b>mild</b> <b>explosions,</b> like novae, {{as a consequence of the}} necessity to convert two protons into two neutrons, and that only the thermonuclear fusion of carbon could be energetic enough to feed a strong explosion.

40|$|Pseudocraters are rootless vents {{formed by}} the {{interaction}} of lava flows with surface or near-surface water. This interaction can produce <b>mild</b> <b>explosions</b> and the accumulation of scoria and spatter into small constructs. Pseudocraters in several localities in Iceland were examined {{in the field and}} compared to similar appearing features observed on Mars. The Icelandic pseudocrater cones in this study range in size from 6 to 70 m in diameter, have summit craters which range from 2 to 28 m in diameter (many cones lack craters entirely), and have flanks that am either concave- up or convex-up. The size and spacing of Icelandic pseudo-craters might be a function of the availability of water, in which larger, closely spaced features result from efficient lava-water interaction, as suggested by the environments in which the features formed. Possible Martian pseudocrater cones in Amamnis Planitia range in diameter from 30 to 180 m and have craters 12 to 80 m in diameter. A numerical model for volcanic explosions was adapted to study the formation of pseudocraters under terrestrial and Martian conditions. The results suggest that explosions forming Martian cones require significantly less water (calculated masses am less by a factor of 4 to 16) than those forming Icelandic pseudokers, despite their larger sizes, This is attributed to the low gravity and atmospheric pressure in the Mars environment and is consistent with the likely lower abundance of water, which might be present as interstitial ice at shallow depths in the regolith.

40|$|The use of {{stationary}} remote cameras {{for visual}} {{monitoring of the}} eruptive activity was implemented in the monitoring system of Etna and Stromboli volcanoes since 1993 and 1994 respectively. Camera records of eruptive activity became the major information source for describing eruptive phenomena occurred at Etna and Stromboli in the last years. However, the main goal of the continuous visual monitoring of active basaltic volcanoes is to analyze eruptive activity images in search of precursors of the paroxysmal events that suddenly interrupt the persistent mild strombolian activity. Stromboli represent the perfect test site for this investigation because its typical activity consists of intermittent <b>mild</b> <b>explosions</b> lasting a few seconds, which take place at different vents and at variable intervals. However, the routine activity can be interrupted by more violent, paroxysmal explosions, that eject m-sized scoriaceous bombs and lava blocks to a distance of several hundreds of meters from the craters, endangering the numerous tourists that watch the spectacular activity from the volcano's summit located about two hundreds meters from the active vents.

In this comparative study, the emphasis was placed on local composition of the pre-treated wood chips (of industrially relevant size). The results show that short hot water extraction treatments lead to significant variations in the local composition within the wood chips, while steam explosion accomplishes a comparably more even removal of hemicelluloses due to the advective mass transport during the explosion step...|$|R

The properties of the unbleached and bleached pulps, including kappa number, pulp yield, fibre length, intrinsic viscosity, chemical composition and ISO brightness, were analysed using standard methods. The findings showed a difference between treatment at four and seven bars, as the higher pressure leads to more significant visual changes as well as somewhat increased degradation of hemicelluloses. These changes however, have no apparent significant negative effect on the final pulp properties. To the contrary, a benefit of steam treatment seems that the time to reach a certain kappa number was slightly reduced with steam-exploded wood chips...|$|R

New petrologic studies on such ultramafic xenoliths {{show that they are}} mostly wherlites (subordinately lherzolites), with slightly protogranular to porphyroclastic texture. Thermo-barometric estimates on the mineralogical assemblage indicate that ultramafic xenoliths equilibrated at depth well below the crust-mantle transition of Stromboli. While Ar isotopes are dominated by a clear atmospheric signature in all the samples, 3 He/ 4 He from LP pumices and S. Bartolo ultramafic xenoliths converge to a value of 4. 2 - 4. 7 Ra, with relatively high gas content. Conversely, the low gas content of the HP scorias allowed us to measure chemical concentrations but not their 3 He/ 4 He ratio. Inferences found out from gas content are therefore in full agreement with previous knowledge about differences in volatile content between HP and LP magmas. The 3 He/ 4 He measured values are much lower than those of most primitive mantle terms of the Sicilian volcanism (7 ± 0. 6 Ra [3]), due to contamination at mantle level beneath Stromboli, operated by the Ionian subducting slab. On the basis of the measured 3 He/ 4 He in the LP pumices and ultramafic xenoliths, helium in thermal waters from the Stromboli basal aquifer is a mixing of a mantle-derived and an atmospheric term. The 3 He/ 4 He values measured in the rocks constitute the upper limit that should be expected in thermal fluids in case of effusions and/or paroxysms. References.

On average, 1 - 2 paroxysmal explosions occurred per year over the past century, but this statistic may be underestimated in absence of continuous monitoring. For this reason from summer 1996 a remote surveillance camera works on Stromboli recording continuously the volcanic activity. It is located on Pizzo Sopra la Fossa, 100 metres above the crater terrace where are the active vents. Using image analysis we seeks to identify any change of the explosive activity trend that could precede a particular eruptive event, like paroxysmal explosions, fire fountains, lava flows. From {{the day of the}} camera installation up to present 12 paroxysmal events and lava flows occurred. The analysis include the counting of the explosions occurred at the different craters and the parameterization in classes of intensity for each explosion on the base of tephra dispersion and kinetics energy. The plot of dissipated energy by each crater versus time shows a cyclic behavior with max and min of explosive activity ranging from a few days to a month. Often the craters show opposite trends so when the activity decreases in a crater, increases in the other. Before every paroxysmal explosions recorded, the crater that produced the event decreased and then stopped its activity from a few days to weeks before. The other crater tried to compensate increasing its activity and when it declined the paroxysmal explosion occurred suddenly at the former site.

40|$|The {{most common}} wood species in Sweden, {{and one of}} the most {{important}} renewable raw materials in Northern Europe, is Norway spruce (Picea abies). Today, it is utilized mainly for sawed timber and the production of pulp and paper. A modern kraft pulp mill that produces bleached pulp has a material efficiency of about 40 - 45 %, and the final product contains mainly cellulose. The other components of the wood, e. g. hemicelluloses and lignin, are heavily degraded during the process and end up in the mill’s recovery boiler, where they are burned to recover the latent energy. The biorefinery concept is an approach where biomass is used for the production of a variety of products, e. g. new materials, chemicals and fuels. The aim of this work is to investigate a process called “mild steam explosion” as a pre-treatment step in a biorefinery. During steam explosion, saturated steam is applied to biomass at elevated pressure, which is followed by a fast pressure release. The treatment leads to both mechanical rupture and chemical reactions, such as acid hydrolysis. The conditions of the steam explosion treatment are kept mild (approx. 140 - 170 °C) to ensure that the degradation of the wood components is kept at a minimum. The idea behind the treatment is to make the structure of wood more accessible and facilitate the extraction and isolation of the wood components, preferably those of high molecular weights. The most abundant hemicellulose component in spruce is (galacto) glucomannan and is of primary concern. This is a challenge since it is also the component that is the most sensitive to chemicals. Treatment with reducing agents, such as sodium borohydride and dithionite, are therefore used to stabilize the (galacto) glucomannan. The findings in this thesis showed that steam explosion, even at modest conditions, made the wood structure accessible for enzymatic reactions. It was also shown that wood components from hemicelluloses and wood extractives were released into the condensed steam. <b>Mild</b> steam <b>explosion</b> was also seen to increase the rates of both extraction and delignification during subsequent treatments. The mechanical effects of the steam explosion treatment originated from steam heating, expansion during pressure release and impact.

40|$|We {{describe}} the mineralogy, geochemistry, and mesomicrostructure of fresh subvolcanic blocks erupted during the 5 April 2003 paroxysm of Stromboli (Aeolian Islands, Italy). These blocks represent ∼ 50 vol. % {{of the total}} erupted ejecta and consist of fine- to medium-grained basaltic lithotypes ranging from relatively homogeneous dolerites to strongly or poorly welded magmatic breccias. The breccia components are represented by angular fragments of dolerites entrapped in a matrix of vesiculated (lava-like to scoriae) crystal-rich (CR) basalt. All of the studied blocks are cognates with the CR basalt of the normal Strombolian activity or lavas and they are often coated by a few-centimeter thick layer of crystal-poor (CP) basaltic pumice erupted during the paroxysm. We suggest that they result from the rapid increase of pressure and related subvolcanic rock failure that occurred shortly before the 5 April 2003 explosion, when the uppermost portion of the edifice inflated and suffered brecciation {{as the result of}} the sudden rise of the gas-rich CP basalt that triggered the eruption. Dolerites and magmatic matrix of the breccias show major and trace element compositions that match those of the CR basalts erupted during normal Strombolian activity and effusive events at Stromboli volcano. Dolerites consist of (a) phenocrysts normally found in the CR basalts and (b) late-stage magmatic minerals such as sanidine, An 60 - 28 plagioclase, Fe–Mn-rich olivines (Fo 68 - 48), phlogopite, apatite, and opaque mineral pairs (magnetite and ilmenite), most of which are never found both in lava flows and scoriae erupted during the persistent explosive activity that characterizes typical Strombolian behavior. Subvolcanic crystallization of the Stromboli CR magma, leading to slowly cooled equivalents of basalts, could result from transient drainage of the magma from the summit craters to lower levels. Fingering and engulfing of the material that collapsed from the summit crater floor into the shallow basaltic system during the late evening of 28 December 2002 coupled with the short break in the summit persistent explosions between December 2002 and March 2003 permitted the CR magma pockets to solidify as dolerites, which were confined to the uppermost portion of the system and thus not involved in the ongoing flank effusive activity. Crystal size distribution of the basaltic blocks and crystallization of the finer-grained (< 0. 1 mm) mafic minerals of the dolerites over a time interval of ∼ 100 days closely agrees with the above interpretation. Vesicle filling (miarolitic cavities) locally found in some dolerites, with minerals deposited as vapor-phase crystallization is a result of continuous gas percolation through the rocks of the uppermost portion of the volcanic system. Poorly welded magmatic breccias formed during syn-eruptive processes of 5 April 2003, when the paroxysm strongly shattered the shallow subvolcanic system and many dolerite fragments were entrapped in the CR magma. In contrast, the high degree of welding between the dolerite clasts and the CR basaltic matrix in the strongly welded magmatic breccias provides a snapshot of subvolcanic intrusions of the CR basalt into the dolerite when, after a 2 -month break in activity, CR magmas started to rise again to the summit craters. Blocks similar to these subvolcanic ejecta of 5 April 2003 were also erupted during previous paroxysms (e. g., 1930) suggesting that changes in the usual Strombolian activity (e. g., short breaks in the persistent <b>mild</b> <b>explosions</b> and/or flank effusive activity) lead to transient crystallization of dolerites in the shallow plumbing system...|$|R

The hydrodynamics and the nucleosynthesis in these accretion disks has been studied extensively in the past. Several heavy elements are synthesized in the disk and much of these heavy elements are ejected from the disk via winds and outflows. We study nucleosynthesis in the outflows launched from these disks by using an adiabatic, spherically expanding outflow model, to understand which of these elements thus synthesized in the disk survive in the outflow. While studying this we find that many new elements like isotopes of titanium, copper, zinc etc. {{are present in the}} outflows. 56 Ni is abundantly synthesized in most of the cases in the outflow which implies that the outflows from these disks in a majority of cases will lead to an observable supernova explosion. It is mainly present when outflow is considered from the He-rich, 56 Ni/ 54 Fe rich zones of the disks. However, outflow from the Si-rich zone of the disk remains rich in silicon. Although, emission lines of many of these heavy elements have been observed in the X-ray afterglows of several GRBs by Chandra, BeppoSAX, XMM-Newton etc., Swift seems to have not detected these lines yet.

40|$|A 56 -hour gravity sequence, {{recorded}} in the crater area of Stromboli volcano, is presented. Data were acquired {{during a period of}} "normal" strombolian activity. High-frequency gravity anomalies (up to 20 μGal; T = tens of seconds) are observed. Comparison with independent data reveals that these changes reflect the response of the gravimeter excited by seismic waves during strombolian explosions. Correlated changes in the energy distribution over time appear in the continuous wavelet transforms of gravity and RMS-tremor, but over different scales, corresponding to periods centered at about 50 and 25 min, for gravity and tremor, respectively. We infer that the rate of fresh magma supply to the shallow feeding system controls the energy distribution over time of the coupled components in gravity and RMS-tremor signals. In particular, the gravity signal (with an average amplitude of 1 - 2 μGal) could be induced by temporary accumulations, at shallow depth, of the volatiles discharged by quiescent degassing. Changes in the rate of explosions from the summit craters correlate with changes in the amplitude of the coupled gravity and volcanic tremor oscillations, implying that, even though the slug-genesis process behind the explosions occurs at deeper levels, it is also controlled by the rate of gas-rich magma supply from below. Negative gravity anomalies of about 20 μGal, over intervals of some hours, are also observed, separated by intervals of about 24 hours. They could be induced by increases in magma vescicularity in the uppermost part of the conduit plexus, a view supported by (i) changes in the time/space distribution of tremor amplitudes and (ii) increases in spattering activity from a summit vent, both occurring during the development of the negative gravity anomalies. The processes behind <b>mild</b> Strombolian <b>explosions</b> do not trigger measurable gravity changes. Nevertheless, the slug ascent before a major explosion could induce a precursory gravity signal...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} 1631 - 1944, Vesuvius was in {{persistent}} activity with alternating <b>mild</b> strombolian <b>explosions,</b> quiet effusive eruptions, and violent strombolian eruptions. The {{major difference between}} the predominant style of activity and the violent strombolian stages is the effusion rate. The lava effusion rate during major eruptions was in the range 20 - 100 m(3) /s, higher than during mild activity and quiet effusion (0. 1 - 1 m(3) /S). The products erupted during the mild activity and major paroxysms have different degree of crystallization. Highly porphyritic lava flows are slowly erupted during years-long period of mild activity. This activity is fed by a magma accumulating at shallow depth within the volcanic edifice. Conversely, during the major paroxysms, a fast lava flow precedes the eruption of a volatile-rich, crystal-poor magma. We show that the more energetic eruptions are fed by episodic, multiple arrival of discrete batches of magma rising faster and not degassing during the ascent. The rapidly ascending magma pushes up the liquid residing in the shallow reservoir and eventually reaches the surface with its full complement of volatiles, producing kilometer-high lava fountains. Rapid drainage of the shallow reservoir occasionally caused small caldera collapses. The major eruptions act to unplug {{the upper part of}} the feeding system, erupting the cooling and crystallizing magma. This pattern of activity lasted for 313 y, but with a progressive decrease in the number of more energetic eruptions. As a consequence, a cooling plug blocked the volcano until it eventually prevented the eruption of new magma. The yearly probability of having at least one violent strombolian eruption has decreased from 0. 12 to 0. 10 from 1944 to 2007, but episodic seismic crises since 1979 may be indicative of new episodic intrusions of magma batches...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} nucleosynthesis {{inside the}} gamma-ray burst (GRB) accretion disks {{formed by the}} Type II collapsars. In these collapsars, the core collapse of massive stars first leads {{to the formation of}} a proto-neutron star and a <b>mild</b> supernova <b>explosion</b> is driven. However, this supernova ejecta lack momentum and falls back onto the neutron star which gets transformed to a stellar mass black hole. In order to study the hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis of such an accretion disk formed from the fallback material of the supernova ejecta, we use the well established hydrodynamic models. In such a disk neutrino cooling becomes important in the inner disk where the temperature and density are higher. Higher the accretion rate (dotM), higher is the density and temperature in the disks. In this work we deal with accretion disks with relatively low accretion rates: 0. 001 M_sun s^- 1 ≲ dotM≲ 0. 01 M_sun s^- 1 and hence these disks are predominantly advection dominated. We use He-rich and Si-rich abundances as the initial condition of nucleosynthesis at the outer disk, and being equipped with the disk hydrodynamics and the nuclear network code, we study the abundance evolution as matter inflows and falls into the central object. We investigate the variation in the nucleosynthesis products in the disk with the change in the initial abundance at the outer disk and also with the change in the mass accretion rate. We report the synthesis of several unusual nuclei like 31 P, 39 K, 43 Sc, 35 Cl, and various isotopes of titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese and copper. We also confirm that isotopes of iron, cobalt, nickel, argon, calcium, sulphur and silicon get synthesized in the disk, as shown by previous authors. Much of these heavy elements thus synthesized are ejected from the disk via outflows and hence they should leave their signature in observed data.

40|$|Pretreatments {{are crucial}} to achieve {{efficient}} conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to soluble sugars. In this light, switchgrass was subjected to 13 pretreatments including steam explosion alone (195 °C for 5, 10 and 15 min) and after impregnation with the following catalysts: Ca(OH) 2 at low (0. 4 %) and high (0. 7 %) concentration; Ca(OH) 2 at high concentration and higher temperature (205 °C for 5, 10 and 15 min); H 2 SO 4 (0. 2 % at 195 °C for 10 min) as reference acid catalyst before steam explosion. Enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out to assess pretreatment efficiency in both solid and liquid fraction. Thereafter, in selected pretreatments the solid fraction was subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), while the liquid fraction underwent anaerobic digestion (AD). Lignin removal was lowest (12 %) and highest (35 %) with steam alone and 0. 7 % lime, respectively. In general, higher cellulose degradation and lower hemicellulose hydrolysis were observed in this study compared to others, depending on lower biomass hydration during steam <b>explosion.</b> <b>Mild</b> lime addition (0. 4 % at 195 °C) enhanced ethanol in SSF (+ 28 % than steam alone), while H 2 SO 4 boosted methane in AD (+ 110 %). However, methane represented a lesser component in combined energy yield (ethanol, methane and energy content of residual solid). Mild lime addition was also shown less aggressive and secured more residual solid after SSF, resulting in higher energy yield per unit raw biomass. Decreased water consumption, avoidance of toxic compounds in downstream effluents, and post process recovery of Ca(OH) 2 as CaCO 3 represent further advantages of pretreatments involving mild lime addition before steam explosion...|$|R
40|$|The {{three main}} {{components}} of wood, namely, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, {{can be used in}} various areas. However, since lignin covalently crosslinks with wood polysaccharides creating networks that is an obstacle for extraction, direct extraction of different wood components in high yield is not an easy matter. One potential approach to overcome such obstacles is to treat the wood with specific enzymes that degrade the networks by specific catalysis. However, the structure of wood is so compact that the penetration of the wood fibers by large enzyme molecules is hindered. Thus, the pretreatment of wood prior to the application of enzymes is necessary, for “opening” the structure. One pretreatment method that was performed in this thesis is based on kraft pulping, which is a well-established and industrialized technique. For untreated wood, the wood fibers cannot be attacked by the enzymes. A relatively mild pretreatment was sufficient for wood polysaccharides hydrolyzed by a culture filtrate. A methanol-alkali mixture extraction was subsequently applied to the samples that were pretreated with two types of hemicellulases, Gamanase and Pulpzyme HC, respectively. The extraction yield increased after enzymatic treatment, and the polymers that were extracted from monocomponent enzyme-treated wood had a higher degree of polymerization. Experiments with in vitro prepared lignin polysaccharide networks suggested that the increased extraction was due to the enzymatic untying. However, the relatively large loss of hemicellulose, particularly including (galacto) glucomannan (GGM), represents a problem with this technique. To improve the carbohydrate yield, sodium borohydride (NaBH 4), polysulfide and anthraquinone were used, which increased the yields from 76. 6 % to 89. 6 %, 81. 3 % and 80. 0 %, respectively, after extended impregnation (EI). The additives also increased the extraction yield from approximately 9 to 12 % w/w wood. Gamanase treatment prior to the extraction increased the extraction yield to 14 % w/w wood. Sodium dithionite (Na 2 S 2 O 4) is an alternative reducing agent for the preservation of hemicelluloses because it is less expensive than metal hydrides and only contains sodium and sulfur, which will not introduce new elements to the recovery system. Moreover, Na 2 S 2 O 4 {{has the potential to be}} generated from black liquor. Na 2 S 2 O 4 has some preservation effect on hemicelluloses, and the presence of Na 2 S 2 O 4 also contributed to delignification. The extraction yield increased to approximately 15 % w/w wood. Furthermore, Na 2 S 2 O 4 has been applied in the kraft pulping process of spruce. The yield and viscosity increased, while the Klason lignin content and kappa number decreased, which represents a beneficial characteristic for kraft pulp. The brightness and tensile strength of the resulting sheets also improved. However, the direct addition of Na 2 S 2 O 4 to white liquor led to greater reject content. This problem was solved by pre-impregnation with Na 2 S 2 O 4 and/or <b>mild</b> steam <b>explosion</b> (STEX) prior to the kraft pulping process. Following Na 2 S 2 O 4 pre-impregnation and mild STEX, the obtained kraft pulp had substantially better properties compared with the properties exhibited after direct addition of Na 2 S 2 O 4 to the white liquor. The wood structure opening efficiency of mild STEX alone was also tested. The accessibility of the wood structure to enzymes was obtained even at very modest STEX conditions, according to a reducing sugar analysis, and was not observed in untreated wood chips, which were used as a reference. The mechanical effect of STEX appears to be of great importance at lower temperatures, and both chemical and mechanical effects occur at higher STEX temperatures.   QC 20140903 </p...|$|R
