25|$|For a sweet wine, {{fermentation}} {{is stopped}} before its end {{to keep some}} of the sugar: this is the <b>Mutage</b> (fortification). The fermentation can be stopped by adding Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) (sterilisation of wine), by sudden cooling (anaesthesia of yeasts), by sterile filtration (capturing the yeasts in a very fine mesh filter), {{or a combination of}} several of these methods. A rule of thumb for determining the point of <b>mutage,</b> which allows a good balance of acquired alcohol and residual sugar, is to leave as many potential degrees as the degrees acquired over 10% by volume. For sweeter dessert wines fermentation stops spontaneously by excess sugar and alcohol: Alcohol is waste from the yeast and it is poisonous in large doses. In the case of sweet wines an addition of wine alcohol stops the fermentation. FML is not done for sweet wines as the lactic bacteria preferentially degrades sugar which would give a lactic bite (sweet and sour wine). In addition, the balance of acidity and sugar in the wine supports vivacity.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the many}} types of white wine, dry white wine is the most common. More or less {{aromatic}} and tangy, it {{is derived from the}} complete fermentation of the wort.

The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, passerillage (straining), or the use of Noble rot. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are wines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the bottle is opened.|$|E
25|$|While the Portuguese wine Port is {{similarly}} {{made with a}} <b>mutage</b> halting the fermentation, there are some distinct differences in how vin doux naturels like Maurys are made. For one, the fortifying spirits used in Port are of a lower alcohol strength (traditionally 77%) while those used for vin doux naturels are often 95%. The spirits are then added to the VdNs later in the fermentation process than with Port. More of the fortifying spirits are often used in Port production, representing up to a fifth (20%) of the finished volume of wine compared to the spirits accounting for around 15% of the finished volume of the VdNs. This means that most VdNs contain less water and alcohol than the typical Port wine.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} process, {{known in}} France as <b>mutage,</b> {{is similar to}} that used to make Port. Alcohol is added to the must to halt fermentation while sugar levels are still high, preserving the natural sweetness of the grape. The wines are then matured in oak barrels, or outside in glass bottles exposed to the sun, allowing the wine to maderise. The maturation period is a minimum of ten months for Banyuls AOC. The resulting wine bears a similarity to port but tends to be lower in alcohol (~16% vs. ~20%).|$|E

It belongs to family Bracicaceae and being used as genetic resource to improve the other species of Brassica. The seedlings- 3 - 3 developed from treated seeds with sodium azide at concentration ranged (1 x 10 to 5 x 10 M) showed wide variation in plant growth (plant height, leaf area, fresh and dry weight) upto 60 days after sowing. Among various concentrations of sodium azide, 3 mM concentration was found highly effective in all morphometric and yield traits after 60 days of sowing as compared to untreated plants. Total chlorophyll content was decreased as compared to control plants and low content of chlorophyll was found in those plants which developed from treated seeds at 5 mM concentration of sodium azide.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple scheme has been {{developed}} for the isolation and purification {{of two of the}} major mutagenic heterocyclic amines formed in heated beef products by affinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies which recognize 2 -amino- 3 -methylimidazo(4, 5 -f]quinoline (IQ). Two cell lines producing IgG antibodies were established following fusion of Sp 2 or P 3 x. 63 myeloma cells with spleen cells of immunized BALB/cby mice. The antigen was bovine gamma globulin haptenized with 2 -(3 -carboxypropylthio) - 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoline. The antibodies were immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B. IQ and MeIQx formed in heated beef products were partially purified by XAD- 2 chromatography and then applied to the affinity columns. Purification by affinity chromatography was adequate for subsequent quantitative analysis by HPLC with UV detection. With this purification scheme as little as 1 g of beef extract or 15 g of fried beef could be assayed for IQ and MeIQx at the part per billion level. Both antibodies had similar affinity constants for IQ (9. 3 × 106 and 6. 7 × 106 M− 1) and for MeIQx (7. 1 × 105 and 2. 7 × 105 M− 1) and both were suitable for immunoaffinity purification of IQ from complex mixtures. MAb 2 could be used as well to selectively remove MeIQx from meat products after partial purification by XAD- 2. MAb 1, despite having a 3 -fold higher affinity than MAb 2 for MeIQx, could not be used for affinity chromatography for this <b>mutage...</b>|$|E
