5|$|In Iași, {{the walls}} of princely courts fell, and <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> and monastery towers collapsed. In Suceava, the Armenian Church steeple cracked, while in Pașcani, cracks {{appeared}} in {{the walls of}} St. Archangels Church. Other religious buildings damaged during the earthquake include the Princely Church of the Assumption in Bârlad and Cașin Monastery in Bacău.|$|E
5|$|Outwardly, the {{destruction}} and removals for sale {{had changed the}} church forever. <b>Many</b> <b>churches</b> had concealed their vestments and their silver, and had buried their stone altars. There were many disputes {{between the government and}} parishes over church property. Thus, when Edward died in July 1553 and the Duke of Northumberland attempted to have the Protestant Lady Jane Grey made Queen, the unpopularity of the confiscations gave Mary the opportunity to have herself proclaimed Queen, first in Suffolk, and then in London to the acclamation of the crowds.|$|E
5|$|Rural Deans, or deans of Christianity as {{they were}} known in the Scottish Church, {{supervised}} the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop's edicts. There were four deaneries in the Moray diocese—Elgin, Inverness, Strathspey and Strathbogie—and these provided the income {{not only for the}} cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses within and outside the diocese. <b>Many</b> <b>churches</b> were allocated to support designated canons, and a small number were held in common. The bishop received mensal and prebendary income in his separate positions as prelate and canon.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Stainer (6 June 1840– 31 March 1901) was an English {{composer}} and organist whose music, though not generally much performed today (except for The Crucifixion, still heard at Passiontide in <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> of the Anglican Communion), was very popular during his lifetime. His work as choir trainer and organist set standards for Anglican church music {{that are still}} influential. He was also active as an academic, becoming Heather Professor of Music at Oxford.|$|E
5|$|St Dunstan's—the charity that {{provides}} support, rehabilitation, and respite care to blind ex-service personnel of the British Armed Forces—is named after him, as are <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> {{all over the}} world. St Dunstan's, Mayfield, St Dunstan's, Stepney, St Dunstan-in-the-East, London, and St Dunstan-in-the-West, London are four of the more well known in Britain. The church at the junction of London Road and Whitstable Road gives {{its name to the}} neighbourhood of Canterbury on the north bank of the River Stour.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks on}} the Southern Pictish Zone at Dunnottar and Dundurn {{represented}} {{a major threat to}} Ecgfrith's suzerainty. Ecgfrith was contending with other challenges to his overlordship. In June 684, countering a Gaelic-Briton alliance, he sent his armies, led by Berhtred, son of Beornhæth, to Brega in Ireland. Ecgfrith's force decimated the local population and destroyed <b>many</b> <b>churches,</b> actions which are treated with scorn by Bede.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Bricius's {{chapter of}} eight clerics {{consisted}} of the dean, precentor, treasurer, chancellor, archdeacon and three ordinary canons. His successor, Bishop Andreas de Moravia, greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much-enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts (succentor and subdean) and added 16 more prebendaries. In total, 23 prebendaries had been created {{by the time of}} Andreas' death, and a further two were added just before the Scottish Reformation. Prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage. In the case of Elgin Cathedral, the de Moravia family, of which Bishop Andreas was a member, is noted as having the patronage of <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> given as prebends.|$|E
5|$|Black {{churches in}} Maryland hosted many musical, {{as well as}} {{political}} and educational, activities, and many African American musicians got their start performing in churches, including Anne Brown, Marian Anderson, Ethel Ennis and Cab Calloway, in the 20th century. Doctrinal disputes did not prevent musical cooperation, which included both sacred and secular music. Church choirs frequently worked together, even across denominational divides, and church-goers often visited other establishments to see visiting performers. Organists were a major part of African American church music in Baltimore, and some organists became well known, Baltimore's including Sherman Smith of Union Baptist, Luther Mitchell of Centennial Methodist and Julia Calloway of Sharon Baptist. <b>Many</b> <b>churches</b> also offered music education, beginning as early as the 1870s with St. Francis Academy.|$|E

5|$|Early church {{buildings}} may originally {{have been}} wooden, like that excavated at Whithorn, but of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry-built churches, beginning {{on the west}} coast and islands and spreading south and east. Early chapels tended to have square ended converging walls, similar to Irish chapels of this period. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>churches</b> in {{the city}} (including the Church of the Resurrection or Holy Sepulchre) were burned, and {{numerous}} relics, including the True Cross, the Holy Lance, and the Holy Sponge, were carried off to the Persian capital Ctesiphon. The loss of these relics was thought by many Christian Byzantines to be a clear mark of divine displeasure. Some blamed the Jews for this misfortune and {{for the loss of}} Syria in general. There were reports that Jews helped the Persians capture certain cities and that the Jews tried to slaughter Christians in cities that the Persians had already conquered but were found and foiled from doing so. These reports are likely to be greatly exaggerated and the result of general hysteria.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland from {{the sixth century}} led {{to the construction of}} basic masonry-built churches, beginning on the west coast and islands. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings. However, from the eighth century, more sophisticated buildings emerged. Early Romanesque ashlar masonry produced block-built stone buildings, like the eleventh century round tower at Brechin Cathedral and the square towers of Dunblane Cathedral and The Church of St Rule.|$|E

5|$|The {{legend of}} Bishop Henry's life, or his Vita, was written {{at the end}} of the 13th century. It {{contains}} little concrete information about Henry. He is said to have been an English-born bishop in Uppsala at the time of King Eric the Saint of Sweden in the mid-12th century, ruling the peaceful kingdom with the king in heavenly co-existence. To tackle the perceived threat from the non-Christian Finns, Eric and Henry were forced to battle them. After they had conquered Finland, baptized the people and built <b>many</b> <b>churches,</b> the victorious king returned to Sweden while Henry (Henricus) remained with the Finns, more willing to live the life of a preacher than that of a high bishop.|$|E
5|$|Following the Black Death, the {{invasion}} of Gotland by Valdemar IV of Denmark and the Battle of Visby in 1361, and a general decrease in trade, Gotland entered a period of decline. From about 1361, building activity therefore dropped. The inauguration of Sankta Karin in 1412 {{marks the end of}} church building activity in Visby. When troops from Lübeck pillaged the city in 1525, and probably damaged several of the churches, the social and economic rationale for sustaining them had vanished. With the advent of the Reformation soon afterwards, the religious rationale to sustain the upkeep of the <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> also permanently disappeared. All monasteries were abolished and all churches within the city walls except one (present-day Visby Cathedral) were abandoned and left to decay. During the following centuries, some church ruins were used as quarries. In 1805 the church ruins were protected by law and in 1863 the Swedish state for the first time allocated money for their conservation.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle-Atlantic states, {{it caused}} little injury overall, though many boats and ships were capsized. To {{the north in}} New England, <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> endured {{significant}} damage, and shipwrecks led to 15deaths, with one other death owing to a building collapse. Due to intense gusts, hundreds of trees were uprooted and many buildings were unroofed. Agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock industries also suffered substantial impairment, with considerable injury experienced by barns, crops, watercraft, timber, and livestock. Farther north, entire swaths of forest were leveled, and heavy snow blocked roads, paths, and turnpikes. Fruit orchards and sugar groves endured {{the worst of the}} storm, reducing the season's harvests. Private properties generally suffered damage to roofs, windows, and chimneys; several buildings throughout the region were reported to have collapsed. Overall, approximately $100,000 in damage and more than 16deaths were recorded.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolsheviks, and Russia became part of the new Soviet Union. As the promotion of state atheism was a part of Marxist–Leninist ideology, the Soviet government ordered <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> closed. The Peter and Paul parish was formally dissolved by the communist government in 1929, and celebrating Mass was forbidden. The church lost much of its surrounding gardens in 1935—a school was built there the following year—and the church was finally closed on 30 July 1938 (the St. Peter and Paul church had met the same fate nine days earlier). The church was plundered after its closure, and many items, including the main altar and the organ, were irretrievably lost. The church was used for several months as a vegetable store, and was then reconstructed as a hostel and its interior divided into four floors.|$|E
5|$|Koniecpolski {{inherited}} some {{seven or}} eight villages from his father. At his death, he owned 12 starostwo districts, with over 300 settlements, including dozens of towns, giving him yearly revenues of over 500,000 złoty. His holdings of land and serfs in western Ukraine were considerable; he owned 18,548 households in Bratslav. Koniecpolski invested much of his wealth in developing his Ukrainian estates, and supported settlement of underpopulated regions. He founded and sponsored the development of many towns and cities, including the town of Brody, which flourished with his investments, and became an important local commercial center. Koniecpolski fortified the town with a citadel and bastions in 1633 and set up workshops for producing Persian-type samite fabrics, carpets and rugs. He also constructed a fortified palace in Pidhirtsi (Podhorce) with beautiful Italian gardens. Like most magnates, Koniecpolski was a patron of the arts, sponsoring painters, sculptors, writers. He also founded <b>many</b> <b>churches</b> and sought to upgrade Brody's school to an academy. He sponsored {{the construction of the}} Koniecpolski Palace (now the Presidential Palace) in Warsaw, and military fortifications in Bar and Kudak.|$|E
