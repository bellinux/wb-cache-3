50|$|Waterside Mill {{began as}} two {{independent}} manufactories. The earliest factory was a weaving shed erected by Thomas Mellor and Sons in 1857, at Sharp's Shrubberies in Whitelands, {{they already had}} a combined mill on Gas Street {{which could not be}} expanded. The Whitelands mill was a four storey building built by George Harry Mellor, and leased to the Waterside Mill Company, who were registered with a capital of £20,000. It was equipped with 34,256 mule spindles. By 1896 both buildings were being operated by Thomas Mellor and Sons, and before the First World War the mills were physically joined. Waterside became a combined <b>mill,</b> <b>weaving</b> fancies from coarser cotton counts of American cottons.|$|E
50|$|The Lauba House is a {{building}} that once served as the TKZ (Zagreb Textile <b>Mill)</b> <b>weaving</b> mill, which now has {{the status of a}} protected cultural monument. Around it were factory halls, historically significant for the national textile industry, which had been manufacturing top quality damask ever since 1923. The hall was initially built as a riding arena within the Austro-Hungarian Cavalry Barracks. Emil Eisner and Adolf Ehrlich, the leading construction company in Zagreb, designed it in 1910. The barracks were situated on more than 20 000 square meters of land, including {{a building}} for the brigadier officer school team, a smithy, horse stalls and the riding arena. Lauba House has become the first example of a successful cultural heritage reconstruction {{in the western part of}} Zagreb.|$|E

40|$|Restricted {{possibilities}} for flexible working {{are among the}} basic problems in order-oriented textile <b>weaving</b> <b>mills.</b> In order to increase production and get orders ready on time, <b>weaving</b> <b>mills</b> generally focus on the speed and performance of the machines. However, the basic problem lies in a lack of organisation which definitively causes bottlenecks. In this study, a <b>weaving</b> <b>mill</b> which produces fabric based upon orders has been chosen as a subject, and this firm’s current system has been simulated. After working on the current system, the data were evaluated and the bottlenecks determined. Thus, alternative systems were created instead of the current system, and these alternative systems were compared with this current system. Further, thanks to the improved simulation program, the ordered product’s delivery date can be easily estimated. In this way, we aim to give ideas about optimising organisation and estimating the delivery dates of the orders for the <b>weaving</b> <b>mills</b> {{with this kind of}} job process. Key words: <b>weaving</b> <b>mills,</b> order-oriented textile <b>weaving</b> <b>mills,</b> organisation, bottlenecks, simulation technique...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact on}} the environment of textile products, highlighting that their pollution is primarily exerted on air and water. Textile industry affects the environment through the consumption of water, energy and chemicals, {{as a result of the}} existence of a great number of processes through which fibers are passing until they are transformed into finished products, and the large amount of waste they generate. They may be recoverable (resulting from the spinning phases, yarn waste from spinning <b>mills,</b> <b>weaving</b> <b>mills,</b> knitting, <b>weaving</b> heads and strips from <b>weaving</b> <b>mills</b> and cutting section, patches from the cutting stages etc.) returned to the manufacturing process they can be used to obtain vicuna yarns, non-woven textile fabrics, cotton upholstery for furniture and cars, insulating materials, geotextiles, etc. or irrecoverable – which are incinerated or discarded in landfills - polluting both air and ground. Waste generation involves a loss of materials and energy and imposes high environmental and economic costs to society - of collection, treatment and processing. Therefore we believe that the desire of "zero waste" is currently one of the strategic directions for sustainable development of a society based on knowledge. Suggested solutions to reduce pollution exercised by textiles products various measures were proposed, such as: sound management of waste, recycling and the increase of "green" products in the all textile products...|$|R

A good example is how Rover and Rolls-Royce moved into Barnoldswick to produce and later design aero engines. When weaving was re-established in the early 1950s, expectations and attitudes had changed, and the thousand loom sheds such as Queen Street Mill were laid out in eight and ten loom sets and the weavers were on minimum wage contracts.
