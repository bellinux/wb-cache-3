5|$|Because {{the basic}} fruit body {{structure}} in all genera of the Nidulariaceae family is essentially similar, Cyathus may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Crucibulum, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> hairy ectoperidium worn off. It distinguished from Nidula {{by the presence}} of a funiculus, a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.|$|E

5|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} destroy the Horcrux, the trio take turns wearing it to dilute its power. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing the wand-maker Gregorovitch, who claims that a teenage boy had once stolen the legendary Elder Wand from his shop. While Ron is wearing the locket, he is overcome by negative feelings and argues with Harry before leaving him and Hermione behind. Hermione deduces that the sword of Gryffindor can destroy Horcruxes and decides with Harry to go to Godric's Hollow. They visit Harry's parents' graves and the house where they were killed. They encounter Bathilda Bagshot, who they believe <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> sword. Bathilda lets Harry and Hermione into her house, and is revealed to actually be Nagini, controlling Bathilda's reanimated corpse from inside of her. Hermione and Harry escape into the Forest of Dean, but Hermione accidentally breaks Harry's wand whilst fighting Nagini. Hermione is then {{able to identify the}} mysterious thief seen in Harry's vision as Gellert Grindelwald.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E

25|$|The {{geophysical}} {{features of}} <b>the</b> plateau <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been <b>the</b> {{result of an}} early Miocene collision event between the Benham Rise and the eastern margin of Luzon, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also allowed <b>the</b> inception of the NW striking strand of the Philippine fault. These forces <b>may</b> <b>have</b> impacted <b>the</b> shape of the island of Luzon because of the basaltic sea floor resisting <b>the</b> subduction that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also cause <b>the</b> bending of the Philippine Fault.

5|$|Diamonds {{can also}} form under other {{naturally}} occurring high-pressure conditions. Very small diamonds of micrometer and nanometer sizes, known as microdiamonds or nanodiamonds respectively, {{have been found}} in meteorite impact craters.

Popigai crater in Russia <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> world's largest diamond deposit, estimated at trillions of carats, and formed by an asteroid impact.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} stimulation involves physical stimulation to {{the external}} anatomy of the clitoris– glans, hood and the external shaft. Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same effect as direct clitoral stimulation. Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E
5|$|Passive linear {{electronic}} analogue {{filters are}} those filters {{which can be}} described with linear differential equations (linear); they are composed of capacitors, inductors and, sometimes, resistors (passive) and are designed to operate on continuously varying (analogue) signals. There are many linear filters which are not analogue in implementation (digital filter), {{and there are many}} electronic filters which may not have a passive topology both of which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same transfer function of the filters described in this article. Analogue filters are most often used in wave filtering applications, that is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from analogue (continuous-time) signals.|$|E

5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war {{to be able to}} avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but to}} reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution further {{provides}} for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament (MPs) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people <b>may</b> <b>have.</b> <b>The</b> Government's view is that representative democracy is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system. While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation {{of the concept of}} representative democracy, it serves as a check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised within the limits established by the Constitution, such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV.|$|E
5|$|The Irish overprinted stamps came, as {{supplied}} from the printers in London, with a watermark of the Royal Cypher of George V. The first Irish watermark was a stylised {{design of the}} two overlapping letters 's' and 'e' making an 'se' watermark representing {{the name of the}} country Saorstát Éireann. This watermark was discontinued around 1940 when the country's name changed to Éire (Ireland); it was replaced with e watermark paper to represent Éire. Stamps of the period <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> watermark in any of several states of inversion and rotation attributable to the way the paper was fed into the printing machines.|$|E

5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, the predator <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of a phylogenetic approach to taxonomy suggested the Liliales formed {{some of the earliest}} monocots. Molecular analysis indicates that divergence amongst the Liliales probably occurred around 82 million years ago. The closest sister family to the Liliaceae are the Smilacaceae with the Liliaceae separating 52 million years ago. Liliaceae thus arose during the late (Maastrichtian) Cretaceous to early (Paleocene) Paleogene periods. Major evolutionary clades include the Lilieae (Lilium, Fritillaria, Nomocharis, Cardiocrinum, Notholirion) from the Himalayas about 12mya and the Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa, Gagea) from East Asia at about the same time. The Medeoleae (Clintonia and Medeola) may have appeared in North America but were subsequently dispersed, as <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae. Liliaceae fossils have been dated to the Paleogene and Cretaceous eras in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient <b>may</b> <b>have.</b> <b>The</b> problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E
