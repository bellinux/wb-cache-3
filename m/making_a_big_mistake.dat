It was written by David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, and {{directed}} by James Burrows. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in the United States on September 21, 1998.

The situation gets complicated when Grace's socialite assistant, Karen Walker, and Will's flamboyantly gay friend, Jack McFarland, interfere.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, Conkling then {{submitted}} {{a resolution that}} bound every delegate in the hall to support the party's nominee. Conkling said that [...] "no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree." [...] A voice vote was called, and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support. However, about {{a dozen or so}} delegates answered [...] "no". Conkling was shocked. He asked, [...] " [...] at a Republican convention would vote 'no' on such a resolution?" [...] He then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters. Most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the [...] "Glass Palace". Only three delegates, all from West Virginia, voted [...] "no" [...] to the resolution, and were showered with a [...] "storm of hisses." [...] Conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three West Virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention. The West Virginians revolted against Conkling's resolution, and heavily criticized him for his motion. James Garfield, who was sitting at the Ohio delegation, stood up and tried to settle the matter. He stated that the convention would be <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> if they approved Conkling's motion, and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case. Garfield argued that the three West Virginians should not [...] "be disenfranchised because they thought it was not the time to make such an expression [...]" [...] He stated that [...] "there never can be a convention...that shall bind my vote against my will on any question whatever." [...] Garfield had won the crowd over with his speech. Conkling did not particularly enjoy the situation. He scribbled a note to Garfield which read, [...] "New York requests that Ohio's real candidate and dark horse come forward...R.C." ...|$|E

500|$|On November 10, 1960 {{the second}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was convened. As Hoxha recalled, [...] "In his speech Khrushchev {{expressed}} the revisionist views completely and attacked the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, {{as well as}} those who were going to follow these parties, but without mentioning any names... wanted to keep all the communist and workers' parties of the world under his conductor's baton, under his dictate." [...] On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership, which [...] "showed that no compromise between them was possible." [...] During the meeting Hoxha noted that [...] " [...] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal. This question he addressed to our generals at the airport, in the presence of one of your generals. Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, to the Party of Labour and socialism." [...] Khrushchev replied, [...] "If our ambassador said such a thing, he was foolish." [...] Hoxha in turn replied, [...] "He was no fool. He committed this 'foolishness' following the Bucharest Meeting." [...] The subject eventually came to the Vlora naval base, which was the subject of a Soviet–Albanian dispute to become acute months later. Khrushchev threatened Hoxha, saying, [...] "We can dismantle the base if you like." [...] Hoxha replied, [...] "If you dismantle the base you will be <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake.</b> We have fought empty-bellied and bare-footed, but have never kowtowed to anybody." [...] As the meeting's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared, [...] "You flare up in anger. You spat on me; no one can talk to you." [...] The meeting ended after Kapo declared, [...] "I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this." ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Lo {{summarised}} the storyline of the EP; [...] "The song 'Love Ballad' {{is about}} the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". The EP's main genres are pop, electropop and indie pop. The Swedish edition of Truth Serum opens with [...] "Love Ballad", a pop song with drum instrumentation. It was described as a [...] "parody of love songs" [...] that talks about the [...] "carefree beginnings of a new romance". Lo also called it a [...] "way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him". In the standard edition, the EP opens with [...] "Not on Drugs", a pop, dance and electropop song in which the artist compares falling in love to being under the influence of drugs. Following the narrative of Truth Serum, it represents the happy beginning of the relationship, when Lo was [...] "really in love" [...] and [...] " [...] think straight". [...] "Paradise" [...] is a jungle and drum and bass song with electronic elements; it talks about the moment when Lo realizes that she needs and relies on her partner. The electropop song [...] "Over" [...] details the part when Lo and her boyfriend end the relationship. The singer stated that it was about [...] "me <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> and having to confess and come clean". [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is a pop and electropop track which talks about the artist's hedonistic attempts to forget her former boyfriend. [...] "Out of Mind" [...] is a pop song with minimal instrumentation. According to Lo, it represents the part when [...] "I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak. It's when you moved on and you're sort of okay, but you still have that little scar". The EP's last track is the downtempo [...] "Stay High", a remix version of [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] by record production duo Hippie Sabotage.|$|E

Well, I won't run for the place, so it'll be Homans. He's the man to captain us, that's certain. Graves thinks, though, that he can pull the wires and be elected captain. He's way off. Besides, Peg, he's <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake.</b> Worry doesn't like him, and when he finds out about this break in {{training}} we'll have a new third-baseman.

That's not against rules. Punch him! If Worry knew the truth he would pat you on the back for slugging Graves. Cheer up, Peg! Even if Graves has got all the kids on his side, which I doubt, Homans and I are with you. And you can just bet that Worry Arthurs will side with us.... Now run along, for I must study." ...|$|E
