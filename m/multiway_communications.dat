40|$|Precise {{timing and}} {{asynchronous}} I/O are appealing features for many applications. Unix kernels provide such features on a per-process basis, using signals to communicate asynchronous events to applications. Per-process signals and timers are grossly inadequate for complex multithreaded applications that require perthread signals and timers that operate at finer granularities. To {{respond to this}} need, we present a scheme that integrates asynchronous (Unix) signals with userlevel threads, using the Ariadne system as a platform. This is done with a view towards support for portable, multithreaded, and multiprotocol distributed applications viz. the CLAM (connectionless, lightweight, and <b>multiway)</b> <b>communications</b> library. In the same context, we propose the use of continuations as an efficient mechanism for reducing (thread) context-switching and busy-wait overheads in multithreaded protocols. Our proposal for integrating timers and signal-handling mechanisms not only solves problems relate [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{realization}} of multiway group communications and scaleable layer 3 switching over ATM networks requires merging of virtual connections to be possible. This capability, known as VC merging, cannot {{be provided by}} ATM networks which use a standard ATM protocol stack on both switches and stations. This paper describes AAL 5 X, an extension to the ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL 5) that allows for VC merging while keeping the typical advantages of cell-switching and without requiring any modification to ATM switches. * Submitted to Infocom 98 * Corresponding author. 1 1. Introduction The future of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) seems to be closely related to two issues. The first one is the native support for <b>multiway</b> <b>communications,</b> which will allow {{for the provision of}} an efficient service to multicast applications. The second one is IP switching (or layer 3 switching), that is the capability of switching most of the network level traffic at hardware speeds possibly using ATM switche [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} factors motivate and favor the {{implementation}} of communication protocols in user-space. There is a particularly strong motivation {{for the provision of}} scalable, multiway and connectionless transport for distributed computing, multimedia, and conferencing applications. This is also true of high speed networking, where it is beneficial to keep the OS kernel out of the critical path in communication. User-space protocol implementations may hold the key to optimal functionality and performance. We describe the Connectionless, Lightweight and <b>Multiway</b> (CLAM) <b>communications</b> system which provides efficient and scalable user-space support for distributed applications requiring multiple protocols. The system supports heterogeneous networked applications with irregular or asynchronous communication patterns and multimodal data. We focus on motivating and describing the CLAM architecture and present some experimental results that evaluate an specific protocol module inside this arch [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Connectionless, Lightweight, and <b>Multiway</b> (CLAM) <b>communications</b> {{environment}} provides {{efficient and}} scalable multi-protocol support for distributed applications using multimodal data. This paper presents motivation and design decisions behind the CLAM system, {{along with two}} simple but effective scheduling algorithms for the simultaneous support of multiple, threads-based user-space protocols. One algorithm is readily portable to shared-memory multiprocessors, and enables two or more protocols to coexist within a process's space. We present experimental results {{on the performance of}} both algorithms. To demonstrate the utility of the approach in a typical application, we present the results of an experiment in which one algorithm is used to implement a Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) application. The performance of this implementation is compared to the standard UDP-based implementation of DIS for the given application. Keywords: User-level Protocols, DIS, Massage Passing, Mu [...] ...|$|R
