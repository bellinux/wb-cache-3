40|$|BACKGROUND: Chagas' {{disease and}} the aging process cause loss of neurons of the esophageal myenteric plexus. AIM: To {{evaluate}} the esophageal motility impairment caused by Chagas' disease in two age groups. Our hypothesis was that the aging process may cause further esophageal motility impairment in patients with Chagas' disease. METHODS: We studied the esophageal motility of 30 patients with Chagas' disease and dysphagia, with esophageal retention of barium sulfate and an esophageal diameter within the normal range. Fifteen were 34 to 59 years old (younger group, <b>median</b> 51 <b>years)</b> and 15 were 61 to 77 years old (older group, <b>median</b> 66 <b>years).</b> As a control group we studied 15 subjects aged 33 to 58 <b>years</b> (<b>median</b> 42 <b>years)</b> and 7 subjects aged 61 to 73 <b>years</b> (<b>median</b> 66 <b>years).</b> The esophageal contractions were measured by the manometric method with continuous perfusion after five swallows of a 5 mL bolus of water at 2, 7, 12 and 17 cm below the upper esophageal sphincter. RESULTS: Patients with Chagas' disease had lower amplitude of contractions and fewer peristaltic, more simultaneous, and more non-conducted contractions than controls. Older patients with Chagas' disease had lower amplitude of contractions in the distal esophagus (mean ± SE: 30. 8 ± 4. 3 mm Hg) than younger patients (51. 9 ± 8. 6 mm Hg). From 12 to 17 cm, older patients had more non-conducted (41 %) and fewer peristaltic (8 %) contractions than younger patients (non-conducted: 16 %, peristaltic: 21 %). CONCLUSION: Older patients with Chagas' disease with clinical and radiological examinations {{similar to those of}} younger patients had motility alterations suggesting that the aging process may cause further deterioration of esophageal motility...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile {{scleroderma}} (JS) {{represents a}} rarely seen group of connective tissue diseases with multiple organ involvement. Cardiac involvement in JSS {{is well known}} and, although rare in children, {{it may be an}} important cause of mortality and morbidity. Therefore, an early determination of cardio-vascular and pulmonary involvement is of the most relevance to reduce the mortality in patients with juvenile scleroderma. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore the non-invasive methods (Doppler echocardiography, pulmonary function tests), Forced vital capacity (FVC) and Carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) in the assessment of the cardiopulmonary involvement in patients with JS. The assessment of pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and risk factors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) were made by the measurement of maximum tricuspid insufficiency (TI), end-diastolic pulmonary insufficiency (PI), ratio of acceleration time (AT) to ejection time (ET) (AT/ET), right atrial pressure (RAP) and contraction of vena cava inferior during inspiration.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{most studies}} suggested that hysterectomy with ovarian conservation {{was associated with}} a decreased risk of ovarian cancer. However, several recent studies have reported modestly increased risks of ovarian cancer following hysterectomy. Given that as many as 35 % of women will have a hysterectomy, the nature of the association requires clarification. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature on the relationship between hysterectomy and ovarian cancer to investigate whether there has been a temporal change in the association. Twenty observational studies that have reported a quantitative assessment of the association between hysterectomy and risk of histologically-confirmed ovarian cancer were included in the meta-analysis. The overall relative risk (RR) estimate was 0. 81 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 72 - 0. 92) suggesting hysterectomy decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the results (I- 2 = 74 %). Our exploration of sources of heterogeneity and metaregression showed that <b>median</b> <b>year</b> of cancer diagnosis of included cases explained most of the heterogeneity relative risk (RR = 0. 70 (95 % CI 0. 65 - 0. 76) for <b>median</b> <b>year</b> diagnosis pre 2000; RR = 1. 18 (95 % CI 1. 06 - 1. 31) for post 2000). This study shows {{that there has been a}} temporal shift in the association between hysterectomy and risk of ovarian cancer. One explanation may be the trend away from hysterectomy in younger women. Other speculative possibilities include the decline in oophorectomy rates and the use of oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy in hysterectomised women. Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should not advise women that a hysterectomy without salpingo-oophorectomy will favourably influence their future risk of ovarian cancer.
