25|$|Jellyfish {{deteriorate}} rapidly at {{room temperature}} so processing starts soon after they are caught. The bell is separated from the dangling oral arms and both are washed in seawater before being scraped to remove the gonads and mucus. Dehydration is traditionally undertaken by sprinkling the jellyfish with table salt and alum, draining off the brine and repeating the process. Finally the jellyfish are heaped to drain, turned several times and left to dry. The whole process takes three to six weeks and results in a product with about 65% moisture and 20% salt. The alum reduces the pH and serves to firm the texture while the salt removes water and prevents <b>microbial</b> <b>deterioration.</b> In Malaysia and Thailand, a little sodium bicarbonate is added during processing which facilitates dehydration and increases crispness.|$|E
50|$|The {{three types}} of drying methods are: sun drying, shade drying, and {{mechanical}} drying. Sun drying is an inexpensive process; however, environmental contamination, insect infections, and <b>microbial</b> <b>deterioration</b> can occur and the resulting raisins are often of low quality. Additionally, sun drying is a very slow process and may not produce the most desirable raisins.Mechanical drying {{can be done in}} a safer and more controlled environment where rapid drying is guaranteed. One type of mechanical drying is to use microwave heating. Water molecules in the grapes absorb microwave energy resulting in rapid evaporation. Microwave heating often produces puffy raisins.|$|E

30|$|Direct {{effects of}} fire and the overall changes to the {{ecosystem}} can both lead to short-, medium-, and long-term changes in the soil (Doerr and Cerda 2005). Physical, chemical, and biological soil properties can be altered by fires (Neary et al. 2009, Úbeda and Outeiro 2009). The magnitude and duration of these changes depend on factors like fire severity, peak temperature, and soil type. During severe fires, the most typical effects are loss of organic matter and nutrients through volatilization, ash entrapment in smoke columns, leaching and erosion, alterations of <b>microbial</b> communities, and <b>deterioration</b> of soil structure by affecting aggregate stability (Mataiz-Solera and Cérda 2009). Hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in the post-fire period are dependent {{on the status of}} the soil surface. Reduction in vegetation cover will also lead to changes in soil thermal regime and, in general, higher soil and water losses (Certini 2005).|$|R

This paper presents a computational model to predict, and visualize, the temperature conditions (e. g. velocity, temperature and relative humidity) in refrigerated truck chambers. The model consists of a computer procedure, in which the general equations describing the airflow pattern and the heat/mass transfer in a refrigerated room are solved using the finite volume method. The effect of turbulence is described by the k-ε turbulence model.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{one in a series}} of three that {{addresses}} the issue of forage loss in harvest, storage, and feeding of animals. Forage loss occurs primarily by two modes: 1) escape of forage from the mass of forage as it moves through handling and storage processes and 2) <b>microbial</b> <b>deterioration.</b> Escape of forage can often be observed as forage lying on the ground or on top of equipment surfaces. Most <b>microbial</b> <b>deterioration</b> is invisible and may only be detected by a temperature rise in the forage or a darkening as the forage oxidizes.

Edible coatings (EC) containing natural compounds are a promising preservation technology for raw seafood without compromising fresh-like appeal and nutritional content. The {{aim of this}} work was to evaluate the effect of Thunnus obesus skin gelatin-based EC containing Codium spp. or Fucus vesiculosus extracts on raw tuna preservation. Three gelatin-based EC (gelatin (5 %) + glycerol (25 %); gelatin (5 %) + Codium spp. (1 %) + glycerol (25 %); gelatin (5 %) + Fucus vesiculosus (1 %) + glycerol (25 %)) were applied directly {{on the surface of}} tuna fillets. Functional properties of gelatin and gelatin-based EC containing seaweed extracts were also studied. The gelatin was extracted by an acid-swelling process in the presence/absence of pepsin, followed by subsequent heating/refrigeration, after a pre-treatment with NaOH. The type of acid, temperature and concentration of NaOH greatly influence the process yield. The higher extraction yield was achieved using acetic acid in the presence of pepsin by subsequent refrigeration, especially when skins were previously treated with NaOH (0. 2 M). Tuna quality was assessed over 12 days of storage at 4 ± 1 °C in terms of chemical and microbial indices. Results showed that tuna skin gelatin-based EC avoids tuna <b>deterioration.</b> <b>Microbial</b> growth, assessed by total viable counts, and total volatile basic nitrogen were maintained below the maximum limits recommended, contrarily to the control.

A total of 64 water samples, over a 5 -month period in 2012 - 2013, were collected from free standing bottled water coolers and water taps in Isfahan. Water samples were analyzed for heterotrophic plate count (HPC), temperature, pH, residual chlorine, turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC) and total organic carbon (TOC). Identification of predominant bacteria was also performed by sequence analysis of 16 S rDNA. The mean HPC of water coolers was determined at 38864 CFU/ml which exceeded the acceptable level for drinking water in 62 % of analyzed samples. The HPC from the water coolers was also found to be significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than that of the tap waters.

40|$|Colour is {{considered}} a fundamental property of foods, since it has been widely demonstrated that it correlates well with other physical, chemical and sensorial indicators of product quality [1]. In fact, colour {{plays a major role}} in the assessment of external quality in food industries and food engineering research. The measure of the standard colour of fruits and vegetables can be done by a wide range of colour spaces. However, the L*a*b* system is suggested as the best colour space for quantification in foods with curved surfaces [2]. Drying is one of the methods used for preserving foods, based on the removal of water to a level that minimizes <b>microbial</b> spoilage and <b>deterioration</b> reactions [3]. Pears of the variety S. Bartolomeu are traditionally dried in Portugal by a direct sun-exposure method.

In South Korea, Gangwon-do province is one of the coldest terrains in which eighty percent of the area is mountainous regions, and mainly {{plays an important role in}} the agriculture and dairy industries. The purposes of this study were to analyze the indigenous microbiota of raw milk in Gangwon-do and accurately investigate a putative <b>microbial</b> group causing <b>deterioration</b> in milk quality. Methods We collected raw milk from the bulk tank of 18 dairy farms in the Hoengseong and Pyeongchang regions of Gangwon-do. Milk components were analyzed and the number of viable bacteria was confirmed. The V 3 and V 4 regions of 16 S rRNA gene were amplified and sequenced on an Illumina Miseq platform. Sequences were then assigned to operational taxonomic units, followed by the selection of representative sequences using the QIIME software package. Results The milk samples from Pyeongchang were higher in fat, protein, lactose, total solid, and solid non-fat, and bacterial cell counts were observed only for the Hoengseong samples. The phylum Proteobacteria was detected most frequently in both the Hoengseong and Pyeongchang samples, followed by the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Notably, Corynebacterium, Pediococcus, Macrococcus, and Acinetobacter were significantly different from two regions. Conclusion Although the predominant phylum in raw milk is same, the abundances of major genera in milk samples were different between Hoengseong and Pyeongchang. We assumed that these differences are caused by regional dissimilar farming environments such as soil, forage, and dairy farming equipment so that the quality of milk raw milk from Pyeongchang is higher than that of Hoengseong.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Pumpkin is {{originated}} from America and belongs to Cucurbitaceae family. This fruit/vegetable {{has a huge}} nutritional and health protective value. Fresh pumpkins {{are very sensitive to}} microbial spoilage, even when refrigerated, being sometimes convenient to freeze or dry them. Drying is a method that allows the maintenance of nutritive properties of pumpkins and also has the capability to extend their life Presumably, drying process is the oldest and the most important method of food preservation. The main objective of drying consists in removing water in the solids up to a certain level, at which <b>microbial</b> spoilage and <b>deterioration</b> chemical reactions are much minimized. Freeze drying is considered a high technique of excellence and guarantees a higher quality of the product. METHODOLOGY In the present work the drying treatments used were convective air drying in a tunnel and a chamber at different temperatures, and freeze-drying. The chemical properties of the fresh and dried samples were evaluated in terms of ash, sugars (reducing, non-reducing and total), fiber and vitamin C, using established methodologies (AOAC). The phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were assessed using a spectrophotometer to read the absorbencies of the methanol and acetone extracts. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results show that drying influences the sugars contents, and vitamin C in a high extent. The values for phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity are very identical for all samples, thus indicating that drying has a minor effect on the antioxidant capacity and in the phenolic compounds contents. However, some slight differences were observed. Furthermore, the acetone and methanol extracts also show some little differences. CONCLUSIONS The results obtained enable us to conclude that drying does not induce important changes, either in the phenolic contents or in the antioxidant activity...|$|R

40|$|In metal {{machining}} processes, {{the regulation}} of heat generation and lubrication at the contact point are achieved by application of a fluid referred to as metalworking fluid (MWF). MWFs inevitably become operationally exhausted with age and intensive use, which leads to compromised properties, thereby necessitating their safe disposal. Disposal of this waste through a biological route is an increasingly attractive option, since it is effective with relatively low energy demands. However, successful biological treatment is challenging since MWFs are chemically complex, and include biocides specifically to retard <b>microbial</b> <b>deterioration</b> whilst the fluids are operational.

Roots of six cassava genotypes were evaluated in two experiments, during storage under different environmental conditions: high temperature and low soil moisture; or low temperature and high soil moisture. Roots were treated or not with fungicide (carbendazim) before storage. Genotype reactions to MD and PPD were evaluated at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days after harvest (DAH), in the proximal, medial, and distal parts of the roots. A diagrammatic scale was proposed to evaluate nonperipheral symptoms of PPD. Fungicide treatment and root position did not influence PPD expression; however, all factors had significant effect on MD severity. Genotypes differed as to their tolerance to PPD and MD. Both deterioration types were more pronounced during periods of higher humidity and lower temperatures. The fungicide treatment increased root shelf life by reducing MD severity up to 10 DAH. Whole roots showed low MD severity and high PPD expression up to 10 DAH, which enabled the assessment of PPD without significant interference of MD symptoms during this period...|$|E

In the case of strict anaerobes species they are difficult to grow and isolate using culture methods in conventional microbiology laboratories. Furthermore, conventional culture methods are sometimes not capable of distinguishing species or genera. DNA-based molecular methods are alternative strategies for detecting viable and non-cultivable microorganisms and strict anaerobic microorganisms that are difficult to cultivate.

The fungal population in the 14 days-cured sweet potato roots was {{higher than in the}} 7 days-cured sweet potato roots by 0. 6 - 1. 6 log cfu/g for 28 days of storage. For both the 7 and 14 days-cured sweet potato roots, the sweet potato roots stored for 28 days in the three different storage structures had a higher microbial count compared to the sweet potato roots stored for 14 days. Aspergillus flavus was the most dominant fungal species occurring in all of the three different storage structures fol-lowed by A. niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Tricho-derma viride, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium digitatum, Cladosporium herbarum, and Aspergillus ochraceus, in that order...|$|E
40|$|Fresh sprouts and ready-to-eat salad {{mixtures}} sold in bags {{which were}} cut, washed and packaged days earlier are considered as perishable products. Though they are stored under refrigerated conditions, {{there is a}} danger of <b>microbial</b> <b>deterioration</b> and contamination with bacteria such as Listeria, Salmonella, E. coli bacteria or viruses such as norovirus or hepatitis A virus. These bacteria can cause a range of foodborne infections of varying severity with symptoms such as nausea, indigestion, bloody diarrhoea or kidney dysfunction. Soy bean sprouts or alfalfa as well as ready-to-eat mixtures of leaf lettuce and uncooked vegetables such as white or red cabbage and carrots can thus become a health hazard for humans. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has completed studies on the microbial load of sprouts and ready-to-eat salads mixtures. In 2009, 59 samples of fresh, packaged sprouts and shoots from retail shops were analysed. The results showed that the number of bacteria in packaged sprouts increase considerably within a few days and are an above average microbial load when they reach the best before date. In 2008 BfR analysed ready-to-eat salads mixtures from retail shops with regard to Listeria bacteria. Out of 133 salad mixtures, 5 % of samples contained the disease-causing bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, especially mixed salads that contained white cabbage. BfR recommends that consumers wash sprouts and packaged salads thoroughly before consumption {{in order to reduce the}} microbial load...|$|E
