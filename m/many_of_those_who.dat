5|$|While the {{painting}} largely representedand {{was one of}} the pioneers ofan emerging style, the work was criticised by several authorities on the subject. The reasons for this varied from Delaroche's depiction of the scene to a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were in the latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match the genius of Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were invoked {{in the process of}} the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.|$|E
5|$|Before Juan made landfall, about 100 people {{evacuated}} around Port Arthur, Texas. In Louisiana, about 6,550 people evacuated, including only 700 of the 1,900 residents on Grand Isle; <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> {{stayed behind}} there were trapped after {{the onslaught of}} the storm surge. About 6,000 people evacuated in Mississippi due to the threat for flooding. Many schools were closed along the coast in Louisiana and Mississippi, and two beaches were closed {{both sides of the}} Brownsville, Texas shipping channel. On October 28, governor Edwin Edwards {{declared a state of emergency}} for 13 Louisiana parishes, while officials issued flash flood watches for 42 of Louisiana's 64 parishes. Governor George Wallace also declared a state of emergency for Alabama, and shelters were opened along the coast.|$|E

5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Williamson {{offered his}} {{apartment}} in Kingston as a space in which gay Jamaicans could meet roughly every fortnight. In the early 1990s he purchased a large property on New Kingston's gentrified Haughton Street, converting part of this building into a gay nightclub that he called Entourage. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> attended the club worked in the city's foreign embassies. Although the police tried to close it down, the club remained open for two years until Williamson was attacked by a patron carrying a knife, which was used to slash Williamson's arm. Although same-sex sexual relations between men were illegal in Jamaica, Williamson was openly gay.|$|E

5|$|On September 9, Boston Police Department {{officers}} went {{on strike}} at 5:45p.m. Of the force's 1,544 officers and men, 1,117 (72%) failed to report for work. Coolidge assigned 100 members of the state's Metropolitan Park Police Department to replace the striking officers, but 58 of them refused to participate and were suspended from their jobs. Despite assurances from Commissioner Curtis to Mayor Peters and Governor Coolidge, Boston had little police protection for the night of September 9. Volunteer replacements were still being organized and due to report the next morning. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> provided scab labor were students at Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|Rivera {{recommended}} closing Presidio de los Tejas {{and reducing}} the number of soldiers at the other presidios. His suggestions were approved in 1729, and 125troops were removed from Texas, leaving only 144soldiers divided between Los Adaes, La Bahía, and San Antonio. The three East Texas missions which had depended on Presidio de los Tejas were relocated along the San Antonio River in May 1731, increasing the number of missions in the San Antonio area to five. The San Antonio missions usually contained fewer than 300Indians. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> lived at the mission had nowhere else to go, and belonged to small tribes that have since become extinct.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{performance}} was disappointing. Jaguar {{had intended to}} produce up to 350 cars, but production ceased in 1994 with 275 production cars produced, not all {{of which had been}} sold; some left-hand drive examples were still available in 1997. The recession left <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> placed a deposit unable to complete the purchase. The index linking of contracts exacerbated the issue, and added almost £200,000 to the purchase price between early 1990 and mid-1992. The McLaren F1 suffered from similarly poor sales performance, with just 71 cars sold against McLaren's target of 300. McLaren's F1 program eventually turned a small profit thanks to the sale and servicing of the 28 GTR racing variants produced.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Weingarten {{proposed}} legislation that passed unanimously in the Assembly {{to require the}} State of New Jersey to create a web site listing sex offenders, including their names, addresses, pictures and details of the crimes committed. The bill expanded the availability of information about sex offenders beyond the community notification requirements included in the 1994 Megan's Law. Weingarten {{emphasized the importance of}} making this information available, noting that as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> 95% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have committed sexual crimes are repeat offenders.|$|R

Bell has also done a public service announcement for Do Something's Healthy Living Campaign. In 2014, Bell launched a Prizeo campaign offering fans a chance to win a date with her in return for donating to Invisible Children.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after UDI, 46 {{academics}} {{working at}} University College, a racially non-segregated institution, in Rhodesia wrote to The Times in London, denouncing the move. Officers of the British South Africa Police visited <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had signed to search their houses. Shortly afterwards, the residence permit {{of one of}} the academics came up for renewal, which would normally be automatic. In fact, it was revoked and the academic was deported. Van der Byl was the responsible minister and all but admitted that the reason was his opposition to UDI.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E

60|$|The sermon ended, the {{minister}} wiped his steaming face and turned down his cuffs, and nods and sagacious glances went round.

5|$|At around 6a.m., {{a passing}} {{labourer}} saw women's items near a water-filled pit. One {{of the items}} was a woman's shoe with blood on it. He raised the alarm. He and others {{were able to use}} a rake to find a body in the pit– that of Mary Ashford. Two workers from a nearby factory found a series of footprints on the newly harrowed field near the pit, showing that {{a man and a woman}} had travelled together, almost up to the pit, and that the man returned alone. Ashford was known to <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> gathered around the pit, as was the fact that she had gone to Tyburn the previous evening. The local mill owner, who took charge, went to Tyburn to discover with whom Ashford had left the party. Daniel Clarke, the landlord, began to ride towards Castle Bromwich to try to locate Thornton, and encountered him almost at once. When Clarke told Thornton of Ashford's death, Thornton stated that he was with her until 4a.m., and at Clarke's request went with him to Tyburn.|$|E
5|$|Despite the denunciations {{from the}} anarchist {{organizations}} and periodicals around the world, opinion {{began to change}} in 1976, when Sam Dolgoff published his book The Cuban Revolution: A Critical Perspective. As well, in 1979, the MLCE began publishing a new magazine titled Guángara Libertaria, reprinting Alfredo Gómez' article The Cuban Anarchists, or the Bad Conscience of Anarchism. In 1980, the MLCE and Guángara Libertaria supported the mass evacuation of Cubans from Cuba after many Cuban dissidents occupied the Peruvian embassy in Havana. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> left Cuba at this time joined the editorial collective of Guángara. By 1985, the collective had correspondents around the world, including Mexico, Hawaii, Spain, and Venezuela. The magazine reached a press run of 5000 copies in 1987, making it the largest circulation anarchist periodical in the U.S. However, in 1992, the collective ceased publication of GL, though many of its members continued to publish writings. By 2008, the MLCE was structured as an affinity group and coordinating network for Cuban anarchists of diverse tendencies.|$|E
5|$|His father, Niccolò Polo, a merchant, traded {{with the}} Near East, {{becoming}} wealthy and achieving great prestige. Niccolò {{and his brother}} Maffeo set off on a trading voyage before Marco's birth. In 1260, Niccolò and Maffeo, while residing in Constantinople, then {{the capital of the}} Latin Empire, foresaw a political change; they liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away. According to The Travels of Marco Polo, they passed through much of Asia, and met with Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan dynasty. Their decision to leave Constantinople proved timely. In 1261 Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, took Constantinople, promptly burned the Venetian quarter and re-established the Eastern Roman Empire. Captured Venetian citizens were blinded, while <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea.|$|E
50|$|In particular, King George V {{wished to}} create an Order to honour <b>many</b> {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had served {{in a variety of}} non-combatant roles during the First World War.

50|$|The federal {{government}} indicted <b>many</b> others <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> allegedly bribed Epps, such as Mark Longoria, CEO of Drug Testing Corporation of Houston, Texas, {{who pleaded guilty}} in August 2016.

5|$|In February 1931, {{the woods}} were {{included}} in a sale by King's College to the urban district council. Park Wood was sold for £28,100, with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included {{as a gift to}} the people of Ruislip. King's had also wished to present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75% of the cost, as the urban district council argued that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> would make use of the land would be recreational day-trippers from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new building was constructed without the permission of the county council. An area of the wood to the south {{was not included in the}} lease agreement and three residential roads were later constructed on it.|$|E
5|$|In early 1612, {{the year}} of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a {{criminal}} offence at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Germans {{who were}} {{responsible}} for the operation of the camp were captured and brought to trial. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had been prominent German officials during the occupation of Serbia, including Turner, Fuchs and Meyszner, were extradited to Yugoslavia by the Allies after the war, where they were executed. Camp commander Andorfer managed to escape {{with the assistance of the}} Roman Catholic Church, which helped him flee to South America. He returned to Austria from Venezuela in the 1960s, and was subsequently apprehended and tried on the minor charge of being an accessory to murder—for which he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years imprisonment. Andorfer's deputy, Enge, was apprehended in the 1960s, and sentenced to one-and-a-half years imprisonment. His sentence was never carried out due to his old age and poor health. German guards suspected of executing Serbian prisoners were never tried, although they served as witnesses in several trials in West Germany.|$|E
