If they had reached any science worth the name, they might have loved it; but of the paltry knowledge they possessed, they could only be proud. There was not anything in it capable of being loved. Anatomy, indeed, then first made a subject of accurate study, is a true science, but not so attractive as to enlist the affections strongly on its side: and therefore, like its meaner sisters, it became merely a ground for pride; and the one main purpose of the Renaissance artists, in all their work, was to show how much they knew.|$|E

6000|$|Under this {{impossibility of}} {{studying}} {{the laws of}} the formation of character by experiments purposely contrived to elucidate them, there remains the resource of simple observation. But if it be impossible to ascertain the influencing circumstances with any approach to completeness even when we have the shaping of them ourselves, much more impossible is it when the cases are further removed from our observation, and altogether out of our control. Consider the difficulty of the very first step—of ascertaining what actually is the character of the individual, in each particular case that we examine. There is hardly any person living concerning some essential part of whose character there are not differences of opinion even among his intimate acquaintances; and a single action, or conduct continued only for a short time, goes a very little way toward ascertaining it. We can only make our observations in a rough way and en masse; not attempting to ascertain completely in any given instance, what character has been formed, and still less by what causes; but only observing in what state of previous circumstances it is found that certain marked mental qualities or deficiencies oftenest exist. These conclusions, besides that they are mere approximate generalizations, deserve no reliance, even as such, unless the instances are sufficiently numerous to eliminate not only chance, but every assignable circumstance in which a number of the cases examined may happen to have resembled one another. So numerous and various, too, are the circumstances which form individual character, that the consequence of any particular combination is hardly ever some definite and strongly marked character, always found where that combination exists, and not otherwise. What is obtained, even after the most extensive and accurate observation, is merely a comparative result; as, for example, that in a given number of Frenchmen, taken indiscriminately, there will be found more persons of a particular mental tendency, and fewer of the contrary tendency, than among an equal number of Italians or English, similarly taken; or thus: of a hundred Frenchmen and an equal number of Englishmen, fairly selected, and arranged according to the degree in which they possess a particular <b>mental</b> <b>characteristic,</b> each number, 1, 2, 3, etc., of the one series, will be found to possess more of that characteristic than the corresponding number of the other. Since, therefore, the comparison is not one of kinds, but of ratios and degrees; and since, in proportion as the differences are slight, it requires a greater number of instances to eliminate chance, it can not often happen to any one to know a sufficient number of cases with the accuracy requisite for making the sort of comparison last mentioned; less than which, however, would not constitute a real induction. Accordingly, there is hardly one current opinion respecting the characters of nations, classes, or descriptions of persons, which is universally acknowledged as indisputable.(272) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{managers}} and management {{researchers believe that}} without constant commitment {{of the members of}} organizations, achieving the organizational objectives seems to be unattainable. Motivation is considered as a human <b>mental</b> <b>characteristic</b> which indicates the individual's level of organizational commitment. Paying attention to the employees’ motivation plays a vital role in the way the organizations offer their services. In this study, after comprehensive evaluation of various theories and models regarding motivation, the model of Frederick Herzberg has been used. This paper aims to investigate the relationships between hygiene and motivational factors and motivation among chief operating officers and employees. The statistical population of this study includes all the employees of the mentioned government organizations with the occupational group of 12 to 16 who have answered the questionnaire. After investigating the face and content of validity of the questionnaire, the Cronbach's alpha was conducted to investigate its reliability coefficient which was equal to 0. 87. The results of the study revealed that Herzberg's hygiene factors {{have a significant impact on}} improving employees and chief operating officers’ motivation than motivational factors. Moreover, the findings indicated that the impact of Herzberg's motivational factors on middle managers’ motivation raising is more than hygiene factors...|$|E

My use of the term mentality drew on the work of a French historical school prominent in the 1960 s and 1970 s (led by histo-rians Jacques LeGoff and Lucien Febvre) that championed the study of l’histoire des mentalités, meaning deep mental structures that persist in cultural groups over time.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} whether Science DOES transcend Culture {{naturally}} [...] not whether it CAN do so. That Science can be adopted into any culture is clear from modern history (as in China today). That Science does not automatically develop even when a Culture has reached {{a high level of}} technical achievement (as in modern China) or intellectual sophistication (as in ancient Greece) is also clear from history. Evidently Science and Technology are not the same thing, for none of these high Cultures ever succeeded in crossing the threshold into an Industrial Revolution. Yet it did appear in Europe where Technology is not particularly remarkable, but Philosophy is. Research has shown that non-Indo-Europeans are highly inventive and responsible for all basic Technology, but are quite un-philosophical. On the other hand, Indo-Europeans are quite uninventive but philosophically inclined and responsible for all philosophical systems. Neither Philosophy nor Technology alone is capable of producing Science. Only when Philosophy is applied to Technology does Science arise. An examination of the reasons for these circumstances constitutes the subject of this thesis. To the question, Can Science transcend Culture, the answer would be unquestionably, Yes. To the question, Does Science transcend Culture, the answer apparently is NO. Science can transcend Culture but apparently it does not by nature do so. It thus appears to be an activity that is culturally conditioned. The interrelationship between language and thought is explored: evidence show that non-Indo-European languages do not permit or encourage speculation of a philosophical nature, whereas Indo-European languages do. How did this bifurcation come about and what factors tend to preserve it? Did language predetermine thought patterns, or has some <b>mental</b> <b>characteristic,</b> possibly genetically determined, been responsible for the structure of language? The possible relevance of all this in terms of educational methods is considered. By formulating precisely the relationships between Philosophy, Technology, and Science, and by giving attention to the part which the structure of Language plays in these relationships, it is hoped to give some direction to the content of Education needed to train and equip Scientists...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{existence}} of optimism {{as a personal}} psychological characteristic of managers is a necessity in contemporary economy and decision making, although the phenomenon of over-optimism may lead to unfavourable outcomes. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the optimism bias and its impact on the firms' future performance. Especially regarding the recent years where Greece faces increased economic depression, high percentages of unemployment and lack of budgetary discipline, the goal is therefore, to find whether managerial optimism has an impact on corporate investment of Greek firms. Design/methodology/approach-The investment of firms with optimistic managers is more sensitive to cash flow than the investment of firms with managers who are not optimistic. To test the research question a number of fixed effect panel regressions of capital expenditures (capital expenditures divided by lagged assets is the dependent variable) is run. In all regressions we analyse cash flow divided by lagged assets and lagged Tobin's Q as the independent variables, for firms whose managers are classified as optimistic and not optimistic. This classification is based on the optimism "dummy" variable, which is equal to 1 when members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board (ALL), only the Executive Board (EB), and only CEO are classified as optimistic. The concept of this study is tested for firms which are listed in the Athens Stock Exchange. A total of 243 firms are recorded, for the time period between 2007 and 2012, including firms from 11 different industries; basic materials, chemicals, consumer goods, consumer services, health care, industrials, financials, oil and gas, technology, telecommunications, and utilities. Based on the literature and on related methodology aspects, financial firms are excluded. Findings-It was revealed that managerial optimism affects corporate investment in firms with high degree of closely held shares. Moreover, managerial optimism is never linked to corporate investment regarding firms which belong to middle degree of closely held shares. Additionally it is proved that decisions for acquisitions are not affected by the manager's optimism regarding the prospects of his / her firm. This result it is not consistent with results of previous literature like Malmendier and Tate (2008) and Glaser et al. (2008) who have been found that cash flow, Tobin's Q and firm size mainly drive the probability of an acquisition. Finally, it is confirmed that investment of firms with optimistic managers was found to be more sensitive to cash flow than the investment of firms with managers who are not optimistic. Optimism was proved to be extremely effective concerning investment. Research limitations/implications-A possible proposal for further research could be the testing of each year separately. In this study we have run the regressions for the whole of the 6 -year period of 2007 to 2012. However, testing each year individually could provide researchers with the ability to compare different results, to find out whether there was anything special statistically for each specific year and maybe test the period after the year 2010 when the Greek crisis had started to come up on the horizon. The impact of the Greek financial crisis on managerial behaviour and on the personal characteristics of managers like optimism could constitute a field for further research. Originality/value-Since research on this specific field of finance is quite limited; this study aims to add value on the existing knowledge on the Greek case. The investigation of managerial optimism as a personal, psychological and <b>mental</b> <b>characteristic</b> encloses the effort of Greek managers to come out of the economic crisis and consequently achieve greater outcomes for their firms...|$|E
