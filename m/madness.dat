5|$|In September 2010, <b>Madness</b> {{were awarded}} the Idol Award at the Q Awards in London. Guitarist Chris Foreman stated in his {{acceptance}} speech that <b>Madness</b> were recording a new album.|$|E
5|$|<b>Madness</b> {{achieved}} most {{of their}} success {{in the early to}} mid-1980s. Both <b>Madness</b> and UB40 spent 214 weeks on the UK singles charts {{over the course of the}} decade, holding the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts. However, <b>Madness</b> did so in a shorter time period (1980–1986).|$|E
5|$|Early {{in their}} career, <b>Madness</b> {{were linked to}} skinheads; members of a British working-class {{subculture}} that the media often stereotyped as racist (although many skinheads, including the original generation, are non-racist or anti-racist). Not only was <b>Madness,</b> along with other 2 Tone bands, popular with skinheads, but {{it was said that}} the band members were associated with the subculture.|$|E
5|$|From 28 October 2002 to 16 August 2003, {{a musical}} based on <b>Madness</b> songs, Our House, ran at the Cambridge Theatre in London. <b>Madness</b> {{played a role}} in the {{executive}} production of the show, and Suggs {{played a role in}} the production for a period, playing the central character's father. It won an Olivier Award for best new musical of 2003, and the performance was released on DVD on 1 November 2004. There was also a previous musical based on <b>Madness</b> songs, One Step Beyond!, written by Alan Gilbey. The musical had a brief run at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in 1993 and a run at Putney Arts Theatre, London in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Greenwald {{debuted in}} WCW as the evil Miss <b>Madness,</b> one of Randy Savage's valets along with Gorgeous George and Madusa. Savage asked Greenwald and Madusa to train his then-girlfriend Gorgeous George in real life, {{highlights}} {{of which were}} shown on WCW television. As part of the storyline, this villainous alliance, called Team <b>Madness,</b> would interfere in matches {{for the benefit of}} Savage. Behind the scenes, Greenwald and Madusa trained the other women of WCW at the WCW Power Plant. Eventually, Savage betrayed Miss <b>Madness</b> by firing her from Team <b>Madness</b> along with Madusa after a championship loss. She then became Mona, a fan favorite, who wrestled in a blue cocktail dress and barefoot. She embarked on mini-feuds with Madusa, Little Jeannie, and Asya. Independent female wrestlers, such as Dee Dee Venturi and Brandi Alexander, were also brought in to wrestle Mona. WCW released Greenwald, however, in August 2000 in a cost-cutting move.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Fey {{and other}} members of The Second City {{provided}} voices for the pinball game Medieval <b>Madness.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, <b>Madness</b> {{played the}} {{majority}} of their new album The Liberty of Norton Folgate at London's Hackney Empire for three nights. The Hackney Empire performances were recorded and sold to fans as they left the show on USB wristbands. <b>Madness</b> played two dates in December 2008, firstly in Manchester on 18 December, and secondly a return gig to The O2 in London on the 19th.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also the}} victor of Billboard's 2013 reader-voted March <b>Madness</b> contest, against hits by Kelly Clarkson, Rihanna and P!nk, among others.|$|E
5|$|<b>Madness</b> officially {{opened the}} rebuilt pier at Hastings on 21 May 2016 with a concert.|$|E
5|$|<b>Madness</b> {{were not}} only running their own label at the time, but also had their own {{recording}} studio, Liquidator Studios. The studio is still located on Caledonian Road in North London, in {{what was once the}} premises of their fan club office. They built a 24-track professional studio in the cellar. The ground floor has always been an office and chill out area, while a room upstairs is used for song mixing. The band have recorded a number of demos and b-sides at Liquidator, as well as The <b>Madness</b> album in 1988. Other acts to use the studio include Feargal Sharkey, The Farm, Apollo 440, The Potato 5, The Nutty Boys, The Deltones and The Butterfield 8. The studio is still regularly used by musicians, including members of <b>Madness</b> themselves.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 28 August, <b>Madness</b> {{played the}} Rock en Seine festival near Paris, {{on the same}} night where Oasis {{brothers}} Noel and Liam Gallagher engaged in a physical altercation, resulting in the split of the band. As Oasis cancelled their headlining slot, <b>Madness,</b> even though having played earlier in the evening, were asked to replace them. They accepted the invitation and both of their sets during the festival were said to have been well received.|$|E
5|$|That {{was a bad}} scene, brother. The {{sickness}} and <b>madness</b> of those daysI'm glad {{to be free of}} them.|$|E
5|$|The six {{remaining}} original {{members of}} <b>Madness</b> {{began working on}} their first original album in seven years.|$|E
5|$|While his {{stand-in}} is {{masquerading as}} the Goblin, Osborn joins a cult, hoping to receive great {{power from the}} 'Gathering of Five', which will grant the participants Power, Knowledge, Immortality, <b>Madness</b> or Death, but while he believes that he receives Power, he is instead driven further into <b>madness,</b> and threatens the world with genetic bombs. It is during this time that Peter learns May Parker is alive and Osborn's actress died in her place. Osborn's complete <b>madness</b> is evident, as he hallucinates unmasking and killing Peter; yet in reality Peter easily defeats him. He is rescued from custody thereafter by his cabal of henchmen.|$|E
5|$|By 1978, {{the band}} had allowed McPherson to return, after filling in {{temporarily}} for Hasler (who {{had taken over}} vocals when McPherson was removed). Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson. Drummer Daniel Woodgate (Woody) and bass player Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, replacing Garry Dovey and Rodgers, respectively. After briefly changing their name to Morris and the Minors, the band renamed itself as <b>Madness</b> in 1979, paying homage {{to one of their}} favourite songs by ska/reggae artist Prince Buster. The band remained a sextet until late 1979, when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of <b>Madness</b> as a backing vocalist and dancer.|$|E
5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Beyond the Mountains of <b>Madness</b> too was {{announced}} in November 2002 and has been scheduled for the Xbox and PC release {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2004. It would be a sequel to Lovecraft's novella At the Mountains of <b>Madness,</b> inspired by the Call of Cthulhu RPG campaign of the same title. The game was to be a survival horror and first-person shooter set in the 1930s and taking place in varied locations including Germany and Antarctica, and its protagonist would be a Miskatonic University archaeologist Robert Naples attempting to stop the Nazi occultist search for the ruins of the Elder Things' city.|$|E
5|$|Live {{recordings}} of <b>Madness</b> performances {{as well as}} those by other 2 Tone bands were used in the documentary film and soundtrack album Dance Craze.|$|E
5|$|<b>Madness</b> are an English ska {{band from}} Camden Town, London, who formed in 1976. One {{of the most}} {{prominent}} bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s 2 Tone ska revival, they continue to perform with their most recognised line-up of seven members.|$|E
5|$|Marble <b>Madness</b> is an arcade {{video game}} {{designed}} by Mark Cerny {{and published by}} Atari Games in 1984. The player uses a trackball to guide an onscreen marble through six obstacle-filled courses within a time limit. Marble <b>Madness</b> was Atari's first game to use the Atari System 1 hardware and to be programmed in the C programming language. It {{was also one of}} the first games to use true stereo sound; previous games used either monaural sound or simulated stereo.|$|E
5|$|Marble <b>Madness</b> was commercially successful. The {{game was}} ported to {{numerous}} platforms and inspired {{the development of}} other games. A sequel was developed and planned for release in 1991, but canceled when location testing showed the game could not compete with other titles.|$|E
5|$|Myrrha {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here she and other falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, Myrrha's being <b>madness.</b> Myrrha's {{suffering}} in the tenth bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha's contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her <b>madness</b> in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous {{of the social order}} in life.|$|E
5|$|The Fink Brothers were a {{short-lived}} alter ego created by <b>Madness</b> members Suggs and Chas Smash, {{working under the}} aliases Angel and Ratty Fink.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Smart's eclipse may be traced {{in part to}} a {{prejudice}} of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for <b>madness.</b> It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of <b>madness</b> than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} many genres, {{including}} fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror and romance), {{the world of}} Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death. Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and <b>madness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Atari created prototypes for {{location}} testing, but {{the game}} did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as Street Fighter II. Atari assumed the track balls accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls. Because the new models were met with the same poor reception, production was halted and the focus shifted to Guardians of the 'Hood, a beat 'em up game. An urban legend states that when WMS Industries purchased Time Warner Interactive (the company which Atari Games had since merged into) in 1996, they ran a steamroller over the Marble <b>Madness</b> II boards in order to clear inventory for tax purposes. In actuality, no Marble <b>Madness</b> II boards were made apart from the prototypes, and according to Cerny at most 12 of these exist. These prototypes have since become collector items.|$|E
5|$|Cicero {{translated}} Aratus in his youth; he {{made the}} Orion episode half again longer {{than it was in}} the Greek, adding the traditional Latin topos of <b>madness</b> to Aratus's text. Cicero's Aratea is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including epyllia in non-epic poems.|$|E
5|$|Following the RAW Tour in mid-2011, Hopsin begun {{working on}} Knock <b>Madness,</b> though not very heavily. On January 17, 2012, fellow Funk Volume rappers SwizZz and Dizzy Wright were {{confirmed}} to make appearances on the album. In a March 2012 interview, Hopsin {{said that he}} talked to Tech N9ne about appearing on the album, which Tech N9ne agreed to. He also stated in 2012 that he wanted Yelawolf on the album.|$|E

Dizzy Wright and DJ Hoppa joined Hopsin on select dates during the North American run of the tour.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, Ewing {{suffered}} {{an attack of}} rheumatism, and received treatment several times thereafter, often being confined to his chair. He was likely prostrated with illness as Commander of Louisville during Burbridge's <b>madness</b> in Kentucky. He was made a brevet major general on March 13, 1865. After leaving the Army, he experienced painful attacks {{for the rest of}} his life, often bedridden for periods of up to forty days.|$|E
5|$|In {{stories from}} the 13th century, tengu began to abduct young boys {{as well as the}} priests they had always targeted. The boys were often returned, while the priests would be found tied to the tops of trees or other high places. All of the tengu's victims, however, would come back in a state of near death or <b>madness,</b> {{sometimes}} after having been tricked into eating animal dung.|$|E
5|$|<b>Madness</b> {{toured the}} UK {{throughout}} November and December 2010 with their final show at London's Earl's Court, where {{they played a}} new song from their upcoming album. However, two concerts, in Hull and Sheffield, were cancelled due to a heavy snowfall, although they were later rescheduled for 5 and 6 February 2011 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Madusa {{returned}} to WCW in April 1999 {{as part of}} Randy Savage's faction Team <b>Madness</b> with Gorgeous George and Miss <b>Madness.</b> After that storyline ended, Madusa entered into a tournament for the WCW Championship, but she was defeated and eliminated from the tournament. She was later re-entered into the tournament in a match against Evan Karagias, but was eliminated the next week. After her elimination, Madusa put all her focus on managing Karagias. After Karagias won the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship at Mayhem, he was found flirting with Spice of the Nitro Girls. At Starrcade, however, Spice gave Karagias a low blow during the match, and Madusa pinned him {{to become the first}} female ever to win the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship. Spice then aligned herself with Madusa and became her manager for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Marble <b>Madness</b> was {{developed}} by Atari Games, with Mark Cerny as the lead designer and Bob Flanagan as the software engineer. Both Cerny and Flanagan handled programming the game. It uses the Atari System 1 hardware, an interchangeable system of circuit boards, control panels, and artwork. The game features pixel graphics on a 19-inch Electrohome G07 model CRT monitor, and uses a Motorola 68010 central processing unit (CPU) with a MOS Technology 6502 subsystem to control the audio and coin operations. Marble <b>Madness</b> was Atari's first game to use an FM sound chip produced by Yamaha, {{which is similar to}} a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer and creates the music in real time so that it is in synchronization with the game's on-screen action. The game's music was composed by Brad Fuller and Hal Canon who spent a few months becoming familiar with the capabilities of the sound chip.|$|E
