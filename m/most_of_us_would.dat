Bernard Shaw, {{in his role}} as a music critic, commented, [...] "The stale wonderment which the great chorus never fails to elicit has already been exhausted"; he later wrote, [...] "Why, instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous {{dullness}} of a Handel Festival does not somebody set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in St James's Hall with a chorus of twenty capable artists? <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> be glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die." [...] The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts.

Jimmy Stewart of Charisma reported that the film gives a human face to trafficking statistics and instils a desire in the viewer {{to put an end to}} such criminal activity. Ted Baehr of Movieguide, a Christian magazine, called the film [...] "a powerful, compelling and transformational documentary about human trafficking and sex slavery" [...] and wrote that it was amazing that the film covered an inherently sexual topic both honestly and without nudity. Baehr praised the cinematography, editing, and filmmaking, but criticized some portions of the film as being repetitive and uncompelling. The Movieguide review ends by comparing the film's opposition to modern slavery to the death of Saint Telemachus, which put an end to gladiatorial games in ancient Rome. Erica Yunghans of Star News Daily called the film [...] "controversial".|$|E

60|$|Individually, I have no {{love for}} academies on the {{continental}} model, and still less {{for the system}} of decorating men of distinction in science, letters, or art, with orders and titles, or enriching them with sinecures. What men of science want is only a fair day's wages {{for more than a}} fair day's work; and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I suspect, <b>would</b> be well content if, for our days and nights of unremitting toil, we could secure the pay which a first-class Treasury clerk earns without any obviously trying strain upon his faculties. The sole order of nobility which, in my judgment, becomes a philosopher, is that rank which he holds in the estimation of his fellow-workers, who are the only competent judges in such matters. Newton and Cuvier lowered themselves when the one accepted an idle knighthood, and the other became a baron of the empire. The great men who went to their graves as Michael Faraday and George Grote seem to me to have understood the dignity of knowledge better when they declined all such meretricious trappings.|$|R
500|$|Although {{the poem}} was defended {{by a few}} critics, E. C. Pettet {{returned}} to {{the argument that the}} poem lacked a structure and emphasized the word [...] "forlorn" [...] as evidence of his view. In his 1957 work, Pettet did praise the poem as he declared, [...] "The Ode to a Nightingale has a special interest in that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> probably regard it as the most richly representative of all Keats’s poems. Two reasons for this quality are immediately apparent: there is its matchless evocation of that late spring and early summer season [...] and there is its exceptional degree of 'distillation', of concentrated recollection". David Perkins felt the need to defend {{the use of the word}} [...] "forlorn" [...] and claimed that it described the feeling from the impossibility of not being able to live in the world of the imagination. When praising the poem in 1959, Perkins claimed, [...] "Although the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] ranges more widely than the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn," [...] the poem can also be regarded as the exploration or testing out of a symbol, and, compared with the urn as a symbol, the nightingale would seem to have both limitations and advantages." [...] Walter Jackson Bate also made a similar defense of the word [...] "forlorn" [...] by claiming that the world described by describing the impossibility of reaching that land. When describing the poem compared to the rest of English poetry, Bate argued in 1963, [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is among [...] "the greatest lyrics in English" [...] and the only one written with such speed: [...] "We are free to doubt whether any poem in English of comparable length and quality has been composed so quickly." [...] In 1968, Robert Gittins stated, [...] "It may not be wrong to regard [...] as Keats's earlier essays in this [...] form, and the great Nightingale and Grecian Urn as his more finished and later works." ...|$|E

40|$|Naturalness {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a highly valued property <b>of</b> a material. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> for example, <b>would</b> accept {{to pay more for}} a natural silk dress or wooden floor than for functionally equivalent but “fake ” versions, meeting the same standards. What physical properties are underlying naturalness perception? And how do people know the difference? The MONAT (Measurement of Naturalness) project aims to understand how the perception of naturalness is formed. Each material has specific physical properties that differentiate them from other materials. These properties are picked up by one or several of our sensory systems and bound into a unitary percept. For example, properties like colour and glossiness are perceived by our visual system, whereas temperature and roughness are encoded by the tactile system. At some stage of processing these, initially separate, perceptual properties are combined to form a unitary percept of the material upon which any judgments about its naturalness will be based. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we seek to better understand the relationship between the physical measurements of material properties and the perceptual as well as neural bases of naturalness judgements by humans. In this paper we will focus on the subjective measurements of human naturalness judgements, and the contributions of vision and haptics to this perceptual decision...|$|R

On the contrary, according to glreach. com [1], there are 801. 4 million people online with at least 510 million non-English and the remainder are English speakers. As a big step towards comprehending web page dimensions regarding languages in cyberspace, we have officially launched a project called â€œLanguage Observatory (LO) " in February 2004. We have made several experimental runs using Ubicrawler, {{some of which were}} dedicated to the 57 Organization of the Islamic Conference country code Top Level Domains (ccTLD). It {{is interesting to note that}} we covered at least 42 million web pages compared to almost 17 million indexed by two well known search engines and this covers nearly triple the amount containing multiple dimensions such as languages, script and character set encoding. Furthermore, data mining activities by LO yield significant findings that further provide a snapshot of cyberspace. This will offer contents that are often created in particular domains hence this provide practical information: language preferences and source documentations in cyberspace. The potency of LO in producing indispensable information must be taken into account because these are factors that should not be absent within the value chain of translation activities...|$|R
40|$|To many, if not <b>most,</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> it <b>would</b> {{seem like}} “common {{sense that you}} do not go to jail unless there is a {{potential}} that your activities will cause harm to others [...] ” It has certainly long been accepted that government should not resort to the criminal law to control behaviour unless that behaviour creates a real risk of harm. But what if the government thought otherwise? What if the government decided to criminalize recreational activities that posed a neglible risk of harm to society? What if the government decided to criminalize conduct which, {{for the vast majority of}} the public who engage in that conduct, poses no real risk of harm? Does the Charter offer any protection against unnecessary criminal laws? Does section 7 of the Charter include a “harm principle” that restricts the imposition of criminal prohibitions to conduct that causes at least some measurable harm to society? in the recent trilogy of cases dealing with a section 7 Charter challenge to the criminal prohibition on marijuana, a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada decided that the “harm principle” was not a principle of fundamental justice. Despite the historical and widespread support for recognition of a “harm principle”, the majority’s decision wisely prevented the creation of a double-edged sword. In other words, constitutionalization of a “harm principle” could equally have led to challenges by public interest groups demanding that the government criminalize conduct that the group considers potentially injurious to society. Did we even need a “harm principle” to be enshrined within section 7 of the Charter? Ironically, prior to the majority’s decision in the trilogy of marijuana cases, the general balancing approach which the Supreme Court of Canada had recognized and applied, would have been reasonably well-suited to the task. Unfortunately, in the course of losing the battle to establish a firm footing for the “harm principle”, the appellants in the marijuana cases seem to also have severely narrowed the scope of substantive review afforded by previously decided cases...|$|R

40|$|The 8 th annual Ethics ConferenceRaphael Alvira {{reminds us}} that {{originally}} Economics meant the law or norm of the house or simply “household management”; whose other names are (oikia, domus, Haus). He also {{suggests that there are}} three elements that form the basis of the family institution: namely, family intimacy, education and economics. Every state is a community and every community is established with a view to some good. The state itself is made up of many communities. Since therefore all people and all communities associate for the sake of some good, and the state is the highest community embracing all the other unities, then this self-sufficing state must aim at the highest good and its origin must be a union of those who cannot exist without each other; namely, of male and female, that the race may continue. From this first natural union follows other types of associations such as that of parent-child and master-servant and associations of friendships until the highest which is the self-sufficing community. Gary Stanley Becker, who was honoured with the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1992, wrote a book called Human Capital in 1975. He reminded us that when we think of capital we associate it with money in the bank or capital stock or steel plants. We forget that good parental instruction, schooling, expenditures on medical care, begetting children and lectures on the virtues of punctuality and honesty are capital too and they improve health, raise earnings, and their good effects continue with a person throughout their life time. They are therefore capital just as much as the others and even more important. Suffice it to say that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> here <b>would</b> easily attribute the best of our life’s learning to our parents or guardians. Modern economic theory nevertheless seems unconscious {{of the importance of the}} family institution. In its place is another rationale that has substituted it; sometimes positively and at times negatively affecting the family. Our thesis in this presentation is that economics as a discipline needs to embrace the reality of the natural society called ‘family’. Without good, stable and well managed families, economics lacks the firm foundation for stability and market growth...|$|R

6000|$|And yet, alas! {{we cannot}} use in our days, that which {{eighteen}} {{hundred years ago}} was the most simple and obvious test of our Lord's truthfulness, namely His miraculous powers. The folly and sin of man have robbed <b>us</b> <b>of</b> what is, as it were, one of the natural rights of reasoning, man. Lying prodigies and juggleries, forged and pretended miracles, even--oh, shame!--imitations <b>of</b> His <b>most</b> sacred wounds, have, up to our own time, made all rational men more and more afraid of aught which seems to savour of the miraculous; till <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I think, <b>would</b> have to ask forgiveness--as I myself should have to ask,--if, tantalized and insulted again and again by counterfeit miracles, we failed to recognise real miracles, and Him who performed them. Therefore, for good or evil, we should be driven back upon that test alone, which, after all, perhaps, is the most sure {{as well as the}} most convincing--the moral test- -the test of character. What manner of personage would He be did He condescend to appear among <b>us?</b> <b>Of</b> that, thank God, the Gospels ought to leave us in no doubt. What acts He might condescend to perform, what words He might condescend to speak, it is not for such beings as we to guess.

Should we see in Him an utterly ideal personage--The Son of Man, and therefore, ere we lost sight of Him once more, the Son <b>of</b> God? Let <b>us</b> think. First, therefore, we must believe that--as in Judea of old--Christ would meet men with all consideration and courtesy. He would not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax. He would not strive, nor cry, nor let His voice be heard in the streets. He would not cause any of God's little ones to offend, to stumble. In plain words, He would not shock and repel them by any conduct of His. Therefore, as in Judea of old, He would be careful of, even indulgent to, the usages of society, {{as long as they were}} innocent. He would never outrage the code of manners, however imperfect, however conventional, which this or any other civilised nation may have agreed on, to express and keep up respect, self-restraint, delicacy, of man toward man, of man toward woman, of the young ward the old, of the living toward the dead.
