40|$|We {{demonstrate}} an amplitude-based micro-displacement sensor {{that uses}} a plastic photonic bandgap Bragg fiber with one end coated with a silver layer. The reflection intensity of the Bragg fiber is characterized in response to different displacements (or bending curvatures). We note that the Bragg reflector of the fiber acts as an efficient <b>mode</b> <b>stripper</b> for the wavelengths {{near the edge of}} the fiber bandgap, which makes the sensor extremely sensitive to bending or displacements at these wavelengths. Besides, by comparison of the Bragg fiber sensor to a sensor based on a regular multimode fiber with similar outer diameter and length, we find that the Bragg fiber sensor is more sensitive to bending due to presence of <b>mode</b> <b>stripper</b> in the form of the multilayer reflector. Experimental results show that the minimum detection limit of the Bragg fiber sensor can be smaller than 5 um for displacement sensing...|$|E
40|$|One of {{interesting}} properties of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) is their possibility to be single-moded {{over a wide}} wavelength range, down to UV, while still having a reasonably large modal profile. Such properties are attractive for applications like optical sensing, interferometry, and transport of white light. PCFs, which is designed specially for such property are known as the endlessly single-mode (ESM-) PCFs [1]. However, the ESM property requires the holey cladding of a PCF to have a small air-filling factor. Such a requirement indeed creates problems for PCF manufacturers, as it does not go in harmony with other equally important properties of the PCF. A small air filling factor implies large leakage loss. So, the characteristics of commercially available ESM-PCFs, in fact come out from compromises between the desirable endlessly-single-modeness and the low leakage loss properties. Hence, {{depending on the type}} of applications, the term ESM itself could mislead its users, if the endlessly single modeness is presumed without proper precautions. In this work, using a vectorial finite-element leaky mode solver published recently [2], several dominant leaky modes of a commercial ESM-PCF [3] were investigated. Although the leakage loss of the fundamental mode is already 6 orders lower (on a dB/unit-length scale) than that of the nearest higher order modes, the leakage losses of these higher order modes are still quite low, which might still be significant, especially for short wavelength and short fiber-length applications. In addition to the ordinary-fiber-like hybrid core modes, the existence and significance of unusual modes like cladding-resonance modes and core-cladding-resonance modes were also numerically observed. Based on the loss discrimination between the most dominant and the nearest higher order mode, we set-up a criterion for the single-modeness. Using that measure, we verified the single-modeness of the corresponding ESM-PCF and found that the endlessly single-modeness is valid only for a relatively long fiber, typical of local area network applications. This finding implies that applications employing short fiber-length, working in short wavelength regimes, should be prepared for significant effects of the higher order modes, e. g. by employing a <b>mode</b> <b>stripper</b> to suppress their effects. We suggest that ESM-PCF for short fiber-length applications need to be designed differently from those for long fiber-length applications. References [1]. 	T. A. Birks, J. C. Knight, and P. S. J.

40|$|Traditionally the {{precision}} placement and adhesion of optical fiber to an optical planar substrate {{has been made}} through use of solder, glass frit, glues or epoxies. These generally have disadvantages that include mechanical weakness in harsh environments (e. g. high temperature, high pressure and exposure to common solvents) and poor optical characteristics (e. g. high optical loss, high scattering and modal/refractive index mismatch with optical fiber). In this work we shall present an approach that overcomes these disadvantages, through embedding and consolidating a fiber directly upon a planar substrate layer using Flame Hydrolysis Deposition (FHD). The result is a planarized composite that is mechanically robust in harsh environments and is of planar optical quality. The deposited silica layers can be tailored in thickness, refractive index and anisotropic stress, with the ability for multiple layers to be deposited sequentially to achieve planar guiding. The technique is compatible with a lithography toolset allowing full planar integration techniques; physical micromachining capability allowing fiber evanescent field access and Bragg grating writing. The components that can be developed using this technique include precision layer-up fiber (e. g. high density fiber packing, precision fiber lengths and delay lines), hybrid fiber-planar devices (e. g. MOEMS, evanescent field sensors and environmentally stabilised narrow line lasers) and optical pump schemes (e. g. fiber pumping, pump <b>strippers</b> and <b>mode</b> <b>strippers).</b> We shall report {{the latest developments in}} fabrication, capability and component...|$|R
40|$|The PhD activity, {{from which}} this thesis is taken, has been aimed at the design and {{development}} of optical components and subsystems for industrial and biomedical laser applications. Industrial-grade high-power laser market, traditionally dominated by gas and solid state lasers, is currently being revolutionized by two new devices, namely fiber and direct diode lasers, which are partly competing and partly complementary. On the one hand, Fiber Lasers (FLs) make use of rare-earth doped specialty fibers to converted the radiation from semiconductor laser modules (the "pump" source) into a high quality beam at an another wavelength; their strong point is the brightness enhancement, although at the expenses of the conversion efficiency. On the other hand, Direct Diode Lasers (DDLs) rely on the combination of semiconductor laser chips, {{similar to those used}} as pump for FLs, to achieve kilowatt-range output power, which is then delivered to the piece under treatment without the need of further conversion or processing; their strong point is the wall-plug efficiency, while the beam quality is typically low. Different applications may privilege one or the other technological approach: for instance, metal sheet cutting and industrial additive manufacturing from metal powders are more suited for FLs, whereas welding and brazing for DDLs. The first part of the PhD activity have been devoted to the design and development of high power laser systems, yielding to the all-fiber realization of a 600 W single-mode Yb-doped FL module and 500 W to 2000 W low-brightness DDLs. First, different architectural solutions have been investigated and optimized, considering feasibility issues, energy consumption and overall ownership costs. Then, key fiber components, such as fused fiber combiners, cladding <b>mode</b> <b>strippers</b> and laser end-caps, which are usually not commercially available being too dependent on the fiber characteristics and other application related constraints, have been designed fabricated and tested. These devices have been later used to assemble demonstrators of fiber and direct diode laser systems for industrial applications. The implemented FL has reached ~ 600 W of nearly single-modeoutput, with Beam Parameter Product (BPP) less than 0. 54 mm mrad. As for the DDL case, two demonstrators (~ 500 W power with BPP 44. 4 mm mrad and ~ 2 kW power with laser BPP 66. 5 mm mrad) have been realized and engineered. In all the cases, the output power has been limited to available diodes only. The second part of the PhD, and thus of the thesis, has been focused on the laser application in the biomedical field, and in particular to the laser ablation of solid tumors in liver and pancreas. Innovative applicators for laser tumor ablation with customized beam irradiation pattern and integrated all-optical temperature sensing capabilities have been designed and manufactured. The prototypes have been validated in liver phantoms (e. g. agar jelly and porcine livers), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solution and encourage further developments toward clinical applications. It is important to highlight that during the PhD the entire chain from design to manufacturing, to applications, has been explored and this has allowed acquiring new skills in different areas, not strictly limited to the main topic of the thesi...|$|R
40|$|Allergan {{constructed}} and is operating a unique biological {{system designed to}} reduce emissions of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as well as acetone and heptane from intaocular lens manufacturing operations. The exhaust gases from the manufacturing facility are passed through a pair of wet scrubbers, in series, that allow mass transfer of the IPA from air to water. The original design called for packed towers {{to be used to}} partially biochemically oxidize the emissions. This design was changed after three months, due to fouling problems, to simply a water <b>stripper</b> <b>mode</b> of operation. Then, the water stream is passed through a fixed film bioreactor to reduce the final concentration of IPA and other emissions to less than 99 % of the total inlet concentration. The inlet concentrations treated by the system ranged from 200 to 500 mg/m 3 at a flow rate of 5000 cfm. On average, the system treated approximately 12 gallons per day of IPA and lesser amounts of acetone and heptane. The system is a closed system and only requires the addition of bacteria and nutrients on a periodic basis. Sludge is removed periodically. The system was started on May 18, 1997 and went through a startup validation which was completed in December of 1997. The operational data is presented along with the method of startup and methods to overcome adverse operating conditions. The system from two weeks after startup has maintained an IPA removal efficiency of greater than 99 %. Nutrient loading and pH adjustment have been fine tuned during the startup validation period. The system has proved to be as economical as first described in a previous paper as compared to other control devices such as catalytic thermal oxidation...|$|R
40|$|Siemens Corporate Technology New Technology Fields Healthcare & Technology Concepts (CT NTF HTC) have {{proposed}} a novel electrostatic accelerator for nuclear medicine which aims at gradients of up to 10 MV m - 1. With beam currents of 100 μA at ≈ 10 MeV it might replace cyclotrons whilst being simpler, more reliable and more cost effective. The accelerator concept consists of concentric hemispherical metallic shells spaced by insulators {{and placed in a}} vacuum system. The shells are interconnected by high voltage diodes so that they form a voltage multiplier with its highest voltage in its centre. Particle beams can be accelerated towards the centre through a set of holes in the shells. In tandem <b>mode,</b> with a <b>stripper</b> in the centre and a negative ion source as injector, beams of twice the centre voltage can be achieved. This thesis presents several commissioning milestones of a test system for the novel electrostatic accelerator, thus validating the concept for commercial applications. An inter shell insulator has been designed and successfully tested to fields of 12 MV m - 1. A diode protection concept has been devised and validated in realistic breakdown scenarios. An AC drive system including control software has been developed, delivering a sinusoidal input voltage of up to 140 kV peak to peak at 80 kHz. An automatic process to carefully commission the high voltage system in vacuum has been created, implemented in a control system and successfully operated. A 4 -shell prototype with these components has been successfully tested with achieved gradients of up to 5. 5 MV m - 1. A negative hydrogen ion source has been constructed, commissioned and characterised with a purposely developed wire grid. Beam currents beyond 200 μA have been achieved. Beam transport from the ion source through the 7 -shell system has been demonstrated in simulations which are based on experimental data from the ion source characterisation. A stripper system has been designed and constructed. This thesis is not currently available in ORA. The author reserves all rights.
