50|$|A <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> payer {{can also}} pay <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> using the GST ratio option. This {{is based on}} what your {{previous}} year’s residual tax liability was and what your GST Taxable supplies were for that year. You then apply this percentage to your current period GST return. Under this option you pay <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> {{at the same time}} as you pay GST.|$|R
50|$|If a {{taxpayer}} {{does not pay}} enough <b>provisional</b> <b>tax,</b> it may be charged IRD interest (also known as use of money interest). On the other hand, if it pays too much <b>provisional</b> <b>tax,</b> it may receive an interest credit. The use of money interest rate for underpayments is higher than that applying to overpayments. In some cases, the underpayment rate is higher than {{a taxpayer}}’s borrowing rate.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} method {{is the most}} common method. However a <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> payer can choose to estimate their <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> payments. Estimation allows the business owner to pay less or more tax depending on how they think their business is performing. Any underpayment is subject to interest, and no interest is paid on over payment, so it is important that they estimate their profit accurately.|$|R
50|$|Both overpaid and underpaid <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> have {{financial}} consequences. Overpaid <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> {{results in}} money that a taxpayer could use in its business being tied up at IRD {{at a cost}} to the taxpayer. Underpaid provisional means a taxpayer is faced with an unexpected interest cost on top of its liability. Many taxpayers consider the overpayment interest rate does not adequately compensate them and the interest charged on underpayments is too high.|$|R
50|$|Tax pooling allows New Zealand {{taxpayers to}} pool their <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> {{payments}} {{together in an}} account held by a registered tax pooling intermediary at Inland Revenue (IRD) so that underpayments by some can be offset by overpayments of others. Taxpayers receive/pay an interest rate that is higher/lower than IRD’s rates if they overpay/underpay <b>provisional</b> <b>tax.</b> Intermediaries operate under legislation {{set out in the}} Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994.|$|R
50|$|Officials {{acknowledged}} that the <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> rules resulted in uncertainty for taxpayers because they assume taxpayers can correctly forecast their income for the year.|$|R
50|$|Often {{the amount}} of income tax a {{taxpayer}} must pay is uncertain as <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> payments are based on an estimation of annual profit.|$|R
50|$|This {{arrangement}} {{allows a}} taxpayer {{to pay an}} upcoming instalment of <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> at a date {{in the future that}} suits them. The taxpayer pays an upfront finance fee and a tax pooling intermediary makes a date-stamped deposit equal to the amount financed into its tax pool account on behalf of the taxpayer on the <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> date. The taxpayer then pays the intermediary at the agreed upon date in the future and the intermediary arranges the tax deposit to be transferred from its tax pool to the taxpayer’s IRD account.|$|R
50|$|A <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> payer is {{a person}} or a company that had a {{residual}} income tax of more than $2500 in the previous financial year. There are three options for paying provisional tax; standard method, estimated method and GST Ratio option.|$|R
50|$|Taxpayers in New Zealand with {{an income}} tax {{liability}} of more than $2500 for the previous year {{may have to pay}} <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> the following year. This usually happens if they earn income without having tax deducted during the year.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, IRD {{issued a}} {{discussion}} document explaining proposed {{changes to the}} New Zealand <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> system. The document stated that while the new safe harbour threshold would reduce the impact of use of money interest on taxpayers, they could continue to using tax pooling to make their payments.|$|R
50|$|Rather than pay <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> {{directly}} to IRD, a taxpayer deposits money {{with a tax}} pooling intermediary on its three <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> dates. The tax pooling intermediary deposits each payment into its tax pooling account at IRD. The taxpayer’s deposits are date-stamped and recorded in the intermediary’s tax pool registry. The taxpayer can use the deposits held in the pool on its behalf to settle their income tax liabilities once it has finalised its income tax return. Funds remain in the intermediary’s tax pool account at IRD until instruction is received from the taxpayer to transfer the deposits into the taxpayer’s own IRD account. Once processed by IRD, the taxpayer’s IRD statement will show the tax pool transfers at the original date of the deposit, satisfying the taxpayer’s liability.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, when IRD {{publicly}} {{raised the}} possibility of trading <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> payments as a means of reducing exposure to use of money interest, Ian engaged with IRD officials by helping to write legislation and come up with an actual system that would bring together taxpayers, an independent intermediary and IRD.|$|R
50|$|A {{depositing}} taxpayer who has overpaid at one <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> {{date and}} underpaid at another can swap tax between these dates (or with another depositing taxpayer) to even out payments to either increase or {{reduce the amount}} of interest payable or receivable. A tax swap is a combination of a tax sale and a tax purchase.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the year}} the {{business}} files a tax return (due on the following 7 July for businesses with a tax year ending 31 March) and any under or overpayment is then calculated. Tax pooling was introduced in 2003 to remove some of the worry associated with estimating <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> payments by allowing businesses to pool their payments together so the underpayments by some can be offset by the overpayments of others to reduce/enhance the interest they pay/receive.|$|R
50|$|The tax is payable {{directly}} by the taxpayer, who is also obliged to remit <b>provisional</b> salaries <b>tax</b> by instalments based on the previous year's liability.|$|R
50|$|A {{depositing}} taxpayer who has excess tax remaining {{once it has}} transferred what {{it needs}} from the tax pool to satisfy its own liability can earn {{a higher rate of}} interest on their overpayment than it would receive from IRD by selling the surplus tax it has at each of its <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> dates to another taxpayer who has underpaid at those dates. The underpayer can reduce the interest payable on its underpaid income tax when it purchases this surplus tax to meet its own liability.|$|R

The population bases used to compute rates for 1979 and 1980 were the same as those used for the monthly series published in Vol. 29, nos. 1 - 12 and, therefore, are not consistent with estimates based on the 1980 census enumeration (see Technical notes) ...|$|R

40|$|Income {{variability}} {{is one of}} {{the serious}} disadvantages of farming. It makes it difficult to organize farm development wisely and upsets the farm family's standard of living. In the past there have been boom years when farmers have spent wastefully to prevent windfall gains being lost to the farm in taxation. In years of low farm income {{it may be difficult to}} carry on a development plan started in better times and thus not exploit past investment. Moreover few farming families have the liquid reserves to see them over bad seasons and it is customary for banks and stock and station agents to carry their clients over bad seasons. Farmers have to "draw their horns in" too. Development ceases, holidays are foregone, and teenage children may be brought home from boarding school following a difficult season. In the past New Zealand agricultural policy has aimed to reduce the fluctuations in farm income. The guaranteed price for butterfat and the floor price for wool are examples of policy aimed at reducing price fluctuations and the drought relief scheme is an example ameliorating the results of technical uncertainty. The Income Tax Assessment Act of 1957 which introduced the pay-as-you-earn method of paying income tax encourages a system which increases rather than decreases the variation in post-tax income a reversal of previous policy. The Act provided for provisional and terminal taxation. Terminal taxation is the difference between the <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> paid in the previous year and the tax which should have been paid. This annual square up, which can be a refund of an overpayment or a demand for underpayment, adds extra variation to a farmer's post-tax income compared with the method of tax assessment before 1957. The Tax Department and accountants encourage farmers to base, <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> on the previous year's income and this, in conjunction with terminal tax, results in three years' income having an influence post-tax income as will be explained later. While farmers and other businessmen are well aware of the adverse effects on post-tax income variation of <b>provisional</b> and terminal <b>tax,</b> the author has, not found any quantitative investigational work done in this field. Consequently this paper describes the provisions for paying tax under the existing taxation legislation in New Zealand and outlines some alternative methods. The use of the standard deviation as a measure of income variability is described. Then follows a case study in which the implications of these taxation methods are evaluated using pre-tax incomes from Lincoln College's Ashley Dene farm over a 16 year period. Finally, general analytical methods are developed for calculating the variance of post-tax income. These methods treat pre-tax income as a random variable. This makes it possible to predict the standard deviation of post-tax income under a wide range of conditions and to draw more general conclusions than is possible from a case study...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Taxation) One of the {{canons of}} context {{requires}} that a liability {{will be in}} 1986 :para 4. 47). taxation is certainty. "Certainty taxpayer be reasonably certain of what any given set of circumstances" (Margo in this his tax Report, It is submitted that, at present, {{there is not the}} desired certainty regarding the treatment of unrealised foreign exchange differences. This is proven by the internal memorandum circularised by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, advising local Receivers of Revenue to put on hold all income tax returns with unrealised foreign exchange losses and all objections to the disallowance of these losses until such time that it has, in consultation with professional bodies, been able to establish an acceptable solution to the problem (Commissioner for Inland Revenue, n. d.). No finality has been reached to date and uncertainty therefore still prevails {{on either side of the}} fence, resulting in losses to both parties. As a result of the Commissioner's instruction not to assess income tax returns with foreign exchange differences, Revenue suffers significant losses from a cash flow point of view. This is because a taxpayer is entitled to base his first and second <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> payment for a particular tax year on his "basic amount", this being his taxable income or assessed loss for the last tax year for which he has been assessed. For many affected taxpayers, this is their 1984 tax year in respect of which they reported a considerably lower taxable income than for their last year of assessment. This means that their first two <b>provisional</b> <b>tax</b> payments in respect of a particular tax year can be extremely low in comparison to their taxable income for their last year of assessment. There are also quite a few taxpayers who had an assessed loss for their 1984 tax year who are therefore not required to make a payment at all. It follows, therefore, that Revenue could improve its cash flow position by not allowing assessments to fall too far in arrears. Conversely, disallowance response to pay tax on purposes. taxpayers lose where they have objected to the of their foreign exchange losses and are still awaiting a their objections as, in the meantime, they will have to the basis that the losses are not deductible for tax The direct effect of the disallowance of unrealised foreign exchange losses would be that the after tax cost of borrowings from abroad would be unacceptably high, thus creating a bias towards local borrowing. In a country in dire need of foreign capital, this situation is obviously totally undesirable...|$|R

40|$|Kalmia KnielCadmium is a {{heavy metal}} that is both {{abundant}} and naturally occurring in the environment. It is found in soils and can be taken up by some crops and animals, which eventually accumulates in the food chain. Cocoa products are particularly susceptible to increased exposure to cadmium as they naturally take up more of the nutrients in soils than many other plants. Cadmium toxicity {{could lead to a}} variety of negative health effects including renal tubular dysfunction, disruption in calcium metabolism and osteomalacia. For this reason, a <b>Provisional</b> <b>Monthly</b> Tolerable Intake of 25 micrograms/kg body weight (1. 75 mg per 70 kg person per month) has been established. To assess the levels of cadmium in cocoa products currently on the U. S. market, 249 samples were tested and analyzed for their average parts per million over several parameters. There was a positive correlation between the percentage of cocoa solids in each product and the amount of cadmium typically found. The highest average amounts of cadmium based upon the form of product were found in the powdered products at 0. 842 parts per million. By region, the products from the African region generally had the lowest amounts of cadmium at 0. 098 parts per million compared to Latin American sourcing which held the highest averages at 0. 695 parts per million. Addition of ingredients like sweeteners, dairy products and flavoring agents to cocoa make the products more palatable and dilute the amount of cadmium in these products by lowering the percent cacao. By creating limits on the maximum levels of cadmium in chocolate products specific to one country or region, the international market detracts from the needs of singular countries because it impedes fair global trade and favors exclusion of certain areas of the global market. Cadmium levels in cocoa products should be examined with the potential health benefits in mind. By doing such, it is fair to assume that cocoa products are safe in moderation. Human bodies are self-regulating which make them similar to the environment as they both fluctuate with the levels of their nutrients, and only in extreme cases of imbalance are there detrimental effects on their health. This being said, regulating and monitoring these imbalances is extremely important to provide maximal public health protection. Food Scienc...|$|R
