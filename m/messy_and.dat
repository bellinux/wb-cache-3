Unlike AI, an emulation wouldn't be able to rapidly expand beyond the size of a human brain. Emulations running at digital speeds would have less intelligence differential vis-à-vis AI and so might more easily control AI.|$|E

Caregivers may need to provide foods or liquids so that self-feeding is possible, or they may need to feed the person with A-T. In general, meals should be completed within approximately 30 minutes. Longer meals may be stressful, interfere with other daily activities, and limit the intake of necessary liquids and nutrients.|$|E

It peaked at No.20 on the Top Independent Albums chart and at No.186 on the Billboard 200. In {{his review of}} the album, Johnny Loftus wrote [...] "It {{wants to be a}} confrontational megaphone in the ear of conservatives, but Jahred's torrential rhetoric is too <b>messy</b> <b>and</b> blatantly offensive to incite anything but superficial anger, and the music -- though occasionally explosive -- takes a backseat to the ranting." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for Salon magazine, Andrew O'Hehir wrote, [...] "What Soderbergh {{has sought to}} capture here is a grand process of birth and extinguishment, one that {{produced}} a complicated legacy in which John McCain, Barack Obama, and Raúl Castro are still enmeshed. There {{will be plenty of}} time to argue about the film's (or films') political relevance or lack thereof, to call Soderbergh names for this or that historical omission, for this or that ideological error.

500|$|Common {{starlings}} may be kept as pets or as laboratory animals. Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz {{wrote of}} them in his book King Solomon's Ring as [...] "the poor man's dog" [...] and [...] "something to love", because nestlings are easily obtained from the wild and after careful hand rearing they are straightforward to look after. They adapt well to captivity, and thrive on a diet of standard bird feed and mealworms. Several birds may be kept in the same cage, and their inquisitiveness makes them easy to train or study. The only disadvantages are their <b>messy</b> <b>and</b> indiscriminate defecation habits {{and the need to}} take precautions against diseases that may be transmitted to humans. As a laboratory bird, the common starling is second in numbers only to the domestic pigeon.|$|E

500|$|The album's title also {{evolves into}} a {{reference}} to the political corruption and general social mistrust pervading contemporary Colombian society. The album cover features a photo of her, soot-covered palms up, caught with her hands dirty. Shakira explained the cover, saying, [...] "rom that point of view, we all have stolen at one time or another, myself included. The dirty hands [...] represent the shared guilt. No one is completely clean, in the end we are all accomplices". In keeping with her increasingly rocker sound, for this album she left her hair loose and <b>messy</b> <b>and</b> filled it up with little colorful braids, looking like a [...] "modern Medusa" [...] according to biographer Ximena Diego. Following the album's commercial success, girls from several countries were copying Shakira's style, colorfully braiding their hair and wearing friendship bracelets.|$|E
500|$|Empire Kim Newman {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars. He said Saw is styled like early David Fincher films and [...] "boasts an {{intricate}} structure - complex flashbacks-within-flashbacks explain how the characters have come to this crisis - and a satisfying mystery to go with its ghastly claustrophobia." [...] He ended his review saying, [...] "As good an all-out, non-camp horror movie as we've had lately." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B minus, calling it [...] "derivative and <b>messy</b> <b>and</b> too nonsensical for its own good." [...] He described Jigsaw's intent as [...] "to show you the serial killer lurking inside yourself." [...] Gleiberman criticized Elwes' performance by saying, [...] " [...] ought to be featured in a seminar on the perils of overacting." [...] Daniel M. Kimmel of the Telegram & Gazette called it [...] "one of the most loathsome films this critic has seen in more than 20 years on the job." ...|$|E
500|$|In its year end {{review of}} albums {{released}} in 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Rebel Heart at number 45 noting: [...] "How {{did it take}} this long for Madonna to write herself a theme song titled 'Unapologetic Bitch'? No apologies offered or needed—Rebel Heart was the queen's finest album in a decade, picking up the disco-stick baton of her 2005 Confessions on a Dance Floor as Madonna voyages back into the groove and reflects on where she's been lately". It was also listed at number six on its ranking of the 20 Best Pop Albums of 2015. Similarly, in its year end review, Spin magazine listed the album at number 21 as Andrew Unterberger noted that: [...] "For most artists who spent whole decades defining the mainstream, titling an album Rebel Heart would seem misguided at best, but for Madonna, it's truer now than ever: A fifty-something refusing to bend to public demands about how she should age gracefully... is as big an act of defiance as you can stage in contemporary pop music". AllMusic called Rebel Heart {{as one of their}} Favorite Pop Albums of 2015, describing it as: [...] "Bold, <b>messy,</b> <b>and</b> life-affirming record that finds Madonna simultaneously looking forward and back".|$|E

500|$|Peter Bradshaw, in {{his review}} for The Guardian, wrote, [...] "Perhaps it will even come {{to be seen as}} this director's flawed masterpiece: enthralling but {{structurally}} fractured—the second half is much clearer and more sure-footed than the first—and at times frustratingly reticent, unwilling to attempt any insight into Che's interior world". In his less favorable review for Esquire, Stephen Garrett criticized the film for failing to show Guevara's negative aspects, [...] "the absence of darker, more contradictory revelations of his nature leaves Che bereft of complexity. All that remains is a South American superman: uncomplex, pure of heart, defiantly pious and boring". Richard Corliss had problems with Del Toro's portrayal of Guevara: [...] "Del Toro—whose acting style often starts over the top and soars from there, like a hang-glider leaping from a skyscraper roof—is muted, yielding few emotional revelations, seemingly sedated here ... Che is defined less by his rigorous fighting skills and seductive intellect than by his asthma". In his review for Salon.com, Andrew O'Hehir praised Soderbergh for making [...] "something that people will be eager to see and eager to talk about all over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something <b>messy</b> <b>and</b> unfinished and amazing. I'd be surprised if Che doesn't win the Palme d'Or ... but be that as it may, nobody who saw it here will ever forget it".|$|E

The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Jasper Tsang, said: [...] "the China Central Television (CCTV) report [...] {{did not seem to be}} able to calm the public. As the case drags on, there will be more speculation". Human Rights Watch was quoted as saying: [...] "Given that Gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado, in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility". The Washington Post said: [...] "The narrative seems <b>messy</b> <b>and</b> incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even". Amnesty International’s China researcher cast doubt on the narrative, asking: [...] "Why would four other employees of a company need to go missing in order to assist with a regular criminal case? How could other missing or otherwise investigated colleagues of Gui Minhai have any connection to the case?" [...] The Guardian drew a connection to Operation Fox Hunt, a Chinese government campaign launched by Xi Jinping in 2014 to repatriate corrupt officials or opponents of the regime who had fled abroad, and which may also have been responsible for the abduction of the other missing booksellers. By mid-June 2016, Gui's family had not yet received official confirmation that he was under detention, according to Gui's daughter.|$|E

[...] Following China Central Television's release of videotaped confessions from Gui Minhai – and of Swedish NGO staffer Peter Dahlin, Reporters Without Borders condemned China's [...] "dissemination of forced 'confessions' that have no informational value". The organisation urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for [...] "knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress".

[...] Philip Sherburne wrote in Spin magazine that Artpop gets [...] "a lot artier" [...] with [...] "Venus".

[...] John Walker of MTV Buzzworthy called the song [...] "crazy, otherwordly, barely intelligible sense, but still — sense!" [...] Bradley Stern of MuuMuse described [...] "Venus" [...] as [...] "a track just weird and stupid and <b>messy</b> <b>and</b> catchy enough to work."

A few days later, Suzanne, with Darren's help, gives birth to twins Jack and Francine. Dawson said that at first, Darren chooses to be in denial about it wants nothing to do with Suzanne because {{he does not want to}} lose Nancy. Dawson noted that the birth of Darren's babies is <b>messy</b> <b>and</b> surprising. Darren finds himself in a situation he never expected when he has to deliver the babies and accept responsibility for them. Dawson stated, [...] "I think it's a moment where Darren changes a little bit". Dawson added that Darren does [...] "step up to the mark" [...] and [...] "matures very quickly". Dawson felt that Darren enjoys being a father and it gives him a [...] "purpose in life" [...] which he has never had before. Dawson explained that Darren usually thinks of himself but is now thinking of the babies. E4, regarding Darren becoming a father, commented that due to his previous antics, he would not be an ideal candidate for [...] "Father of the year".

500|$|The 1992 {{animated}} series {{introduced the}} Joker's female sidekick: Harley Quinn, {{a psychiatrist who}} falls for—and ends up in an abusive relationship with—the Joker, becoming his supervillain accomplice. The character was popular, and was adapted into the comics as the Joker's romantic interest in 1999. In the same year, Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle's comic book Anarky concluded with the revelation that the titular character was the Joker's son. Breyfogle conceived the idea {{as a means to}} expand on Anarky's characterization, but O'Neil (by then the editor for the Batman series of books) was opposed to it, and only allowed it to be written under protest, and with a promise that the revelation would eventually be revealed incorrect. However, the Anarky series was cancelled before the rebuttal could be published. The Joker's first major storyline in The New 52, DC Comics' 2011 reboot of story continuity, was 2012's [...] "Death of the Family" [...] by writer Scott Snyder and artist Greg Capullo. The story arc explores the symbiotic relationship between Joker and Batman, and sees the villain shatter the trust between Batman and his adopted family. Capullo's Joker design replaced his traditional outfit with a utilitarian, <b>messy,</b> <b>and</b> disheveled appearance to convey that the character was on a mission; his face (surgically removed in 2011's Detective Comics #1) was reattached with belts, wires, and hooks, and he was outfitted with mechanics overalls.
