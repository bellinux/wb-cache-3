50|$|In its liquid form, {{cyanoacrylate}} {{consists of}} monomers of cyanoacrylate molecules. <b>Methyl-2-cyanoacrylate</b> (CH2=C(CN)COOCH3 or C5H5NO2) has a molecular weight equal to 111.1, a flashpoint of 79 °C, and a density of 1.1 g/ml. Ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate (C6H7NO2) has a molecular weight equal to 125 and a flashpoint of >75 °C. To facilitate easy handling, a cyanoacrylate adhesive is frequently formulated with an ingredient such as fumed silica {{to make it}} more viscous or gel-like. More recently, formulations are available with additives to increase shear strength, creating a more impact resistant bond. Such additives may include rubber, as in Loctite's Ultra Gel, or others which are not specified.|$|E
50|$|Cyanoacrylate is {{the generic}} name for {{cyanoacrylate}} based fast-acting glues such as <b>methyl-2-cyanoacrylate,</b> ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (commonly sold under trade names like Superglue and Krazy Glue) and n-butyl-cyanoacrylate. Skin glues like Indermil and Histoacryl {{were the first}} medical grade tissue adhesives to be used, and these are composed of n-butyl cyanoacrylate. These worked well but had the disadvantage of having to be stored in the refrigerator, were exothermic so they stung the patient, and the bond was brittle. Nowadays, the longer chain polymer, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, is the preferred medical grade glue. It is available under various trade names, such as LiquiBand, SurgiSeal, FloraSeal, and Dermabond. These have the advantages of being more flexible, making a stronger bond, and being easier to use. The longer side chain types, for example octyl and butyl forms, also reduce tissue reaction.|$|E
5000|$|Semi-permanent lashes, {{also known}} as {{individual}} eyelash extensions, are eyelashes applied with an adhesive which is usually cyanoacrylate. There are different types of cyanoacrylates including ethyl, methyl, butyl, and octyl, which are designed for bonding to different surfaces. Lash adhesives are made from <b>methyl-2-cyanoacrylate</b> {{which is designed to}} bond a smooth surface (the eyelash extension) to a porous surface (the natural eyelash). it is designed to be used around the eyes and on the natural lashes, but not on the skin as it may cause irritation.Eyelash extensions are waterproof and give the appearance of having mascara on without the messy clumps and smudging of makeup. Generally, a single lash is applied to each natural lash. When applied properly, neither the extension lash nor the glue should touch the eyelid. The bond is designed to last until the lashes naturally fall out, usually around 3-4 weeks new lash growth will need to be bonded, making lash extensions a regular monthly service if one wishes to maintain the full look.|$|E
