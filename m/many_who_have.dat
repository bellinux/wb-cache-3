25|$|Cottrell {{also claimed}} that disciplining of ordained ministers due to {{theology}} was inconsistent – that one may believe Christ was a created being, legalism or works-oriented salvation, or the non-literalness of the Genesis creation account without losing their credentials; yet lists <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{lost their jobs}} regarding the investigative judgment.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} college {{students}} (n = 80) by Goldsmith and Freyd report that <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> experienced emotional abuse do not characterise the mistreatment as abusive. Additionally, Goldsmith and Freyd show that these people also tend to exhibit higher than average rates of alexithymia (difficulty identifying and processing their own emotions).|$|E

25|$|Esperanto and Interlingua are {{fundamentally}} different in their purposes. Whereas Esperanto {{is meant to}} be an international second language able to be fluently learned by speakers of any language, Interlingua is directed more toward European languages, especially its control languages. Though Esperanto may be more neutral as well as easier to master, Esperantists can usually communicate only with other Esperantists, though the language is at least somewhat comprehensible to <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not studied it; Interlingua, however, is intended to be understood to some extent by a speaker of any Romance language, because many words in Interlingua resemble their originals in Latin, the precursor to all Romance languages.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{group is}} the “afromexicanos” or Afro-Mexicans who are concentrated in the Costa Chica region. This group is found in Guerrero and the Costa Chica area of Oaxaca. This group has been relatively isolated {{from the rest of}} Mexico, with little modernization or formal education. To this day, there are <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> no birth certificates or know how to read or write. Much of the history of these people is preserved in oral tradition. Historically, afromexicanos have been discriminated against and marginalized. Even among these people today, the concept of being “negro” is considered bad and a number take to skin-lightening methods. The musical style associated with the group is “chilena ” which became popular outside of Guerrero and Oaxaca after the 1960s. One of these songs, “Soy negro de la Costa…,” has been preserved by CONACULTA and INAH as part of Mexico’s cultural heritage. A major change for this community came with the building of the highway connecting Acapulco with Pinotepa Nacional and Puerto Escondido, which opened it up to the outside world. This allowed the shipping of goods and influx of people. The increase in people and contacts led to the building of schools.|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{bypass surgery}} has an {{emotional}} and physiological {{impact on the}} individual. <b>Many</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> undergone the surgery suffer from depression in the following months {{as a result of}} a change in the role food plays in their emotional well-being. Strict limitations on the diet can place great emotional strain on the patient. Energy levels in the period following the surgery can be low, both due to the restriction of food intake and negative changes in emotional state. It may take as long as three months for emotional levels to rebound. Muscular weakness in the months following surgery is also common. This is caused by a number of factors, including a restriction on protein intake, a resulting loss in muscle mass and decline in energy levels. Muscle weakness may result in balance problems, difficulty climbing stairs or lifting heavy objects, and increased fatigue following simple physical tasks. Many of these issues pass over time as food intake gradually increases. However, the first months following the surgery can be very difficult, an issue not often mentioned by physicians suggesting the surgery. The benefits and risks of this surgery are well established; however, the psychological effects are not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Having {{captured}} Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled. However, {{there were}} <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never left Europe at all. When {{the success of}} the crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope. <b>Many</b> crusaders <b>who</b> <b>had</b> remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, {{there were only a few}} hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of Jerusalem.|$|R

[...] The review objects to the [...] "thick type headings to the subdivision of chapters" [...] which it finds too much like [...] "the 'new journalism'". It concludes by urging readers to compare the book with Darwin's Descent of Man and with Wallace's Darwinism.|$|E
500|$|Veteran dog breeders of {{the times}} were the primary critics of the novel, chastising Terhune's {{depiction}} of an unrealistically perfect collie that would mislead the public into believing such a dog could exist. The anniversary and subsequent editions, featuring a sable-and-white collie, also drew criticism from loyal readers as it did not resemble Lad. New York Times Book Review reviewer Alden Welch felt the full novel would [...] "surely appeal not only to all lovers and masters of dogs, but to <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> never owned any and who have no general and indiscriminate liking for them." [...] He found the stories [...] "interesting" [...] and a [...] "most welcome addition to dog-literature", praising the novel as the most [...] "delightfully written" [...] of Terhune's works to date. In 1968, Sports Illustrateds Robert H. Boyle stated that Terhune's stories were responsible {{for many of the}} active collie breeders at the time getting involved in the sport. Calling the author a [...] "godlike figure" [...] and the hero of [...] "goggle-eyed youngsters of the 1920s, '30s and even into the '40s." [...] In comparing the work to popular collie character Lassie, Boyle noted that rather than having Lassie's seeming immortality, Terhune's dogs [...] "led epic lives and they had epic deaths".|$|E

500|$|As {{numerous}} artists {{recorded it}} {{in a variety}} of styles, [...] "Hoochie Coochie Man" [...] became a blues standard. [...] Janovitz describes the song as [...] "a vital piece of Chicago-style electric blues that links the Delta to rock & roll".

[...] In 1984, Waters' original [...] "I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man" [...] was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame.

King, Buddy Guy, John P. Hammond, the Allman Brothers Band, and Eric Clapton. [...] A Grammy Hall of Fame Award followed in 1998, which [...] "honor recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance". The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the [...] "500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll" [...] recognizes the song's influence on rock. Representatives of the music industry and press voted it number 226 for Rolling Stone magazine's list of the [...] "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".
