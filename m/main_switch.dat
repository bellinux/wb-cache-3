2500|$|The Wylex {{standard}} {{consumer unit}} was {{very popular in}} the United Kingdom until the wiring regulations started demanding residual-current devices (RCDs) for sockets that could feasibly supply equipment outside the equipotential zone. The design {{does not allow for}} fitting of RCDs or RCBOs. [...] Some Wylex standard models were made with an RCD instead of the <b>main</b> <b>switch,</b> but (for consumer units supplying the entire installation) this is no longer compliant with the wiring regulations as alarm systems should not be RCD-protected. [...] There are two styles of fuse base that can be screwed into these units: one designed for rewirable fusewire carriers and one designed for cartridge fuse carriers. Over the years MCBs have been made for both styles of base. In both cases, higher rated carriers had wider pins, so a carrier couldn't be changed for a higher rated one without also changing the base. [...] Cartridge fuse carriers are also now available for DIN-rail enclosures.|$|E

2500|$|The {{previous}} 16th Edition of the IEE Electrical Wiring Regulations required use of RCDs for {{socket outlets}} that were {{liable to be}} used by outdoor appliances. Normal practice in domestic installations [...] was to use a single RCD to cover all the circuits requiring RCD protection (typically sockets and showers) but to have some circuits (typically lighting) not RCD protected. This was to avoid a potentially dangerous loss of lighting should the RCD trip. Protection arrangements for other circuits varied. To implement this arrangement it was common to install a consumer unit incorporating an RCD in what is known as a split load configuration, where one group of circuit breakers is supplied direct from the <b>main</b> <b>switch</b> (or time delay RCD {{in the case of a}} TT earth) and a second group of circuits is supplied via the RCD. This arrangement had the recognised problems that cumulative earth leakage currents from the normal operation of many items of equipment could cause spurious tripping of the RCD, and that tripping of the RCD would disconnect power from all the protected circuits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{auxiliary}} commutation cell for PWM inverters {{that allows the}} <b>main</b> <b>switches</b> to be turned on and off at zero voltage and zero current. The <b>main</b> <b>switches</b> zero current turn-on reduces the unde-sired effects of parasitic inductances related to the cir-cuit layout. The main diodes reverse recovery losses are minimized since di/dt and dv/dt are controlled. The ZCZVT commutation cell is located out of the main power path of the converters and is activated only dur-ing switching transitions. Additionally, the auxiliary switches are turned on and off at ZCS and use the same ground signals of the upper <b>main</b> <b>switches.</b> The com-mutation losses are practically reduced to zero. Soft switching operation is guaranteed for full load range without changes in command strategy. The operation of the ZCZVT PWM full-bridge DC-AC Converter is analyzed and an auxiliary commutation cell design pro-cedure based on the analysis is proposed. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed commutation cell. Artigo submetido em 02 / 05 / 0...|$|R

In particular, self balancing quality and controlling possibility of the DC center potential in the basic ARCPI circuit are investigated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new zero voltage {{switching}} current fed half bridge converter with an auxiliary circuit is proposed. The auxiliary circuit not only absorbs the voltage surge across switches at turn off instance, but also provides zero voltage switching condition for all converter switches.

Since the switches in auxiliary circuit operate under soft switching conditions, these switches don’t apply additional losses to proposed converter.
