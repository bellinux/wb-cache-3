40|$|We propose in this {{contribution}} a new BVP discretization method {{which represents}} the unknown distribution {{as well as its}} derivatives by piecewise constant distributions (PCD) but on distinct meshes. Once the meshes are chosen, it is relatively straightforward to define an approximate variational formulation of the BVP on the associated PCD spaces and hence to derive the discrete equations. We end with the same scheme as the corner <b>mesh</b> <b>box</b> method and we display a precise relation between the exact solution and our approximation, which holds in the absence of absorption. We also compare these results with other approaches using a mixed variational formulation of the same BVP and snaring with our method the use of several meshes.

To achieve robustness in large-scale welding simulations, a dynamic mesh refinement with quadtree and octree data structures was used in the welding region. Accuracy, convergence and efficiency were verified by solving two and three dimensional problems. It is found that the present VPE can successfully simulate the hybrid laser welding process with good accuracy and convergence. The adaptive refined <b>mesh</b> <b>box</b> can synchronously move with the welding heat source, which dramatically reduces the number of field nodes. Compared with the standard FEM,the VPEM requires only approximately 42 % of the total degrees of freedom used in standard FEM for the same accuracy. Furthermore, we compare the computational cost and accuracy of the method to that of the finite element method, the edge based virtual node polygonal element/virtual node method, the edge-based Smoothed Point Interpolation Meshless Method (ES-PIM), the edge-based Element (ES-PIM) the Element Free Galerkin (EFG) method and the Meshless Local Petrove-Galerkin Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) method.

Gabions {{are used in}} many situations including the stabilization of earth movement and erosion, river control, reservoirs, canals refurbishment, landscaping and retaining walls. The main aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the behavior of gabion structure through the development of finite element model of gabion using COMSOL program. The construction of model stages were started with develop numerical model to simulate the behavior (deformation, strain and stress) of single gabion box (20 × 20 × 20) cm, and Compare the result obtained from the model with testing result of the compression tests performed in the laboratory. The second stage included the development of a numerical model to simulate the behavior (deformation, strain,and stress) of a single gabion box model for existing gabion structure using the gabion box (120 × 45 × 45) cm. Finally, a study the mechanical behavior of large scale model of existing gabion structure using the gabion box (120 × 45 × 45) cm was made and deformation results were compared with these obtained from with the actual structure. The result of numerical analysis of model was seen that the results obtained from COMSOL and Physical model have been according reality within the specific range with some of different value including stresses, deformation and strain, this difference was discussed to reach the reason of this variation. Generally, in the small box model (20 × 20 × 20) cm the deformation was record within range (4. 0 to 53. 081 mm), and in box (120 × 45 × 45) cm the deformation was record within range (4 to 11. 011 mm), but in the wall model the deformation was record within range (0 to 0. 1 mm) The studies as a whole are expected to contribute substantially to understand the actual behavior of gabion structure systems with particular reference to efficiency and stability of it.

This class of schemes, {{has been introduced}} by H. B. Keller in 1971 for parabolic problems. In the case of elliptic problems, the basic principle is to average the two continuous equations (conservation and flux) given by the mixed form of the problem, onto the boxes of the <b>mesh.</b> <b>Box</b> schemes belong to the category of so-called mixed Petrov-Galerkin finite volume methods. Indeed, the approximation is performed on the mixed form of the problem, {{with a pair of}} trial spaces different from the pair of test spaces. The trial spaces (for u and ∇ u) are of finite element type and the test spaces are of Galerkin-discontinuous type. The selection of the different spaces functions (trial and test) is difficult, because they have to satisfy the compatibility Babuska-Brezzi condition. However, contrary to other schemes, the method requires an unique mesh. In most of the cases, the scheme is equivalent to a variational formulation in the principal unknow (u) and a local reconstruction of the flux (∇ u). Firstly, I studied the bidimensional mixed form of the Poisson problem with a box scheme on triangular or quadrangular meshes. Stability results and error estimates are given using the finite element theory. A numerical study on several test cases (Matlab code) completes our theoretical results. As part of the research group MoMaS for deep ground repositories of radioactive wastes, the potential interest of box schemes for unstationary convection-diffusion problems has been tested. A box scheme has been designed for the 1 D equation. Two kinds of upwinding are introduced, each one being designed to cure the two classical oscillations sources present in the approximation of convective-diffusion equations. The generalization to the bidimensional case is perfomed using an ADI-like method (Alternating Direction Implicit). Dans cette these, nous etudions les schemas boite. Ils ont ete introduits par H. B. Keller en 1971. Dans un premier temps, on s'est interesse a des problemes elliptiques de type Poisson. Plusieurs schemas boite pour des domaines de (R) ^ 2 mailles par des triangles ou des rectangles ont ete introduits. Dans ce cas, la discretisation s'effectue sur la forme mixte du probleme en prenant la moyenne des deux equations (conservation et flux) sur les cellules du maillage. La methode peut etre qualifiee de "methode volumes finis mixte de type Petrov-Galerkin ". Une des difficultes du design de cette famille de schemas reside dans le choix des differents espaces de fonctions (approximation et test) qui doivent satisfaire des conditions de compatibilite de type Babuska-Brezzi. En revanche, cette methode de discretisation ne necessite qu'un seul maillage (le maillage du domaine). De plus, on montre dans la plupart des cas que le schema obtenu est equivalent a un probleme découplé : la résolution d'un probleme variationnel pour l'inconnue principale et une formule locale pour le gradient (le flux). Cette formulation facilite le calcul des inconnues discretes. Des resultats de stabilite et les calculs d'erreurs reposant sur la theorie des elements finis ont ete etablis. Une etude numérique valide ces resultats pour quelques cas tests. Dans le cadre du Groupement de Recherche MoMaS pour le stockage des dechets nucleaires dans la Meuse, j'ai ensuite etudie des problemes de convection-diffusion instationnaires. Un schéma boite permettant d'approcher ces equations dans le cas monodimensionnel a ete introduit. Des coefficients de decentrement propres a chaque maille permettent de controler le schema (precision, stabilite). Afin de generaliser rapidement ce schema au cas bidimensionnel, je me suis concentree sur une extension du schema boite monodimensionnel par la methode ADI (Alternating Direction Implicit) ...|$|E

However, Nitsche is weighted with the mesh size h and therefore is a purely discrete point of view with no interpretation in terms of a continuous variational approach associated with a boundary value problem. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to Nitsche method which is associated with a continuous bilinear form.

Similar to DENMAX and HOP, the method can efficiently identify small halos embedded in a large halo, while the FoF and the SO do not resolve such small halos.
