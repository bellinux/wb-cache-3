40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>measured</b> wide-area <b>network</b> traffic such as Internet traffic exhibits locally complex irregularities, consistent with multifractal behavior. It has also been shown that the observed multifractal structure becomes most apparent when analyzing <b>measured</b> <b>network</b> traffic at a particular layer in the well-defined protocol hierarchy that characterizes modern data networks, namely the transport or TCP layer. To investigate this new scaling phenomenon associated with the dynamics of <b>measured</b> <b>network</b> traffic over small time scales, we consider a class of multiplicative processes, the so-called conservative cascades, that serves as a cascade paradigm for and is motivated by the networking application. We present a wavelet-based time/scale analysis of these cascades to determine rigorously their global and local scaling behavior. In particular, we prove that for the class of multifractals generated by these conservative cascades the multifractal formal [...] ...|$|R

Airport operations efficiency is decomposed into production and service efficiency. Service efficiency can then be further decomposed into airside and landside aspects. Our empirical findings suggest that efficiency in airport production may not guarantee efficiency in the service process of domestic airports in Taiwan, and vice versa.

The ‘Component efficiency measure’ section shows a new complex <b>network</b> <b>measure</b> for high-level classification: the component efficiency.

The ‘High-level classification on network components’ section denotes an important conceptual modification in our high-level approach: complex <b>network</b> <b>measures</b> are employed on graph components. The ‘Non-parametric influence coefficient {{for the network}} measures’ section shows an automatic way to obtain the influence coefficient of the <b>network</b> <b>measures.</b> The ‘Complex <b>network</b> <b>measures</b> per component’ section provides the adaptation of the complex <b>network</b> <b>measures</b> to work on components instead of classes.|$|R
