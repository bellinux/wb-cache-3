As a main-sequence star goes through an activity cycle, {{the outer layers}} of the star are subject to a <b>magnetic</b> <b>torque</b> changing the distribution of angular momentum, resulting in {{a change in the}} star's oblateness.

2500|$|In {{this model}} (from 1944) the {{companion}} went nova with ejected material {{captured by the}} Sun and planets forming from this material. In a version a year later it was a supernova. [...] In 1955 he proposed a similar system to Laplace, and with more mathematical detail in 1960. It differs from Laplace in that a <b>magnetic</b> <b>torque</b> occurs between the disk and the Sun, which comes into effect immediately or else more and more matter would be ejected resulting in a much too massive planetary system, one comparable to the Sun. The torque causes a magnetic coupling and acts to transfer angular momentum from the Sun to the disk. The magnetic field strength {{would have to be}} 1 gauss. The existence of torque depends on magnetic lines of force being frozen into the disk (a consequence of a well-known MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) theorem on frozen-in lines of force). As the solar condensation temperature when the disk was ejected could not be much more than 1000 degrees K., a number of refractories must be solid, probably as fine smoke particles, which would grow with condensation and accretion. These particles would be swept out with the disk only if their diameter at the Earth's orbit was less than 1 meter so as the disk moved outward a subsidiary disk consisting of only refractories remains behind where the terrestrial planets would form. The model is in good agreement with the mass and composition of the planets and angular momentum distribution provided the magnetic coupling is an acceptable idea, but not explained are twinning, the low mass of Mars and Mercury, and the planetoid belts. It was Alfvén who formulated the concept of frozen-in magnetic field lines.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} {{mechanisms that}} set the initial rotation rates in massive stars are a crucial unknown in current star formation theory. Observations of young, massive stars provide evidence that they form {{in a similar fashion}} to their low-mass counterparts. The magnetic coupling between a star and its accretion disk may be sufficient to spin down low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars to well below breakup at the end stage of their formation when the accretion rate is low. However, we show that these <b>magnetic</b> <b>torques</b> are insufficient to spin down massive PMS stars due to their short formation times and high accretion rates. We develop a model for the angular momentum evolution of stars over a wide range in mass, considering both <b>magnetic</b> and gravitational <b>torques.</b> We find that <b>magnetic</b> <b>torques</b> are unable to spin down either low or high mass stars during the main accretion phase, and that massive stars cannot be spun down significantly by <b>magnetic</b> <b>torques</b> during the end stage of their formation either. Spin-down occurs only if massive stars' disk lifetimes are substantially longer or their magnetic fields are much stronger than current observations suggest.

40|$|The collapsar {{model for}} gamma-ray bursts {{requires}} three essential ingredients: a massive core, {{removal of the}} hydrogen envelope, and enough angular momentum in the core. We study current massive star evolution models of solar metallicity to determine which massive star physics is capable of producing these ingredients. In particular, we investigate the role of hydrodynamic and magnetic internal angular momentum transport and binary mass and angular momentum transfer. We follow the evolution of rotating binary systems that include rotational processes for both stars. Neglecting magnetic fields, we show that the cores of massive single stars can maintain a high specific angular momentum (j� 10 17 cm 2 s - 1) when evolved {{with the assumption that}} mean molecular weight gradients suppress rotational mixing processes. In binary systems that undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning the mass receiving star accretes large amounts of high angular momentum material, leading to a spin-up of the core. We find, however, that this merely compensates for the tidal angular momentum loss due to spin-orbit coupling, which leads to synchronous rotation before the mass transfer event. Therefore the resulting cores do not rotate faster than in single stars. We also present models that include magnetic fields generated by differential rotation and we consider the internal angular momentum transport by <b>magnetic</b> <b>torques.</b> We find that the magnetic coupling of core and envelope after the accreting star ends core hydrogen burning leads to slower rotation (j� 10 15 - 16 cm 2 s - 1) than in the non-magnetic case.
