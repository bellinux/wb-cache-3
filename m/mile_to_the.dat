5|$|The Ghetto {{is south}} of {{downtown}} Dayton but {{north of the}} city of Oakwood. The Great Miami River is just more than half a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, and Interstate 75 is just more than a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. In its current form, it is bounded by Brown Street to the west, Irving Avenue to the south, Trinity Avenue and Evanston Avenue to the east, and Caldwell Street and Stonemill Road to the north. This gives the area a roughly triangular shape.|$|E
5|$|Trains from Östersund, Sweden (Meråker Line/Central Line) stop at Hell station, where {{passengers}} {{can change}} trains or walk 1.5km (1 <b>mile)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airport terminal.|$|E
5|$|Situated half a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{north of}} the {{southbound}} services, the northbound services are set back from the motorway. The main building is an unusual design based on curves and circles. Unlike the southbound site, the cash machines are located outside and both the car and lorry parking is {{to the front of}} the building.|$|E

Commercial service is {{available}} 33 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south in Columbia at the Columbia Regional Airport or the MO-X (an airport shuttle to and from STL and MCI), 60 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south in Jefferson City via the Amtrak station, 45 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north in La Plata via the Amtrak station, or 55 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North in Kirksville at the Kirksville Regional Airport.|$|R
5|$|A <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east at Whalen Road, NY64 {{separates}} from US20 and NY5, {{following the}} road, and US20A, {{which has its}} eastern terminus at this intersection, south toward Bristol. US20 and NY5 continue on through rural Ontario County before splitting from its easterly alignment at an intersection four miles (6km) east of US20A and NY64 {{in the town of}} Canandaigua. West Avenue, the former routing of US20 and NY5 into downtown Canandaigua, continues east from the junction while US20 and NY5 turn south onto a bypass around Canandaigua.|$|E
5|$|A {{request by}} the state to dismiss the suit was denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} heard {{by the state}} Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile (1.6km) of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6–1 in favor of the Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E
5|$|Bronze age {{archaeology}} is to {{be found}} in abundance in the surrounding area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet. Iron Age archaeology is also well represented, for example in the souterrain nearby Warddykes Cemetery and at West Grange of Conan, as well as the better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.|$|E

5|$|Old Gisborough Hall was {{demolished}} around 1825 and the Chaloners built {{a mansion}} house, Gisborough Hall, {{about half a}} <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east in 1857. In 1932, Thomas Chaloner, 2nd Baron Gisborough transferred control of the priory to the Office of Works. which became {{the responsibility of the}} Ministry of Works, then the Department of the Environment and from 1984, English Heritage. It remains the property of Lord Gisborough; English Heritage is responsible for maintaining the ruins, while day-to-day running is managed by Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century brought {{improvements}} to energy and domestic systems: electrical service {{was introduced in}} 1915; and in 1941, just before World WarII, the town installed a water system. The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic {{through the center of}} town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, drawing off development, retail trade and ultimately, businesses. This caused downtown to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.|$|E
25|$|The nearest {{international}} airport is Birmingham Airport, around 19 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. The nearest local airport is Wolverhampton Airport, {{which is about}} 10 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of the town.|$|R

5|$|The name of {{the cross}} is likely to derive {{from the village of}} Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it had ceased to exist {{by the time of the}} first Ordnance Survey map, {{published}} in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859. Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie, about half a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
5|$|The East Washington Avenue Bridge serves an {{area that}} was {{previously}} known as Pembroke, the name stemming from the 1650s, that grew to become a prosperous agricultural community. East of Pembroke was the village of Newfield, which was chartered as the borough of Bridgeport in 1800. In 1821, it became the township of Bridgeport before being chartered as a city in 1836. The need for the bridge arose when Reverend Birdsey Noble purchased 50 acres from Senator Wright; {{with the intention of}} selling housing lots. The location of the bridge was originally planned to be one quarter of a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, but it was changed through public opposition, and a toll bridge was constructed in 1836. The description of this bridge and details of its service life and replacement have not been found in records.|$|E
50|$|The University of Gloucestershire has campuses a few <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north (in Cheltenham and Gloucester) and the Royal Agricultural University west of Cirencester is 11 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|R
50|$|Further afield, Killylea is {{also served}} by the M1 {{motorway}} which can be accessed twelve <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, near Dungannon or, alternatively, near Portadown which is fifteen <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-east.|$|R
50|$|About 30 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, is {{the famous}} temple of Tarakeswar Shiva, which is {{connected}} with Kamarpukur by a road running via Jahanabad (or Arambagh). Besides this, Ghatal (18 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south) and Vishnupur (30 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west) are joined with Kamarpukur by another road that abuts on <b>the</b> aforesaid road <b>to</b> Puri, after passing through the village via Kotulpur and Koalpara.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{service station}} opened with the M5 and M50 motorways in November 1962, {{though none of}} the original buildings survive in use. The M5, which was built with dual two-lane carriageways, was extended southwards, from junction 8 in 1969, with dual three-lane carriageways. It was widened between junctions 3 and 8 to dual three-lane carriageways in the early 1990s including a remodelling of junction 8 (M50). The proximity of the northbound area to the remodelled junction would have caused issues with traffic trying to join and leave the motorway {{and so it was}} relocated half a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north on a new larger site in 1991. The exit from the southbound services has been altered to feed directly into the M50 junction. The former northbound area is now in use as a maintenance area, though due to the motorway widening this can now only be accessed from the local road network.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 January, at Wandumi, the main Japanese thrust fell upon the 70-man strong 'A' Company, 2/6th Infantry Battalion. Throughout the day the company fought desperately to hold the Japanese while {{reinforcements}} from the 2/5th were brought up from Wau; in the mid-afternoon, as it looked like they would be overrun, a desperate bayonet charge temporarily bought the Australians some relief and they eventually withdrew about a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-west, back towards the Bulolo River where they formed a night defensive position, having successfully delayed the Japanese advance and inflicted over 75 killed upon them. Throughout the following day, as poor weather hampered efforts to fly in the 2/7th Infantry Battalion, {{a large group of}} about 500 Japanese bypassed 'A' Company's position and continued on towards Wau. In response two companies of the 2/5th were moved to the airstrip, reaching there early on 29 January just before Japanese mortars began firing on it. By mid-morning, however, the weather cleared and Allied aircraft soon began arriving at the airfield, disgorging men from the 2/7th who were quickly thrown into the line. That night several counterattacks were fought off and the following day, as a section of guns from the 2/1st Field Regiment arrived, the 17th Brigade went on the offensive. A company of machine guns from the 7th Machine Gun Battalion was also flown in. By 5 February the Japanese began withdrawing from the area. Significant fighting occurred on 9 February, and {{over the course of the}} next three weeks further clashes took place as the Australians followed up the retreating Japanese. The last actions came around Buibaining and Waipali and by 26 February the withdrawal was complete with the Japanese establishing themselves around Guadagasal and Mubo.|$|E
