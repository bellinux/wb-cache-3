5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} {{viewed as a}} criminal, prone to violence and stupidity. A proven enemy of the Nevilles, Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for displacing him from his hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed <b>Margaret</b> <b>and</b> served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter had family ties to the House of York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E

They were accompanied by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.|$|E
50|$|The {{author of}} The Cloister and the Hearth, {{at the end}} of this story, reveals that <b>Margaret's</b> <b>and</b> Gerard's son, also named Gerard, became the great Catholic scholar and Humanist, Erasmus of Rotterdam, a major {{historical}} figure. Indeed, little is actually known about Erasmus' actual parentage (apparently illegitimate), though his parents were in reality named <b>Margaret</b> Roger <b>and</b> Gerard. Reade was apparently using his imagination to fill in some historical gaps in Erasmus' background. The Cloister and the Hearth can easily be read as anti-Catholic, as it presents Catholic discipline regarding the celibate priesthood as an unsympathetic obstacle preventing <b>Margaret's</b> <b>and</b> Gerard's love from continuing to be consummated.|$|R
