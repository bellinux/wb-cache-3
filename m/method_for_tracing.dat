2500|$|Determining {{the origins}} {{and nature of the}} Khazars is closely bound with {{theories}} of their languages, but {{it is a matter of}} intricate difficulty, since no indigenous records in the Khazar language survive, and the state was polyglot and polyethnic. Whereas the royal or ruling elite probably spoke an eastern variety of Shaz Turkic, the subject tribes appear to have spoken varieties of Lir Turkic, such as Oğuric, a language variously identified with Bulğaric, Chuvash, and Hunnish (the latter based upon the assertion of the Persian historian al-Iṣṭakhrī that the Khazar language was different from any other known tongue). One <b>method</b> <b>for</b> <b>tracing</b> their origins consists in analysis of the possible etymologies behind the ethnonym [...] "Khazar".|$|E

Next, we choose an interval for the second continuation parameter, and trace one-dimensional solution curves for certain values in this interval. This constitutes a two-dimensional solution surface. The procedure can be generalized to trace a k-dimensional solution manifold.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} a <b>method</b> <b>for</b> <b>tracing</b> {{the current and}} complex power from individual power sources to system loads. Based on solved load flow, the method converts power injections and line flows into real and imaginary current injections and current flows. These currents are then represented independently as real and imaginary current networks. Since current networks are acyclic lossless networks, proportional sharing principle and graph theory is used to trace the relationship between current sources and current sinks. The contributions from each current source are finally translated into power contributions to each load. IEEE 14 -bus test system is used to illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} method. Comparison of the results with previous methods is also given. 1...|$|E
