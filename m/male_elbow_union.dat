Joint angle ranges were estimated for 5 th, 50 th and 95 th percentile values pooled from {{males and females}} {{for each of the}} 17 task elements. Large differences in risk levels were found between the 5 th and 95 th percentile estimates. <b>Male</b> <b>elbow</b> angles were smaller than the females 2 ̆ 7, but the male shoulder angles were greater than the females 2 ̆ 7, on average.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} differences in elbow and shoulder flexion angles in an assembly task. The experiment involved ten subjects on a simulated assembly task {{that consisted of}} seventeen task elements. The locations of the components were at three distances from the subjects. Confidence intervals (90 %) were estimated and large differences in risk levels were found when data were pooled from both males and females. Between gender comparisons of joint angles revealed that the <b>male</b> <b>elbow</b> angles were smaller than the females, but the male shoulder angles were greater than the females on average. A within-gender analysis found greater change in angles for the female group {{with an increase in}} task distance from the body. This was not the case for the males. This was explained with reference to a previous study that related anthropometrics to differences in joint angles. The shoulder was identified as a joint sensitive to small physical changes in the workplace layout that may make a task more awkward to reach. This was not the case for the elbow. Finally, it was noted that both directions of movement and initial hand location affected final elbow and shoulder joint angles for task elements. ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R
50|$|At {{some point}} between the {{construction}} of the Williamsburg Bridge and 1913 (it appears on a 1913 map of Brooklyn), Grand Street was connected to the bridge plaza from the <b>elbow</b> bend near <b>Union</b> Avenue by the Grand Street Extension (now named Borinquen Place) and this became the main flow for car traffic. In 1950, Grand Street was severed by the BQE between Marcy Avenue and Rodney Street.|$|R
5000|$|The now {{obsolete}} length unit ell relates {{closely to}} the elbow. This becomes especially visible when considering the Germanic origins of both words, Elle (ell, defined as {{the length of a}} <b>male</b> forearm from <b>elbow</b> to fingertips) and Ellbogen (elbow). It is unknown when or why the second [...] "l" [...] was dropped from English usage of the word. The ell as in the English measure could also be taken to come from the letter L, being bent at right angles, as an elbow. The ell as a measure was taken as six handbreadths; three to the elbow and three from the elbow to the shoulder. Another measure was the cubit (from cubital). This was taken to be the length of a man's arm from the elbow {{to the end of the}} middle finger.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{outcome and}} prognostic determinants for arm pain presenting to primary care and physiotherapy services. METHODS: Patients with arm pain were recruited as they presented to primary care and physiotherapy services, and were followed for 12 months. At baseline, they were classified by diagnosis using a validated examination schedule. Depression, somatizing tendency, health anxiety, fear-avoidance beliefs and chronic pain outside the arm were ascertained using standard definitions. Three outcomes were considered: same-site pain {{during the final}} month of follow-up (continuing pain); pain present on most days of that month; and pain present without a break of 7 days over follow-up ('unremitting' pain). Associations were explored in multi-level logistic regression models and summarized as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). RESULTS: Altogether, 313 (83 %) of 375 subjects completed follow-up, including 53 % with 'continuing' and 24 % with 'unremitting' pain. 'Continuing' pain was predicted most strongly by male sex (OR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 2) (this association was restricted largely to the elbow), higher frequency of pain {{in the past month}} at baseline (OR 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 5. 6), chronic pain at sites outside the arm (ORs 1. 6 - 2. 4 for different sites) and current smoking (OR 3. 3, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 6. 6). There were also indications that mental health and fear-avoidance beliefs influenced prognosis. Predictors for the other two adverse outcomes were similar. CONCLUSION: Arm pain often persists in patients who consult medical services. Predictors of persistence include <b>male</b> sex (<b>elbow</b> only), frequency of pain at baseline, chronic pain at other sites and smokin...|$|R
40|$|The {{object was}} to {{investigate}} muscle activities during increasing and decreasing force of isometric contraction. Ten <b>male</b> subjects performed <b>elbow</b> flexion and extension with isometric force increasing linearly from zero to 70 % maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and immediately decreasing from 70 %MVC to zero. Surface electromyographic (EMG) activities from the biceps brachii (BB) and triceps brachii (TB) were recorded. Force tremor root mean square (rms), EMG rms, EMG mean power frequency (MPF), and the peak value of cross correlation coefficients between agonist and antagonist EMGs were calculated for each 1000 ms period. Force tremor rms in the decreasing phase were higher than that in the increasing phase,while no significant increase in agonist EMG rms was found between both phases. Antagonist EMG rms in the decreasing phase was higher than that in the increasing phase. The cross correlation levels between agonist and antagonist EMGs in the decreasing phase were higher {{than those in the}} increasing phase. These results suggest that the increase in force tremor rms in the decreasing phase is cause by the synchronization of firing of motoneurons, not by the recruitment of the motor unit, and that agonist-antagonist muscle pairs are controlled as a single unit by a common central drive especially in the decreasing phase...|$|R

In mouse models, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB) is necessary for M 2 macrophage-mediated regeneration after muscle injury. In humans, CEBPB expression in blood was strongly associated with muscle strength. In this study we aimed to test whether CEBPB expression in blood in people is increased 2 days after exercise designed to induce muscle damage and subsequent repair. Sixteen healthy <b>male</b> volunteers undertook <b>elbow</b> flexor exercises designed to induce acute muscle micro-damage. Peripheral blood samples were collected at baseline and days 1, 2, 4 and 7 following exercise. Expression of CEBPB and related genes were analysed by qRT-PCR. Extent of muscle damage was determined by decline in maximal voluntary isometric torque and by plasma creatine kinase activity. Nine subjects had peak (day 4) creatine kinase activity exceeding 10, 000 U/l. In this subgroup, CEBPB expression was elevated from baseline to 2 days post exercise (paired-samples t (1, 8) = 3. 72, p = 0. 006). Related expression and selected cytokine changes after exercise did not reach significance. Muscle-damaging exercise in humans can be followed by induction of CEBPB transcript expression in peripheral blood. Associations between CEBPB expression in blood and muscle strength may {{be consistent with the}} CEBPB-dependent muscle repair process. Wellcome TrustNational Institute for Health Researc...|$|R

Bone and joint TB {{is one of}} the most common types of extrapulmonary TB, with elbow TB comprising a small proportion of these cases. The treatment for elbow stiffness associated with TB has been rarely reported. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed six patients (four females and two <b>males)</b> with tubercular <b>elbow</b> stiffness during a 7 -year period. All of them received open arthrolysis and hinged external fixation to restore functional extension, flexion, supination and pronation. Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and range of motion (ROM) were evaluated preoperatively and at final follow-up. Results: At final follow-up after surgery, we evaluated the average active ROM, which was 111. 7 ° (90 °– 135 °). The average extension was 11. 7 ° (0 °– 30 °), while the average flexion was 123. 3 ° (115 °– 135 °). At the same time, the average supination was increased to 70 ° (40 °– 90 °) and the average pronation was increased to 68. 3 ° (45 °– 80 °). The MEPS was elevated to 92. 5 (85 – 100). Three patients displayed complications and were treated and cured with dressing changes and antibiotics. Conclusion: Open arthrolysis and hinged external fixation are useful for the treatment of non-traumatic elbow stiffness with TB.

40|$|Current {{trends in}} {{industry}} are leaning towards specialized production systems and sedentary computer work {{tasks that are}} associated with low and less varying mechanical exposures. It has been suggested that physical variation is an effective intervention to reduce local fatigue and potentially musculoskeletal disorders. However, little is known in how the differences between physical variation patterns affect physiological and psychophysical responses. The general purpose of this thesis was to explore the biophysical effects of varying force amplitudes using forces, cycle times, and duty cycles that are relevant to occupation and longer-term health outcomes. Fifteen healthy <b>males</b> performed an <b>elbow</b> extensor sustained isometric exertion at 15 % Maximum Voluntary Force (MVF), an intermittent contraction between 0 % MVF and 30 % MVF (On/Off), an intermittent contraction between 7. 5 % MVF and 22. 5 % MVF (MinMax), an intermittent contraction between 1 % MVF and 29 % MVF (1 Percent), and a sinusoidal contraction between 0 % and 30 % MVF (Sinusoidal). Eight commonly used measurement tools recorded biophysical responses as participants performed each condition for up to 60 minutes or until exhaustion, during 60 minutes recovery, and at 24 hours post-exercise. Measures included electromyography of the triceps muscles, mechanomyography, blood flow, heart rate, stimulated tetani and twitch responses, maximum exertions, and perceived exertion. The rate of response during exercise and comparisons between baseline, cessation, and recovery values were used to assess fatigue responses. This research shows that implementing physical variation, at the same mean amplitude, may provide reduced fatigue rate and that the magnitude and shape of the intermittent force variations affect exercise and recovery measures. Time varying forces may therefore provide the necessary mechanism to encourage beneficial physiological responses that would improve long-term health and well being of workers at low-load jobs...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionComminuted {{fractures}} of {{the proximal}} ulna are severe injuries {{often associated with}} bone and ligament injuries of the elbow joint (Monteggia lesion, radial head fractures, dislocation of the elbow). The treatment of these fractures is very demanding and the functional results often fairly mediocre due to associated injuries. Based on a single-center retrospective study, we report {{the results of the}} treatment of these fractures fixed using a double-plate technique. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of this fixation mode and to compare it with other fractures series using a single plate fixation (in terms of bone <b>union,</b> <b>elbow</b> joint function, and complications stemming from the plates). Patients and methodsEighteen patients sustained a comminuted proximal ulna fracture between 2002 and 2006. The fractures were associated in five cases with a Monteggia type lesion, in two cases with elbow dislocation, and in four cases with a Mason 3 radial head fracture. Four patients had an open fracture. These comminuted ulna fractures included nine Mayo Clinic IIIB fractures. Bone fixation was performed with two third-cylinder tubular plates, one plate {{on each side of the}} proximal ulna. This allows more versatile solutions for screw insertion. Functional assessment (according to Broberg and Morrey) and radiological evaluation (bone healing) were provided at 6  months and at the longest follow-up by an independent surgeon. ResultsSixteen of 18  patients achieved bone union. No septic complications occurred and no hardware removal was required on patient request. In 67 % of the cases, the Morrey score indicated excellent or good results with a mean score of 82. DiscussionThere are no reports in the literature on the technical point of fixation concerning complex fractures of the ulna. Two plates mean the possibility of twice the number of screw insertions for epiphyseal reconstruction. This fixation remains easy to perform and provides stable anatomic reconstruction of the ulna.
