5|$|The Battle of Stillman's run was {{a turning}} point. Prior to this battle, Black Hawk had not been {{committed}} to war. Now he determined to avenge {{what he saw as}} the treacherous killing of his warriors under a flag of truce.

5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer <b>might</b> <b>consider</b> a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
