40|$|The New South Wales prawn {{aquaculture}} {{industry is}} considering alternative species, such as <b>mulloway</b> (Argyrosomus japonicus), to diversify their production base, but little exists on their market potential. Farmed <b>mulloway</b> had {{higher levels of}} fat, energy, and cholesterol than wild <b>mulloway</b> and were {{an excellent source of}} long chain omega- 3 s with good fillet yields: 46. 3 % (skin-on) and 38. 8 % (skin-off). Wild <b>mulloway</b> had higher sodium and moisture content but were a poor source of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. For consumer acceptance, there was a preference for the flavor of wild to farmed <b>mulloway.</b> The high cost of production remains a major constraint to industry growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stocking}} density {{on the growth}} of <b>mulloway,</b> Argyrosomus japonicus, was tested with 17 g fish stocked at 4. 08, 8. 16, or 16. 32 kg m− 3 in 50 l aquaria. Weight checks were carried out every 2 weeks to track performance. Each density treatment was also compared to a nonhandled control group to establish if handling during weight checks influenced the growth of <b>mulloway.</b> <b>Mulloway</b> performed poorly at the lowest density and, under the current experiment conditions, growth {{did not appear to}} be negatively affected by regular handling...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the mass-specific routine metabolic rate (RMR) of similar sized <b>mulloway</b> (Argyrosomus japonicus), a sedentary species, and yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi), a highly active species, acclimated {{at one of}} several temperatures ranging from 10 – 35 °C. Respirometry {{was carried out in}} an open-top static system and RMR corrected for seawater–atmosphere O 2 exchange using mass-balance equations. For both species RMR increased linearly with increasing temperature (T). RMR for <b>mulloway</b> was 5. 78 T − 29. 0 mg O 2 kg− 0. 8 h− 1 and for yellowtail kingfish was 12. 11 T − 39. 40 mg O 2 kg− 0. 8 h− 1. The factorial difference in RMR between <b>mulloway</b> and yellowtail kingfish ranged from 2. 8 to 2. 2 depending on temperature. The energetic cost of routine activity can be described as a function of temperature for <b>mulloway</b> as 1. 93 T − 9. 68 kJ kg− 0. 8 day− 1 and for yellowtail kingfish as 4. 04 T − 13. 14 kJ kg− 0. 8 day− 1. Over the full range of temperatures tested Q 10 values were approximately 2 for both species while Q 10 responses at each temperature increment varied considerably with <b>mulloway</b> and yellowtail kingfish displaying thermosensitivities indicative of each species respective niche habitat. RMR for <b>mulloway</b> was least thermally dependent at 28. 5 °C and for yellowtail kingfish at 22. 8 °C. Activation energies (Ea) calculated from Arrhenius plots were not significantly different between <b>mulloway</b> (47. 6 kJ mol− 1) and yellowtail kingfish (44. 1 kJ mol− 1) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to describe the interactive effects of varying digestible protein (DP) and digestible energy (DE) contents on the feed intake, growth, protein utilization and whole body composition of juvenile <b>mulloway</b> (Argyrosomus japonicus) and to determine the optimal DP : DE ratio for growth. This was achieved by feeding <b>mulloway</b> diets containing one of four different DP levels (250 – 550 g kg− 1) at two DE levels (16 or 21 MJ kg− 1). Juvenile <b>mulloway</b> were stocked at each of two different sizes (70 or 200 g) in triplicate groups for each dietary treatment and fed twice daily to apparent satiation over 58 days. The results indicated that feed intake was not governed solely by energy demands but was also dependant on the DP content of the diet. Protein utilization did not improve with diets containing decreasing protein and increasing lipid content indicating that <b>mulloway</b> have a limited capacity to spare DP. Optimal DP content was found to be 444 – 491 g kg− 1 depending on the DE content of the diet and the size of <b>mulloway</b> and is within the range reported for other sciaenid species. The use of formulated diets with 28. 6 g of DP MJ DE− 1 will achieve optimal growth and protein deposition for 70 – 275 g <b>mulloway...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{preferred}} habitats, {{home range}} and activity patterns of sub-adult <b>mulloway</b> Argyrosomus japonicus (Sciaenidae) in the Georges River, New South Wales, Australia, were investigated using ultrasonic telemetry. Tags were surgically implanted in 9 hatchery-reared and 12 wild-caught <b>mulloway</b> (330 to 730 mm total length, TL). Fish were tracked for 2 periods of continuous tracking over 72 h in a 15 km section of river, once daily for a 20 d period, {{and up to}} 3 times mo– 1 for 11 mo. Key habitats were identified as discrete holes or basins up to 20 m deep. <b>Mulloway</b> preferred this deep hole habitat as small fish (hatchery-reared, 300 to 500 mm TL) remained in these deep holes both day and night, while large fish (wild, 500 to 800 mm TL) ventured outside the holes at night. Maximum home range of small and large <b>mulloway</b> was 6000 and 17710 m 2, respectively, and home range correlated significantly with length. Small fish moved up to 7 km d- 1 while large fish moved up to 16 km d- 1. Small fish released in shallow water initially had significantly greater movements than those released directly over deep holes, with movement up to 10 km in 3 d. Activity patterns varied between small and large fish, with significantly larger movements by large fish during the night and early morning than daytime. Five wild-caught <b>mulloway</b> tracked over 11 mo showed strong fidelity to holes within their particular home range. <b>Mulloway</b> should be stocked directly into their deep holes to minimise movements. The use of key habitats by <b>mulloway</b> indicate that their survival will be sensitive to stocking density. Optimal stocking density could be estimated from the area of key habitat in the target estuary...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{undertaken}} for estuarine stocking of <b>mulloway</b> Argyrosomus japonicus {{to develop}} efficient marking techniques; to identify key habitats and migratory patterns of stocked fish; {{to evaluate the}} diet and growth of stocked fish and recruitment to commercial fisheries; {{and to develop a}} numerical model to estimate optimal stocking density from the predatory impact of stocked fish. The 10 -step responsible approach to marine stock enhancement (Blankenship and Leber 1995) was reviewed for four Australian species, and Argyrosomus japonicus and Lates calcarifer were found to be the best candidates for stocking in Australia. Immersion of <b>mulloway</b> in an oxytetracycline-undiluted seawater solution produced poor quality marks, whilst oxytetracycline-diluted seawater solutions and alizarin complexone-seawater solutions produced high quality marks in otoliths and fin spines. These techniques were applied to produce double marks, and in batch mode at fish densities of 30 kg m- 3. Key habitats for <b>mulloway</b> were identified as discrete holes or basins up to 20 m deep. Hatchery-reared fish initially had significantly greater movements (greater than 10 km in 3 d) when released in shallow water, compared to hatchery-reared fish released directly over deep holes. Such targeted release strategies could revolutionise stocking of depleted fisheries in estuarine and aquatic habitats, and even oceans. Stomach content analysis of <b>mulloway</b> captured from a coastal lagoon and riverine estuary revealed ontogenetic changes in major prey of mysid shrimp, prawns and forage fish. Comparison between benthic resources and dietary composition in these two estuaries revealed that <b>mulloway</b> consume prey resources in proportion to those in the environment, and do not actively select prey. Simulations of a novel Predatory Impact Model were run for part of the Georges River Recreational Fishing Haven, Sydney, to evaluate appropriate stocking density and associated predatory impact. The 15 km stretch of the Georges River contained c. 361, 000 m 2 of key <b>mulloway</b> habitat, and 10 % of mysid shrimp production within this habitat was assigned to support stocked fish. Given these values, this section of river could support c. 4, 000 stocked 8 cm <b>mulloway.</b> Over the 4 y during which <b>mulloway</b> are resident in the estuary, these fish will have a maximum yearly predatory impact of 6. 7 t y- 1 forage fish, 1. 8 t y- 1 school prawns and 2. 2 t y- 1 cephalopods, which represents 48 %, 17 % and 127 % of former commercial fishery in the Georges River respectively...|$|E
