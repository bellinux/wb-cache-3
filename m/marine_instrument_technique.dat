40|$|The {{electric}} <b>marine</b> <b>instruments</b> are newly {{inserted in}} the trade and industry, for which {{the existence of an}} equipped and reliable power system is necessitated. One of the features of such a power system is that it cannot have an earth system causing the protection relays {{not to be able to}} detect the single line to ground short circuit fault. While on the other hand, the occurrence of another similar fault at the same time can lead to the double line fault and thereby the tripping of relays and shortening of vital loads. This in turn endangers the personals' security and causes the loss of military plans. From the above considerations, it is inferred that detecting the single line to ground fault in the <b>marine</b> <b>instruments</b> is of a special importance. In this way, this paper intends to detect the single line to ground fault in the power systems of the <b>marine</b> <b>instruments</b> using the wavelet transform and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. In the numerical analysis, several different types of short circuit faults are simulated on several marine power systems and the proposed approach is applied to detect the single line to ground fault. The results are of a high quality and preciseness and perfectly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

The potential was created by connecting pieces of copper or stainless steel to a layer of Indium/Tin Oxide semiconductor deposited on glass.

As the conductive layer is transparent, the technique was used to protect the windows of commercial optical instruments. This technology could provide an inexpensive way of extending deployment times for <b>marine</b> <b>instruments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In a {{previous}} study that explored epistemological perspectives on solving problems with Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) we concluded that awareness of the special ways that the software utilizes symbols in algebraic manipulations and in implicit plotting should be encouraged (Zehavi, 2004). Such awareness is required for, and encouraged by treating geometry analytically with a symbolic-graphical system. In this paper we compare a traditional solution of a problem in analytic geometry with CAS-based solutions to the same problem. The discussion {{will focus on the}} role of reflective thinking, namely selection of techniques, monitoring of the solution process, insight, and conceptualization, play in the creation of <b>instrumented</b> <b>techniques</b> (Guin & Trouche, 1999). Teachers, who experienced learning activities from a resource e-book for teaching analytic geometry with CAS, contributed to the design of tasks and to the analysis of <b>instrumented</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|R
