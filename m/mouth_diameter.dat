2500|$|The tractrix horn is {{very similar}} in many respects to the {{exponential}} horn and has gained adherents among DIY horn enthusiasts, audiophile consumers, and now some manufactures as well. [...] It uses a curve formula derived by assuming that a tangent to any point on the horn's inner curve will reach the central axis of the horn with a line segment of set length. At the mouth, the tangent line segment becomes perpendicular to the axis and describes the radius of the mouth. This horn concept was studied by Paul G.A.H.

40|$|Suction feeding is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used mechanism of prey capture among aquatic vertebrates. Most previous models of the fluid flow caused by suction feeders involve making several untested assumptions. In this paper, a Chimera overset grids approach is used to solve the governing equations of fluid dynamics in order to investigate the assumptions that prey do not interact with the flow and that the flow can be modelled as a one-dimensional flow. Results show that, for small prey, both neglecting the prey and considering prey interaction give similar calculated forces exerted on the prey. However, as the prey item increases in size toward the size of the gape, its effect on the flow becomes more pronounced. This in turn affects both the magnitude of the hydrodynamic forces imparted to the prey and the time when maximum force is delivered. Maximum force is delivered most quickly to intermediate sized prey, about one-third of <b>mouth</b> <b>diameter,</b> and most slowly to prey less than 7 per cent or greater than 67 per cent of <b>mouth</b> <b>diameter.</b> This suggests that the effect of prey size on the timing of suction forces may have substantial consequences for the feeding ecology of suction feeders that are known to prefer prey between 25 and 50 per cent of <b>mouth</b> <b>diameter.</b> Moreover, for a 15 cm fish with a 15 mm gape, assuming a radial one-dimensional flow field can result in underestimating the maximum force exerted on a 5 mm diameter spherical prey 1 gape distance from the mouth by up to 28. 7 per cent...|$|E

40|$|Boundary shape {{optimization}} is {{a technique}} to search for an optimal shape by modifying the boundary of a device with a pre-specified topology. We consider boundary shape optimization of acoustic horns in loudspeakers and brass wind instruments. A horn is an interfacial device, situated between a source, such as a waveguide or a transducer, and surrounding space. Horns are used to control both the transmission properties from the source and the spatial power distribution in the far-field (directivity patterns). Transmission and directivity properties of a horn {{are sensitive to the}} shape of the horn flare. By changing the horn flare we design transmission efficient horns. However, it is difficult to achieve both controllability of directivity patterns and high transmission efficiency by using only changes in the horn flare.
