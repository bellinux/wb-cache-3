5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are large}} enough {{structures}} {{to have some}} of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus Ka, bending modulus Kb, and edge energy , can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a shear modulus, but like any liquid, the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers. These <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties</b> affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties</b> have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties</b> also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing.

5|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of {{iron and}} its alloys can be {{evaluated}} {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests.

An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength.

In the present study, using the flexibility parameters from two different models, we calculated the average flexibility profiles of 1004 human promoters that do not contain canonical promoter elements, such as a TATA box, initiator (Inr) sequence, downstream promoter element or a GC box, and those of 382 human promoters that contain the GC box only. Here, we show that they have a common characteristic <b>mechanical</b> <b>property</b> that is strikingly {{similar to those of the}} TATA box-containing or Inr-containing promoters. Their most interesting feature is that the TATA- or Inr-corresponding region lies in the several nucleotides around the transcription start site.

Polymer {{blending}} {{was used}} by adding different proportions (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt %) of the short carbon fiber into the high impact polypropylene (PP) matrix to reinforce the matrix’s <b>mechanical</b> <b>property.</b> The carbon fiber was melt blended with the PP matrix.
