It is empirically observed that more than 5 full 360 degree wraps creates little additional loss, so 3 to 5 turns are commonly specified. The <b>mandrel</b> <b>diameter</b> affects how far into the mode volume the modal unbinding occurs. Experimentally, one plots the transmitted power from a wrapped fibre into which a uniform modal power distribution has been excited, {{as a function of}} <b>mandrel</b> <b>diameter,</b> maintaining a constant number of turns. This reveals step-like reductions in transmitted power as the diameter decreases, where each step is {{the point at which the}} mandrel is beginning to affect the next-lower mode group. For best measurement reproducibility, one would select a diameter that is not near such a transition, although this may not be possible if measurements must be performed over a range of wavelengths. Total mode volume in a fiber is a function of wavelength, so the <b>mandrel</b> <b>diameter</b> at which the mode group transitions occur will change with wavelength.|$|E

In this context, the present paper reports a systematic investigation on designing and development of 100 % fiber based stents, which can eliminate or minimize the problems with existing metallic stents. For this purpose, braided stents were produced by varying different materials, structural and process parameters such as mono-filament type and diameter, braiding angle and <b>mandrel</b> <b>diameter.</b> The influence of these design parameters on mechanical behavior as well as stent's porosity was thoroughly investigated, and suitable parameters were selected for developing a stentwith mechanical characteristics and porosity matching with the commercial stents. According to the experimental results, the best performance was achieved with a polyester stent designed with 0. 27 mm monofilament diameter, braiding angle of 35 ° and <b>mandrel</b> <b>diameter</b> of 6 mm, providing similar properties to commercial Nitinol stents.

Due {{to the specific}} properties, the bending behaviors of LDTW commercial pure titanium (CP-Ti) tube are much more complex to achieve precise deformation. With the CP-Ti tube of 50. 8 mm (out diameter, D) × 0. 508 mm (wall thickness, t) × 101. 6 mm (bending radius, R) as a representative component, the bending behaviors of LDTW CP-Ti tube under different processing conditions were investigated. With experiments and analytical analysis, the bending characteristics of the CP-Ti tube were identified. Then, based on the orthogonal experimental design, a series of three-dimensional FE models of RDB for LDTW CP-Ti tube were established, {{and the effects of}} processing parameters on the bending behaviors were numerically investigated. The results show that: 1) Wrinkling is the primary behavior for the LDTW CP-Ti tube in RDB, and the larger the difference between the maximum wall thickening and the maximum wall thinning degrees of the bent tube, the larger the wrinkling tendency; 2) The bending behaviors of the LDTW CP-Ti tube are very sensitive to the some processing parameters, and the wrinkling is significantly affected by the <b>mandrel</b> shank <b>diameter,</b> while the wall thinning is remarkably affected by the clearance between wiper die and tube, <b>mandrel</b> shank <b>diameter.</b> The qualified bent tube with the wall thinning of 11. 43 %, the cross-section distortion of 2. 69 % and the wrinkling height less than 2 % is then obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to generate the knowledge required to: (1) design and manufacture fluid film bearings that do not require precision machining processes during fabrication, but rather gain their precision from off-the-shelf parts used in the fabrication process and (2) manufacture parts with 3 D internal networks by wrapping thin sheets of material containing 2 D through-cut features. This wrapping-based fabrication process, called Three-Dimensional Wrapped Network (3 DWN) technology, uses the precision of low-cost, ubiquitous items instead of manufacturing processes to meet the precision requirements of hydrostatic bearings. 3 DWN bearings are fabricated by cutting 2 D through-cut features into shim stock and then wrapping the shim stock around a precision mandrel. The 2 D shim stock features are designed such that they align and form 3 D internal networks within the bearing during wrapping. In the final wrapped structure the bore retains the precision diameter of the mandrel and the surface finish of the shim stock, thus meeting the functional requirements of the bearing. This thesis investigates the design and manufacturing of 3 DWN hydrostatic bearings. (cont.) An analytical model was derived to describe the transformation of 3 D cylindrical features to 2 D through-cut features. Conventional hydrostatic designs and theory were adapted for use in 3 DWN bearings. A proof-of-concept was designed, constructed, and tested.

40|$|This project {{seeks to}} {{increase}} the lifespan of steel mandrels used by Schlosser Forge in the saddling process, {{which is part of}} the production of forged rings for the aerospace and power generation industries. All saddle mandrel samples were taken from used 4340 steel mandrels. Hardness profiles were measured across rectangular bars cut from the transverse direction of a completely fractured piece of a 7 ″ <b>diameter</b> <b>mandrel.</b> The hardness near one outer surface of the tested bar was 36 HRC and gradually decreased to 30. 5 HRC at the opposite surface. Macroscopic examination of the primary fracture surface along with light microscope imaging of fracture surface feature details suggests that the failure mechanism is likely related to reversed bending fatigue rather than deterioration of the mechanical properties of the steel due to microstructural changes from in-process overtempering during saddling. Cyclic softening of the quenched and tempered steel caused by the saddling process adversely affects the ability of the steel to withstand fatigue. Different heat treatments were conducted to compare the resulting toughness, measured by Charpy impact test, to that of the current process of quenching and tempering the mandrel to a hardness of 38 – 42 HRC. Each heat treatment involved austenitizing at 1500 °F for one hour. By varying the tempering temperature, with a constant two hour tempering time, samples were obtained at 28. 5 HRC, 39. 8 HRC, and 42. 5 HRC.

Deliverables are a 30 cm diameter superpolished composite AO mirror.

The influence function was chosen to be comparable to the atmospheric correlation coefficient r(sub 0) which is about 5 cm at sea level. There was no print-thru of the graphite fibers in the cyanate ester surface (the bane of many previous efforts to use cyanate ester mirrors). Our subcontractor has devised a means for developing a 30 - 50 nm thick layer of graphite free pure ester resin {{on the surface of the}} mirrors. This graphite fiber filled material has a thermal expansion coefficient in the 10 (exp - 8) centimeter per Kelvin range (the same range of expansion coefficient as Zerodur and ULE glasses) and does not take up water and swell, so it is a nearly ideal mirror material in these areas. Unfortunately for these 0. 8 mm thick faceplates, the number of plies is not enough to result in isometric coverage. Isolated figure irregularities can appear, making it necessary to go to thicker faceplates. The influence function will then only approximate the length of r(sub 0), at higher altitudes or longer wavelengths. The influence function goes as the cube of the thickness, so we are now making a faceplate optimized for an infrared wavelength, possibly that used for the AO system of the Keck telescope, instead of 0. 63 microns.

These medical devices assume great importance in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) which are {{the leading cause of death}} worldwide. In the European Union CVD account for 40 % of deaths and assume an estimated annual cost of 196 billion euros[1]. Stents must possess certain requirements, in order to, adequately, perform its function, such as biocompatibility (so that its use does not c ause damage on the health of its user), mechanical strength, radiopacity (so that it is easy to view), longitudinal flexibility, ease of handling, corrosion resistance and having high strength and high radial expansion ability to recover. Stents can be made of different materials, but metals, particularly stainless steel, are the most common. However, metallic stents present several dRawbacks such as corrosion and restenosis, leading to health complications for the patient, or even death. In order to minimize these disadvantages, new materials, like fibrous materials, have been used [2]. Monofilaments present high potential for stents development because, in addition to its biocompatibility, these materials allow the application of various surface treatments, such as antibacterial coatings. Furthermore, monofilament exhibit excellent mechanical properties, like greater stiffness and good results when subjected to compression, tensile and bending forces, since these forces will be directly supported by the monofilament [3]. To minimize the reaction of the human body and Limit the adhesion of microorganisms to the stent surface, some coatings have been developed, including the use of novel metals with antimicrobial properties, like silver. The main objective of this study was the development of fibrous stents, incorporation of silver oxide nanocoating. For the development of the stent, polyester monofilaments with 0. 27 mm of diameter were used in braiding technology, with a <b>mandrel</b> <b>diameter</b> of 6 mm and a braiding angle of 35 ⁰. The mechanical behaviour of the stent were evaluated by mechanical testing under longitudinal and radial compression, bending. The results of compressive strength tests are according with value from literature: 1. 13 to 2. 9 N for radial compression and 0. 16 - 5. 28 N to longitudinal compression. From literature is also possible to verify that stents must present 75 % of unchanged diameter during the bending test and must possess a porosity between 70 % and 80 % [4]. The produced polyester stent presents values of 1. 29 N for radial compression, 0. 23 N for longitudinal compression, 80 % of porosity and 85. 5 % of unchanged diameter, during bending tests. For the antibacterial functionalization, silver oxide nanocoatings were prepared, through reactive magnetron g, with an Ag target in an Ar +O 2 atmosphere. In order to evaluate the nanostructure and morphology of the coatings, d ifferent technique s like X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and and X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS were used. From the analyses of XRD it is possible to verify that the peaks corresponds to planes of Ag 2 O and MATERIAIS 2015 Porto, 21 - 23 June, 2015 characterize a cubic phase. The presence of Ag 2 O is corroborated by XPS spectrum, where it is possible to observe silver, not only, in oxide state, but a lso in mettalic state, and it is possible to verify the presence of silver clusters, confirmed by SEM analysis. Films’ roughness and topography, parameters influencing the wettability of the surface and microorganism adhesion, were measured by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and it was observed that the roughness is very low (under 10 nm). Coatings’ hydrophobicity and surface tension parameters were determined by contact angle measurement, and it was verified the hydrophobic behavior of the coatings. For antibacterial tests were used Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (IE 186) and Staphylococcus aureus(ATCC 6538), and halo inhibition zone tests were realized. Ag+release rates were studied by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP -MS). The obtained results suggest that silver oxide coatings do not modify significantly surface properties of the substrate, like hydrophobicity and roughness, and present antimicrobial properties for both bacteria used...|$|E
