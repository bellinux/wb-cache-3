40|$|This article {{examines}} the <b>minor</b> <b>character</b> of Bulkington in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick and argues that his character functions as a narrative "cue," prompting the reader to consider an assemblage of <b>minor</b> <b>characters,</b> including the carpenter and the blacksmith. Through their virtuosic labor and linguistic procedures that interrupt communication and disrupt meaning, I argue that <b>minor</b> <b>characters</b> resist the individualizing force of language and capitalism, and maintain an undifferentiated, impersonal state of being. The impact of minority in the narrative is two-fold: the impersonality of <b>minor</b> <b>characters</b> is invulnerable to exploitation within transatlantic capitalism, and the novel experiences the impossibility of incorporating <b>minor</b> <b>characters</b> into a seamless narrative. Thus, the narrative reveals the capacity of fragmentation and non-representation to create a space that fully realizes the devastating force of minority. This assertion demands a radical reconsideration of the way meaning is created in the traditional form of the novel...|$|R
