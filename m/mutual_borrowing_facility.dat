40|$|The Investment Company Act of 1940 {{regulates the}} capital {{structure}} {{of mutual funds}} in order to restrain their leverage and speculative character. It is often (mistakenly) assumed that the law prohibits open-end <b>mutual</b> funds from <b>borrowing</b> money. This Article (I) analyzes the law governing mutual fund capital structure to reveal when (and to what extent) borrowing is allowed and (ii) examines a novel dataset on mutual fund capital structure that shows borrowing is an unexpectedly common practice. Using data on all registered investment companies in the U. S. from 1998 to 2013, I find that nearly 8 % of open-end mutual funds, and 10 % of all <b>mutual</b> funds, <b>borrow</b> money for leverage purposes each year. This figure increases to over 12 % of funds when I include non-conventional forms of <b>borrowing.</b> In fact, <b>mutual</b> funds <b>borrow</b> about {{as often as they}} employ the most commonly used derivatives. Closed-end funds are more aggressive than open-end funds in their borrowing, often pushing leverage to the regulatory limits. I find that, in addition to borrowing for leverage purposes, <b>mutual</b> funds also <b>borrow</b> on a short-term basis to manage liquidity, via a host of practices: bank lines of credit, overdrafts on custodial accounts, and joint <b>borrowing</b> and lending <b>facilities</b> that allow funds to borrow from other funds. Recent regulatory initiatives (which focus on risks arising from illiquidity and derivatives) overlook the substantial <b>borrowing</b> practices of <b>mutual</b> funds...|$|R

Even if enterprises encounter the challenge of deferred payment, they can resort to a credit guarantee from a third party such as the installment of a commercial bank and acceptance bill commonly used in transactions. In fact, transactions without a third party as a credit guarantee generally use cash in order to avoid risks. There is {{a great deal}} of <b>mutual</b> <b>borrowing</b> and lending behavior among enterprises.

40|$|Abstract: Among most economists, {{political}} scientists, and sociologists, it {{is taken}} for granted that the rational choice approach is a predictive methodology, and its strengths and weaknesses are judged in relation to that purpose. However, the rational choice model of action is found in a far wider range of disciplines across academia, and the purpose {{for which it is}} adopted varies greatly, with prediction, prescription, and interpretation each being seen by some as the model’s major role. In different disciplines, different purposes are emphasized, which often obscures the common assumptions shared and issues faced by their respective literatures, hence reducing the possibilities for interdisciplinary dialogue and shared theory development. This paper provides a broad, interdisciplinary survey of the positive, normative, and interpretive versions of the rational choice approach. It then discusses complementarities between these three subapproaches, showing how <b>mutual</b> <b>borrowing</b> of methodologies can lead to benefits for all of them...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} not to notice a curious unrest in the philosophic atmo-sphere of the time, a loosening of old landmarks, a softening of oppo-sitions, a <b>mutual</b> <b>borrowing</b> from one another {{on the part of}} systems anciently closed, and an interest in new suggestions, however vague, as if the one thing sure were the inadequacy of extant school-solutions. The dissatisfactions with these seems due for the most part to a feeling that they are too abstract and academic. Life is confused and super-abundant, and what the younger generation appears to crave is more of the temperament of life in its philosophy, even though it were at some cost of logical rigor and formal purity.
