40|$|Two {{concepts}} of management style are drawn {{together in this}} paper for a more complete description {{of the individual and}} therefore of the organisation. The concepts are those of decision style, based on Jung's personality types, and Maslow's concept of basic motivation, embracing his famous hierarchy of needs. Maslow's growth-motivated are found to have the flexibility of decision style which characterises the best managers. This unified concept of the individual enables a better understanding of many issues in planning and management and examples are given in organisational design and personnel planning. A growth-motivated management is seen as necessary for successful multidimensional functioning and decision style must be <b>matched</b> <b>to</b> organisational <b>purpose.</b> The lifecycle of organisations is characterised by growth-motivated founders and their decline attributable to the loss of this growth-motivation and to decision styles inappropriate to the stage of lifecycle and purpose of the organisation. ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{automobiles}} carry {{one person}} and are used for less than one hour per day. A more economically rational approach would be to use vehicles more intensively. Carsharing, in which people pay a sub-scription plus a per-use fee, is one means of doing so. Carsharing may be organized through affinity groups, large employers, transit opera-tors, neighborhood groups, or large car-sharing businesses. While carsharing does not offer convenient access to vehicles, it does provide users with a large range of vehicles, fewer ownership responsibilities, and less cost (if vehicles are not used intensively). Societal benefits include less demand for parking space and the indirect benefits result-ing from costs being more directly tied to actual usage and vehicles being <b>matched</b> <b>to</b> trip <b>purpose.</b> This article reviews the experience with shared-use vehicle services and explores their prospects for the future, focusing on the trend toward expanded services and use of advanced communication and reservation technologies...|$|R

40|$|The {{approach}} to analysis within educational research needs <b>to</b> be <b>matched</b> <b>to</b> the <b>purpose.</b> The presentation will outline and exemplify a customised {{approach to}} analysis identified as generative divergent analysis (GDA). The GDA model was {{conceived as a}} parameter for the Creative Analytic Paradigm (CAP) {{in order to allow}} for the paradigm’s more open format. Within the CAP the purpose of analysis is to identify points of contact with the phenomena of experience which generate and have the potential to generate reflection. The analytical process also involves elaboration of the associated themes. Analysis begins with and includes differentiating the perceptual field by noticing naturally occurring objects of interest/actively evocative objects and/or by actively focusing attention (re latent evocative objects). As a constitutive and creative process, analysis within the GDA model includes looking away from the object evoking the initial response and following the generated ideas, rather than being specifically concerned with deconstructing the object itself. This more creative and imaginative way of thinking relates well to the concept of divergent thinking and to ideas of fluency, flexibility and originality. Divergent analysis within the GDA model is generated in experience and relates to a contemplative process model of research as ‘relationship’...|$|R

40|$|In two {{equivalence}} experiments, a "think aloud" procedure {{modeled after}} Ericsson and Simon's (1980) protocol analysis was implemented to examine subjects' covert verbal responses during <b>matching</b> <b>to</b> sample. The <b>purpose</b> was <b>to</b> identify variables {{that might explain}} individual differences in equivalence class formation. The results from Experiment 1 suggested that subjects who formed equivalence classes described the relations among stimuli, whereas those not showing equivalence described sample and comparison stimuli as unitary compounds. Because Experiment 1 only demonstrated a correlation between describing stimulus compounds {{and the absence of}} equivalence classes, a second study was conducted. In Experiment 2, equivalence class formation was brought under experimental control through pretraining manipulations that facilitated responding either to stimulus compounds or to relations among stimuli. The results demonstrated that a history of describing stimulus compounds, when compared with describing the relations among the stimuli, interfered with the emergence of stimulus equivalence. These findings clarify individual differences in stimulus equivalence. They also demonstrate the utility of analyzing verbal reports to identify possible variables that can be manipulated experimentally...|$|R

While teachers understand the importance of talk for student learning, they are often unaware of the impact of their discourse practice on the quality of classroom talk. To develop substantive classroom discourse, first teachers need to understand what substantive talk looks and sounds like, and then they need to develop their capacity to use questioning and discourse moves to achieve such talk. Science poses additional challenges for teachers in that the form of discourse needs <b>to</b> be <b>matched</b> <b>to</b> the instructional <b>purpose</b> of the phase of inquiry.

Hence, ecocomposition instructors emphasize not only the writer's relationship to physical place but also the social relations among writers and readers.

30|$|The {{concept of}} e-Agriculture {{is still in}} the nascent stage in Bangladesh context, so does it in the {{academic}} arena. In 2003, under the “Support to ICT” taskforce program the ministry of agriculture of Bangladesh did set up an agricultural information system. (MoA 2003). In 2005, a group of researchers of D.Net (Development Research Network, Bangladesh) proposed the idea of “Pallitathya Help Center” and conducted a project on it. The idea centered on the use of relatively less fashionable ICT, the mobile phone, as an effective ‘last mile solution’ to improve access to livelihood information for the rural people. They found it most challenging to understand the problems (related to health, agricultural, weather information) of rural people and to provide the appropriate information (Raihan et al. 2005). Since this idea is brand new, this researcher has not come across any local literature that has made any qualitative attempt to measure the impact of e-Agriculture in the empowerment process. Hence, the quest for previous quantitative approached literature has been shifted to South Asian literatures because these countries share the similar socio-economic context. Ironically, this attempt has turned into a futile one also, as there are numerous literatures that have examined the women empowerment, economic empowerment through micro-finance but nothing in the field of farmer empowerment or impact of e-Agriculture. Out of all the literatures that have been reviewed, the researcher has found the literature of Sendilkumar (2012) from Kerala Agricultural University which has close <b>match</b> <b>to</b> the <b>purpose</b> of this literature. Sendikumar (2012) made an attempt to study the empowerment dynamics of kerala farmers who joined the grouped approached farming of Paddy introduced by the kerala local government. In this regard, he developed an Empowerment Dynamics Index (EDI) and computed the index for the before and after joining situation of these farmers. The result showed that this program had statistically significant role to set up sustainable development of the farmers in this state. So, this literature has been attempted in this Greenfield segment and perhaps {{the first of its kind}} in Bangladeshi context. Not to mention, the researcher has thoroughly gone through the other empowerment literatures from which statistical the model used in the context, has been applied.|$|R

40|$|Microfinance, and its impact, have {{received}} considerable attention {{over the last}} few decades. Several studies confirm a positive impact on the customers. Nevertheless, these studies only consider the effect of a micro-loan whilst microfinance nowadays incorporates much more than just credit. This study attempts to fill this gap by estimating the effect of additional services offered. These are non-financial services such as training and the establishment of market linkages designed specifically <b>to</b> <b>match</b> the <b>purpose</b> of the loan. The study explores the possibility of estimating such effects making use of data readily available from the Management Information System of Microfinance Institutions as well as of official statistics that are accessible to all. Taking the services as randomly given is shown to result in significant overestimation of the estimated program effect. This paper applies an instrumental variable approach to account for the endogeneity of participation in these additional services. Doing so results in a sign change of the estimated effect, suggesting that customers that chose to take extra services {{have a negative effect on}} their income. This effect remains negative but becomes slightly insignificant when accounting for the existence of market linkages...|$|R
