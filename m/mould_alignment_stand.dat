5000|$|Grinding: Grinding or finish-machining {{creates the}} final {{form and the}} surface finish of the cavity in the mould insert. Usually, the finish is carried out by grinding; a {{subsequent}} polishing step is optionally required. Finish grinding can require several changes of the grinding tool and several truing steps of the tool. Finish-machining of the mould is an iterative process: As long as the machined mould shows deviations from the nominal contour in the measurement step after grinding, {{it has to be}} reground. There is no well-defined border between pre-machining and fine grinding. Throughout the grinding process of the cavity, the grain size of the tool, the feed rate and the cutting depth are reduced whereas machining time increases. Convex surfaces are easier to manufacture. The necessary steps of workpiece preparation are the <b>mould</b> <b>alignment</b> and the <b>mould</b> referencing. Grinding tool alignment, grinding tool referencing and grinding tool truing also have to be done. After that polishing can be necessary to remove the anisotropic structure which remains after grinding. It can be performed manually or by a CNC-machine.|$|R

25|$|Grain Fort was {{constructed}} between 1861–68 to a heptagonal design. It initially had thirteen open emplacements carried on an earthwork, under which lay the magazines and linking passages. A semi-circular brick keep on a north-south <b>alignment</b> <b>stood</b> at {{the centre of}} the fort. It provided barrack accommodation for the garrison and was designed to be defensible, with loopholes in its front face to facilitate musket fire. Similarly, its gorge at the rear, where the main entrance stood, had crenelations to provide protection for defenders faced with a rearward attack. In front of the keep was a ditch, accessed via a gate {{at the rear of the}} fort. It had four caponiers that guarded the angles and were accessed via passages through the underlying structure. An inner ditch around the keep was covered by a further three caponiers and two demi-caponiers which led into the earthwork ramparts in one direction and into the keep in the other. The keep could also be accessed via a bridge which connected it with the terreplein.|$|R
40|$|The highly {{flattened}} {{distribution of}} satellite {{galaxies in the}} Milky Way presents a number of puzzles. Firstly, its polar <b>alignment</b> <b>stands</b> out from the planar alignments commonly found in other galaxies. Secondly, recent proper motion measurements reveal that the orbital angular momentum of at least 3, and possibly as many as 8, of the Milky Ways satellites point (within 30 degrees) along the axis of their flattened configuration, suggesting some form of coherent motion. In this paper we use a high resolution cosmological simulation to investigate whether this pattern conflicts with {{the expectations of the}} cold dark matter model of structure formation. We find that this seemingly unlikely set up occurs often: approximately 35 % of the time we find systems in which the angular momentum of 3 individual satellites point along, or close to, the short axis of the satellite distribution. In addition, in 30 % of the systems we find that the net angular momentum of the 6 best aligned satellites lies within 35 degrees of the short axis of the satellite distribution, as observed for the Milky Way.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Thermal {{distress}} in asphalt concrete pavements {{is a widespread}} problem around the world. Thermal cracking {{can be divided into}} two modes of distress: low temperature cracking and thermal fatigue cracking. Low temperature cracking results from extremely cold temperatures; thermal fatigue cracking results from daily temperature cycles. Low temperature cracking is attributed to tensile stresses induced in the asphalt concrete pavement as the temperature drops to an extremely low temperature. If the pavement is cooled, tensile stresses develop {{as a result of the}} pavement's tendency to contract. The friction between the pavement and the base layer resists the contraction. If the tensile stress equals the strength of the mixture at that temperature, a micro-crack develops at the surface of the pavement. Under repeated temperature cycles, the crack penetrates the full depth and across the asphalt concrete layer. The thermal stress restrained specimen test (TSRST) was identified as an accelerated laboratory test to evaluate the thermal cracking resistance of asphalt concrete mixtures. The TSRST system developed at OSU includes a load system, data control/acquisition system and software, temperature control system, and specimen <b>alignment</b> <b>stand.</b> The overall system is controlled by a personal computer. A TSRST is conducted by cooling an asphalt concrete specimen at a specified rate while monitoring the specimen at constant length. A typical thermally-induced stress curve is divided into two parts: relaxation and non-relaxation. The temperature at which the curve is divided into two parts is termed the transition temperature. The temperature at fracture is termed the fracture temperature and the maximum stress is the fracture strength. An extensive number of TSRSTs over a wide range of conditions were performed to investigate the thermal cracking resistance of asphalt concrete mixtures. The TSRST results provided a very strong indication of low temperature cracking resistance for all mixtures considered. A ranking of mixtures for low temperature cracking resistance based on the TSRST fracture temperature was in excellent agreement with a ranking based on the physical properties of the asphalt cements. It is highly recommended that the TSRST be used in mix evaluation to identify low temperature cracking resistance of asphalt concrete mixtures. The TSRST showed very promising results regarding the effect of all variables which are currently considered to affect the low temperature cracking of mixtures. The variables considered to have significant affect on the low temperature cracking resistance of mixtures in this study include asphalt type, aggregate type, degree of aging, cooling rate, and stress relaxation...|$|R
40|$|A lot of {{material}} {{has been published}} about strategic information system planning (SISP) methodologies. These methods {{are designed to help}} information system planners to integrate their strategies with organisational stra-tegies. Classic business system planning for strategical <b>alignment</b> (BSP/SA) theory <b>stands</b> out because it provides information systems with a reactive role regarding an organisation’s objectives and strategy.

This work was aimed at presenting a computer-based application automating {{one of the most important}} tasks in BSP/SA methodology (process-organisation matrix). This matrix allows storing information about the levels of present responsibilities in positions and processes. Automating this task has facilitated students’ analysing the process-organisation matrix during SISP workshops forming part of the Systems Management course (Systems Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Colombia). Improved results have thus arisen from such workshops. The present work aims to motivate software development for supporting SISP tasks...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{inspects}} how {{the events}} of the so called Bronze Night in Tallinn in April 2007 were re-presented in Helsingin Sanomat and Hufvudstadsbladet, the two major newspapers in Finland representing two different language groups. I describe two events in Estonia from the mid- 2000 that were related to differing memories and understanding of the past between two ethnic groups sharing the same homeland but a differing memory of its history. The aim was to find themes from the reporting that held some kind of judgement to the Estonian issue. What kinds of messages and symbolism could be defined in the reporting and did they differ? I make a well-guarded attempt to draw a parallel between the Estonian language question of 2007 between Russian speaking Estonians and Estonians, and the remote Finnish language question a century before between Swedish speaking Finns and Finns. A connection to the Finnish events in the 1920 ’s may still be found in the formation of opinions relating to a more distanced topic, here a language question in Estonia. By inspecting the articles relating to the Estonian events in 2007 by Finnish and Swedish language newspapers, I attempt to provide a new meaning or two to the events around the Bronze Soldier. I present another perspective to the Bronze Night, bringing the subject into another cultural context, where the reporting of the Bronze Night functions as the source in finding a possible addition to the current state of national memory in Finland. For a most authentic analysis of the texts and their meanings, the most important background knowledge of the Finnish language question is presented as well as the newspapers with political <b>alignment,</b> ideological <b>stand</b> and a historical review. The analysis was carried out with a traditional qualitative content analysis with the support of semiotic theories regarding denotation and connotation. The main finding lay in the symbolism. The Bronze Soldier statue’s greatest purpose was symbolic, and the main differences in the newspaper’s reporting in the Finnish cultural context was in fact in re-presenting its symbolic meaning. Furthermore, the Finnish and Swedish language newspapers would clearly take opposite sides in the matter...|$|R

Method applied {{in this study was}} descriptive method. The result of this research was hoped to be useful for teachers and students in teaching and learning process. It gave an input in teaching to emphasize classroom interaction effectively both enhance student achievement and more motivated students in solving the psychology problems, conceptual understanding with the result that the interaction between teacher and students are smooth and yield good feedback each other. Based on the result of data analysis there were four ritual constraints found: (a) ritual constraints in opening/ closing (b) Ritual constraints and backchannel signals, the teacher used verbal backchannel signals such as okay, yeah, and well. Beside, the students used ritual constraints and backchannel signals by using nonverbal backchannel signals such as: eyes contact and body <b>alignment</b> such as <b>stand</b> up and waving their hand. (c) Ritual constraints and turnover signals, the interaction between teacher and students gave signals by giving gaps/ small silences such as, slowing tempo, and falling intonation.

40|$|The flood defence in the {{historical}} town centre of Dordrecht is situated in the Voorstraat, which is a busy shopping street. The dike itself is too low at some places, but with a system of flood stop logs in the doors of buildings along the street some extra height can be reached. The reliability of the stop log system is doubted however, so plans for strengthening the flood defence are needed. One important issue for strengthening the flood defence is the climate change. Warming of the earth would lead to sea level rise and higher river discharges. The rate of climate change is unsure however and various scenarios have been made which range from minor to major changes. The water level at Dordrecht is determined by both the sea level and river discharges, so climate change could have severe consequences for the safety against flooding of Dordrecht. When {{the advice of the}} Delta Committee is followed, the safety standards of the dike rings should be heightened and much higher water levels have to be expected. Also the plans for the Rijnmond-Drechtsteden area are important for the strategy of strengthening the flood defence in the town centre of Dordrecht. A system of barriers in this area could protect Dordrecht against flooding, but {{it is also possible that}} strengthening the flood defence in the town centre of Dordrecht is still needed. Strengthening the flood defence in the Voorstraat is difficult. Therefore also a new flood defence through the part of the town centre which now lies outside the flood defence is considered. Various alignments are possible, of which a flood defence along the river, which protects the entire town centre against flooding has been elaborated. This new flood defence will consist of an automatically floating barrier in the quays. Under normal circumstances this barrier is invisible and when the water level rises the barrier automatically floats up. At one part of the <b>alignment</b> buildings <b>stand</b> with the facades directly along the river. Here a boulevard through the river will be made, separated from the buildings. By integrating the floating barrier in the structure the boulevard can be kept low. Inside the flood defence there is place for a marina and a swimming area. At five places in the alignment a harbour has to be crossed. For this purpose at four places a flood gate will be made, which under normal circumstances lies at the bottom, so it is not visible and ships can pass. When a flood is expected the gates are closed. At one place, at the largest harbour crossing, a multi-functional barrier will be made. This barrier consists of two gates which stand horizontally when retaining a flood. After the flood the gates are lifted and rotated to form a bridge and viewing platform over the harbour. Because of the floating barrier the largest part of the new flood defence will not be visible under normal circumstances, so it will have little impact on {{the historical}} town centre. Therefore it is a good and sustainable solution for protecting the entire town centre of Dordrecht against flooding for a long time. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Tese de Doutoramento (Programa Doutoral em Tecnologias e Sistemas de Informação) The {{challenges}} {{involved in}} developing information systems (which {{are able to}} adapt to rapidly changing business and technological conditions) {{are directly related to}} the importance of their alignment with the business counterpart. These challenges comprise issues that cross management and information systems domains, relating and aligning them in order to attain superior performance for the organization, while identifying its strategy and tailoring its business processes. As this relation is increasingly intertwined its concepts are conducted to pragmatic methods, incorporating both management and information systems components, for how, when and where this alignment really matters. The related topics of the alignment between business and information systems comprise diverse paths of research, though with little common ground established inside the community, where problems arouse due to the fast moving business and technological environments. According to these circumstances, the process of developing information systems to support the alignment benefits from incorporating the use of structured and model-based approaches. So, as the development of evermore complex information systems presents a challenge for the currently available methods, the use of models to support the <b>alignment</b> with business <b>stands</b> as an increasingly important issue. Following those challenges, we set out to question how to develop solutions aligning information systems with business in a model-based approach. Accordingly, we support our research on the need to understand what are the perspectives involved in aligning information systems with business, and, moreover, to comprehend in what sense model adoption drives information systems development. So, the proposed goals for this thesis are: (1) set the basis for the elicitation of business requirements in order to support a well-grounded development of information systems; (2) provide for the generation of business models based on the business requirements, while assuring their alignment and traceability; and (3) arrange for the derivation of information system architectures from the business requirements, while attaining alignment and traceability for their mutual transformation and adaptation. Several issues surrounding these goals have already been described and approached in diverse ways by other researchers, where existing approaches and associated methods achieved good results. Nevertheless, these approaches are not without their shortfalls, sometimes failing to present a complete solution, others being unable to adapt to new challenges, or even incapable of reacting to recent trends. In order to tackle these issues we propose to build upon those approaches by adapting, evolving and innovating on solutions {{in each of the three}} proposed goals, respectively intertwining with perspectives from related standards and reference models. Answering the first goal, in what regards the main contributions of this thesis, we propose to broaden the elicitation of requirements by relating functional and nonfunctional requirements from business processes. So, we present a unified metamodel representation for those requirements, accompanied by a customizable method for their joint elicitation, based-on business-driven use-cases, goals and rules. This approach adopts the Rational Unified Process (RUP) development methodology and the Business Motivation Model (BMM) standard model language representation for business requirements. Moreover, the metamodel representation and method operationalization are accompanied by a prototype support tool that completes this first contribution. For the second goal, a more business-oriented one correlated to the higher-level requirements, we propose to generate business models directly from the inferred functional and nonfunctional requirements. So, we present a three-dimensional approach built on the relation of the referred requirements with the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) reference model, where an additional mapping to the Business Model Canvas (BMC) is also made available. This proposal provides an associated metamodel representation for the relation between the elements involved and a customizable method for their operationalization, all accompanied by a prototype support tool. On the third goal, focused on system architectures and connected to the lower-level requirements, we propose to derive service-oriented participants from the functional requirements, while aligning the nonfunctional requirements with the quality characteristics of the solution to-be. First, we present an evolution of an existing method for the derivation of a logical architecture, in order to adapt it to a service-oriented approach (SOA). Then, following on the existing relation between the nonfunctional and functional side of the low-level requirements, our approach is able to associate these last with its related services on the derived architecture, in another three-dimensional approach. Additionally, a mapping of the nonfunctional requirements with the system quality characteristics (CISQ) is made available. Once more, an associated metamodel, a customizable method and a prototype support tool are also provided. The development of these three approaches is supported through the execution of tasks which originate artifacts and lead to publications associated to their respective research and development efforts, all according to the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology. These are applied in ongoing projects involving experimental scenarios in industrial settings and associated to established research reference patterns, balancing the interests of both researchers and practitioners while focused both on technology and management audiences. The results obtained from their evaluation reflect the quality and depth of our findings, helping to validate the scientific contribution of this work. Os desafios implicados no desenvolvimento de sistemas de informação (que sejam capazes de se adaptar a condições tecnológicas e de negócios em rápida mutação) estão diretamente relacionados à importância do seu alinhamento com a contraparte do negócio. Esses desafios envolvem questões que cruzam os domínios da gestão e dos sistemas de informação, relacionando-os e alinhando-os com o intuito de alcançar um desempenho superior para a organização, ao mesmo tempo que identificam a sua estratégia e adequam os seus processos de negócio. Como esta relação está cada vez mais interligada, os seus conceitos são canalizados para métodos pragmáticos, incorporando ambos os componentes de sistemas de informação e de gestão, para saber como, quando e onde este alinhamento realmente interessa. Os tópicos relacionados com o alinhamento entre negócio e sistemas de informação abrangem diversos caminhos de pesquisa, embora com poucos alicerces em comum estabelecidos dentro da comunidade, onde os problemas surgem devido às rápidas mudanças nos negócios e nos ambientes tecnológicos. De acordo com estas circunstâncias, o processo de desenvolvimento de sistemas de informação para apoiar o alinhamento beneficia de incorporar o uso de abordagens estruturadas e baseadas em modelos. Assim, dado que o desenvolvimento de sistemas de informação cada vez mais complexos apresenta um desafio para os métodos atualmente disponíveis, o uso de modelos para apoiar o alinhamento com o negócio destaca-se como uma questão cada vez mais importante. Em linha com esses desafios, estabelecemos a questão de como desenvolver soluções para alinhar sistemas de informações com o negócio numa abordagem baseada em modelos. Neste sentido, apoiamos a nossa pesquisa na necessidade de compreender quais são as perspetivas envolvidas no alinhamento dos sistemas de informação com o negócio, e, além disso, de compreender em que sentido a adoção de modelos capacita o desenvolvimento desses sistemas. Assim, os objetivos propostos para esta tese são: (1) definir as bases para o levantamento de requisitos de negócio a fim de suportar um desenvolvimento bem fundamentado de sistemas de informação; (2) disponibilizar a geração de modelos de negócio baseados nos requisitos de negócio, garantindo o alinhamento e a rastreabilidade entre ambos; e (3) estruturar a derivação de arquiteturas de sistema de informação a partir dos requisitos de negócio, preservando o alinhamento e rastreabilidade para a sua mútua transformação e adaptação. Várias questões envolvendo estes objetivos foram já descritas e tratadas de diversas maneiras por outros investigadores, tendo as abordagens existentes e os métodos associados alcançado bons resultados. No entanto, essas abordagens têm as suas lacunas, umas vezes falham em apresentar uma solução completa, noutras são ineficientes ao se adaptarem a novos desafios, ou mesmo incapazes de reagir às novas tendências. Para lidar com estas questões, propomo-nos apoiar nessas abordagens, adaptando, evoluindo e inovando em soluções para cada um dos três objetivos propostos, intersetando-as, respetivamente, com perspetivas de modelos de referência e padrões relacionados. Relativamente ao primeiro objetivo, no que concerne aos principais contributos desta tese, propomos alargar o levantamento de requisitos, relacionando os requisitos funcionais e nãofuncionais dos processos de negócios. Assim, apresentamos um meta-modelo para a representação unificada desses requisitos, acompanhado por um método personalizável para o seu levantamento conjunto, baseada em casos-de-uso, metas e regras orientadas a negócio. Esta abordagem adota a metodologia de desenvolvimento do Rational Unified Process (RUP) e a representação padrão do modelo de linguagem do Business Motivation Model (BMM), para os requisitos de negócio. Além disso, a representação meta-modelo e a operacionalização do método são acompanhados por um protótipo de uma ferramenta de suporte que completa esta primeira contribuição. Quanto ao segundo objetivo, mais orientado ao negócio e correlacionado com os requisitos de nível superior, propomos gerar modelos de negócio a partir dos requisitos funcionais e não-funcionais inferidos. Assim, apresentamos uma abordagem tridimensional, construída sobre a relação dos referidos requisitos com o modelo de referência do Balanced Scorecard (BSC), em que um mapeamento adicional para o Business Model Canvas (BMC) é também disponibilizado. Esta proposta inclui um meta-modelo para representação da relação entre os elementos envolvidos e um método personalizável para a sua operacionalização, tudo acompanhado por um protótipo de uma ferramenta de suporte. No terceiro objetivo, focado em arquiteturas de sistema e ligado aos requisitos de nível inferior, propomos derivar participantes orientados-a-serviços desde os requisitos funcionais, alinhando os requisitos não-funcionais com as características de qualidade da solução a obter. Primeiro, apresentamos uma evolução de um método existente para a derivação de uma arquitetura lógica, adaptando-o a uma abordagem-orientada-a-serviços (SOA). Assim, prosseguindo a relação existente entre o lado não-funcional e funcional dos requisitos de baixo nível, a nossa abordagem associa estes últimos com os serviços relacionados na arquitetura derivada, numa outra abordagem tridimensional. Além disso, um mapeamento dos requisitos não-funcionais com as características de qualidade do sistema (CISQ) é disponibilizado. Mais uma vez, um meta-modelo associado, um método personalizável e um protótipo da ferramenta de suporte são disponibilizados. O desenvolvimento destas três abordagens é suportado pela execução de tarefas, as quais dão origem a artefatos e levam a publicações associadas aos seus esforços de pesquisa e desenvolvimento respetivamente, tudo de acordo com a metodologia DSR. Estas são aplicadas a projetos em andamento, os quais envolvem cenários experimentais em ambientes industriais e associados a padrões de investigação de referência, equilibrando os interesses de investigadores e profissionais assim como dos diferentes públicos de tecnologia e gestão. Os resultados obtidos na sua avaliação refletem a qualidade e a profundidade dos nossos resultados, ajudando a validar a contribuição científica deste trabalho...|$|R
