5|$|<b>Mood</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} {{using the}} patient's own words, {{and can also}} be described in summary terms such as neutral, euthymic, dysphoric, euphoric, angry, anxious or apathetic. Alexithymic individuals {{may be unable to}} describe their subjective mood state. An individual who is unable to experience any pleasure may be suffering from anhedonia.|$|E
5|$|Subjunctive <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> {{occasionally}} {{used for}} some verbs, but its use is in sharp decline and few speakers perceive {{the handful of}} commonly used verbs (as for instance: vore, månne) as separate conjugations, most of them remaining only as set of idiomatic expressions.|$|E
5|$|The contemporative <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> used to {{construct}} subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if {{the subject of the}} subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative {{can also be used to}} form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.|$|E
50|$|The {{indicative}} <b>mood</b> <b>was</b> {{the default}} <b>mood,</b> and, alongside the imperative, the oldest. It {{was used for}} simple statements of fact. The indicative <b>mood</b> <b>was</b> the only <b>mood</b> to have distinctions in tense in imperfective verbs, all other <b>moods</b> <b>were</b> tenseless. The present tense used the primary endings, while the past tense used the secondary endings, as did the indicative of perfective verbs. Stative verbs used their own, entirely different set of endings in the indicative mood.|$|R
40|$|Should <b>moods</b> <b>be</b> {{regarded}} as intentional states, and, if so, {{what kind of}} intentional content do they have? I focus on irritability (understood as an angry mood) and apprehension (understood as a fearful mood), which I examine {{from the perspective of}} a teleosemantic theory of content. Eric Lormand has argued that <b>moods</b> <b>are</b> non-intentional states, distinct from emotions; Robert Solomon and Peter Goldie argue that <b>moods</b> <b>are</b> generalised emotions and that they have intentional content of a correspondingly general kind. I present a third model, on which <b>moods</b> <b>are</b> regarded, not as generalised emotions, but as states of vigilance; and I argue that, on this model, <b>moods</b> should <b>be</b> {{regarded as}} intentional states of a kind quite distinct from emotions. An advantage of this account is that it allows us to distinguish between a mood of apprehension and an episode of objectless fear...|$|R
5000|$|The finite <b>moods</b> <b>are</b> the {{indicative}} (l'indicatif), {{the imperative}} (l'impératif), and the subjunctive (le subjonctif).

5|$|The participial <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> used to {{construct}} a subordinate clause describing its subject {{in the state of}} carrying out an activity. It is used when the matrix clause and the subordinate clause have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as relative clauses.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} section in {{spirited}} 3/8 time, the predominant <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> of joyous exaltation reflecting the text from Isaiah. The structure of the choral material in this final section complements that of the first section; there a fugal passage was enclosed between two homophonic episodes; here a homophonic episode is preceded and followed by fugal passages. While the first section is preceded by the lengthy orchestral sinfonia, the final section ends with a short coda for full chorus and orchestra.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of outward {{directed}}ness <b>moods</b> might <b>be</b> directed at either {{the world as a}} whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In {{the case of}} inward directedness <b>moods</b> <b>are</b> directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness <b>moods</b> <b>are</b> directed at some combination of inward and outward things.|$|R
30|$|<b>Moods</b> <b>are</b> {{the affective}} quality of experiences, {{constantly}} experienced but often only sporadically reflected consciously (Morris 2005; Silvia and Warburton 2006). Compared to emotions, <b>moods</b> <b>are</b> lacking objects, are psychologically diffuse, relatively long lasting, and are structured simply; moreover, {{they are not}} differentiated by patterns of appraisal (Silvia and Warburton 2006).|$|R
5|$|The epistolary form unites The History of Sir Charles Grandison with Richardson's Pamela and Clarissa, but Richardson {{uses the}} form in a {{different}} way for his final work. In Clarissa, the letters emphasise the plot's drama, especially when Lovelace alters Clarissa's letters. However, the dramatic <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> replaced in Grandison with a celebration of Grandison's moral character. In addition to this lack of dramatic emphasis, the letters of Grandison do not serve to develop character, as the moral core of each character is already complete at the outset.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperative}} <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> used {{to issue}} orders. It is always {{combined with the}} second person. The optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, {{and one that is}} considered rude and is usually used to address children.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion {{is a key}} {{precursor}} to Bacon's later work, and he sustained its formal and thematic preoccupations throughout his career. The triptych format, the placement of figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames, the open mouth, the use of painterly distortion, the Furies, and {{the theme of the}} Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works. Bacon's principal mode of expression is introduced: the subjects are anatomically and physically distorted, and the <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> violent, foreboding, and relentlessly physical. In other respects the triptych stands apart from other paintings in his oeuvre. It refers directly to its inspirations, and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner. The triptych is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space; by 1948, Bacon's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{arrive in}} Comity after arguing over {{directions}} along the way. They meet a local detective, Angela White (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), {{and go to}} Boom's funeral. Scully, in a bad <b>mood,</b> <b>is</b> skeptical of these claims. The high school principal, Bob Spitz, interrupts the funeral by ranting Inquisitorial-style about Satanic cults murdering their children when suddenly the coffin starts smoking and catches on fire. Mulder and Scully go into separate rooms to interview Margi and Terri, both of whom offer an identical story about a satanic ceremony where a baby was sacrificed. Scully thinks their stories are cliché and points {{out the fact that}} the belief in a satanic conspiracy is illogical and paranoid. Looking at the latest victim's body, Mulder and Detective White find a burn mark {{in the shape of a}} horned beast; Scully says she doesn't see anything. Mulder goes to see White to apologize for Scully's behavior and the two visit the local astrologist Madame Zirinka who claims the town's crazy behavior is due to the rare planetary alignment of the planets Mars, Uranus, and Mercury. Terri and Margi watch basketball practice, lusting over one of the players, Scott, whose girlfriend is fellow cheerleader Brenda (much to Terri and Margi's displeasure). One of the other players accidentally spills a table of drinks on them, so they cause the basketball to bounce underneath the bleachers and it closes when he goes to get it, killing him. Scully is angry at Mulder for ditching her to be with Detective White.|$|E
25|$|The {{imperative}} <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> used {{to describe}} an action that the speaker wants another person to do: Duok pinigų! – Give me some money! Iš pradžių įleiskime svečius. – Let us at first invite the guests in. This <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> actively used in modern Lithuanian.|$|E
50|$|A common {{example of}} this kind of state <b>are</b> <b>moods.</b> <b>Moods</b> <b>are</b> states with phenomenal {{character}} that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. <b>Moods</b> <b>are</b> thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad at your sibling, you are afraid of a dangerous animal. People conclude that because <b>moods</b> <b>are</b> undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.|$|R

25|$|This <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> {{actively}} used {{in modern}} Lithuanian {{and one of}} its functions corresponds to the English conditional mood. The conditional <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> used to describe a hypothetical action that could take place if certain conditions were met (hence the name) or a desired action in present or in future: Panaikinus muitus, sumažėtų prekių kainos – Having eliminated customs duties, prices would go down. Conditional <b>mood</b> <b>is</b> used in conditional (if) sentences; this usage requires conditional mood in subordinate and main clauses if both actions are perceived as hypothetical: Visi laimėtų, jeigu priimtumėte šį pasiūlymą. – There would be a win-win situation for everyone if you accepted this offer.|$|E

40|$|Overweight and {{depressed}} <b>mood</b> <b>are</b> {{more common in}} knee osteoarthritis (OA) than in the general popula-tion [1 - 3], and are both positively associated with pain and activity limitations [4 - 13]. There is growing evi-dence that overweight, as indicated by body-mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m 2, {{and depressed}} <b>mood</b> <b>are</b> interrelated [14, 15], and that common biological and psychological mechanisms underlie the development of both overweight and depressed mood [16]. Therefore, the question arises whether BMI and depressed <b>mood</b> <b>are</b> independently as-sociated with pain and activity limitations in knee OA. This information may guide the design of interventions targeting bodyweight or depressed mood {{as a means to}} improve pain and activity limitations in knee OA. Two studies that examined a broad set of determi-nants of pain and activity limitations in patients with knee OA found that BMI and depressed <b>mood</b> <b>were</b> in-dependently associated with pain and activity limitation...|$|R

50|$|Under {{negative}} state relief model, helping behaviours {{are motivated}} by one’s egoistic desires. In Manucia’s study (1979), the hedonistic nature of helping behaviour was revealed and negative relief model was supported. Subjects were divided into 3 groups - happy, neutral and sad mood groups. Half of the subjects in each group were made {{to believe that their}} induced <b>mood</b> <b>was</b> fixed temporarily. Another half group believed that their <b>mood</b> <b>was</b> changeable. The results showed that saddened subjects helped more when they believed that their <b>mood</b> <b>was</b> changeable. The results supported the egoistic nature of helping behaviours as well as the negative state relief model.|$|R
