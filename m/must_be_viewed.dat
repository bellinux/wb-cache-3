25|$|In retrospect {{there is}} {{evidence}} of a lack of missionary sensitivity to many aspects of African culture, the injustices of early colonial land policies, the low priority given to theological education, and the slowness to ordain African clergy. But much as missionaries <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as principally propagators of basic religion, their work in introducing ideas of western medicine and technology undoubtedly {{had a profound impact on}} the foundations of modern public health in the region.

25|$|In 1678, however, {{flaws in}} Casaubon's dating were discerned by Ralph Cudworth, {{who argued that}} Casaubon's {{allegation}} of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the Corpus Hermeticum. Moreover, Cudworth noted Casaubon's failure to acknowledge the codification of these treatises as a late formulation of a pre-existing oral tradition. According to Cudworth, the texts <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as a terminus ad quem and not a quo. Lost Greek texts, {{and many of the}} surviving vulgate books, contained discussions of alchemy clothed in philosophical metaphor.|$|E

25|$|To Antonino Votto, Callas wasThe {{last great}} artist. When {{you think this}} woman was nearly blind, and often sang {{standing}} a good 150 feet from the podium. But her sensitivity!

25|$|A second {{dilemma for}} U.S. {{democracy}} promotion in the MENA region is aid prioritization. Critics say {{the priorities of}} Western aid <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as a whole, and therefore question the vastly greater amounts spent on military aid than democracy aid. Massive foreign aid to countries like Jordan and Egypt, for example, gives regimes the ability to both co-opt and repress their populations by supporting state job and economic infrastructures and funding state security apparatuses. This results in often contradictory U.S. positions on democracy, with officials praising Arab security structures {{that are used to}} crack down on activists and civil society while simultaneously funding technical assistance aimed at promoting democracy in Egypt and Palestine for example.|$|E

Even Great Britain's Chartists sought the same democratic goals. The Canadian rebels believed that the right of citizens {{to participate in the}} political process through the election of representatives was the most important right, and they sought to make the legislative council elective rather than appointed. When the British military crushed the rebellions, they ended any possibility the two Canadas would become republics.|$|E

25|$|King Agrippa I, in {{a letter}} to Caligula, {{enumerated}} among the provinces of the Jewish diaspora almost all the Hellenized and non-Hellenized countries of the Orient. This enumeration was far from complete as Italy and Cyrene were not included. The epigraphic discoveries from year to year augment the number of known Jewish communities but <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> with caution {{due to the lack of}} precise evidence of their numbers. According to the ancient Jewish historian Josephus, the next most dense Jewish population after the Land of Israel and Babylonia was in Syria, particularly in Antioch, and Damascus, where 10,000 to 18,000 Jews were massacred during the great insurrection. The ancient Jewish philosopher Philo gives the number of Jewish inhabitants in Egypt as one million, one-eighth of the population. Alexandria was by far the most important of the Egyptian Jewish communities. The Jews in the Egyptian diaspora were on a par with their Ptolemaic counterparts and close ties existed for them with Jerusalem. As in other Hellenistic diasporas, the Egyptian diaspora was one of choice not of imposition.|$|E
500|$|His close {{relationship}} with Deguchi introduced Ueshiba to various members of Japan's far-right; members of the ultranationalist group the Sakurakai would hold meetings at Ueshiba's dojo, and he developed a friendship with the philosopher Shūmei Ōkawa during this period, as well as meeting with Nisshō Inoue and Kozaburō Tachibana. Deguchi also offered Ueshiba's services as a bodyguard to Kingoro Hashimoto, the Sakurakai's founder. Ueshiba's commitment {{to the goal of}} world peace, stressed by many biographers, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> in the light of these relationships and his Ōmoto-kyō beliefs. His association with the extreme right-wing is understandable when one considers that Ōmoto-kyō's view of world peace was [...] of a benevolent dictatorship by the Emperor of Japan, with other nations being subjugated under Japanese rule.|$|E

He was invited to lecture in the U.S. on multiple occasions, by Robert Braidwood, William Duncan Strong, and Leslie White, but was barred from entering the country due to his socialist beliefs. Whilst working at the Institute, Childe continued writing and publishing books dealing with archaeology and prehistory. History (1947) continued his belief that prehistory and literate history <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> together, and adopted a Marxist view of history, whilst Prehistoric Migrations (1950) displayed his views on moderate diffusionism. In 1946 he had also published a paper in the Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, titled [...] "Archaeology and Anthropology" [...] which argued that the two disciplines must be used in tandem, {{something that would be}} widely accepted in the decades following his death.|$|E

In response to repeated Greek requests for return of the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon and similar requests to other museums around the world, in 2002 over 30 of the world's leading museums— including the British Museum, the Louvre, the Pergamon Museum in Berlin and the Metropolitan Museum in New York City— issued a joint statement declaring that [...] "objects acquired in earlier times <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> {{in the light of}} different sensitivities and values reflective of that earlier era" [...] and that [...] "museums serve not just the citizens of one nation but the people of every nation".|$|E
