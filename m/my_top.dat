25|$|Today, {{everybody}} pays him homage. I nearly blow <b>my</b> <b>top.</b> I {{can still}} hear {{the way he was}} whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial to make him lose. His home town of Rouen organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (il les a tous couillonnés).|$|E

500|$|Director Terry Gilliam would {{praise the}} film as [...] "a work of genius. It got people to {{understand}} what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing {{at the top of}} the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning.

[...] Evans stated regarding the death of Gary Speed that [...] "I was {{a man on a}} mission. I had a message on <b>my</b> <b>top</b> for Gary Speed which I wanted to show. I'm thankful I got the goal... the crowd started singing – it gave me goose pimples... not one person has a bad word to say about him, he was a gentleman... even people who haven't met him know how much of a nice man he was... it still hasn't hit home, it still feels surreal." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2014, Nash {{announced}} that the 2014–15 season would be his last. During the preseason, he experienced back pain, and further aggravated his back while lifting luggage. On October 23, {{less than a week}} before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash's 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury. Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back. Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court this season has been <b>my</b> <b>top</b> priority, and it is disappointing to {{not be able to do}} that right now. I work very hard to stay healthy, and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult. I will continue to support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long-term health." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Ebert noted his own [...] "tendency {{to place}} what I now {{consider}} the year's best film in second place, perhaps because I {{was trying to}} make some kind of point with <b>my</b> <b>top</b> pick," [...] adding, [...] "In 1968, I should have ranked [...] above The Battle of Algiers. [...] In 1971, McCabe and Mrs. Miller was better than The Last Picture Show. [...] In 1974, Chinatown was probably better, in a different way, than Scenes from a Marriage. [...] In 1976, how could I rank Small Change above Taxi Driver? [...] In 1978, I would put Days of Heaven above An Unmarried Woman. And in 1980, of course, Raging Bull was a better film than The Black Stallion... although I later chose Raging Bull as the best film of the entire decade of the 1980s, it was only the second-best film of 1980... am I the same person I was in 1968, 1971, or 1980? [...] I hope not." ...|$|E
500|$|Zeta's Lad trainer John Upson {{was among}} those {{trainers}} who were particularly angry, feeling, correctly as it transpired, that this was his only {{chance to have a}} leading contender in a National. Before the race Upson had said: [...] "I'm not someone who always thinks their horse is going to win, but this year I just have a feeling." [...] The horse was in mid-division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple, riding in his third National, realised the race was not on. Upson later revealed: [...] "The reason I really blew <b>my</b> <b>top</b> was, that once the initial fiasco had happened, there was the starter standing there saying, 'Right, I'm disqualifying everything, apart from the nine that didn't go. I'll start the race again with nine runners.' At that stage I just thought the world had gone completely mad. The adrenaline was going and I was jumping up and down." ...|$|E

500|$|Avatar {{received}} compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as [...] "the most evocative {{and amazing}} science-fiction movie since Star Wars" [...] and others calling it [...] "audacious and awe inspiring", [...] "master class", and [...] "brilliant". Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian {{is also a}} noted fan of the film. On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: [...] "It's not in <b>my</b> <b>top</b> three James Cameron films.... t what point in the film {{did you have any}} doubt {{what was going to happen}} next?". For French filmmaker Luc Besson, Avatar opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series Valérian and Laureline that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film. TIME ranked Avatar number 3 in their list of [...] "The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)" [...] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-TIME 100 list, and IGN listed Avatar as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.|$|E
500|$|Cotto and Margarito's {{aggressive}} boxing styles led to much speculation of {{a potential}} fight of the year candidate. Junior welterweight titleholder Paulie Malignaggi said that the fight would be [...] "pure entertainment", and HBO commentator Jim Lampley said that [...] "I'm asking for one of <b>my</b> <b>top</b> 10fights in my 22years of calling fights on television". Dave Larzelere of Sporting News wrote that the bout had [...] "the potential {{to be one of}} those epic Irresistible Force vs. Immoveable Object kind of battles that we talk about forever afterwards, à la Hagler/Hearns or Corrales/Castillo". Jeff Haney of the Las Vegas Sun described the fight as [...] "not only the sport’s most promising matchup of the year. It also conjures memories of past fights in which regional or national pride was at stake", noting the rivalry between Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Arizona Republic wrote, [...] "Cotto, an impassive and intimidating Puerto Rican, and Margarito, a patient and tough Mexican, are another chapter in a rivalry rich in legends and still productive". Yahoo! Sports writer Kevin Iole felt that the boxing match would provide a performance similar to that of the fight between Jose Luis Castillo and Diego Corrales, which was named fight of the year by The Ring magazine.|$|E

[...] A certain single room in A Link to the Past [...] contained 45 Blue Rupees and a note bearing a greeting from Chris Houlihan, {{the winner of the}} contest. The room has been found through five different methods, and was intended as a crash prevention measure; the game would send players to this room if it couldn't determine where Link was going when he goes to another area. The message reads: [...] "My name is Chris Houlihan. This is <b>my</b> <b>top</b> secret room. Keep it between us, okay?" [...] There was not wide awareness of the room until more than a decade after the release of A Link to the Past after the increased popularity of the Internet and Super NES emulators. The Game Boy Advance re-release of A Link to the Past titled [...] removed the ability to access the room, though it could still be found in the game's code. The Virtual Console re-releases on the Wii and Wii U of A Link to the Past however allowed players to access the room.|$|E
