2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of his career Hayek made a number of {{contributions}} to social and political philosophy, which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge, and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions. [...] He argues in favour of a society organised around a <b>market</b> <b>order,</b> in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules, and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. [...] These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge. [...] Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic, free-market polity would be self-regulating {{to such a degree that}} it would be 'a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it'.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} shows that the existing literature on milk <b>marketing</b> <b>orders</b> misses an important effect. Previous work ignores the interaction of <b>marketing</b> <b>orders</b> with milk grading regulation. We model this interaction and show that producer benefits from <b>marketing</b> <b>orders</b> have been smaller than previous work suggests, and, under some conditions, may even be negative. Additional costs of producing fluid grade milk, omitted from previous welfare analyses, reduce producer benefits from <b>marketing</b> <b>orders.</b> Estimates of the additional cost indicate that this previously unmeasured effect is a significant component of the total welfare effect of <b>marketing</b> <b>orders.</b> An econometric model is developed to explain the variation in the fluid grade share of milk across states and time as a function of <b>marketing</b> <b>order</b> policy. Regression results support the hypothesis that <b>marketing</b> <b>orders</b> have encouraged the shift towards production of fluid-grade milk. Marketing,...|$|R

5000|$|The absurd {{result of}} {{valuable}} stocks being executed for a penny likely was {{attributable to the}} use of a practice called [...] "stub quoting." [...] When a <b>market</b> <b>order</b> is submitted for a stock, if available liquidity has already been taken out, the <b>market</b> <b>order</b> will seek the next available liquidity, regardless of price. When a market maker’s liquidity has been exhausted, or if it is unwilling to provide liquidity, it may at that time submit what is called a stub quote—for example, an offer to buy a given stock at a penny. A stub quote is essentially a place holder quote because that quote would never—it is thought—be reached. When a <b>market</b> <b>order</b> is seeking liquidity and the only liquidity available is a penny-priced stub quote, the <b>market</b> <b>order,</b> by its terms, will execute against the stub quote. In this respect, automated trading systems will follow their coded logic regardless of outcome, while human involvement likely would have prevented these orders from executing at absurd prices. As noted below, we are reviewing the practice of displaying stub quotes that are never intended to be executed.|$|E
40|$|In order-driven markets, limit-order book (LOB) {{resiliency}} is {{an important}} microscopic indicator of market quality when the order book is hit by a liquidity shock and plays {{an essential role in}} the design of optimal submission strategies of large orders. However, the evolutionary behavior of LOB resilience around liquidity shocks is not well understood empirically. Using order flow data sets of Chinese stocks, we quantify and compare the LOB dynamics characterized by the bid-ask spread, the LOB depth and the order intensity surrounding effective <b>market</b> <b>orders</b> with different aggressiveness. We find that traders are more likely to submit effective <b>market</b> <b>orders</b> when the spreads are relatively low, the same-side depth is high, and the opposite-side depth is low. Such phenomenon is especially significant when the initial spread is 1 tick. Although the resiliency patterns show obvious diversity after different types of <b>market</b> <b>orders,</b> the spread and depth can return to the sample average within 20 best limit updates. The price resiliency behavior is dominant after aggressive <b>market</b> <b>orders,</b> while the price continuation behavior is dominant after less-aggressive <b>market</b> <b>orders.</b> Moreover, the effective <b>market</b> <b>orders</b> produce asymmetrical stimulus to limit orders when the initial spreads equal to 1 tick. Under this case, effective buy <b>market</b> <b>orders</b> attract more buy limit orders and effective sell <b>market</b> <b>orders</b> attract more sell limit orders. The resiliency behavior of spread and depth is linked to limit order intensity. Comment: 18 pages inclusing 8 figure...|$|R
