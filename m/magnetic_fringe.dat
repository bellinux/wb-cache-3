Methods and materials: A 1. 5  T MRI linac was installed in a treatment room, neighboured by three accelerators. A detector array was used to acquire gantry angle dependent beam flatness and symmetry parameters. Measurements were performed before and after ramping up the magnet, and again after adjusting the beam steering for deviations in flatness and symmetry. Results: Changes in beam symmetry as a function of gantry angle of up to 4 % (Linac A) and 1 % (Linac B) were observed, causing beam parameters to be out of clinical tolerance. After steering adjustment, the parameters were within tolerance for all gantry angles. Linac C did not show any significant change.

The CBXMR system will harness the complementary strengths of both modalities to guide and deploy a bioprosthetic valve into the aortic annulus of the heart without coronary artery obstruction. A major challenge in constructing this system is ensuring proper operation of a rotating-anode x-ray tube in the MRI <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringe</b> field environment.

The authors found that in the fringe field acting on the x-ray tube at the clinical location for the x-ray C-arm (4 mT), focal spot size increased by only 2 %, so the fringe field did not limit the resolving power of the x-ray system.

We find that such a slow ion beam is very sensitive to space-charge forces, but also that the neutralization of the beam's space charge by secondary electrons is virtually complete for beam currents up to at least 0. 5 mA. The beam emittance directly behind the extraction system is 65 pi mm mrad and {{is determined by the}} fact that the ion beam is extracted in the strong <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringe</b> field of the ion source. The relatively large emittance of the beam and its non-paraxiality lead, in combination with a relatively small magnet gap, to significant beam losses and a five-fold increase of the effective beam emittance during its transport through the analyzing magnet. The calculated beam profile and phase-space distributions in the image plane of the analyzing magnet agree well with measurements. The kinematic and magnet aberrations have been studied using the calculated second-order transfer map of the analyzing magnet, with which we can reproduce the phase-space distributions of the ion beam behind the analyzing magnet. Using the transfer map and trajectory calculations we have worked out an aberration compensation scheme based on the addition of compensating hexapole components to the main dipole field by modifying the shape of the poles.

40|$|Hybrid closed bore x-ray∕MRI {{systems are}} being {{developed}} to improve the safety and efficacy of percutaneous aortic valve replacement procedures by harnessing the complementary strengths of the x-ray and MRI modalities in a single interventional suite without requiring patient transfer between two rooms. These systems are composed of an x-ray C-arm in close proximity (≈ 1 m) to an MRI scanner. The MRI <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringe</b> field can cause the electron beam in the x-ray tube to deflect. The deflection causes the x-ray field of view to shift position on the detector receptacle. This could result in unnecessary radiation exposure to {{the patient and the}} staff in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Therefore, the electron beam deflection must be corrected. The authors developed an active magnetic shielding system that can correct for electron beam deflection to within an accuracy of 5 % without truncating the field of view or increasing exposure to the patient. This system was able to automatically adjust to different field strengths as the external magnetic field acting on the x-ray tube was changed. Although a small torque was observed on the shielding coils of the active shielding system when they were placed in a magnetic field, this torque will not impact their performance if they are securely mounted on the x-ray tube and the C-arm.

This system will harness the complementary strengths of both modalities to improve clinical outcome. A key component of the CBXMR system will be a rotating anode x-ray tube to produce high-quality x-ray images. There are challenges in positioning an x-ray tube in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringe</b> field of the MRI magnet. Here, the effects of an external magnetic field on x-ray tube induction motors of radiography x-ray tubes and the corresponding reduction of x-ray tube heat loadability are investigated. Anode rotation frequency fanode was unaffected when the external magnetic field Bb was parallel to the axis of rotation of the anode but decreased when Bb was perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The experimental fanode values agreed with predicted values to within ± 3 % over a Bb range of 0 – 30 mT. The MRI fringe field at the proposed location of the x-ray tube mounted on the C-arm (≈ 4 mT) reduced fanode by only 1 %, so x-ray tube heat loadability will not be compromised when using CBXMR systems for percutaneous aortic valve replacement procedures.

The model is intended for applications where both accuracy and solution time are critical. Axisymmetric <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringing</b> and leakage permeances were derived in order to capture nonlinear magnetic field phenomena that affect force and inductance. ^ The tradeoffs between solid-center and hollow-center electromagnets were investigated. It was shown with both simulation and measurement that a hollow-center electromagnet has a 37. 7 % shorter useful stroke due to increased <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringing</b> and leakage (from 4. 0 mm to 2. 5 mm). However, it was also shown that the hollow-center electromagnet has a 70 % improved turn-off response (from 617 ms to 362 ms). A single objective optimization study was performed demonstrating that hollow-center electromagnets are advantageous and can up to 204 % increased dynamic response for systems where dynamics are dominated by eddy current lag. ^ Electromagnets experience dynamic lag when turning on and off due to inductance and eddy currents. Coil driving methods, such as peak-and-hold, are often used to minimize turn-on lag by using high initial voltages and currents. However, circuits often do not address turn-off lag, which can be significant. This work investigates the effects of using momentary reversed current pulses to increase the decay rate of eddy currents in order to improve electromagnet turnoff speed. It is shown with simulation and measurement that driving circuitry can improve dynamic turn-off response by as much as 944 % (from 1556 ms to 149 ms), but increase turn-off electrical energy consumption and heat generation by as much as 1030 % (from 1. 0 J to 11. 4 J). ...|$|R
40|$|Random, {{spatially}} uncorrelated nuclear-hyperfine {{fields in}} organic materials dramatically affect electronic transport properties such as electrical conductivity, photoconductivity, and electroluminescence. The influence of these nuclear-hyperfine fields can {{be overwhelmed by}} a uniform externally applied magnetic field, even at room temperature where the thermodynamic influences of the resulting nuclear and electronic Zeeman splittings are negligible. As a result, even in applied magnetic fields as small as 10  mT, the kinetics of exciton formation, bipolaron formation, and single-carrier hopping are all modified at room temperature, leading to changes in transport properties in excess of 10 % in many materials. Here, we demonstrate a new method of controlling the electrical conductivity of an organic film at room temperature, using the spatially varying <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringe</b> fields of a magnetically unsaturated ferromagnet.

The size of the effect, the magnetic-field dependence, and hysteretic properties rule out a model where the fringe fields from the ferromagnet provide a local magnetic field that changes the electronic transport properties through the hyperfine field, and show that our effects originate from electrical transport through the inhomogeneous fringe fields coming from the ferromagnet. Surprisingly, these inhomogeneous fringe fields vary over length scales roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger than the hopping length in the organic materials, challenging the fundamental models of magnetoresistance in organic layers which require the correlation length of the inhomogeneous field to correspond roughly to the hopping length...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{implement}} a unique low-field open magnetic resonance scanner for perioperative imaging in neurosurgery. A paradigm was created for joint intraoperative/interventional MRI, including premises, surgical practice and an operational model. The feasibility of the paradigm was tested in clinical work. The joint use of the facilities between the Departments of Neurosurgery and Diagnostic Radiology was found to enhance the economic rationale and provide for perioperative imaging. It was also found to be organizationally viable in the long run. Intraoperative MRI was implemented and studied in connection with neuronavigation and other intraoperative instruments, tools and imaging modalities. The unique shut down possibility of the magnet enabled staged operating-imaging practice, use of non-MRI-compatible instruments and devices, multimodal imaging with navigation, and avoidance of safety risks associated with operating in <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringe</b> fields. Two dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging sequences, which used undersampled projection reconstruction, were implemented in the low-field scanner. The applicability of these imaging sequences to follow contrast enhancement of meningiomas was studied in laboratory experiments and in two patient cases. The laboratory experiments showed a nearly linear response in signal intensity to the concentration of gadopentetate dimeglumine in purified water up to 1. 25 mM. The patient cases showed results consistent with an earlier study performed at high-field strength. The potential of low-field MRI study including dynamic contrast enhanced imaging to predict surgical and histopathologic characteristics of meningiomas was studied in a series of 21 patients. Dynamic contrast enhanced imaging could be used to evaluate microvessel densities of meningiomas.

We demonstrate an interaction be-tween the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringing</b> fields produced by domain walls within planar permalloy nanowires and a cloud of ultracold 87 Rb atoms. This interaction is manifested through the realisation of a magnetic atom mirror produced by a two-dimensional domain wall array. The interaction is tuned through the reconfiguration of the micromagnetic structure. Analytic modelling of the fringing fields is developed and shows good agreement with calculations based on micromagnetically simulated struc-tures. The accurate and rapid calculation of the fringing fields permits simu-lation of the resulting atom dynamics, which agrees well with data. In turn, we use the atom dynamics as a probe of the micromagnetic reconfiguration processes that take place and observe a collective behaviour which is both reliably reproducible and in agreement with alternative, conventional mag-netometry. We also observe evidence of stochastic behaviour, characteristic of superparamagnetic systems. We consider the development of a more advanced spintronics-based atom chip which will allow for the creation of extremely tight mobile atom traps. We consider the problems associated with ensuring that the trapping poten-tial is adiabatic, sufficiently deep, and technically feasible.

40|$|Purpose: With the {{introduction}} of hybrid PET/MRI systems, {{it has become more}} likely that the cyclotron and MRI systems will be located close to each other. This study considered the interference between a cyclotron and a superconducting MRI system. Methods: Interactions between cyclotrons and MRIs are theoretically considered. The main interference {{is expected to be the}} perturbation of the magnetic field in the MRI due to switching on or off the magnetic field of the cyclotron. MR imaging is distorted by a dynamic spatial gradient of an external inplane magnetic field larger than 0. 5 - 0. 04 μT/m, depending on the specific MR application. From the design of a cyclotron, it is expected that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringe</b> field at large distances behaves as a magnetic dipolar field. This allows estimation of the full dipolar field and its spatial gradients from a single measurement. Around an 18 MeV cyclotron (Cyclone, IBA), magnetic field measurements were performed on 5 locations and compared with calculations based upon a dipolar field model. Results: At the measurement locations the estimated and measured values of the magnetic field component and its spatial gradients of the inplane component were compared, and found to agree within a factor 1. 1 for the magnetic field and within a factor of 1. 5 for the spatial gradients of the field. In the specific case of the 18 MeV cyclotron with a vertical magnetic field and a 3 T superconducting whole body MR system, a minimum distance of 20 m has to be considered to prevent interference. Conclusions: This study showed that a dipole model is sufficiently accurate to predict the interference of a cyclotron on a MRI scanner, for site planning purposes. The cyclotron and a whole body MRI system considered in this study need to be placed more than 20 m apart, or magnetic shielding should be utilized. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|E
40|$|Introduction At WTTC 14 we {{presented}} {{data on the}} target yields of our GE PETtrace C- 11 HP target {{in comparison to the}} target yields we had been getting on the MC 17 prior to its decommissioning 1. Discussion with other attendees alerted us {{to the fact that the}} target may be too “thin”, allowing the beam to spread out and interact with the walls, which could result in a lower target yield. Additionally, a GE service engineer indicated that we could be striking the top of the target with some of the beam, due both to target thinning and the “banana” effect from the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringe</b> fields. Experiments were carried out to determine the potential magnitude of this effect and the efficacy of potential solutions. Material and Methods All experiments were performed on a GE PET-trace cyclotron. The first set of experiments was performed on the C- 11 HP target in its natural mounting state (no aids). The change is gas pressure as a function of beam current was measured, from 5 to 70 microamps for three different gas fill pressures: 210, 230 and 250 PSI. The second set of experiments was performed after mechanically lifting the back end of the target with a box, changing the target angle from 23. 9 degrees past horizontal to 25. 2 degrees past horizontal. While this change in angle does not seem drastic, it did pick up all the slack in the target mount due the sagging of the target from its longer length than other GE targets. The change in gas pressure as a function of beam current was measured, from 5 to 80 microamps for four different gas fill pressures: 190, 210, 230 and 250 PSI. (Note that the box is a temporary solution and the target will sag over time without a more permanent solution for supporting the back end of the target.) Results and Conclusion The graphical results of pressure rise as a function of beam current are shown in FIGURE 1. Note that measurements were stopped when the pressure approached 470 PSI, based on advice from GE engineers. There is some flattening out for the 190 -PSI data, even with the increase in angle as an attempt to counteract the banana effect (note that GE’s recommended fill pressure is 187 PSI). Increases in the fill pressure helped in keeping the target thick, but with the tradeoff that less beam can be put onto the target before reaching the maximum specified pressure. Final-ly, using a lifting mechanism to raise the back of the target also helped to prevent thinning, as seen in the r-squared values for the linear fit, shown in TABLE 1. The data presented indicate that a shorter target that can withstand higher pressures could be beneficial for the PETtrace cyclotron, allowing the beam to fully stop before striking the walls, be it through target thinning or the “banana” effect while still allowing the user to run high beam currents...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: In recent times, {{longitudinal}} field MRI-linac {{systems have}} been proposed for 6 MV MRI-guided radiotherapy (MRIgRT). The magnetic field is parallel with the beam axis and so will alter the transport properties of any electron contamination particles. The purpose of this work {{is to provide a}} first investigation into the potential effects of the MR and fringe magnetic fields on the electron contamination as it is transported toward a phantom, in turn, providing an estimate of the expected patient skin dose changes in such a modality. METHODS: Geant 4 Monte Carlo simulations of a water phantom exposed to a 6 MV x-ray beam were performed. Longitudinal magnetic fields of strengths between 0 and 3 T were applied to a 30 [*]×[*] 30 [*]×[*] 20 cm(3) phantom. Surrounding the phantom there is a region where the magnetic field is at full MRI strength, consistent with clinical MRI systems. Beyond this the fringe magnetic field entering the collimation system is also modeled. The MRI-coil thickness, fringe field properties, and isocentric distance are varied and investigated. Beam field sizes of 5 [*]×[*] 5, 10 [*]×[*] 10, 15 [*]×[*] 15 and 20 [*]×[*] 20 cm(2) were simulated. Central axis dose, 2 D virtual entry skin dose films, and 70 μm skin depth doses were calculated using high resolution scoring voxels. RESULTS: In the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field, electron contamination from the linear accelerator is encouraged to travel almost directly toward the patient surface with minimal lateral spread. This results in a concentration of electron contamination within the x-ray beam outline. This concentration is particularly encouraged if the fringe field encompasses the collimation system. Skin dose increases of up to 1000 % were observed for certain configurations and increases above Dmax were common. In nonmagnetically shielded cases, electron contamination generated from the jaw faces and air column is trapped and propagated almost directly to the phantom entry region, giving rise to intense dose hot spots inside the x-ray treatment field. These range up to 1000 % or more of Dmax at the CAX, depending on field size, isocenter, and coil thickness. In the case of a fully magnetically shielded collimation system and the lowest MRI field of 0. 25 T, the entry skin dose is expected to increase to at least 40 %, 50 %, 65 %, and 80 % of Dmax for 5 [*]×[*] 5, 10 [*]×[*] 10, 15 [*]×[*] 15, and 20 [*]×[*] 20 cm(2), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Electron contamination from the linac head and air column may cause considerable skin dose increases or hot spots at the beam central axis on the entry side of a phantom or patient in longitudinal field 6 MV MRIgRT. This depends heavily on the properties of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fringe</b> field entering the linac beam collimation system. The skin dose increase is also related to the MRI-coil thickness, the fringe field, and the isocenter distance of the linac. The results of this work indicate that the properties of the MRI fringe field, electron contamination production, and transport must be considered carefully during the design stage of a longitudinal MRI-linac syste...|$|E

40|$|Journal articlePurpose: Monte Carlo (MC) {{simulation}} can be {{used for}} accurate electron beam treatment planning and modeling. Measurement of large electron fields, with the applicator removed and secondary collimator wide open, has been shown to provide accurate simulation parameters, including asymmetry in the measured dose, for the full range of clinical field sizes and patient positions. Recently, disassembly of the treatment head of a linear accelerator has been used to refine the simulation of the electron beam, setting tightly measured constraints on source and geometry parameters used in simulation. The simulation did not explicitly include the known deflection of the electron beam by a <b>fringe</b> <b>magnetic</b> field from the bending magnet, which extended into the treatment head. Instead, the secondary scattering foil and monitor chamber were unrealistically laterally offset to account for the beam deflection. This work is focused on accounting for this <b>fringe</b> <b>magnetic</b> field in treatment head simulation. Methods: The magnetic field below the exit window of a Siemens Oncor linear accelerator was measured with a Tesla-meter from 0 to 12 cm from the exit window and 1 - 3 cm off-axis. Treatment head simulation was performed with the EGSnrc/BEAMnrc code, modified to incorporate the effect of the magnetic field on charged particle transport. Simulations were used to analyze the sensitivity of dose profiles to various sources of asymmetry in the treatment head. This included the lateral spot offset and beam angle at the exit window, the <b>fringe</b> <b>magnetic</b> field and independent lateral offsets of the secondary scattering foil and electron monitor chamber. Simulation parameters were selected within the limits imposed by measurement uncertainties. Calculated dose distributions were then compared with those measured in water. Results: The magnetic field was a maximum at the exit window, increasing from 0. 006 T at 6 MeV to 0. 020 T at 21 MeV and dropping to approximately 5 % of the maximum at the secondary scattering foil. It was up to three times higher in the bending plane, away from the electron gun, and symmetric within measurement uncertainty in the transverse plane. Simulations showed the magnetic field resulted in an offset of the electron beam of 0. 80 cm (mean) at the machine isocenter for the exit window only configuration. The fringe field resulted in a 3. 5 %- 7. 6 % symmetry and 0. 25 - 0. 35 cm offset of the clinical beam R-max profiles. With the magnetic field included in simulations, a single (realistic) position of the secondary scattering foil and monitor chamber was selected. Measured and simulated dose profiles showed agreement to an average of 2. 5 %/ 0. 16 cm (maximum: 3 %/ 0. 2 cm), which is a better match than previously achieved without incorporating the magnetic field in the simulation. The undulations from the 3 stepped layers of the secondary scattering foil, evident in the measured profiles of the higher energy beams, are now aligned with those in the simulated beam. The simulated <b>fringe</b> <b>magnetic</b> field had negligible effect on the central axis depth dose curves and cross-plane dose profiles. Conclusions: The <b>fringe</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is a significant contributor to the electron beam in-plane asymmetry. With the magnetic field included explicitly in the simulation, realistic monitor chamber and secondary scattering foil positions have been achieved, and the calculated fluence and dose distributions are more accurate.
