25|$|Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood on July 13 {{at about}} 9:30a.m. Less {{than three hours}} later, they drove away in a car {{belonging}} to Harry Walters, who was unconscious, and his wife, Marlene, 43, who had been raped and beaten to death. Harry Walters survived and later testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camper he had offered for sale. While Walters {{sat on the couch}} and discussed the trailer title with Coleman, Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Walters {{on the back of the}} head with it. The impact of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of bone against Mr. Walters' brain, and he remembered little else of the incident beyond that point. Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45p.m., where she found her mother dead at the bottom of the basement steps, and her father still alive. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her head was covered with a bloody sheet. The coroner indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of locking pliers, covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained <b>magazine</b> <b>rack</b> located in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.|$|E

500|$|At {{the scene}} of the crime, the pair deduce Krusty could not have been the robber because the robber used the {{microwave}} not suitable for those with a pacemaker, and read at the <b>magazine</b> <b>rack.</b> They go to Sideshow Bob with the intention of finding if Krusty had any enemies, but are given tickets to his show. At the live broadcast, Bart is invited up on stage with Sideshow Bob, where he points out the facts regarding the microwave and magazine, which Sideshow Bob dismisses. When Sideshow Bob says he has [...] "a lot of big shoes to fill", Bart remembers how Homer stepped on the robber's foot, causing him to scream in pain. Bart realizes that despite wearing clown shoes all the time, Krusty never would have felt Homer stepping on them due to his small feet. Bart then deduces that Sideshow Bob is the real robber, since he had the most to gain through Krusty's downfall and has large feet. To prove his theory, he hits the end of Sideshow Bob's shoe with a mallet, causing Sideshow Bob to scream in pain and exposing him as the robber to the public. The police, having watched the show, realize they wrongfully put Krusty in jail for a crime he did not commit and head down to the studio to arrest Sideshow Bob.|$|E

It is important to challenge ourselves to write in the genres that we are unfamiliar with. The more we write the better we become as fiction writers, non-fiction writers, playwrights, screenplay writers, journalists, poets, research and essay writers."My more recent work has been concentrated in the area of media production for feature films and television documentaries. I believe television and the big screen is the most powerful media available to us today.The importance of our visibility in these areas writing and the media is for our children. They deserve to perform our work on stage and film. Always they seek us on the shelves of libraries, <b>magazine</b> <b>racks,</b> and newspaper stands.

Subscription places a certain obligation or onus on the subscriber to at least glance through, if not read, the thing. Secondly, there are those casual and curious readers that come across the journal in bookshops or on <b>magazine</b> <b>racks</b> at libraries. Being a regular browser, I have always been fascinated with the browsing habits of readers. It is often said that {{you can tell a}} lot about a person by what they read. Then, there are those in the industry-academics, publishers writers and practitioners, just keeping up with what is hot and what is not. And finally, there are those who position themselves as queer. This last category of readers, I would suggest, are in fact the primary target audience and market for queer issues of journals. In proposing this, however, I am only too keenly aware of how slippery this category is...|$|R

Such a format, Warren explained, averted the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, the comic-book industrys self-censorship body: The Comics Code saved the industry from turmoil, but at the same time, it had a cleansing kind of effect on comics, making them [...] "clean, proper and family-oriented" ...
