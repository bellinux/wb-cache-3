5|$|A. b. lichtensteinii (Peters, 1849) : Known as Lichtenstein's hartebeest. Inhabits the <b>miombo</b> {{woodlands}} {{of eastern}} and southern Africa. It is native to Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|T. o. livingstonii (Sclater, 1864; Livingstone's eland): {{also called}} kaufmanni, niediecki, selousi and triangularis. It {{is found in}} the Central Zambezian <b>Miombo</b> woodlands. Livingstone's eland has a brown pelt with up to twelve stripes.|$|E
5|$|In the low-lying {{parts of}} the country fever trees, mopane, combretum and baobabs abound. Much of the country is covered by <b>miombo</b> woodland, {{dominated}} by brachystegia species and others. Among the numerous flowers and shrubs are hibiscus, flame lily, snake lily, spider lily, leonotus, cassia, tree wisteria and dombeya. There are around 350 species of mammals that can be found in Zimbabwe. There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), <b>miombo</b> woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|However, {{perhaps the}} richest birding areas of Kasanka are the {{extensive}} tracts of <b>miombo</b> woodland. A variety of specialist species occur here, {{many of which}} are not found outside the sub-region, these include black-collared and green-capped eremomelas, racket-tailed roller, rufous-bellied and <b>miombo</b> grey tits, grey penduline tit, woodland and bushveld pipit, spotted creeper, white-tailed blue flycatcher, Böhm's flycatcher, yellow-bellied hyliota, red-capped crombec, Cabanis's bunting, Reichard's and black-eared seedeater, <b>miombo</b> scrub robin, <b>miombo</b> rock thrush, thick-billed cuckoo, Anchieta's sunbird, and Anchieta's, Whyte's and <b>miombo</b> pied barbets.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{habitats}} in the park. Brachystegia woodland, otherwise known as <b>Miombo</b> Woodland, covers around 70% of Kasanka’s surface area, interspersed with grassy dambos. It is very rich in tree species and in many places forms a half closed canopy but also supports a well-developed herbaceous stratum. A high frequency of fires removes this stratum and young saplings and leads to <b>Miombo</b> Woodland with large, widely separated trees. Decades of “early burning” in the park have resulted in more natural <b>Miombo</b> with a strong presence of young trees and thicket species.|$|E
25|$|Mopane {{woodland}} savannah predominates in the area, {{with smaller}} areas of <b>miombo</b> and Rhodesian teak woodland and scrubland savannah. Riverine forest with palm trees lines {{the banks and}} islands above the falls. The most notable aspect of the area's vegetation though is the rainforest nurtured by the spray from the falls, containing plants rare for the area such as pod mahogany, ebony, ivory palm, wild date palm {{and a number of}} creepers and lianas. Vegetation has suffered in recent droughts, and so have the animals that depend on it, particularly antelope.|$|E
25|$|It tolerates a {{range of}} dry or mesic habitats, {{typically}} bushy grassland or sparsely wooded savannah. It also occurs along the fringes of marshes, in woodland clearings or in the fragmented ecotone of woodland and grassland. It is present from near sea level in the south, to about 3,000 meters near the equator. In Zimbabwe it occurs from 900 to 1,800 meters, and in East Africa from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. Termitaria, bushes, small trees or fence posts provide perches for display, while a combination of tall and short grass provides cover and foraging space. In southern Africa it occurs only sparsely in grassy fynbos, grassy karoo and upland sour grasslands, but has high reporting rates in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe, in <b>miombo</b> and in sweet or mixed grasslands.|$|E
500|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} {{are mainly}} found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas in {{southern and eastern}} Africa, thriving {{in areas that are}} neither too wet nor too arid. They can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open woodland floodplains. Trees such as Brachystegia and Combretum are common in these areas. Blue wildebeest can tolerate arid regions as long as a potable water supply is available, normally within about [...] distance. The southern limit of the blue wildebeest stops at the Orange River, while the western limit is bounded by Lake Victoria and Mt Kenya. The range does not include montane or temperate grasslands. These wildebeest are rarely found at altitudes in excess of [...] With the exception of a small population of Cookson's wildebeest that occurs in the Luangwa Valley (Zambia), the wildebeest is absent in the wetter parts of the southern savanna country, and particularly is not present in <b>miombo</b> woodlands.|$|E
500|$|The {{distribution}} of the Brazza's martin was initially poorly studied, although it is now known to breed {{in the south of}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Republic of the Congo, and in northern Angola. There is one probable sighting from southeast Gabon. In the breeding season this martin is found near rivers with the steep banks that are needed for the nest burrows. Suitable habitat occurs along lowland tropical rivers like the Congo or rivers with sandbanks in the highlands of Angola. The highland locations have wide grassy riverways running through <b>miombo</b> woodlands, whereas the Congo Basin is tropical forest with over [...] of rain a year. The lowland habitats are a patchwork of dry, seasonally flooded and permanently wet woodland, and seasonally flooded savanna. This martin seems to be able to adapt to open savanna habitats containing Hymenocardia acida, in which it will roost overnight when not breeding, and is therefore not heavily dependent on the neighbouring forests as long as the riverine breeding sites survive.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the Somali ostrich may be better considered a full species, {{but there is no}} consensus among experts about this. The Tree of Life Project, The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World and [...] recognize it as a different species, but Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World does not. BirdLife International has reviewed the proposed split and accepted it. Mitochondrial DNA haplotype comparisons suggest that it diverged from the other ostriches not quite 4 mya due to formation of the East African Rift. Hybridization with the subspecies that evolved southwestwards of its range, S. c. massaicus, has apparently been prevented from occurring on a significant scale by ecological separation, the Somali ostrich preferring bushland where it browses middle-height vegetation for food while the Masai ostrich is, like the other subspecies, a grazing bird of the open savanna and <b>miombo</b> habitat.|$|E
2500|$|Udzungwa Mountains National Park {{is part of}} the Eastern Arc Mountains (with an area of [...] {{comprising}} {{mountain ranges}} from Taita Hills in Southern Kenya to the Makambako Gap in South central Tanzania) or the African Galapagos, extends over an area of [...] with hill ranging in elevation between [...] in the Park and [...] of Lohomero peak (highest in the park). The park's habitat covers tropical rainforest, mountain forest, <b>miombo</b> woodland, grassland and steppe. The park has the distinction of holding 30–40 percent of plants and animal species of Tanzania. More than 400 bird species and 6 primate species are reported from the park. It has the second largest biodiversity of a national park within Africa. It is included in the list of 34 [...] "World Biodiversity Hotspot". It is also listed as one of the 200 WWF Eco regions of global critical importance. Six primate species have been recorded, five of which are endemic. The Udzungwa red colobus and Sanje mangabey are only found in the Udzungwa Mountains National Park; that mangabey was only recognised as a distinct species in 1986.|$|E
