40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} why rail is used to move semi-trailers to and from seaports to lesser extent than it is used to move <b>maritime</b> <b>containers,</b> and which actions can foster an increase of semi-trailer transport by rail. The two types of load units are obviously used in quite different logistics settings. The two transport segments are compared in terms of the transport markets they serve, the competition they face and the operational and technological principles upon which they operate. The empirical setting is the transport of general cargo in load units between Scandinavia, Continental Europe and the UK, although the container segment is analysed as an element of deep-sea liner shipping. Empirical findings are drawn from the case of the Port of Gothenburg and its Scandinavian hinterland. Sustained double-digit annual growth has led to a situation where most of the potential market for the hinterland transport of <b>maritime</b> <b>containers</b> has already been realised. The challenge for further growth is now to capture the semi-trailer segment. Not surprisingly, this analysis shows that rail is more competitive for the hinterland transport of containers than of semi-trailers, but there are still significant opportunities for reaping the benefits of rail transport of semi-trailer transport in the hinterlands of European ports. An increased integration of rail transport and Roll-on/Roll-off shipping will not only require, but also encourage, changes in the overall system design as well as its competitiveness compared to all-road and all-rail services...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Defense Transportation System (DTS), {{led by the}} Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC), depends on the commercial maritime industry to provide movement of supplies and equipment around the world. The <b>maritime</b> shipping <b>container</b> is a critical asset in providing for this logistical support to the war fighter abroad. These 20 - or 40 -foot containers have become {{the backbone of the}} maritime industry, and will continue to proliferate as global commerce continues to expand. While the growth in the use of <b>maritime</b> shipping <b>containers</b> in the 21 st century has accelerated the nation's economic trade substantially, it may also have become a significant problem. Containers are an indispensable but vulnerable link in the chain of global trade; approximately 90 percent of the world's cargo moves by container. Because of DoD's dependency on the maritime industry and these containers, it will and must continue to ride the wave of commercial practices, specifically in pursuit of better security throughout the maritime industry. In the wake of September 11, 2001, and with the new threats of WMD, the <b>maritime</b> shipping <b>container</b> may become a weapons delivery system. This thesis documented the need for security improvements for the <b>maritime</b> shipping <b>container</b> in protecting global commerce and DoD cargo shipments. Comprehensive reviews of government reports, books, articles, and Internet based materials, as well as interviews with MTMC personnel, have indicated that DoD is taking a series of measures to meet these challenges. DoD's Defense Transportation System and the commercial maritime industry will be challenged and tested by new policy requirements. MTMC has already adopted new business processes, cargo manifest requirements, and technological innovations that assure customers in-transit visibility and total asset visibility (ITV/TAV), including the Intelligent Road-Rail Information Server (IRRIS) system.

50|$|The same rail {{has been}} tested to 80 t axle {{loadings}} for mainline use, {{and can be used}} in tunnels and other locations where the loading gauge is restricted. Replacing flat bottom girder rails on sleepers and ballast with LR55 in tunnels can increase the head room by a minimum of 300 mm, without the need to excavate the tunnel invert. A method statement to undertake this transformation allows contractors to proceed on an incremental basis without closing the tunnel to rail traffic. Temporary transition rails link flat bottom and LR55 rails, until the conversion is completed. The extra loading gauge can then be used to install overhead electrification, or to move larger rail vehicles. These can include double deck passenger trains and freight trains with high cube (9 ft) <b>maritime</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Detecting {{anomalies}} in {{the maritime}} domain is nowadays essential {{as the number}} of goods transported by <b>maritime</b> <b>containers</b> keeps increasing. An anomaly can be described in several ways depending on the application domain. For cargo shipments, an anomaly can be defined as an unexpected relationship between ports. This chapter describes a new approach for detecting anomalies in the sequential data used to describe cargo shipments. The technique is divided in two steps. First, we find the normal itineraries with a regular expression technique. Then, we compare a given itinerary with a normal itinerary using a distance-based method in order to classify the given itinerary as normal or suspicious. The first results of this method are very promising, and it can be further improved when integrated with time-based information. This chapter presents both the methodology and some results obtained using real-world data representing container movements. JRC. G. 3 -Maritime affair...|$|R
