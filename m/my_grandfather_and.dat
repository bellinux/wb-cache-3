However he chose to play internationally for the French national team, as both {{his father and grandfather}} did. As Bozon said regarding his choice, [...] "All of my family are French, and <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>and</b> father played for France’s national team. It’s why I play too." [...] At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Division I Championship, he helped France to a third-place finish, the first time the French under-18 team had ever won a medal in an IIHF tournament. His six points in five games were tied for eleventh overall in tournament scoring and tied for the lead on the French team. Bozon declined to participate in the 2012 World Junior Division IB Championships because he wanted to stay in North America and help the Blazers.|$|E

When questioned regarding his roots, he would answer: [...] "My family is of Russian origin. [...] <b>My</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>and</b> other ancestors from the time of Peter the Great were Russian Orthodox priests. Consequently, the Russian nationality of the family must be considered as well established".|$|E

2500|$|White did not record {{how soon}} {{he took up}} {{photography}} after {{he and his wife}} returned to Newark, but it had to have been quickly. There are at least two photographs taken by him that date from that same year, 1893, and by the following year he was deeply engaged in his new interest. White's grandson wrote, [...] "It is not coincidental that Clarence White's life in photography began in the year of his marriage. My grandmother wore a great many hats, and all with real flair; she was wife, mother, business manager, model, aesthetic critic, stoic, and a buffer between <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> <b>and</b> many of the unpleasantnesses of life. With steadfast devotion, she created an environment in which he could lead a calm and productive life." [...] The considerable influence of his wife in White's artistic development may be seen later when he began corresponding with Alfred Stieglitz; White often used the words [...] "we" [...] or [...] "Mrs. White and I" [...] when describing his most recent photographic activities.|$|E

60|$|Of my {{progenitors}} further back, I do {{not conceive}} {{it necessary to}} say much. They were partly of English, and partly of Low Dutch extraction, as is apt {{to be the case}} with those who come of New York families of any standing in the colony. I retain tolerably distinct impressions of both of <b>my</b> <b>grandfathers,</b> <b>and</b> of one of my grandmothers; my mother's mother having died long before my own parents were married.|$|R

60|$|I have {{no words}} to write of my {{feelings}} then.

The answer I framed, alas, remained unspoken. From his own lips I had heard how much the news had mended him, and for once I lacked the heart, nay, the courage, to speak the truth. But Mr. Carvel took no heed of my silence, setting it down to another cause.|$|R

6000|$|... "You would what, sir?" [...] says George, very quietly, [...] "if you did {{not love}} <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> <b>and</b> my brother, and my mother. You are making her {{petticoat}} a plea for some conduct of yours--you would do what, sir, may I ask again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This, then, is Ravensnest!"
