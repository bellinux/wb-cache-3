50|$|While {{a pocket}} mask {{is not as}} {{efficient}} as a bag <b>valve</b> <b>mask,</b> it does have its advantages when only one rescuer is available. As suggested by its name, the pocket mask benefits from a somewhat easier portability {{when compared to the}} bag <b>valve</b> <b>mask.</b> Also, in contrast to the bag <b>valve</b> <b>mask,</b> which requires two hands to operate (one to form a seal and the other to squeeze the bag), the pocket mask allows for both of the rescuer's hands to be on the patients head. This hand placement provides a superior seal on the patient's face, and allows the responder to perform a jaw thrust on patients suspected of a spinal injury.|$|R

5000|$|Mouth-to-mask - Most organisations {{recommend}} {{the use of}} some sort of barrier between rescuer and patient to reduce cross infection risk. One popular type is the 'pocket mask'. This may be able to provide higher tidal volumes than a Bag <b>Valve</b> <b>Mask.</b>|$|R
25|$|Administration {{of oxygen}} at 15 litres per minute by face <b>mask</b> or bag <b>valve</b> <b>mask</b> is often sufficient, but {{tracheal}} intubation with mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Suctioning of pulmonary oedema fluid should be balanced against {{the need for}} oxygenation. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory pressure will generally improve oxygenation. Drug administration via peripheral veins is preferred over endotracheal administration. Hypotension remaining after oxygenation may be treated by rapid crystalloid infusion. Cardiac arrest in drowning usually presents as asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Ventricular fibrillation {{is more likely to}} be associated with complications of pre-existing coronary artery disease, severe hypothermia, or the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine.|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} after {{maintaining}} a patent airway is checking breathing rate and quality.

50|$|Ventilators come in many {{different}} styles and method of giving a breath to sustain life. There are manual ventilators such as bag <b>valve</b> <b>masks</b> and anesthesia bags that require the users to hold the ventilator to the face or to an artificial airway and maintain breaths with their hands. Mechanical ventilators are ventilators not requiring operator effort and are typically computer-controlled or pneumatic-controlled.|$|R

50|$|Either a bag <b>valve</b> <b>mask</b> or an {{advanced}} airway {{may be used}} to help with breathing. High levels of oxygen are generally given during CPR.

50|$|CNS {{depression}} is treated {{within a hospital}} setting by maintaining breathing and circulation. Individuals with reduced breathing may be given supplemental oxygen, while individuals who are not breathing can be ventilated with bag <b>valve</b> <b>mask</b> ventilation or by mechanical ventilation with a respirator.

50|$|The {{efficiency}} of artificial respiration can be greatly increased by the simultaneous use of oxygen therapy. The amount of oxygen {{available to the}} patient in mouth-to-mouth is around 16%. If this is done through a pocket mask with an oxygen flow, this increases to 40% oxygen. If either a bag <b>valve</b> <b>mask</b> or a mechanical ventilator is used with an oxygen supply, this rises to 99% oxygen.

5000|$|The {{equipment}} {{carried by}} cycle responders will vary depending upon role {{and the level}} to which the rider is trained.

40|$|Abstract Background Bystander {{resuscitation}} {{plays an}} important role in lifesaving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A significant reduction in the "no-flow-time", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme ® (LMAS) in the manikin. Methods An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag <b>mask</b> <b>valve</b> device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated. Results A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96. 7 %) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8. 7 %) attempts. Eight (5. 3 %) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79. 3 %) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83. 2 ± 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0. 85), technical education (P = 0. 07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0. 25). Conclusion In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding. </p...|$|R

50|$|Age {{can play}} a role in whether or not the {{procedure}} is warranted, and is commonly needed in younger persons. The clinician that performs RSI must be skilled in tracheal intubation and also in bag <b>valve</b> <b>mask</b> ventilation. Alternative airway management devices must be immediately available, in the event the trachea cannot be intubated using conventional techniques. Such devices include the combitube and the laryngeal mask airway. Invasive techniques such as cricothyrotomy must also be available in the event of inability to intubate the trachea by conventional techniques.|$|R

30|$|Introduction In ICU, {{intubation}} is a {{high risk}} procedure associated with high morbidity. Despite procedure’s improvement with systematic application of fluid loading, early use of vasopressors and checklist use, morbidity remains high. Preoxygenation and intubation are the 2 main determinants of complication occurrence. McGrath Mac failed to improve first pass laryngoscopy success during intubation in ICU as compare to Macintosh laryngoscope. A predefined post hoc analysis of the MACMAN study was performed to evaluate quality of preoxygenation with 4 devices allowed: bag <b>valve</b> <b>mask,</b> non-invasive ventilation (NIV), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and non-re-breather mask (NRM).|$|R

5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid.
