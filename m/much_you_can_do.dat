Van Avermaet described himself as [...] "really disappointed" [...] following his crash, which ruled him out of Paris–Roubaix.

2500|$|The school motto Quantum Potes Tantum Aude ("Dare All <b>You</b> <b>Can,</b> for God and Man") was {{introduced}} by the rector-headmaster, Fr Thomas Gartlan SJ, in 1906. Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is now formally translated from Latin as [...] "As <b>much</b> as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> so <b>much</b> dare to do", seen to best reflect the Latin, replacing the former [...] "Dare to do your Best". The motto is taken from a song of Saint Thomas Aquinas (12271274) entitled Lauda Sion Salvatorem ('Praise, O Sion, Praise Thy Saviour'). The next line after Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is Quia Maior Omni Laude, which, together, translates to [...] "As <b>much</b> as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> so <b>much</b> dare to do, because He is above all praise".|$|R
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Häkkinen was delighted with his victory: [...] "This was an incredible win. It {{was a very difficult}} and unusual situation including my spin which of course was not planned. The kerbs here are very slippery and once you go over one there is not <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> I was lucky to keep going and I was able to chase Michael. But the car got better and better." [...] The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see if Michael Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen's overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind backmarkers for straight-line speed assistance during the race's closing stages.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{continued}} as showrunner after the movie. Critics {{have argued that}} the quality of the show has declined in Jean's tenure. Jacob Burch, an administrator of the website NoHomers.com, {{said in an interview that}} the show [...] "seems less cohesive, more about trying to get the jokes in there, instead of make a story and let the jokes come off of that" [...] and adds [...] "I just think there's only so <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> [...]" [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E

Due to the tight shooting schedule, Wan could not afford to shoot {{more than a couple of}} takes per actor. [...] "It was a really tough struggle for me. Every day, it was me fighting to get the shots I did not get. I had high aspirations, but there's only so <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> I wanted to make it in a very Hitchcockian style of filmmaking, but that style of filmmaking takes time to set up and so on," [...] Wan said about the very short shooting schedule. He said the style instead ended up being [...] "more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with" [...] and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.|$|E

500|$|Following Tahil's departure, plots were {{abandoned}} and many scripts {{had to be}} rewritten. EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan revealed that it was intended that Dan would be murdered by his children after prolonged bullying and abuse, saying [...] "The family arrived in Albert Square in what {{was expected to be}} a huge storyline. The father [...] was an oppressive and violent bully – eventually his children were going to kill him. It was all scripted – how they buried him in a shallow grave, how they dealt with it, and how it all exploded. And then Dalip got bloody deported. He was actually on the studio floor and they marched him off. Broken legs, nervous breakdowns – we can deal with that. But when actors are physically taken away by the government and deported, there's not <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> Fifty scripts had to be reworked. And because all the episodes had been written around this big storyline, we had to keep the same amount of Ferreira material." [...] The murder storyline was replaced with one concerning a kidney transplant between Ronny and his newly discovered half brother Tariq. Jordan admitted they could have recast the character of Dan, but it may have looked [...] "tacky": [...] "We couldn't go, 'Tonight, the part of Mr Ferreira will be played by Michael French with a suntan'. We were trying to do it with integrity. Then somebody said, 'What if Ronnie Ferreira's mate Tariq turns out to be his half-brother and we do the whole kidney transplant thing?' And, of course, it was like watching paint dry. 'Can I have your kidney?' 'No. Oh, go on then...'" [...] Jordan told the Daily Mirror the Ferreiras were [...] "the least successful characters I created – through no fault of their own." ...|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E

But I shall not be here long enough to accept your kindness in this house nor in your own. I have but one desire and object now. It is to dispose of this property, and indeed all I possess, to pay the debt of my husband. It is in your power, perhaps, to help me. I am told that you wish to possess Los Cuervos," [...] she went on, equally oblivious of the consciousness that appeared in Don José's face, and a humorous perplexity on the brow of Poindexter. [...] "If you can arrange it with Mr. Poindexter, you will find me a liberal vendor. That <b>much</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> and I know you will believe I shall be grateful. You can do no more, unless it be to say to your friends that Mrs. Belle Tucker remains here only for that purpose, and to carry out what she knows to be the wishes of her husband." [...] She paused, bent her pretty crest, dropped a quaint curtsey to the superior age, the silver braid, and the gentlemanly bearing of Don José, and with the passing sunshine of a smile disappeared from the corridor.|$|E
40|$|There is <b>much</b> more <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{with wood}} than cook and build. So-called non-timber forest {{products}} (NTFPs) are attracting interest, at the cusp of environmental conservation and income-generation (see Spore 89). NTFP harvesting does not necessarily contradict forest conservation. Tapping the Green Market aims at keeping the two in balance. It provides profiles of major NTFPs throughout the world and pays attention to the ongoing search for sustainable ways of managing forests, including the certification of NTFPs. It warns, rightfully so, against optimism about certification - this requires a wealthy and environmentally conscious group of consumers and that rules out many of the world's NFTPs.

30|$|Teacher {{autonomy}} {{served as}} a locally endogenous variable {{in this study and}} as an exogenous variable to math and science teachers’ intentions to remain in the profession. Six questionnaire items from SASS 08 were considered for use in measuring this variable, using Klassen and Chiu’s study of 2010 as a basis for their selection. In their study, they had three teacher autonomy factors specific to classroom management, student engagement, and instructional strategies and included survey questions like, “How <b>much</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to control disruptive behavior in the classroom?”, “How <b>much</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to implement a variety of assessment strategies?”, and “How <b>much</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to implement alternative strategies in your classroom?” (Klassen and Chiu 2010). For this study, a single teacher autonomy variable was used with the consideration of six questionnaire items from SASS 08 to be included in its scale. These items referred to the teacher’s perception of his or her ability to effectively control the following areas of their craft: (1) selecting textbooks and other instructional materials, (2) selecting content, topics, and skills to be taught, (3) selecting teaching techniques, (4) evaluating and grading students, (5) disciplining students, and (6) determining the amount of homework to be assigned. Each of these items was based on a 4 -point Likert scale with 1 [*]=[*]no control and 4 [*]=[*]a great deal of control.|$|R
