25|$|Toxic {{substances}} and poisons (like atropine) can {{significantly reduce the}} range of aperture. Pharmaceutical products such as eye drops may also cause similar side-effects. Tropicamide and phenylephrine are used in medicine as mydriatics to dilate pupils for retinal and lens examination. These medications take effect in about 30–45 minutes after instillation and last for about 8 hours. Atropine is also used {{in such a way}} but its effects can last up to 2 weeks, along with the <b>mydriatic</b> effect; it produces cycloplegia (a condition in which the crystalline lens of the eye cannot accommodate to focus near objects). This effect goes away after 8 hours. Other medications offer the contrary effect. Pilocarpine is a miotic (induces miosis); it can make a pupil as small as 1mm in diameter depending on the person and their ocular characteristics. Such drops are used in certain glaucoma patients to prevent acute glaucoma attacks.|$|E

40|$|Melanopsin-containing retinal {{ganglion}} cells play {{an important}} role in the non-image forming effects of light, through their direct projections on brain circuits involved in circadian rhythms, mood and alertness. Individual differences in the functionality of the melanopsin-signaling circuitry can be reliably quantified using the maximum post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) after blue light. Previous protocols for acquiring PIPR relied on the use of <b>mydriatics</b> to dilate the light-exposed eye. However, pharmacological pupil dilation is uncomfortable for the participants and requires ophthalmological expertise. Hence, we here investigated whether an individual’s maximum PIPR can be validly obtained in a protocol that does not use <b>mydriatics</b> but rather increases the intensity of the light stimulus. In 18 participants (5 males, mean age ± SD: 34. 6 ± 13. 6 years) we evaluated the PIPR after exposure to intensified blue light (550 µW/cm 2) provided to an undilated dynamic pupil. The test-retest reliability of the primary PIPR outcome parameter was very high, both between day-to-day assessments (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0. 85), as well as between winter and summer assessments (ICC = 0. 83). Compared to the PIPR obtained with the use of <b>mydriatics</b> and 160 µW/cm 2 blue light exposure, the method with intensified light without <b>mydriatics</b> showed almost zero bias according to Bland-Altman plots and had moderate to strong reliability (ICC = 0. 67). In conclusion, for PIPR assessments, increasing the light intensity is a feasible and reliable alternative to pupil dilation to relieve the participant’s burden and to allow for performance outside the ophthalmological clinic...|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} {{clinical}} {{experience that the}} pupil in the African dilates slowly in response to <b>mydriatics.</b> Full mydriasis can be obtained in about 40 minutes in the Asian or European, but takes much longer in the African. This difference in response has been observed in the same clinic {{at the same time}} and using the same drug. Scott (I 945) noted the need for stronger <b>mydriatics</b> to dilate the pupil in Negroes. There must be an intrinsic peculiarity in the African iris, and it has been shown that this is not due to faulty innervation (Scott, I 945). An obvious peculiarity of the African iris is the abundant pigmentation. The present study has revealed that the relatively slower response of the pupil to <b>mydriatics</b> in the Afri-can is indeed related to pigmentation, and that the pupil in the albino African behaves differently. The exact mechanism by which pigmentation influences mydriasis is not clear, and anatomical and physiological studies have been carried out in an attempt to find a possible explanation.

40|$|Aim. To {{assess the}} effects of <b>mydriatics</b> {{commonly}} used in clinical practice on choroidal thickness and anterior chamber change. Methods. This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study including a single eye of the participants. The subjects were assigned into 4 groups to receive tropicamide 1 %, phenylephrine 2. 5 %, cyclopentolate 1 %, and artificial tears. At the baseline, anterior chamber parameters were assessed using a Pentacam Scheimpflug camera system, and choroidal thickness (CT) was measured using a spectral-domain OCT with Enhanced Depth Imaging (EDI) modality. All measurements were repeated again after drug administration. Results. Increases in pupil diameter, volume, and depth of anterior chamber {{were found to be}} significant (p= 0. 000, p= 0. 000, and p= 0. 000, resp.), while decreases in the choroidal thickness were found to be significant in subjects receiving <b>mydriatics</b> (p< 0. 05). Conclusions. The study has shown that while cyclopentolate, tropicamide, and phenylephrine cause a decrease in choroidal thickness, they also lead to an increase in the volume and depth of anterior chamber. However, no correlation was detected between anterior chamber parameters and choroidal changes after drug administration. These findings suggest that the <b>mydriatics</b> may affect the choroidal thickness regardless of anterior chamber parameters.

Ther. 171 : 205 - 213, 1970. Isolated albino or pigmented guinea-pig eyes with pupils constricted to a base line with methacholine {{were exposed to}} increasing cumulative molar concentrations of <b>mydriatics</b> and the resulting pupilary dilation was measured and plotted in dose-response curves. Pigmented irises were about one-third as sensitive to ephedrine mydriasis as albino irises. This phenomenon of differing iris sensitivity was selective for ephedrine and related compounds having a methyl group on the a-carbon and a hydroxyl group on the fl-carbon of the side chain. It did not occur with other <b>mydriatics</b> such as phenylephrine, tyramine, isoproterenol or aminophylline. Ephedrine produced mydriasis through a “direct ” com-ponent of action which was not antagonized by propranolol or sotalol (MJ 1999); higher concentrations of ephedrine were antagonized slightly by phentolamine but lower concen-trations were not. Mydriasis due to ephedrine therefore involves receptors other than alpha or beta adrenergic. Theories suggested by earlier workers {{to account for the}} lesser sensi-tivity with greater iris pigmentation are not supported by these investigations. The mech-anism of the latter phenomenon appears to be closely involved with the <b>mydriatic’s</b> molec-ular structure. Ophthalmologists are aware that human sub-jects with deeply pigmented irises are less re-sponsive to ephedrine mydriasis than are those with light iris pigmentation.

50|$|A <b>mydriatic</b> is {{an agent}} that induces {{dilation}} of the pupil. Drugs such as tropicamide {{are used in}} medicine to permit examination of the retina and other deep structures of the eye, and also to reduce painful ciliary muscle spasm (see cycloplegia). Phenylephrine (e.g. Cyclomydril) is used if strong mydriasis is needed for a surgical intervention. One effect of administration of a <b>mydriatic</b> is intolerance to bright light (photophobia). Purposefully-induced mydriasis via mydriatics is also used as a diagnostic test for Horner's syndrome.|$|E
40|$|ATROPINE, {{perhaps the}} drug most used in ophthalmology, {{is prone to}} cause contact-irritation, often {{at a time when}} {{continued}} mydriasis is essential, in patients on long-term treatment.

40|$|AIMS: To detect {{systemic}} {{complications of}} screening for {{retinopathy of prematurity}} (ROP), paying {{particular attention to the}} physical examination. METHODS: Oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and blood pressure were monitored before, during, and after 110 ROP screening examinations. RESULTS: Following topical <b>mydriatics</b> diastolic blood pressure was elevated by a mean of 6 (SD 7. 2) mm Hg. Immediately after the examination there was a further rise in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 4. 3 (14. 5) mm Hg and 3. 3 (11. 6) mm Hg, respectively. Oxygen saturation and pulse rate remained stable during the control period and administration of eyedrops. Saturation fell by a median of 3 % (95 % confidence interval plus or minus 1. 2 %) after the examination while there was rise in pulse rate of 7 (SD 23. 1) beats per minute. This change in pulse rate was not observed in infants on concurrent methylxanthine therapy. No infant had clinically significant changes {{at the end of the}} study.

40|$|Patients with {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) {{can develop}} severe uveitis. Although infectious and autoimmune causes must always be considered, drug induced uveitis {{is also an important}} etiology. Herein, we present two case reports illustrating the classical presentation of rifabutin and cidofovir induced uveitis. The first case was a 33 year old woman with AIDS treated with anti-protease and anti-tuberculosis drugs (including rifabutin). She presented with a red painful right eye. There was a strong anterior segment inflammation with fibrinous exudates and a dense vitritis. Rifabutin was stopped and topical steroids and <b>mydriatics</b> were given. Intraocular inflammation and symptoms rapidly resolved. The second patient was a 36 year old woman who presented with a painful decrease of vision in her left eye. She was followed for bilateral CMV retinitis in the setting of AIDS and had recently received 2 systemic injections of cidofovir. Anterior segment inflammation with posterior synechiae in both eyes and folds of Descemet membrane in the left eye were noted. Intraocular pressure was 0 mmHg in the left eye and 10 mmHg in the right eye. Fundus examination disclosed CMV retinitis scars in the right eye and choroidal folds in the macula of the left eye. Cidofovir was discontinued and topical steroids and <b>mydriatics</b> started. Progressively the inflammation decreased and the intraocular pressure returned to normal levels. In conclusion, rifabutin and cidofovir are classical examples of drug induced uveitis with distinct characteristic clinical presentation. Recognition of those entities in AIDS patients can avoid useless and potentially invasive interventions in those fragile people. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} intracameral (IC) administration {{at the beginning of}} cataract surgery, of Mydrane, a standardised ophthalmic combination of tropicamide 0. 02 %, phenylephrine 0. 31 % and lidocaine 1 %, to a standard topical regimen. METHODS: In this international phase III, prospective, randomised study, the selected eye of 555 patients undergoing phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation received 200  μL of Mydrane (Mydrane group) just after the first incision or a topical regimen of one drop each of tropicamide 0. 5 % and phenylephrine 10 % repeated three times (reference group). The primary efficacy variable was achievement of capsulorhexis without additional <b>mydriatics.</b> The non-inferiority of Mydrane to the topical regimen was tested. The main outcome measures were pupil size, patient perception of ocular discomfort and safety. RESULTS: Capsulorhexis without additional <b>mydriatics</b> was performed in 98. 9 % of patients and 94. 7 % in the Mydrane and reference groups, respectively. Both groups achieved adequate mydriasis (> 7  mm) during capsulorhexis, phacoemulsification and IOL insertion. IOL insertion was classified as 'routine' in a statistically greater number of eyes in the Mydrane group compared with the reference group (p= 0. 047). Patients in the Mydrane group reported statistically greater comfort than the reference group before IOL insertion (p= 0. 034). Safety data were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Mydrane is an effective and safe alternative to standard eye drops for initiating and maintaining intraoperative mydriasis and analgesia. Patients who received IC Mydrane were significantly more comfortable before IOL insertion than the reference group. Surgeons found IOL insertion less technically challenging with IC Mydrane.
