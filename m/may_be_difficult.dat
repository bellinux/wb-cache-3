5|$|C.mutica closely {{resemble}} Caprella acanthogaster, also {{a native of}} East Asian waters. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish the two species, particularly since Caprellamutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males. C.mutica can only be reliably differentiated by their setose first and second pereonites (smooth in C.acanthogaster), {{as well as the}} elongated oval shape of their gills (linear in C.acanthogaster).|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> or easy, {{depending}} on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that they appear to be sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} venography {{employs the}} same principles, but uses MRI as a scanning modality. MRI {{has the advantage}} of being better at detecting damage to the brain itself {{as a result of the}} increased pressure on the obstructed veins, but it is not readily available in many hospitals and the interpretation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E

5|$|Seborrheic-like {{psoriasis}} is {{a common}} form of psoriasis with clinical aspects of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish from the latter. This form of psoriasis typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher sebum production such as the scalp, forehead, skin folds next to the nose, skin surrounding the mouth, skin on the chest above the sternum, and in skin folds.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery.

Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine {{does not need to be}} unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, hospice care <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having {{most of their}} care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E

5|$|The brain-like surface folds {{and mature}} olive-brown gleba are {{characteristic}} of Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs {{that have not yet}} developed these characteristics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to identify to species. Another edible puffball, C.cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple-brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba. C.bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C.craniiformis, but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C.craniiformis, but unlike the latter it develops a cavernous opening to reveal an olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.|$|E
5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to train. Training methods {{should always be}} gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
5|$|Wilderness is {{generally}} defined as {{areas that have}} not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, , national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to {{be an integral part of}} the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere).
