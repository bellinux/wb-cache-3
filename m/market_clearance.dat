Both {{supply and demand}} market prices are treated as equilibrium factors along with quantities shipped between the markets. The rates of change {{for each of the}} factors are functions of market conditions such as supply-demand relations and net gains from shipments between markets. After a brief review of the theory of evolution variational inequalities, an evolution variational inequality (EVI) model of the dynamic spatial market equilibrium problem is introduced. Under the maximal monotonicity conditions for the supply, demand, and transaction cost functions, an existence and uniqueness result for the solution path is established. Finally, {{we consider}} a finite- difference scheme - a discretized version of the EVI model. Within this single framework, both questions of the dynamics and convergence of an algorithm are addressed. ...|$|E

D., Inc., San Francisco, CA, USAAbstract: Lumbar fusion is {{commonly}} performed to alleviate chronic low back and leg pain secondary to disc degeneration, spondylolisthesis {{with or without}} concomitant lumbar spinal stenosis, or chronic lumbar instability. However, the risk of iatrogenic injury during traditional anterior, posterior, and transforaminal open fusion surgery is significant. The axial lumbar interbody fusion (AxiaLIF) system is a minimally invasive fusion device that accesses the lumbar (L 4 &ndash;S 1) intervertebral disc spaces via a reproducible presacral approach that avoids critical neurovascular and musculoligamentous structures. Since the AxiaLIF system received <b>marketing</b> <b>clearance</b> from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004, clinical studies of this device have reported high fusion rates without implant subsidence, significant improvements in pain and function, and low complication rates.

For truthfulness also called incentive compatible, we adapt Bayesian settings, where each buyer's private value is drawn independently from publicly known distributions. Therefore, the truthfulness we adopt is Bayesian incentive compatible mechanisms. Most of our results are positive. We study various settings of revenue maximizing problem e. g. competitive equilibrium and envy-free solution in relaxed demand, sharp demand and consecutive demand case; Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism in relaxed demand, sharp demand, budget constraints and consecutive demand cases. Our approach allows us to argue that these simple mechanisms give optimal or approximate-optimal revenue guarantee in a very robust manner...|$|E

These foreseen policy changes must be consistent with equilibrium in both the goods market and asset markets. Potential problems arise because prices often play dual roles, both as final goods prices, and as asset prices, as components of rates of return. We show how the economy accommodates an anticipated policy change depends upon its production flexibility and its structure. With flexible investment, an anticipated reduction in government expenditure is fully accommodated by capital accumulation.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between industrial development and park creation {{during the first half}} of the twentieth century in Portland, Oregon. Beginning with an examination of early planning efforts of John Charles Olmsted alongside the economic boost brought by Lewis and Clark Exposition, this thesis traces the converging and diverging political and social efforts that formed Portland’s Forest Park and Guild’s Lake Industrial Sanctuary, using primary documents to identify similarities and differences in how those two spaces came into existence. The creation of Forest Park came out of a reaction to expanding economic and industrial development, initially sparked by the Lewis and Clark Exposition a century earlier.
