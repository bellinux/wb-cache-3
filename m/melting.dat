Experimental samples show {{a variety}} of microstructures, such as <b>melt</b> lenses, layers, and multigrain <b>melt</b> pools, which are not readily explained using the theory for <b>melt</b> distribution based on isotropic interface energies. These microstructures affect the <b>melt</b> distribution and the porosity-permeability relation. It is still unclear how the <b>melt</b> distribution changes with increasing <b>melt</b> fraction. In this study, electrical conductivity measurements and microstructural investigation with scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction are combined to analyze the <b>melt</b> distribution in synthetic, partially molten, iron-free olivine rocks with 0. 01 – 0. 1 <b>melt</b> fraction. The electrical conductivity data are compared with the predictions of geometric models for <b>melt</b> distribution.

At a <b>melt</b> fraction of 0. 01, the <b>melt</b> is situated in a network of triple junction tubes, and almost all grain boundaries are free from <b>melt</b> layers. At 0. 1, the <b>melt</b> is situated in a network of grain boundary <b>melt</b> layers, as well as occupying the triple junctions.

40|$|Using a {{two-phase}} £ow model, {{we investigate}} {{the formation of}} a high-percentage <b>melt</b> layer beneath the oceanic lithosphere and focusing of the <b>melt</b> towards the ridge axis, taking into account freezing and <b>melt</b> extraction. <b>Melt</b> migration is modelled dynamically within a viscous permeable media that includes the asthenosphere and viscous part of the lithosphere. Due to a much faster <b>melt</b> migration in the brittle part of the lithosphere, the <b>melt</b> migration is simulated by instantaneous <b>melt</b> extraction from an assigned <b>melt</b> extraction region beneath the ridge axis. It is shown that a high-percentage <b>melt</b> layer forms and successfully focuses <b>melt</b> to a narrow zone beneath the mid-ocean ridge.

40|$|The {{timing of}} <b>melt</b> onset affects the surface energy uptake {{throughout}} the <b>melt</b> season. Yet the processes triggering <b>melt</b> and causing its large interannual variability {{are not well}} understood. Here we show that <b>melt</b> onset over Arctic sea ice is initiated by positive anomalies of water vapor, clouds, and air temperatures that increase the downwelling longwave radiation (LWD) to the surface. The earlier <b>melt</b> onset occurs; the stronger are these anomalies. Downwelling shortwave radiation (SWD) is smaller than usual at <b>melt</b> onset, indicating that <b>melt</b> is not triggered by SWD. When <b>melt</b> occurs early, an anomalously opaque atmosphere with positive LWD anomalies preconditions the surface for weeks preceding <b>melt.</b> In contrast, when <b>melt</b> begins late, clearer than usual conditions are evident prior to <b>melt.</b> Hence, atmospheric processes are imperative for <b>melt</b> onset. It is also found that spring LWD increased during recent decades, consistent with trends toward an earlier <b>melt</b> onset. © 2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved...|$|R

5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, and {{the distance between the}} nuclei of the ions is small.

Above their <b>melting</b> point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high <b>melting</b> points, so are solids at room temperature.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily land-surface temperature (LST), MODIS daily snow albedo, and a special diurnal <b>melt</b> product derived from QuikSCAT (QS) scatterometer data, are all effective in measuring the evolution of <b>melt</b> on the ice sheet. These daily products, produced from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, are sensitive to different geophysical features, though QS- and MODIS-derived <b>melt</b> generally show excellent correspondence when surface <b>melt</b> is present on the ice sheet.

5|$|Freshwater {{addition}} {{has been}} implicated by coupled ocean and atmosphere climate modeling (Ganopolski and Rahmstorf 2001), showing that both Heinrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger events may show hysteresis behaviour. This means that relatively minor changes in freshwater loading into the Nordic Seas, {{such as a}} 0.15 Sv increase or 0.03 Sv decrease, would suffice to cause profound shifts in global circulation (Rahmstorf et al. 2005). The results show that a Heinrich event does not cause a cooling around Greenland but further south, mostly in the subtropical Atlantic, a finding supported by most available paleoclimatic data. This idea was connected to D-O events by Maslin et al. (2001). They suggested that each ice sheet had its own conditions of stability, but that on <b>melting,</b> the influx of freshwater was enough to reconfigure ocean currents, and cause <b>melting</b> elsewhere. More specifically, D-O cold events, and their associated influx of meltwater, reduce {{the strength of the}} North Atlantic Deep Water current (NADW), weakening the northern-hemisphere circulation and therefore resulting in an increased transfer of heat polewards in the southern hemisphere. This warmer water results in <b>melting</b> of Antarctic ice, thereby reducing density stratification and the strength of the Antarctic Bottom Water current (AABW). This allows the NADW to return to its previous strength, driving northern hemisphere <b>melting</b> and another D-O cold event. Eventually, the accumulation of <b>melting</b> reaches a threshold, whereby it raises sea level enough to undercut the Laurentide ice sheet, thereby causing a Heinrich event and resetting the cycle.|$|E
