2500|$|When {{experimental}} psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton was {{a leading}} practitioner, and, with his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as psychometrics). James McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the concept to the United States, and in fact coined the term [...] "mental test". In 1901, Cattell's student Clark Wissler published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict their academic performance. In response to 1904 orders from the Minister of Public Instruction, French psychologists Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905–1911, using a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty. Binet and Simon introduced the concept of mental age and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as idiots. Henry H. Goddard put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of <b>mental</b> <b>level</b> such as imbecile and feebleminded. In 1916 (after Binet's death), Stanford professor Lewis M. Terman modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the Stanford–Binet scale) and introduced the intelligence quotient as a score report. From this test, Terman concluded that mental retardation [...] "represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes. Their dullness seems to be racial." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{friends of}} the German cause have complained that Asiatics and Africans upon the very verge of savagery have been brought against them from India and Algiers. And in {{ordinary}} circumstances, I should sympathise with such a complaint made by a European people. But the circumstances are not ordinary. Here, again, the quiet unique barbarism of Prussia goes deeper than what we call barbarities. About mere barbarities, it is true, the Turco and the Sikh would {{have a very good}} reply to the superior Teuton. The general and just reason for not using non-European tribes against Europeans is that given by Chatham against the use of the Red Indian: that such allies might do very diabolical things. But the poor Turco might not unreasonably ask, after a week-end in Belgium, what more diabolical things he could do than the highly cultured Germans were doing themselves. Nevertheless, as I say, the justification of any extra-European aid goes deeper than any such details. It rests upon the fact that even other civilisations, even much lower civilisations, even remote and repulsive civilisations, depend as much as our own on this primary principle, on which the super-morality of Potsdam declares open War. Even savages promise things; and respect those who keep their promises. Even Orientals write things down: and though they write them from right to left, they know the importance of a scrap of paper. Many merchants {{will tell you that the}} word of the sinister and almost unhuman Chinaman is often as good as his bond: and it was amid palm trees and Syrian pavilions that the great utterance opened the tabernacle to him that sweareth to his hurt and changeth not. There is doubtless a dense labyrinth of duplicity in the East, and perhaps more guile in the individual Asiatic than in the individual German. But we are not talking of the violations of human morality in various parts of the world. We are talking about a new and inhuman morality, which denies altogether the day of obligation. The Prussians have been told by their literary men that everything depends upon Mood: and by their politicians that all arrangements dissolve before [...] "necessity." [...] That is the importance of the German Chancellor's phrase. He did not allege some special excuse in the case of Belgium, which might make it seem an exception that proved the rule. He distinctly argued, as on a principle applicable to other cases, that victory was a necessity and honour was a scrap of paper. And it is evident that the half-educated Prussian imagination really cannot get any farther than this. It cannot see that if everybody's action were entirely incalculable from hour to hour, it would not only be the end of all promises, but the end of all projects. In not being able to see that, the Berlin philosopher is really on a lower <b>mental</b> <b>level</b> than the Arab who respects the salt, or the Brahmin who preserves the caste. And in this quarrel we have a right to come with scimitars as well as sabres, with bows as well as rifles, with assegai and tomahawk and boomerang, because there is in all these at least a seed of civilisation that these intellectual anarchists would kill. And if they should find us in our last stand girt with such strange swords and following unfamiliar ensigns, and ask us for what we fight in so singular a company, we shall know what to reply: [...] "We fight for the trust and for the tryst; for fixed memories and the possible meeting of men; for all that makes life anything but an uncontrollable nightmare.

He explained it with the fact that they were treated only on <b>mental</b> <b>level,</b> and not on spiritual level. According to his opinion, addiction is basically spiritual issue, so it needs to be treated on spiritual level.|$|E

At the <b>mental</b> <b>level</b> freedom is attained by the awakening of Kundalini through asana, pranayama, mudra or mantras, the amplification and sublimation of the vital and mental energy and the elevation of consciousness. The culmination of this process is spiritual illumination.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between psychological stress and <b>mental</b> health <b>levels</b> of university students was studied using a Stressometer (stress meter) and the Japanese version of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 28. A GHQ 28 survey {{was performed on}} 22 students with high stress levels of 70 or higher TNR (TNR: units measured by a stress meter) and 19 students with normal stress levels 36 or lower TNR. In students with high stress levels, the average overall GHQ 28 score was 9. 0. In students with normal stress <b>levels,</b> the average <b>mental</b> health score of 5. 3 was significantly lower (p< 0. 02). In students with high stress levels, a particularly notable feature was the social activity disorders in the GHQ factor scales. This study suggests that measurement of stress levels using a stress meter may be useful for assessing <b>mental</b> health <b>levels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of <b>mental</b> fatigue <b>level</b> would improve operational {{safety and efficacy}} of astronauts for long-term space flight. Identification of neurophysiological markers can index impending overload or fatigue before performance decrements using neuroimaging technologies. The current study utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIR) to investigate the relationship of hemodynamic response in prefrontal cortex with changes of <b>mental</b> fatigue <b>level,</b> task performance (reaction time) during n-back working memory task and routine work task in analog space environment. Results indicated that the information entropy of hemodynamic response is related to task performance and subjective self-reported measures; the reaction time is predicted by regression analysis; and the accuracy of mental fatigue classification approaches 90 %. Since fNIR is a portable, wearable and minimally intrusive methodology, {{it has the potential}} to be deployed in future space environments to monitoring mental fatigue and assessing the effort of operators in field environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In recent scenario, mental stress {{analysis}} is important task. There are different methods {{used in the}} literature survey to extract the mental stress. Wavelet transform as transformation, Power, Energy, entropy, Co-variance, Standard deviation and Mean, as features and K nearest neighbor (KNN) or Back Propagation are commonly used to build mental stress system. In this paper, a modified approach to <b>mental</b> stress <b>level</b> detection in a person has been proposed. In this method two lead ECG data extraction and bior 3. 9 (bio-orthogonal) wavelet transform {{has been used for}} decomposition of ECG signal data up to level three. Features Such as Power, Energy, Entropy, Co-variance, Standard deviation and Mean are used for stress detection and analysis. Finally the Back Propagation classification algorithm is used for classification of <b>mental</b> stress <b>level</b> and normal level. The result from this approach is more favorable and acceptable...|$|R
