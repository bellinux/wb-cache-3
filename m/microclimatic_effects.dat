As a result, turbulent vertical mixing is weaker in the lee of the barrier than it is upwind, and interesting secondary <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> result. For instance, by day sensible heat rising from the ground due to the absorption of sunlight (see surface energy budget) is mixed upward less efficiently in the lee of a windbreak, with the result that air temperature near ground is somewhat higher in the lee than on the windward side. Of course this effect is attenuated with increasing downwind distance and indeed, beyond about 8H downstream a zone may exist that is actually cooler than upwind.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mendoza’s Metropolitan Area (MMA), in central-western Argentina, is {{the result}} of a {{development}} model where the man-made environment and the natural one conform an intermingled mosaic, resulting in a strong insertion of green open spaces in the city. In this context, the open spaces: parks, squares and urban forests significantly modify the climatic pattern of the built environment.

40|$|The <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effect</b> of bats {{roosting}} in bell holes (blind vertical cylindrical cavities in cave roofs) in Runaway Bay Caves, Jamaica, {{was measured}} {{and the potential}} impact of their metabolism on dissolution modelled. Rock temperature measurements showed that bell holes with bats get significantly hotter than those without bats during bat roosting periods (by an average of 1. 1 °C). The relationship is clearest for bell holes with more than about 300 g aggregate bat body mass and for bell holes that are moderately wide and deep, of W:D ratio between 0. 8 and 1. 6. Measurement of temperature decay after abandonment showed that rock temperature returns to normal each day during bat foraging periods. Metabolic activity from a typical population of 400 g bat (10 individuals) yields 41 g of CO 2, 417. 6 kJ of heat, and 35. 6 g of H 2 O in each 18 hour roost period, and could produce a water film of ~ 0. 44 mm, that is saturated with CO 2 at ~ 5 %. The resultant rock dissolution is estimated at ~ 0. 005 cm 3 CaCO 3 per day. The metabolic heat ensures that the focus of dissolution remains vertical regardless of geological controls. A typical bell hole 1 m deep may be formed in some 50, 000 years by this mechanism alone. Addition of other erosional mechanisms, such as direct bacterial bio-erosion, or the formation of exfoliative organo-rock complexes, would accelerate the rate of formation. The hypothesis is developed that bell holes are initiated and formed by bat-mediated condensation corrosion and are governed by geographic distribution of clustering bats and their roosting behaviour...|$|R

50|$|In a study near Chapleau, Ontario (Groot 1992, Groot et al. 1997), {{openings}} {{were created}} in 40-year-old aspen and monitored to determine their influence on outplanted white spruce seedling development. Circular openings 9 m and 18 m in diameter, 9 m and 18 m wide east-west strips, and a 100 m × 150 m clearcut were planted and spot-seeded. The variation in solar radiation, air temperature, and soil temperature among the strips and plots was almost {{as great as the}} variation between the clearcut and intact forest. Solar radiation during the first growing season varied from 18% of the above-canopy values within the uncut stand to 68% values {{at the center of the}} 18 m strip. Near the edges of the strips, solar radiation was about 40% of the above-canopy along the south and 70% to 80% along the north. Stomatal conductance in white spruce seedlings declined generally from more sheltered to more exposed environments, correlating best with increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Without vegetation control, position in openings had little effect on the growth of planted white spruce; regrowth of lesser vegetation isolated seedlings from the <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> of overstorey treatment. Seedling diameters were independent of environment, while height growth was only slightly greater in environments having more light. With vegetation control, white spruce diameter and height were greatest in the center of the strips, even though there was less light there than along the north edge of the strips. Moisture stress may have accounted for that result.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{global warming}} is acting across marine, freshwater, and {{terrestrial}} ecosystems to favor species adapted to warmer conditions and/or reduce the abundance of cold-adapted organisms (i. e., "thermophilization" of communities). Lack of community responses to increased temperature, however, has also been reported for several taxa and regions, suggesting that "climatic lags" may be frequent. Here we show that <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> brought about by forest canopy closure can buffer biotic responses to macroclimate warming, thus explaining an apparent climatic lag. Using data from 1, 409 vegetation plots in European and North American temperate forests, each surveyed at least twice over an interval of 12 - 67 y, we document significant thermophilization of ground-layer plant communities. These changes reflect concurrent declines in species adapted to cooler conditions and increases in species adapted to warmer conditions. However, thermophilization, particularly the increase of warm-adapted species, is attenuated in forests whose canopies have become denser, probably reflecting cooler growing-season ground temperatures via increased shading. As standing stocks of trees have increased in many temperate forests in recent decades, local <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> may commonly be moderating the impacts of macroclimate warming on forest understories. Conversely, increases in harvesting woody biomass-e. g., for bioenergy-may open forest canopies and accelerate thermophilization of temperate forest biodiversity...|$|E

For that purpose, frosty pod rot intensity, a disease caused by Moniliophthora roreri on cacao pods, was monitored in 36 cacao agroforests in Costa Rica in order to assess the vegetation composition and spatial structure variables conducive to the disease. Hierarchical partitioning was used to identify the most causal factors. Firstly, pod production, cacao tree density and shade tree spatial structure had significant independent effects on disease intensity. In our case study, the amount of susceptible tissue was the most relevant host composition variable for explaining disease intensity by resource dilution. Indeed, cacao tree density probably affected disease intensity more by the creation of self-shading rather than by host dilution. Lastly, only regularly distributed forest trees, and not aggregated or randomly distributed forest trees, reduced disease intensity in comparison to plots with a low forest tree density. A regular spatial structure is probably crucial to the creation of moderate and uniform shade as recommended for frosty pod rot management. As pod production is an important service expected from these agroforests, shade tree spatial structure may be a lever for integrated management of frosty pod rot in cacao agroforests.

40|$|We {{investigated}} microclimatic edge gradients {{associated with}} grassy powerlines, paved highways and perennial creeks in wet tropical forest in northeastern Australia during {{wet and dry}} seasons. Photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature and vapor pressure deficit, soil temperature, canopy temperature, soil moisture, and air speed {{in the rain forest}} understory were measured during traverses perpendicular to the forest edge. Light intensity was elevated near the edges of powerlines, highways, and creeks, but this effect was strongest for creek edges. Air temperature and vapor pressure deficit were elevated near powerline edges in the dry season and highway edges in both wet and dry seasons but were not elevated near creek edges in either season. In contrast, soil moisture was lowered near creek edges but not near either powerline or highway edges. No edge gradients were detected for air speed. Canopy temperature was elevated near highway edges and lowered near powerline edges in the wet season but no edge gradients in canopy temperature were detected near creek edges in either the wet or the dry season. We suggest that these different edge gradients may be largely the result of differences in the fluxes of latent and sensible heat within each type of linear canopy opening, with periodic flood disturbance assisting by maintaining a more open canopy near creek edges. Our data indicate that the nature of the linear canopy opening is at least as important as the width in determining the nature and severity of <b>microclimatic</b> edge <b>effects,</b> analogous to the "matrix effect" of traditional fragmentation studies...|$|R

Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the detrimental effect of excess nitrogen on butterflies: loss of host plants, deterioration of food plant quality and microclimatic cooling in spring. Here, we investigated whether these mechanisms might explain the dramatic recent decline of the Wall Brown butterfly Lasiommata megera. Monitoring data from the Netherlands indeed show a greater decline at higher critical load exceedance of nitrogen deposition. Loss of host plants is not a likely explanation of the decline for this grass-feeding species. In a greenhouse experiment, we only found beneficial effects of nitrogen fertilization on larval performance, which seems to rule out a nutritional cause; application of a drought treatment did not result in significant <b>effects.</b> <b>Microclimatic</b> conditions at overwintering larval sites of L. megera and the related but increasing Pararge aegeria provided a possible clue.

40|$|Most {{multicellular}} {{terrestrial organisms}} experience climate at scales of millimetres to metres, yet most species-climate associations are analysed at resolutions of kilometres or more. Because individuals experience heterogeneous microclimates in the landscape, species sometimes survive {{where the average}} background climate appears unsuitable, and equally may be eliminated from sites within apparently suitable grid cells where microclimatic extremes are intolerable. Local vegetation structure and topography can be important determinants of fine-resolution microclimate, but a literature search revealed {{that the vast majority}} of bioclimate studies do not include fine-scale habitat information, let alone a representation of how habitat affects microclimate. In this paper, we show that habitat type (grassland, heathland, deciduous woodland) is a major modifier of the temperature extremes experienced by organisms. We recorded differences among these habitats of more than 5 °C in monthly temperature maxima and minima, and of 10 °C in thermal range, on a par with the level of warming expected for extreme future climate change scenarios. Comparable differences were found in relation to variation in local topography (slope and aspect). Hence, we argue that the <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> of habitat and topography must be included in studies if we are to obtain sufficiently detailed projections of the ecological impacts of climate change to develop detailed adaptation strategies for the conservation of biodiversity. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate the ecological consequences of buffer strip retention on riparian and terrestrial biodiversity. Earlier studies on forest buffer strips have evaluated their effectiveness in relation to water quality and aquatic biota. However, forests along streams are species rich habitats for many organism groups. Buffer strip management {{is assumed to be}} important also for protecting such species. Current approaches to biodiversity-oriented forest management practices need to be scientifically evaluated. In this thesis the effects on bryophytes and land snails have been evaluated. A before-and-after experiment along 15 small streams in northern Sweden showed that buffer strips of 10 m {{on each side of the}} stream moderated the negative effects exhibited at the clear-cuts. The number of land snail species remained similar as to before logging and the number of vanished bryophyte species was lower in the buffer strips than in the clear-cuts. The ground moisture influenced the survival rate of land snails at the clear-cuts. At mesic sites many species vanished but at wet sites the snail fauna was unaffected by the logging. Many bryophyte species, most of them liverworts, decreased or disappeared in the buffer strips. These were mostly growing on substrates elevated from the forest floor, such as logs, stumps and tree-bases. A number of nationally red-listed species, sensitive for changes in microclimate, were among those decreasing most. Thus, for the species in most need of protection the buffer strips were too narrow. An experiment with bryophyte transplants followed over a season showed that wet ground moisture moderated the negative edge effects in narrow buffer strips. On the other hand, the growth in mesic and moist sites was almost as low as in comparable clear-cuts. <b>Microclimatic</b> edge <b>effects</b> are stronger at south facing than north-facing edges of forest clear-cuts. This was shown in an experiment using bryophyte growth as an indicator of differences in microclimate. However, the depth of edge influence seemed to be similar between north- and south-facing forest edges, > 30 m for one species. An explanation for this could be that wind penetrates deeper into edges than solar radiation and has a more variable direction. In conclusion, narrow buffer strips consist entirely of edge habitat. For many species the environment in buffer strips is good enough for persistence. For others, most notably bryophyte species on convex substrates, wider buffer strips are needed to ensure long-term survival...|$|R
40|$|Human {{activities}} {{have led to}} the loss and fragmentation of rainforest around the world’s tropics and sub-tropics, whilst internal fragmentation by linear clearings has subdivided many remaining areas of rainforest, exacerbating the effects of the initial disturbance. Linear clearings for human infrastructure, including roads and powerlines, are widespread within the rainforests {{of the world and the}} Wet Tropics World Heritage Area of north-eastern Queensland in particular. Edge effects of these linear clearings have the potential to substantially increase the disturbed area within existing tracts of rainforest and affect a wide range of rainforest biota. I examined the edge effects of two artificial linear clearings on rainforest understorey microclimate, physical disturbance regimes, vegetation structure and composition and tree seedling survival and growth. Edge effects adjacent to powerline clearings and highways were compared with those near perennial creeks, the only type of widespread natural linear canopy opening available in the complex mesophyll vine forest of the Palmerston Region in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area of northeastern Queensland (average annual precipitation 3000 – 4000 mm). Understorey microclimate of rainforest adjacent to highways, powerline clearings and creeks was significantly altered from that of the forest interior. Light intensity was elevated near the edges of powerline clearings, highways and creeks with the effect being strongest for creek edges. Air temperature and vapour pressure deficit were elevated near powerline clearing edges in the dry season and highway edges in both wet and dry seasons but were not elevated near creek edges in either season. In contrast, soil moisture was reduced near creek edges but remained unaltered near powerline clearing and highway edges. Air speed was not significantly related to distance from the forest edge when assessed with instantaneous measurements although slight increases in air speed were detected near the edge of the forest when diurnal patterns were assessed using data loggers. The predominant air speed throughout the study sites, however, remained at or close to 0 m s- 1. Canopy temperature was elevated near highway edges and lowered near powerline edges in the wet season but no edge gradients in canopy temperature were detected near creek edges in either season. These different edge gradients may be largely the result of differences in the fluxes of latent and sensible heat within each type of linear canopy opening with these data indicating that the nature of the linear canopy opening is at least as important as the width in determining the severity and extent of <b>microclimatic</b> edge <b>effects.</b> Variation in the understorey light environment was assessed using the red:far red ratio, which has been shown in other studies to correlate very closely with percent canopy transmittance as well as other commonly used measures of canopy cover and light availability. Average red:far red values were elevated near creek edges and reduced near powerline and highway edges although the proportion of high light measurements (≥ 0. 70) was elevated within 12 m of all edge types. These data indicate that anthropogenic edges are more ‘sealed’ (ie have a greater foliage density near the edge) than creek edges. This more open vegetation structure near creek edges was accompanied by a decline in soil moisture (due to changes in soil texture) suggesting that periodic flooding may be one of the causative factors maintaining lower foliage density and thus a comparatively more open edge structure. Measures of physical disturbance provided mixed results. There were greater numbers of fallen trees near the edges of powerlines, highways and creeks but no particular tree size appeared to be disproportionately at risk of tree-fall mortality. As there was also a greater number of living trees near the forest edge, it is uncertain whether the mortality rate of canopy trees truly was elevated near the forest edge. In contrast, small-scale disturbance to seedlings through falling leaf litter and canopy debris was not consistently greater near the forest edge than in the forest interior. Although the rate of small-scale disturbance, as measured with artificial seedlings, was elevated near highway edges, there was no consistent reduction in the stature of taller (≥ 50 cm) seedlings near the edge as might be expected amongst seedlings suffering greater rates of physical trauma. Whilst the elevated rate of damage to artificial seedlings near highway edges might be a result of greater moisture stress, perhaps as a result of elevated wet season canopy temperatures and year-round increases in understorey vapour pressure deficit near highways, the lack of any consistent signal in seedling stature suggests that this effect may not significantly influence the seedling community. Vegetation structure and composition were altered near the edge of the forest, relative to the forest interior. The abundances of vines, small trees and saplings were elevated near the forest edge. Pioneer species were also more abundant near the edge, particularly adjacent to creeks. Light-demanding herbs occurred more frequently and late-successional shrubs less frequently near the forest edge than in the interior. Grasses and weeds were found almost exclusively on the very edge of the forest but were also recorded in large canopy gaps within 12 m of highway edges and at low abundance within 12 m of creek edges. Changes in the proportions of early-, mid- and latesuccessional tree species between adults and juveniles suggested that understorey light conditions were no longer suitable for the recruitment of early-successional trees near anthropogenic edges. This suggests that anthropogenic edge structure has become more sealed since these edges were created. In contrast, understorey light availability near creek edges remained sufficient for the recruitment of light-demanding pioneer species. Proximity to the edge did not significantly affect seedling survival or growth for eight species included in a herbivore-exclusion experiment. The seedlings of pioneer species survived only in areas with high light availability (ie within the powerline clearing and near creek edges). Light availability was also the strongest determinant of the survival of seedlings of mid- and late-successional species. There was weak evidence for a decrease in herbivory pressure near the forest edge and no evidence of an effect of edge distance on seedling survival or growth. The majority of seedlings did not experience any growth in this experiment although the probability of seedlings experiencing positive growth rates increased with increasing light availability. The major differences observed in this study occurred in seedling survival rather than seedling growth, suggesting that the ability of seedlings to persist in the understorey may have been an important factor influencing the composition of the tree seedling community. These data indicate that artificial linear clearings were associated with edge gradients in the abiotic environment of the adjacent forest and that these abiotic edge effects were the driving force behind changes observed in the plant community at the forest edge. The understorey of forest near the edges of highways and powerlines was brighter, warmer and drier than the forest interior although only slightly windier. In contrast, the edges of natural linear canopy openings did not cause elevated moisture stress but did experience elevated light availability. Analysis suggests that a combination of differences in the degree of edge ‘sealing’ among edge types caused by varying disturbance regimes in the clearings and differences in the physical properties of the linear canopy openings themselves (particularly in the level of evaporative cooling) were responsible for the observed biotic and abiotic edge gradients near natural and anthropogenic linear canopy openings...|$|R

40|$|Microclimate {{has been}} known to drive {{variation}} in the distribution and abundance of insects for some time. Until recently however, quantification of <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> has been limited by computing constraints and the availability of fine-scale biological data. Here, we tested fine-scale patterns of persistence/extinction in butterflies and moths against two computed indices of microclimate derived from Digital Elevation Models: a summer solar index, representing fine-scale variation in temperature, and a topographic wetness index, representing fine-scale variation in moisture availability. We found evidence of microclimate effects on persistence in each of four 20 × 20 km British landscapes selected for study (the Brecks, the Broads, Dartmoor, and Exmoor). Broadly, local extinctions occurred more frequently in areas with higher minimum or maximum solar radiation input, while responses to wetness varied with landscape context. This negative response to solar radiation is consistent with a response to climatic warming, wherein grid squares with particularly high minimum or maximum insolation values provided an increasingly adverse microclimate as the climate warmed. The variable response to wetness in different landscapes may have reflected spatially variable trends in precipitation. We suggest that locations in the landscape featuring cooler minimum and/or maximum temperatures could act as refugia from climatic warming, and may therefore have a valuable role in adapting conservation to climatic change...|$|E
40|$|Long term {{applications}} of leguminous green mulch could increase mineralizable nitrogen (N) beneath cupuaçu trees produced on the infertile acidic Ultisols and Oxisols of the Amazon Basin. However, low quality standing cupuaçu litter could interfere with green mulch N release and soil N mineralization. This study compared mineral N, total N, and microbial biomass N beneath cupuaçu trees grown {{in two different}} agroforestry systems, north of Manaus, Brazil, following seven years of different green mulch application rates. To test for net interactions between green mulch and cupuaçu litter, dried gliricidia and inga leaves were mixed with senescent cupuaçu leaves, surface applied to an Oxisol soil, and incubated in a greenhouse for 162 days. Leaf decomposition, N release and soil N mineralization were periodically measured in the mixed species litter treatments and compared to single species applications. The effect of legume biomass and cupuaçu litter on soil mineral N was additive implying that recommendations for green mulch applications to cupuaçu trees can be based on N dynamics of individual green mulch species. Results demonstrated that residue quality, not quantity, was the dominant factor affecting the rate of N release from leaves and soil N mineralization in a controlled environment. In the field, complex N cycling and other factors, including soil fauna, roots, and <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects,</b> had a stronger influence on available soil N than residue quality...|$|E

These {{data are not}} able to represent temperatures at the canopy level, which control crop growth, and the impact of heat stress on crop yield, which are modified by canopy characteristics and plant physiological processes Since such data are often not available and current simulation approaches are complex and/or based on unrealistic assumptions, new methods for integrating canopy temperatures in the framework of crop system models are needed. Based on a forward stepwise-based model selection procedure and quantile regression analyses, we developed empirical regression models to predict winter wheat canopy temperatures obtained from thermal infrared observations performed during four growing seasons for three irrigation levels. We used daily meteorological variables and the daily output data of a crop system model as covariates. The standard cross validation revealed a root mean square error (RMSE) of ~ 0. 8 ˝C, 1. 5 – 2 ˝C and 0. 8 – 1. 2 ˝C for estimating mean, maximum and minimum canopy temperature, respectively. Canopy temperature of both water-deficit and fully irrigated wheat plots significantly differed from air temperature. We suggest using locally calibrated empirical regression models of canopy temperature as a simple approach for including potentially amplifying or mitigating <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> on plan...|$|E

40|$|The drought Australia {{now faces}} {{is leading to}} shifts in the {{perception}} of the continent, of Australians and the world. The ideals of lush green landscapes are making way for landscape designs in which dryness is a quality of the design. On a map of the world, Australia is enormous, and seems empty because development is concentrated around its edges. Its heart must be red, in the cultural projections of the world from images of Uluru, 'the rock', set in a flat desert with no relief. Of course the country is not really all desert - surely? - with low shrubs pretty much throughout. Inhabitation seems to cling to the edges where teh continent feels <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> from the adjacent oceans and edging mountain ranges, which screen the population from the real state of the environment - dry, harsh, amazing and unique. Australia is rightly proud of this harsh difference from its edges, but prefers the harshness to be 'out there'. At the moment however, the country is pretty much universally in drought, and the contrast between green and brown, that it has celebrated, even built its identity around, is disappearing to become brown throughout. Without the browning of Australia, some areas, such as tropical Queensland, are having their designed public landscapes and gardens revealed as an elaborate mythology, a landscape fraud...|$|E
40|$|The {{density of}} Dhaka is {{increasing}} exponentially, {{and with it}} the demand for residential accommodation. Rapid densification is increasing hard surfaces and changing the urban texture, thereby escalating heat absorption. This intensifies dependency on valuable conventional energy resources, for thermal comfort. Research shows that regional climatic data differs markedly from localised <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> within the built environment. In built-up residential areas of the city there is the lack of natural wind flow, {{one of the most important}} ingredients for comfort during the warm monsoons. Electricity is growing costlier day by day and its supply is erratic, while load shedding to balance the supply and demand, is very common. This paper presents the findings of an ongoing research, to investigate the effects of growing densification in the city on the potential for natural ventilation. The work is based on the premise that the effect of variation in density will be reflected in the comparative differences in qualities of the thermal environment (indicated by the temperature and wind speed measurements) in the different residential areas of Dhaka. Higher temperatures in the denser parts of the city may be attributed to larger daytime absorptions and slower night-time cooling, and lack of breeze to distribute the unevenness. In conclusion some passive measures are suggested to rectify the negative aspects of the environment...|$|E
40|$|A complex urban ecosystem, {{with various}} local climate and air quality influences, emerges within urban {{structures}} with interacting anthropogenic and natural factors. These influences have different {{temporal and spatial}} characteristics. Human well-being is influenced by a multitude of <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects,</b> which are elementary for urban planning. These {{form the basis of}} intelligent control and design of various processes within urban smart cities. For example, micro climatic modeling helps to get a better understanding of temperature changes in diverse urban areas. Possible consequences of different planning scenarios can be explored in advance. The required data for such scenarios are mainly collected at selected locations by multiple individuals. However, the collection of the complete urban data is expensive and time consuming. The non-standardization of data saving formats and measurement procedures leads to various deviations. In future, all relevant data of a smart city should be available ubiquitously and in real time. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a possibility of data standardization and data saving in a worldwide accessible data base. Furthermore, it should be addressed how the data base has to be structured, where local climate data can be saved, and how the data can be made accessible. The basis for this system consists of the interface between the database and different measurement instruments, whose values are stored directly in this data base. For this reason, the data base is essential for the central data infrastructure of smart cities. In addition, this paper shows how a freely accessible system not only improves the quality of urban life, but also makes it measureable...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{disturbance}} and secondary succession on spatio-temporal patterns in the abundance of species is stymied {{by a lack of}} long-term demographic data, especially in response to infrequent and high intensity disturbances, such as hurricanes. Moreover, resistance and resilience to hurricane-induced disturbance may be mediated by legacies of previous land use, although such interactive effects are poorly understood, especially in tropical environments. We address these central issues in disturbance ecology by analyzing an extensive dataset, spanning the impacts of Hurricanes Hugo and Georges, on the abundance of a Neotropical walking stick, Lamponius portoricensis, in tabonuco rainforest of Puerto Rico during the wet and dry seasons from 1991 to 2007. By synthesizing data from two proximate sites in tabonuco forest, we show that resistance to Hurricane Hugo (97 % reduction in abundance) was much less than resistance to Hurricane Georges (21 % reduction in abundance). Based on a powerful statistical approach (generalized linear mixed-effects models with Poisson error terms), we documented that the temporal trajectories of abundance during secondary succession (i. e., patterns of resilience) differed between hurricanes and among historical land use categories, but that {{the effects of}} hurricanes and land use histories were independent of each other. These complex results likely arise because of differences in the intensities of the two hurricanes with respect to <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> (temperature and moisture) in the forest understory, as well as to time-lags in the response of L. portoricensis to changes in the abundance and distribution of preferred food plants (Piper) in post-hurricane environments...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the environmental and}} socio-economic effects associated with the planting of Atriplex nummularia Lindl. (Oldman saltbush) in the karoo. This is the first study of its kind on oldman saltbush and serves as an important scoping exercise in assessing the impact of saltbush on its surrounds and in identifying additional aspects which require investigation. The environmental parameters investigated include <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects,</b> soil induced changes, salinity effects on the germination of selected karoo species and compositional changes in the indigenous plant community within a saltbush plantation. When compared to indigenous karoo plant species oldman saltbush is found to ameliorate soil temperatures and increase surface soil salinity (specifically sodium chloride), on an individual plant basis. Salinity is shown to have a differential effect on the germination of selected karoo shrubs. The indigenous plant community within a forty year old saltbush plantation is impoverished with both density of individuals and species richness being markedly reduced. Saltbush is identified as an unsuitable nurse plant {{for the majority of}} karoo shrubs. Farm size in relation to both actual and intended area established to saltbush is considered. The area of saltbush already established in the karoo is considered too insignificant to have any wide socio-economic impact. Farmers who intend planting large areas of their farms to saltbush are in the minority. It is those farmers who already have some saltbush planted, who intend planting more. Ecologically based management guidelines are presented, suggesting practices which minimize the detrimental effects of saltbush on soil salinity and the indigenous plant community. These guidelines are practical and in keeping with the overall objectives of optimum resource utilisation and the national grazing strategy for South Africa...|$|E
40|$|The geomorphological {{impact of}} small fossorial mammals (adapted to digging and living underground), such as rodents can be significant, and both their direct and {{indirect}} effects may contribute to landscape formation. This thesis is based on empirical field studies of two burrowing rodent species in sub-polar environments, namely invasive House mice (Mus musculus) on sub-Antarctic Marion Island and Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) in sub-Arctic Abisko. The spatial distribution, sediment displacements, impact on vegetation and <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> of the rodents are documented. Invasive mice and rats, introduced on sub-Antarctic Islands during the 19 th century, lack natural enemies and are shown {{to have a significant}} {{direct and indirect}} geomorphic impact by direct sediment displacement, vegetation removal by burrowing, grazing and trampling and thereby exposing the sediments for rain, wind and frost processes.   The geomorphic impacts of lemmings are comparatively more limited as they rely on natural hollows and snow cover for protection and do not burrow to the same extent as other fossorial rodents in cold regions. Lemmings are thus suggested to have little impact on landform integrity, but can affect vegetation composition. A comparison of the findings from this study with published data on seven other rodent species and other physical mass transfer mechanisms in sub-polar and alpine environments suggests that fossorial rodents are a significant and sometimes dominant geomorphic force in sub-polar and alpine environments. The geomorphic work by ground squirrels, ice rats, plateau pikas and zokors is shown {{to be in the same}} order of magnitude as solifluction and rock falls. In alpine and periglacial environments these rodents are considered to act as key-stone species and ecosystem engineers through the creation of landforms by  dislocation and of soil and other impacts on soil properties, vegetation and ecosystem functio...|$|E
40|$|A high {{proportion}} of amphibian species are threatened with extinction globally, and habitat loss and degradation are the most frequently implicated causes. Rapid deforestation {{for the establishment of}} agricultural production is a primary driver of habitat loss in tropical zones where amphibian diversity is highest. Land-cover change affects native assemblages, in part, through the reduction of habitat area and the reduction of movement among remnant populations. Decreased gene flow contributes to loss of genetic diversity, which limits the ability of local populations to respond to further environmental changes. The focus of this dissertation is on the degree to which common land uses in Sarapiquí, Costa Rica impede the movement of two common amphibian species. First, I used field experiments, including displacement trials, and a behavioral landscape ecology framework to investigate the resistance of pastures to movement of Oophaga pumilio. Results from experiments demonstrate that pastures do impede movement of O. pumilio relative to forest. <b>Microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> on movement performance as well as limited perceptual ranges likely contribute to reduced return rates through pastures. Next, I linked local processes to landscape scale estimates of resistance. I conducted experiments to measure habitat-specific costs to movement for O. pumilio and Craugastor bransfodrii, and then used experimental results to parameterize connectivity models. Model validation indicated highest support for resistance estimates generated from responses to land-use specific microclimates for both species and to predator encounters for O. pumilio. Finally, I used abundance and experiment-derived resistance estimates to analyze the effects of prevalent land uses on population genetic structure of the two focal species. While O. pumilio did not exhibit a strong response to landscape heterogeneity and was primarily structured by distances among sites, C. bransfordii genetic variation was explained by resistance estimates from abundance and experiment data. Collectivity, this work demonstrates that common land uses can offer different levels of resistance to amphibian movements in Sarapiquí and illustrates the value of investigating local scales processes to inform interpretation of landscape-scale patterns. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} series of summer air {{temperature}} isotherm maps based on chironomid-inferred temperatures from northwest Europe, covering the Lateglacial and early Holocene (15 – 8 ka BP). These maps are the first of their kind, and use data derived from 22 Lateglacial sites and 34 early Holocene sites. The isotherms are generated by weighted spatial interpolation (kriging). The major patterns of chironomid-inferred summer temperatures are spatially well-resolved in both the Lateglacial and early Holocene. The isotherm maps indicate {{that there was a}} strong west to east gradient during the Lateglacial Interstadial (GI- 1) due to the influence of thermohaline circulation in the regions bordering the north Atlantic, which diminishes eastwards. A strong north to south temperature gradient is also apparent, particularly in eastern regions, influenced by the extent of the Scandinavian ice-cap. Peak temperatures are achieved early in the Interstadial in the south of the region but occur {{towards the end of the}} Interstadial in the north. Holocene warming varies spatially and temporally and is earliest in the south and east, but later in the north and west. During the period covered in our study maximum warmth is reached ca. 10 ka BP. The chironomid-based Lateglacial isotherm maps are compared with previously published isotherm maps from the same region based on beetle-inferred temperatures. While the trends shown in the two datasets are similar, beetle-inferred temperatures are often warmer than chironomid-inferred temperatures. This is especially marked in GI- 1 e and may be due to <b>microclimatic</b> <b>effects</b> causing the chironomids to underestimate air temperatures and/or the beetles to over-estimate air temperatures. The spatial coherence between sites in both the Lateglacial and early Holocene suggest that the chironomid-based temperature estimates are largely reliable, although data testing suggests that estimates from southern Scandinavia may be less reliable perhaps due to high topographical relief influencing local climate. More data points are required, particularly from northwest Scotland, southwest England and Wales, northeast France, Denmark, Finland and the Baltic States, to confirm trends and provide even coverage and a denser network of site...|$|E
