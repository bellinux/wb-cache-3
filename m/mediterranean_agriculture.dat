40|$|Intensity of tillage {{practices}} can enhance organic matter decomposition, increasing CO 2 emissions from soil to the atmosphere. Conservation tillage (CT) {{has been proposed}} {{as a means of}} counteracting potential damages to the environment. In this study the effects of two CT systems, reduced tillage in a long-term experiment (RTL) and no-tillage in a short-term experiment (NTS), were compared to traditional tillage (TT) in the long (TTL) and short-term experiments (TTS). CO 2 fluxes, total soil organic carbon (SOC) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) were evaluated at 0 - 5, 5 - 10 and 10 - 15 cm depths throughout the three years studied (Oct. 2006 -Jul. 2009). Traditional tillage increased CO 2 emissions compared to CT. The CT treatments (RTL and NTS) accumulated more SOC in the surface layer (0 - 5 cm) than the TT treatments (TTL and TTS). SOC accumulation was moderate but DHA consistently increased in CT in the surface soil, especially with a legume crop included in the crop rotation. Values of stratification ratio of all parameters studied were higher in the CT treatments (RTL and NTS).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the {{countries}} of the Eastern <b>Mediterranean</b> Basin <b>agriculture</b> consumes 87 % of the total water resources. Concurrently the water demand of tourism sites develops rapidly. The increasing water competition between these two vital sectors endangers the economic prosperity of the entire region. While agriculture provides the living basis for most of the rural population, tourism carries hopes for increasing wealth and employment in the region. Sustainable water management schemes are urgently needed, since the water conflicts lead to severe overuse of the natural water resources. Such a sustainable water management requires the exploitation of the large marginal water sources of the region. Large-scale implementations of water purification and desalination technologies require huge energy amounts. Biomass is a very suitable basis for providing the water related energy needs. The region has abundant agricultural residues from cereals, corn or palm tree plantations. Moreover, the climatic conditions are favourable for energy crops, which can be irrigated with brackish water. The implementation of biomass based waters supply schemes needs a comprehensive approach of all stakeholders in the private and public sector tackling simultaneously energy and water related issues. This approach best can be achieved by formulating intersectorial water management plans. An integrated model for sustainable water action plans is a valuable tool for supporting the preparation of biomass based water action plans easier on local and regional level...|$|R
40|$|All {{throughout}} the <b>Mediterranean,</b> European <b>agriculture</b> undergoes deep structural transformations, related both with new production conditions, {{but also with}} new demands and requirements for the rural space and the functions that agriculture displays in it. Remote rural areas are normally more reluctant towards these new demands, especially when these concern other issues than production, but nevertheless the attitude toward the landscape understanding and its values has been shifting also here. At the foot of Serra de São Mamede uplands, the confrontation of the new agriculture and society demands with the small-scale farming is observed. As the most conflicting influences on landscape seem to be: • The complex modification of rural society and its lifestyle in last three generations • The possibility of Marvão being accepted as world heritage by UNESCO • Intellectual and economic impact on area form tourist and new-settlers Intensification and rationalisation of agriculture are weak. While the oldest generations are still mainly responsible for the practical field-work, maintaining the traditional polycultures; the younger ones are leaving in search for better future or work in other professions.

Through other political supports, this area with similar biophysical characteristics has developed in a different way.

30|$|In {{addition}} to being a low-cost, environment-friendly process, composting benefits also include reduction of volume, weight, moisture content, potential odor, and pathogens, as well as increasing potential nutrients of the waste (Scheutz et al. 2011). Most importantly, perhaps, the end product {{can be used as a}} useful soil amendment: fertilizer and/or soil conditioner (Huang et al. 2006; Iqbal et al. 2010), besides other uses such as pellets for fuel (Zajonc et al. 2014), isolating various microbial control agents (Larkin and Tavantzis 2013), and potential heat recovery from the composting process (Al-Widyan et al. 2008). However, compost from agro-industrial wastes in particular is more reliable and is considered ‘‘clean biowaste,’’ and thus may be utilized in crop systems as a fertilizer or soil conditioner with a good quality. (Ben Rebah et al. 2007). Olive milling wastes (OMW), grain dust (GD) from grain handling facilities, and coffee-processing wastes (CPW) represent three major agro-industrial waste streams. Meanwhile, in many regions like the <b>Mediterranean,</b> where <b>agriculture</b> is a major activity, soil quality has witnessed continued deterioration due to the widespread implementation of inadequate agricultural production techniques that constitute a serious threat to the sustainability of this vital sector (Zalidis et al. 2002; Lasaridi et al. 2006; Reynolds and Borlaug 2006; Verhulst et al. 2010; Martínez-Blanco et al. 2011). In addition, soils in this region in general suffer from low levels of organic content that is most commonly substituted by chemical fertilizers that have short-term impact on yield, typically up to 2  years, but fail to improve soil physical properties (Shiralipour et al. 1992; Carpenter-Boggs et al. 2000). Meanwhile, the Mediterranean has traditionally been and is projected to continue to be the world’s major olive producer, although olive industry is expanding beyond the Mediterranean into new territories such as Australia, for instance, where olive culture is witnessing a rapid growth.|$|R
40|$|Many recent {{reviews and}} meta-analyses of N 2 O {{emissions}} {{do not include}} data from Mediterranean studies. In this paper we present a meta-analysis of the N 2 O emissions from Mediterranean cropping systems, and propose a more robust and reliable regional emission factor (EF) for N 2 O, distinguishing the effects of water management, crop type, and fertilizer management. The average overall EF for <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>agriculture</b> (EF Med) was 0. 5 %, which is substantially lower than the IPCC default value of 1 %. Soil properties had no significant effect on EFs for N 2 O. Increasing the N fertilizer rate led to higher EFs; when N was applied at rates greater than 400 kgNha - 1, the EF did not significantly differ from the 1 % default value (EF: 0. 82 %). Liquid slurries led to emissions that did not significantly differ from 1 %; the other fertilizer types were lower but did not significantly differ from each other. Rain-fed crops in Mediterranean regions have lower EFs (EF: 0. 27 %) than irrigated crops (EF: 0. 63 %). Drip irrigation systems (EF: 0. 51 %) had 44 % lower EF than sprinkler irrigation methods (EF: 0. 91 %). Extensive crops, such as winter cereals (wheat, oat and barley), had lower EFs (EF: 0. 26 %) than intensive crops such as maize (EF: 0. 83 %). For flooded rice, anaerobic conditions likely led to complete denitrification and low EFs (EF: 0. 19 %). Our results indicate that N 2 O emissions from <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>agriculture</b> are overestimated in current national greenhouse gas inventories and that, with the new EF determined from this study, the effect of mitigation strategies such as drip irrigation {{or the use of}} nitrification inhibitors, even if highly significant, may be smaller in absolute terms. </p...|$|E

The research focuses on two different regions in Spain that represent the continental agriculture of the region of Castilla-Leon in the northern central plateau and the <b>Mediterranean</b> fertile <b>agriculture</b> of Andalusia in the south. The analysis has been carried out based on mathematical programming models that simulate farmers’ behaviour and their response to the different policy scenarios that correspond to the EU agricultural policies (CAP programmes) and water policies (Water Framework Directive) currently in place. Specifically, these scenarios are: full and partial decoupling, subsidy modulation, crop prices reduction, cross-compliance measures and water pricing policies. Results indicate that the new decoupled CAP will not lead to drastic changes in land use in the two regions studied but will have negative repercussions on farmers’ income. Moreover, the introduction of additional measures, such as cross-compliance, will contribute substantially to improving and protecting the environment even though they amount to an additional cost for farmers. Reduction in crop prices will have significant effects on international trade and is likely to produce a reduction in farm intensification and hence a beneficial effect on the environment but will involve negative socio-economic impacts in marginal rain-fed farms. As regards the integration of agricultural and water conservation policies, the application of the EU Water Framework Directive in conjunction with the new CAP reform would produce different region-specific effects and might question the viability of a number of irrigated farms in Spain...|$|R
40|$|In the <b>Mediterranean</b> region, {{conservation}} <b>agriculture</b> principles like minimum soil disturbance or retaining residues on {{soil surface}} are rarely applied in irrigated annual cropping systems. This paper compares a conservation agriculture practice, permanent bed planting (PB), with a conventional {{system in which}} the ridges are reformed annually (CB). Comparisons were made throughout a crop sequence of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L) -maize (Zea mays L.) - cotton in which PB was introduced before the maize cropping. Traffic was controlled during the study. Both maize and cotton crops produced higher leaf area index and biomass under PB than CB and 8 and 24 % higher yield respectively though the yield benefit for maize was not significant. The PB system did not improve Water-use Efficiency but delayed water use until the later growth stages. Soil organic matter (SOM) was significantly higher in PB compared to CB one year after the introduction of the system, and this difference was due to higher SOM in the 0 - 0. 05. m layer, particularly in the furrows. The lack of negative effects of PB on yield and the positive effects on SOM, coupled with increased water infiltration and reduced erosion shown in previous studies, point to the beneficial adoption of PB in the region assuming the patterns are confirmed in the longer term. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|An augment of soil {{organic matter}} (SUM) in {{agricultural}} lands is mandatory to improve soil quality and fertility and to limit greenhouse gases emissions. A better protection of SUM from degradation is seconded to its inclusion in aggregates and {{to the formation of}} organo-mineral interactions with the clay fraction within the soil matrix. Under <b>Mediterranean</b> conditions, conservation <b>agriculture</b> (CA) has been widely related with macro-aggregates formation, SUM protection, and to an improvement of soil fertility and crop yields. The objective of this work was to evaluate the biogeochemical properties of five aggregate-size fractions obtained by dry sieving of a Calcic Fluvisol of an experimental farm managed under three different tillages. Soil aggregates distribution, total organic carbon (TUC), labile carbon pools, and enzymatic activities were measured in 2 different periods of the same agricultural campaign. CPMAS C- 13 NMR analyses were also performed to elucidate the structure of preserved SOM. The results evidenced seasonal variability in aggregate distribution, labile carbon pools and dehydrogenase activity (DHA), whereas TOC, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POxC), and p-glucosidase activity demonstrated to be reliable soil quality indices for soil fractions. The NMR analyses showed a better SUM preservation under conservation tillages, due to higher plant litter inputs and/or higher amount of necromass derived compounds if compared with traditional tillage. Particularly interesting are the results of the circle divide 0. 5 - 1 mm fraction, in which different trends were found for beta-Glu and several organic compound classes if compared with the other fractions. Possibly, in this fraction are concentrated most of the products from cellulose depolymerization stabilized by organo-mineral interactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
