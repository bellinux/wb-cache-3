2500|$|In 1982, the 1¢ coin {{was changed}} to dodecagonal, and the 5¢ was further debased to a {{cupro-nickel}} alloy. In 1987, [...] a $1 coin struck in aureate-plated nickel was introduced. A bimetallic $2 coin followed in 1996. In 1997, copper-plated zinc replaced bronze in the 1¢, and it returned to a round shape. This was followed, in 2000, {{by the introduction of}} even cheaper plated-steel 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ coins, with the 1¢ plated in copper and the others plated in cupro-nickel.

2500|$|The {{prototype}} of the LaGG-3, I-301, was designed by Semyon A. Lavochkin, Vladimir P. Gorbunov and Mikhail I. Gudkov. It was designated LaGG-3 in serial production. Its airframe was partially made of wood delta-veneer (a resin-wood <b>multi-ply</b> veneer composed of very thin, 0.35 to 0.55mm, wood veneer and phenol formaldehyde resin, baked at high temperature and pressure) used for the crucial parts. This novel construction material had tensile strength {{comparable to that of}} non-hardened aluminum alloys and only 30% lower than that of precipitation hardened D-1A grade [...] duralumin. It was also incombustible and completely invulnerable to rot, with service life measured in decades in adverse conditions. The full wooden wing (with plywood surfaces) was analogous to that of the Yak-1. The only difference was that the LaGG's wings were built in two sections. The fuselage was of similar construction to the MiG-3's. The LaGG-3's armament consisted of a 20mm ShVAK cannon, with 150 rounds, which was installed in the motornaya pushka in the cylinder block split- between the [...] "V" [...] of the engine cylinders and firing through a hollow propeller shaft, and two synchronized 12.7mm Berezin UBS machine guns with 170 rpg. Consequently, the combined weight of rounds fired per second was 2.65kg/s, making the LaGG-3 superior in burst mass to all contemporary Russian fighters, particularly to the MiG-3. Most other Russian fighters of that era were considered under-gunned in relation to western contemporary fighters. This is somewhat true even for the Yak-1, which had a 20mm cannon and two 7.62mm machine guns, but not the later versions of the Polikarpov I-16, which had two cannons and two machine guns.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{efficient}} 3 -bit-scan <b>multi-plier</b> without overlapping bits which has good power-delay-area tradeoffs.

The architecture of the 3 -bit-scan multiplier with-out overlapping bits is therefore suitable for synchronous sequential multipliers which are required to operate at low power and at relatively high speed for their area. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Modular {{multiplication}} is {{the most}} dominant arith-metic operation in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), which {{is a type of}} public-key cryptography. Montgomery multiplication is commonly used as a technique for the modular multiplication and required scalability since the bit length of operands varies depend-ing on the security levels. Also, ECC is performed in GF (P) or GF (2 n), and unified architectures for GF (P) and GF (2 n) <b>multi-plier</b> are needed. However, in previous works, changing frequency or dual-radix architecture is necessary to deal with delay-time dif-ference between GF (P) and GF (2 n) circuits of the multiplier be-cause the critical path of GF (P) circuit is longer. This paper pro-poses a scalable unified dual-radix architecture for Montgomery multiplication in GF (P) and GF (2 n). The proposed architecture unifies 4 parallel radix- 216 multipliers in GF (P) and a radix- 264 multiplier in GF (2 n) into a single unit. Applying lower radix to GF (P) multiplier shortens its critical path and makes it possible to compute the operands in the two fields using the same <b>multi-plier</b> at the same frequency so that clock dividers to deal with the delay-time difference are not required. Moreover, parallel archi-tecture in GF (P) reduces the clock cycles increased by dual-radix approach. Consequently, the proposed architecture achieves to compute GF (P) 256 -bit Montgomery multiplication in 0. 23 μs. I...|$|R
