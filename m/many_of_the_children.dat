5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{physical}} isolation, the islanders maintained a lively community. A school {{had been established}} in 1723 by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SPCK), with sixty children on its initial attendance roll. The demands of island life conflicted to some extent with those of schooling. The SPCK's inspector found only eighteen out of seventy pupils present when he visited in 1824. He found that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were fully occupied helping their families in summer and only attended school in winter. Two places of worship were built {{within a couple of}} years of each other, a Baptist chapel in 1877 and a Church of Scotland church in 1878 (at a cost of £900). Although they soon became focal elements of community life, there seems to have been some bad blood between the two congregations, perhaps due to a clash between the missionary zeal of local Baptists and the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk.|$|E

25|$|In his {{capacity}} as Reich Commissioner, Heinrich Himmler oversaw {{the kidnapping of}} Polish children to be Germanised. Historians estimate that between 50,000 and up to 200,000 Polish children were taken from their families during the war. They were sent to farms and families in the Reich never to return. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> remained in Germany after the war unaware of their true origin.|$|E

In 2007, Terry and Marilyn's son, Ben Casteel took over head winemaking duties as Terry's sense of smell declined due {{to the advancement of}} Parkinson. Ted and Pat's daughter, Mimi, is the general manager and viticulturist.|$|E
25|$|Women's clubs helped {{establish}} juvenile courts. The first juvenile court {{was established in}} Chicago in 1899 through the urging of the Chicago Woman's Club whose members felt that children should not be treated as adults by the court. Clubwomen from the Chicago Woman's Club went to court with <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> {{in order to ensure}} they were being treated fairly. The Chicago Woman's Club also established a Protective Agency for Women and Children in 1886.|$|E
50|$|In 1922, Fitzgerald {{introduced}} {{a constitutional amendment}} to allow Congress to control the labor and working hours of children under 18 which was passed by Congress in 1924.

The German language was frequently used in the classrooms up until World War I, when the school abandoned this practice due to anti-German feeling in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{disturbed}} {{nature of}} the child's relationship with its parent(s) before their removal by the state. Serious relationship disturbances are considered likely to be important contributors to difficulties in establishing new attachment relationships. Psychiatric and substance abuse histories and other criminal activities are common. Developmental delays in the children are common {{and there is a}} considerable range of regulatory, socioemotional and developmental problems. The child may perceive relationships as inconsistent and undependable. Further, despite harsh and inconsistent treatment <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> remain attached to their parents, complicating the development of new attachment relationships.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> from Yokneam Illit {{and their}} {{families}} remained in the Megiddo school system, while families who moved from the Megiddo communities to Yokneam Illit were educating {{their children in the}} Yokneam Illit school system. The family ties and school friendships led to mixed Yokneam-Megiddo parents groups in both communities and nearly all sports activities and many other after-school activities being fully integrated. Today, it is extremely rare to find a local team representing only Yokneam Illit or only the Megiddo Regional Council.|$|E

25|$|The {{school was}} founded by Anna Essinger and two of her sisters in the Swabian town of Herrlingen in 1926. It began {{as an adjunct to}} the {{children}}'s home founded by Essinger's sister Klara in 1912. In 1925, as her own children and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> in care came of school age, she got the idea to turn the orphanage into a landschulheim (boarding school). Landschulheim Herrlingen opened on 1 May 1926 as a private boarding school with 18 children ranging in age from 6 to 12. Anna Essinger became head of the school and her sister Paula, a trained nurse, became the school nurse and its housekeeper. The ceremonies to open the school were attended by Theodor Heuss and Otto Hirsch from Stuttgart, as well as the mayors of Göppingen and Ulm.|$|E
25|$|Emmy Werner {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{scientists}} to use the term resilience in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from Kauai, Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> in the study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work. Werner noted that of the children who grew up in these detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-wedlock births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of these youngsters did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'. Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed them to be more successful than non-resilient children and families.|$|E

500|$|Szalavitz {{notes that}} {{according}} to a 2004 statement released by the National Institutes of Health, teen programs using [...] "fear and tough treatment" [...] are not successful and evidence shows that they can worsen existing behavioral problems. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> that enter these programs suffer from mental illness, and already {{have a history of}} prior trauma and abuse. Szalavitz uses first-person accounts from teenagers that participated in these programs, and asserts that the programs have potentially serious negative consequences, including post-traumatic stress and deaths.|$|E
500|$|Because many {{of these}} lemurs have become {{endangered}} {{as a result of}} deforestation in Madagascar, Lemurs' Park participates in a reforestation program supported by Colas Madagascar and Total Madagascar. [...] Between December 2008 and May 2013, approximately 37,163students and 1,270teachers from the public primary schools around Antananarivo have helped plant 170native trees and participated in environmental education at Lemurs' Park. [...] For <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> this program has allowed them to see free-ranging lemurs for the first time. [...] In total, more than 11,000 trees have been planted as part of this collaborative project, including rosewood, Terminalia, and amontana as of May 2013. [...] Saplings of endemic plants, including baobabs, from the Madagascar spiny thickets {{in the southern part of}} the island have also been transported to the park and planted with the help of Colas.|$|E
500|$|Not My Life {{begins with}} a black screen on which the words [...] "Human {{trafficking}} is slavery" [...] appear in white. A sequence filmed in Ghana follows, showing children who are forced to fish in Lake Volta for 14 hours a day. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> die {{as a result of}} the working conditions. A 10-year-old boy swims through the murky water towards the camera, looking into it, and holds his breath underwater while trying to unsnarl a fishing net. Next, Senegalese talibes, Muslim boys who attend Quranic schools, appear. There are approximately 50,000 talibes in Senegal who are forced to beg on the streets to make money for their teachers; children who do not meet their quotas are beaten. Many of these children suffer from skin and stomach diseases because of their diet of spoiled food—one demonstrates his diseased hands to the camera, only for an adult to pull him away by the ear. The film then moves to India and depicts children, mostly wearing flip-flops, illegally sorting through hazardous waste in Ghazipur and New Delhi landfills. Romani families are shown in Central and Eastern Europe, and the narration indicates that Romani boys are often trafficked for the purpose of forced child begging, and that Romani girls are regularly trafficked as child prostitutes. The narrator says that the profits of human trafficking [...] "are built on the backs and in the beds of our planet's youth." ...|$|E
5|$|With Stanton's mother depressed, {{and since}} Stanton's father contended with <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> several <b>children,</b> {{including}} {{his eldest son}} Eleazar, by immersing himself in his work, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> rearing responsibilities fell to Stanton's elder sister, Tryphena, eleven years her senior, and Tryphena's husband, Edward Bayard. Bayard, a Union College classmate of Eleazar Cady's and son of James A. Bayard, Sr., a U.S. Senator from Wilmington, Delaware was, at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> his engagement and marriage to Tryphena, an apprentice in Daniel Cady's law office.

500|$|In 1979, Cunningham Elementary School had 436 students, {{well over}} its {{original}} capacity of 300. 75.5% {{of them were}} White, 14% qualified for free lunch, and 15% qualified for reduced cost lunch. Due to the increasing population and the sudden conversion of adults-only complexes to family oriented, Cunningham Elementary School became overcrowded by 1986 with its enrollment increasing from around 500 in 1985 to more than 900 the next year. By 1988, Gordon Elementary School, a campus in Bellaire, Texas, re-opened {{to serve as a}} reliever school to Cunningham and to a non-Gulfton school. By September 3 of that year, 1,268 students were enrolled at Cunningham; 72% were classified as Hispanic and 99% were on free or reduced-cost lunch programs. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> arrived from Central American countries experiencing civil strife, and therefore many had received an inadequate education prior to coming to the United States. In 1989, Cunningham's overcrowding was described as being [...] "unanticipated." [...] In 1988 the U.S. federal government passed the Fair Housing Act, which, under most circumstances, prohibits any policy that excludes families with children from living in an apartment complex. Abbe Boring, the principal of Cunningham in 1992, said that the student population increased when formerly singles-only apartments were required to allow families to rent complexes. In September 1991 Braeburn and Cunningham were two of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments; in other words the schools were filled to capacity and excess students had to attend other schools. By 1992, Cunningham had around 1,200 students and 51 temporary classroom units. Immediately prior to the opening of Benavidez, Cunningham had 1,400 students.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeologists {{have found}} the remains of at least 42 {{children}} sacrificed to Tlaloc at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> suffered from serious injuries before their death, {{they would have to}} have been in significant pain as Tlaloc required the tears of the young as part of the sacrifice.

2500|$|Blakeman ruled Stratford {{until his}} death in 1665, but as the second {{generation}} of Stratford grew up, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> rejected what they perceived as the exceptional austerity of the town's founders.

50|$|In the {{intervening}} periods between {{each pair of}} events, a series of child murders occurred, which were never solved. The book's surface explanation as to why those murders were never reported on the national news was that location mattered to a news story—a series of murders, no matter how gruesome, do not get reported if they happen in a small town. However, the book's implied reason for why the atrocities went unnoticed was far more sinister: It never let them. Since It controls what happens in Derry, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> murders are never solved, as <b>the</b> adults <b>of</b> Derry either act as though nothing is happening or have forgotten about the periodic murders and disappearances.|$|R
