The diver grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and takes them to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City.|$|E

5|$|By 1500, the {{population}} had expanded considerably. There {{were at least}} five mound centers (although the Shoulderbone site's population had declined dramatically) and several hundred smaller towns and other settlements.

5|$|Commanding {{his forces}} from Pleiku, Major General Phạm Văn Phú, the III Corps commander, was given {{adequate}} warnings {{of the impending}} North Vietnamese attacks, {{but they were not}} given serious consideration. Phú was deceived by an elaborate North Vietnamese communications charade and his belief that PAVN movements toward Buôn Ma Thuột were diversionary operations designed to distract him from the true objective, Pleiku. The defense of Buôn Ma Thuột, therefore, was entrusted to a single Ranger group and provincial Popular and Regional Force units (approximately 4,000 <b>men).</b> <b>They</b> were augmented at the beginning of March by 53rd Regiment of the 23rd ARVN Division.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} the time of Antigonus III Doson, the most elite Antigonid-period {{infantry}} were the peltasts, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding peltai javelins, swords, and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen, although they sometimes served in that capacity. Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected {{to serve in the}} elite agema vanguard, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000. The number of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 <b>men.</b> <b>They</b> fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into chalkaspides (bronze shield) and leukaspides (white shield) regiments.|$|E

5|$|The {{first four}} M-class shipsM, N, O, and Pwere 178 meters long at the waterline, and 183 meters long overall.

The ships had a {{designed}} displacement of 8,500metric tons, but displaced 7,800tons at standard load and 10,400tons fully laden. The ships had a crew of 28 officers and 892 <b>men.</b> <b>They</b> were designed to carry one picket boat, a barge, a launch, and two cutters.|$|E

5|$|The ships had {{a crew of}} twenty-one {{officers}} and 421 enlisted <b>men.</b> <b>They</b> carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one barge, two yawls, and two dinghies. They were good sea boats, but were fairly stiff and suffered from severe roll. The cruisers were maneuverable, but were slow going into a turn. Steering was controlled by a single large rudder. They lost speed only slightly in a head sea, but lost up to sixty percent in hard turns.|$|E
5|$|The {{version of}} events {{recorded}} by history {{is based on the}} accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes's column. Burnham, Ingram and Gooding's stories closely corroborate each other; their {{version of events}} was accepted as true by the Court of Inquiry at Bulawayo in December 1893. First-hand Matabele accounts such as Mjaan's, which were first recorded during 1894, appear to confirm the character of the break-out, saying that three of the white <b>men</b> <b>they</b> were fighting—including Burnham, whom several of them recognised—left during a lull in the battle, just after Wilson withdrew to his final position.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of fresh fighting in 1648, a Royalist army of 8,000 fresh recruits was mustered {{under the command of}} General Rowland Laugharne and Sir Edward Stradling, with the intent of retaking Cardiff. Parliamentary forces in Brecon under the command of Colonel Thomas Horton moved quickly to reinforce the castle, although with only 3,000 <b>men</b> <b>they</b> were content to wait until a larger army under Oliver Cromwell could arrive from Gloucester. With time against them, the Royalist army attacked, leading to the battle of St Fagans just to the west of Cardiff, and a heavy Royalist defeat.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{function}} of the FMPU was the training of combat cameramen. The units were based at nearby Page Military Academy. There were approximately 16 combat units, each made up of seven officers and between 20 and 30 enlisted <b>men.</b> <b>They</b> were trained to {{use a variety of}} photographic equipment and cameras and also received combat and weapons training. The cameramen were sent to every army air force base to document all aspects of the base's operations as well as aerial battle tactics and enemy airplane performance. Every cameraman was trained to load film into their camera under adverse conditions, and if need be, to develop it on location. Most of the aerial motion picture photography shot during World War II was filmed by Fort Roach alumni.|$|E

Randall from Pennsylvania, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. The first round of balloting was inconclusive, with Hancock and Bayard leading the count.

William Hayden English, a conservative politician and businessman from the swing state of Indiana, was nominated for vice president.|$|E
5|$|British {{intelligence}} assessed that Tirpitz {{could be}} repaired within six months, and the Admiralty ordered further carrier-borne strikes against the battleship. First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham {{did not believe}} that Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, but he hoped that further attacks would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. The commander of the Home Fleet, Vice Admiral Bruce Fraser, initially resisted this order on the grounds that further carrier raids on Kaafjord were unlikely to be successful as Tirpitzs defences would have been reinforced and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. Following an argument with Cunningham, Fraser eventually agreed to attack Kaafjord again. Despite the decision to make further attacks on Kaafjord, many of the Home Fleet's airmen were posted to other units following Operation Tungsten. This hindered subsequent operations against German forces in Norway as the new aircrew were less experienced than the <b>men</b> <b>they</b> replaced.|$|E

The German Navy regarded the ships as excellent sea boats, having gentle motion. The ships were highly maneuverable and had a tight turning radius, and only lost slight speed in a head sea.
