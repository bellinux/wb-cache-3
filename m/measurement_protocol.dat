Optimal work protocols with and without measurements of position and velocity are shown to be linear in time.

50|$|Part of {{the process}} of {{determining}} the effectiveness of anti-cancer agents in clinical trials involves measuring the amount of tumor shrinkage such agents can generate. The WHO Criteria, developed in the 1970s by the International Union Against Cancer and the World Health Organization, represented the first generally agreed specific criteria for the codification of tumor response evaluation. These criteria were first published in 1981. The RECIST Criteria, first published in 2000, revised the WHO Criteria primarily to clarify differences that remained between research groups. Under RECIST tumour size was measured unidimensionally rather than bidimensionally, fewer lesions were measured, and the definition of 'progression' was changed so that it was no longer based on the isolated increase of a single lesion. RECIST also adopted a different shrinkage threshold for definitions of tumour response and progression. For the WHO Criteria it had been >50% tumour shrinkage for a Partial Response and >25% tumour increase for Progressive Disease. For RECIST it was >30% shrinkage for a Partial Response and >20% increase for Progressive Disease. One outcome of all these revisions was that more patients who would have been considered 'progressors' under the old criteria became 'responders' or 'stable' under the new criteria. RECIST and its successor, RECIST 1.1 from 2009, is now the standard <b>measurement</b> <b>protocol</b> for measuring response in cancer trials.|$|E

He developed the theme further by proposing Roy's multipartite separability inequalities. Another area of his {{research was}} the Chandrasekhar limit and the critical mass of boson systems, and he collaborated with Andre Martin to propose a proof for the relativistic collapse of Mcr critical mass.

40|$|Introduction: Waist {{circumference}} (WC) measurement {{is one of}} {{the best}} anthropometric measures as it can reliably identify and indicate changes in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue over time. Due to the use of WC measurements in the clinical setting there is a need for a standardised or universally accepted WC protocol to be put in place. The WC <b>measurement</b> <b>protocols</b> differ in regards to their site of measurement, respiratory phase and posture throughout different guidelines, manuals and studies. If WC <b>measurement</b> <b>protocols</b> are not reproducible or cannot be used together overtime then changes as a consequence of various clinical interventions may be misinterpreted and inappropriate conclusions can be drawn. Objective: To investigate the reproducibility and agreement of four commonly used protocols for measuring waist circumference Design: Four WC <b>measurement</b> <b>protocols</b> were used to measure participants WC on two separate occasions three days apart. The four protocols were taken from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), Anthropometric Standardization Reference Manual (ASRM), Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK). Two ways analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested the difference between the WC measurements and between the WC measurements taken both days. Individual differences between the ISAK protocol and the three other WC protocols were assessed through Bland-Altman plots of limits of agreement method. Reproducibility within each of the four WC <b>measurement</b> <b>protocols</b> was investigated by calculating a mean difference and coefficient of repeatability (2 SD) for each as well as formally testing using a paired t-test. Results: Fourteen healthy Scottish female university students with a mean age of 24. 50 (SD 4. 926) years and a mean BMI of 23. 79 (SD 5. 36). Two-way ANOVA showed a difference between WC measurements for the four protocols (p< 0. 05) with no evidence of a day effect. Bland-Altman’s limits of agreement illustrated good agreement between ISAK and ARSM protocols, with a Bias (1. 89) and LOA (Mean +/- 2 SD) (- 0. 39, 4. 16). The NHANES and FHS had poor agreement with the ISAK protocol. The significance level of each of the paired t-tests (≥ 0. 05) indicated that all four WC were reproducible. Conclusion: The four WC <b>measurement</b> <b>protocols</b> were reproducible regardless of site of location, phase of respiration or posture. However the less routinely used ISAK protocol had the best agreement with the more commonly used ASRM protocol but still has the potential to overestimate WC measurement if used interchangeably. Both these protocols used similar site of location and respiratory phase. Further investigation is required in a larger and more diverse population.
