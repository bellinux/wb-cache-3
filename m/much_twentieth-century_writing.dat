40|$|What remains {{from the}} fin-de-siecle Mozart revival is, of course, its {{aesthetic}} influence on twentieth-century neoclassicism and modernism, particularly within {{the tradition of}} the Second Viennese School. Despite the fantastic commercial popularity that Mozart's music now enjoys, from the historian's perpective the turn to Mozart {{in the early twentieth century}} constituted an effort to revive the claims among many musicians on behalf of a model of purely musical hearing and listening. A premium on form and procedures of musical development within works of music-on structural devices overtly detached from the sort of extramusical illustration associated with Wagner-became a hallmark of <b>much</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> concert music. The turn away from the associative musical strategies of late Romanticism helped make <b>much</b> of <b>twentieth-century</b> music less accessible and therefore less popular. Wagnerism held the key to the mass audience. Therefore, from the vantage point of the late twentieth century, the rediscovery of Mozart during the early 1900 s helped lead, on the one hand, to the most extreme deification and dissemination of Mozart and his music within the museum of music, and, on the other (albeit indirectly, through the medium of modernist advocates of theories of absolute music) to the relative marginalization of contemporary music and musical modernism in our own time...|$|R

40|$|An innovative, {{interdisciplinary}} {{study of}} why leprosy, a disease {{with a very}} low level of infection, has repeatedly provoked revulsion and fear. Rod Edmond explores, in particular, how these reactions were refashioned in the modern colonial period. Beginning as a medical history, the book broadens into an examination of how Britain and its colonies responded to the [...] . More believed spread of leprosy. Across the empire this involved isolating victims of the disease in 'colonies', often on offshore islands. Discussion of the segregation of lepers is then extended to analogous examples of this practice, which, it is argued, has been {{an essential part of}} the repertoire of colonialism in the modern period. The book also examines literary representations of leprosy in Romantic, Victorian and <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writing,</b> and concludes with a discussion of traveller-writers such as R. L.

40|$|The twentieth-century novel {{can now be}} {{considered}} to form a distinct and popular area of study. This edited collection brings together {{experts in the field}} of <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writing</b> to provide a volume that is both comprehensive and innovative in its discussion of a set of newly canonical texts. From turn of the century texts such as Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899), through the work of acclaimed authors such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence, and right up to more contemporary examples including Hanif Kureishi's The Buddha of Suburbia (1990) and Zadie Smith's White Teeth (2000) this volume provides a lively yet informed re-evaluation of some of the twentieth-century's most significant and enduring literature. The emphasis in the collection is on a synthesis of original and established approaches to the texts, making the book particularly useful to newcomers to the field. The book employs a theoretically and philosophically informed approach but its style and language make it accessible to a wide audience...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} part of the Scottish heritage for women writers now is the figure of the dangerous woman. In <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writing</b> she may sometimes seem to align herself with a feminist perspective, but she refuses to become quite ideologically sound. She is too sinister for that. She has appeared since the ballads as the daughter of the other world, with all the danger and the glamour that that implies. In modern fantasy her refusal to accommodate herself to a world of known boundaries and social realism maybe related to her psychological alienation from the patriarchal model. But with the other world open to her, she becomes more than subversive, she is perilous, and perhaps, in terms of accepted moralities, downright evil. [1]With these words Margaret Elphinstone described one of the four persistent traditional elements in contemporary fantasy fiction by women in Scotland in an article published in 1992. While introducing the concept of 'the dangerous woman' as a focal point, Elphinstone established three crucial points about this recurring traditional trope: 1. Evil = Glamour. 2. The dangerous woman rejects the patriarchal world. 3. Her role has consequences on narrative tradition and theory...|$|R

40|$|Historical climate {{simulations}} {{of the period}} 1861 – 2000 using two new Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) global climate models (CM 2. 0 and CM 2. 1) are compared with observed surface temperatures. All-forcing runs include the effects of changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases, ozone, sulfates, black and organic carbon, volcanic aerosols, solar flux, and land cover. Indirect effects of tropospheric aerosols on clouds and precipitation processes are not included. Ensembles of size 3 (CM 2. 0) and 5 (CM 2. 1) with all forcings are analyzed, along with smaller ensembles of natural-only and anthropogenic-only forcing, and multicentury control runs with no external forcing. Observed warming trends on the global scale and in many regions are simulated more realistically in the all-forcing and anthropogenic-only forcing runs than in experiments using natural-only forcing or no external forcing. In the all-forcing and anthropogenic-only forcing runs, the model shows some tendency for too <b>much</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> warming in lower latitudes and too little warming in higher latitudes. Differences in Arctic Oscillation behavior between models and observations contribute substantially to an underprediction of the observed warming over northern Asia.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation of three concerts {{is designed to}} present wind instruments in unique combinations by bringing them together with other performance mediums. Programming for wind ensembles that moves beyond the traditional configuration of a full band to include other performers (voices, narrators, strings, organ) adds flexibility and appeal {{to the performance of}} music for winds. As the title implies, all the works chosen for inclusion on these programs involve a distinctive interweaving of wind instruments, with a variety of voices-whether human (both spoken and sung), the "voicing" of the pipe organ, choral music, or vocally based music-as the foundation of original classical works for winds. The additional works for larger wind-chamber ensembles provide another distinctive type of "voice" that can substantially enhance variety in programming and audience reception. Wind bands/ensembles may be combined with other voices to create variety in programming that attracts and hold the attention of discerning listeners. These concerts utilize the Annapolis Wind Symphony and the Chancel Choir of First Presbyterian Church of Annapolis. All concerts are professionally recorded on DVD with high­ quality digital sound. This project creates programs of variety and interest, while presenting music of true quality. The emphasis on voices and vocal music as an underlying theme harkens back not only to the roots of <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writing</b> for winds but also to our over-all musical heritage that began with vocal music...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the empirically-oriented style of realism also informs {{what we now call}} “the fantastic. ” Genres such as science fiction, fantasy, and the Gothic are based on the {{representation}} of a seemingly “realistic” world whose ontology is complicated by the presence of non-empirical phenomena. These phenomena are rendered through a detailed style that is analogous to that mobilized by purportedly realistic narratives, serving, therefore, a dual purpose: it builds up an apparently natural setting that foils the super- or the non-natural, and it lends an air of credibility to entities and events that empirical culture generally tends to reject. Realism and the fantastic have, in other words, a common stylistic matrix: along with the emergence of empiricism in the early modern age went the definition of new, pervasive protocols of representation that were used to describe both the “real” and the “unreal”, the “realistic” and the “unrealistic”. Over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, however, literary codes separated out from factual codes, and the relationship between realism and the fantastic became self-consciously oppositional. The style − and ideology − of the novel were utilized {{and at the same time}} problematized by supernatural fiction, which questioned its ability to provide a reliable representation of reality. Later, the critique of realism enacted by modernism and post-modernism undermined the opposition between the novel and the fantastic, encouraging the non-realistic use of realistic styles typical of <b>much</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> fiction...|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{the twentieth}} century, the {{relationship}} between representation and abstraction has been regarded predominantly in terms of opposition. One of the prominent early twentieth-century defenders {{of this approach is}} Wilhelm Worringer (1881 - 1965), who introduces representation and abstraction as antithetic modes of art-making in Abstraction and Empathy. A Contribution to the Psychology of Style (1908). However, while he distinguishes between abstraction and representation on theoretical grounds, Worringer also observes that, in the history of art, these modes of art-making coexist. The current thesis examines Worringer’s approach to the writing of art history and theory, inquiring into his perspective on the personal responses of viewers and artists to the world, and the manifestations of these responses in art. Abstraction and Empathy addresses issues of empathy, form, and will, in aesthetics and art-making; it discusses and extends the writings of Theodor Lipps, Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Alois Riegl. At {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, Worringer’s book attracted much attention: like its sequel, Form in Gothic (1910), it was often associated with the rise to prominence of Expressionism in Germany. Later in the twentieth century, Worringer’s thought came under the scrutiny of Rudolf Arnheim, who criticized Worringer’s emphasis on abstract-representational opposition. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari praised Worringer’s approach to antithesis, yet questioned the terms Worringer proposed as opposites. For Arnheim, Deleuze and Guattari, alternatives to the antithesis between abstraction and representation became visible. Indeed, in Worringer’s time, artists such as Adolf Hildebrand, Ferdinand Hodler, Paul Cézanne, Claude Monet and Wassily Kandinsky underscored the common grounds between representation and abstraction. Exploring Worringer’s Abstraction and Empathy and Form in Gothic, as well as the words and works of Hildebrand, Hodler, Cézanne, Monet and Kandinsky, this thesis aims to highlight abstract-representational interplay as observable in early <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writing</b> and art-making...|$|R

In evaluating both novels' treatment of female subjectivity, unregimented masculinity and the symbiotic relationship between sexual pleasure and mortal danger, this article investigates {{the degree to which a}} contemporary novel such as In the Cut, which is generally acknowledged to be an ‘erotic thriller’, is heavily indebted to the gothic romance and may therefore be interpreted as a continuation of this more traditional genre, and, conversely, the means through which Moore's novel exhibits an overt and defiant resistance to the gothic romance, thereby signifying the dissolution of this particular genre within <b>twentieth-century</b> women's <b>writing...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} influence of internationalism in <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writing</b> with special regard to the British scene, as writers there negotiated the triple phenomena of globalization, decolonization, and World War. My project begins with a historical-theoretical survey that follows a trajectory from eighteenth-century Enlightenment writers on internationalism, through Marx and {{the founding of the}} First International in 1864, and into the twentieth century, when the movements of global capital made national boundaries increasingly permeable and modernist experiment highlighted the interpenetration of cultures. The chapters that focus more specifically on literary production take up the writing of Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and C. L. R. James, reading them with an emphasis on how they imagine international topographies and twentieth-century political identity. Pulling in the opposite direction to the centrifugal force of internationalism, in a tension that is highlighted in my project, is the centripetal force of nationalism and national identity. I read internationalism as a discourse that hovers at the boundaries of nationalism, and, in various guises, appears to threaten it. The period I investigate is bracketed on one side by Conrad, whose texts not only stand at the threshold of modernism, but also appear to uphold and undermine simultaneously the ideas of imperialism and nationalism, {{and on the other side}} by C. L. R. James, whose work represents the growing body of postcolonial literature that endeavors to imagine what kind of connections and affiliations could supplant dissolved colonial ties. The governing thesis of this project is that modernism was “international” in more than the obvious way it has been portrayed. Modernism has been described as international because it was a movement that flourished in a number of different countries, and because of the way artists and writers circulated in the multinational metropolitan center. In addition to these factors, and perhaps because of them, I argue that internationalism is itself a political idea articulated in the literature of this period. ...|$|R

Rodríguez's pianist Rubén González, who played piano on the 1990s recordings, described the 1940s as [...] "an era of real musical life in Cuba, when {{there was very little}} money to earn, but everyone played because they really wanted to". The era saw the birth of the jazz-influenced mambo, the charanga, and dance forms such as the pachanga and the cha-cha-cha, as well as the continued development of traditional Afro-Cuban musical styles such as rumba and son, the latter transformed with the use of additional instruments by Arsenio Rodríguez to become son montuno.

40|$|The use of {{language}} in contemporary opera and experimental music theatre has long extended far beyond traditional singing. Under the dual influence of scat singing and Roy Hart, <b>twentieth-century</b> vocal <b>writing</b> has expanded the concept of song to encompass extended vocal techniques such as screaming, growling, vocal fry and non-Western singing styles, leading to works as diverse as Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire, Cage's Aria and Maxwell-Davies's Eight Songs for a Mad King. As had {{been the case in}} literature and the visual arts, Modernism also led to a preoccupation with undermining fixed objectivity and what nineteenth-century Romanticism had understood as "meaning". In vocal music, this inevitably led to the deliberate obfuscation of verbal meaning. Verbal incomprehensibility in vocal music therefore dates from the early Twentieth Century and can be accomplished in one of two methods: by rendering the language impossible to understand by means of the musical setting, or through the use of non-verbal sounds for the vocal part. Many pieces use elements from both these techniques...|$|R
