50|$|Use of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> {{continued}} to decline through the 1990s, as fragrance manufacturers voluntarily switched to alternative fragrance compounds. For example, <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> {{has not been}} used in Japanese products (on a voluntary basis) since 1982, and the Association of the German Toiletries and Detergents Industry (IKW) recommended the replacement of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> by another compound in 1993. Production of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> in the European Union {{came to a halt}} and, by 2000 (the last year for which full data are available), imports to Europe were only 67 tonnes, with China as the most important source. The estimated 2008 usage of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> in the European Union was 25 tonnes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is not genotoxic. It has {{significant}} effects on liver function which {{are similar to}} those shown by phenobarbital, for example, induction of CYP2B6 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Nevertheless, the European Union Risk Assessment Report admits that <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is a [...] "borderline case".|$|E
5000|$|The {{biodegradation}} of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> in {{sea water}} and in mixed sea water/sediment systems was studied in laboratory simulations using carbon-14 labelled <b>musk</b> <b>xylene,</b> {{and the results}} discussed in an addendum to the European Union Risk Assessment Report. The half-life in marine sediment {{was estimated to be}} 60 days or less, with biodegradation occurring by anaerobic reduction of the nitro groups. The half-life in sediment-free sea water was estimated to be more than 150 days, far above the [...] "very persistent" [...] threshold of 60 days. The 2008 addendum also discussed the photolysis of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> in water and in air, which are rapid: however, photolysis was not considered to be relevant in the persistence of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> in the environment, and was not taken into account in classifying it as a [...] "very persistent" [...] substance.|$|E
50|$|These {{findings}} indicate that <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is not completely removed from wastewater by the sewage treatment process. Two studies in Germany found compared <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> concentrations in incoming wastewater and sewage treatment plant effluent, and found removal rates of 82% and 58%. However, they are not concentrations which {{are expected to be}} toxic to aquatic life. The European Union Risk Assessment Report reviewed more than a dozen studies of the toxicity of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> to algae and to aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates, and all found no observed effect concentrations greater than 10 µg/l, the chronic aquatic toxicity threshold in the EU REACH Regulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> {{is still}} {{permitted}} {{for use in}} cosmetics products (except oral care products) in the European Union under the Cosmetics Directive. The permitted quantities are: up to 1% in fine fragrances; up to 0.4% in eau de toilette; up to 0.03% in other products. European Union suppliers must inform their customers on request if a product contains more than 0.1% by weight of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is {{classified}} in the European Union as an explosive under the Dangerous Substances Directive and as a category 1.1 explosive under the CLP Regulation. The European Union classification {{reflects the fact that}} hazardous heating under confinement cannot be excluded in the industrial use of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene,</b> as opposed to its transport, and so it is necessary to warn potential users of the risk.|$|E
50|$|The first {{concerns}} about <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> {{arose in the}} early 1980s, with the detection of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> residues in fish from the Tama River near Tokyo, and subsequently in the river water itself, especially at the outlets of sewage treatment plants. This led to a voluntary moratorium {{on the use of}} <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> in Japan from 1982. Similar residues were subsequently found in European waters such as the Elbe, Stör and Ruhr rivers in Germany, the German Bight area of the North Sea and sewage treatment plant outlets in Sweden. Typical concentrations were >0.001 µg/l in sea water, 0.001-0.01 µg/l in river water and 0.01-0.1 µg/l (sometimes higher) in the effluent from sewage treatment plants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> {{has been}} used {{in a wide variety of}} {{consumer}} products since the early 1900s, usually in very small quantities. World production of nitro musks in 1987 was about 2500 tonnes, but had fallen to about 1000 tonnes by the early 1990s: <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> made up roughly two-thirds of the production of nitro musks during this period. Production was concentrated in Western Europe, with the United Kingdom alone accounting for 28% of world production of nitro musks.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is an {{analogue}} of {{the explosive}} trinitrotoluene (TNT), {{so it is}} unsurprising that its safety characteristics have been studied in some detail. Indeed, the nitro musks were first discovered {{in an attempt to}} produce new high explosives. It has also been used - albeit in very small amounts - in mass-market consumer products for the last hundred years. The discovery of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> residues in the environment prompted new concerns about its possible long-term toxicity, and led to the sharp decline in its use from the mid to late 1980s. The European Chemicals Agency has listed <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> as a [...] "substance of very high concern" [...] (SVHC) under the REACH Regulation, judging it to be [...] "very persistent and very bioaccumulative" [...] (vPvB) but not meeting the criteria for human or environmental toxicity to be of concern.|$|E
50|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is a {{synthetic}} musk fragrance which mimics natural musk. It {{has been used}} as a perfume fixative in a wide variety of consumer products, and is still used in some cosmetics and fragrances.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> {{was once}} {{the most widely used}} of the [...] "nitro-musks", but its use has {{declined}} sharply since the mid-1980s due to safety and environmental concerns. Its explosive and carcinogenic hazards are recognized to be borderline, and <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is a useful example of the lowest level of such risks which need to be taken into account. However, it is a very persistent and very bioaccumulative pollutant in the aquatic environment (vPvB substance), and is the first substance to be proposed as a [...] "substance of very high concern" [...] (SVHC) for these reasons alone under the European Union REACH Regulation. Since no company has applied for authorisation, therefore it is banned in the EU.|$|E
50|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is {{produced}} from meta-xylene (1,3-dimethylbenzene), by a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and aluminium chloride followed by nitration with {{fuming nitric acid}} or with a 70:30 mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. The crude product is recrystallized from 95% ethanol.|$|E
50|$|A further {{complication}} is the metabolism of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene.</b> One {{route of}} metabolism is through reduction {{of one or}} more nitro groups by the intestinal microflora (gut bacteria) to produce aromatic amines such as p-NH2-musk xylene. This metabolite has a different liver toxicity: in particular, it inhibits the CYP1B enzymes by covalent binding.|$|E
50|$|It will explode when detonated under {{confinement}} (UN gap test) or when heated under confinement (Koenen test), {{but does}} not explode under the BAM fallhammer test (limiting impact energy 25 J) or the BAM friction test (limiting load >360 N). There is no ignition, explosion, self-heating or visible decomposition when <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is heated (without confinement) to 75 °C for 48 hours.|$|E
50|$|These classifications {{are based}} mainly {{on a single}} study of oral {{exposure}} to <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> in B6C3F1-strain mice. The mice showed a highly significant increase in liver adenomas and carcinomas at median dietary intakes of 170 mg/kg body weight (males) and 192 mg/kg body weight (females), as well as significant increases in adenomas in the Harderian gland (male mice only) and in the liver at median dietary intakes of 91 mg/kg body weight (males) and 101 mg/kg body weight (females).|$|E
50|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> also {{demonstrates}} some of {{the problems}} of classifying substances as carcinogens. It has been placed into Group 3 ("not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans") by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and is classified in the European Union as category 3 carcinogen ("cause concern for man owing to possible carcinogenic effects but in respect of which the available information is not adequate for making a satisfactory assessment") under the Dangerous Substances Directive and a category 2 carcinogen ("suspected human carcinogen") under the CLP Regulation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> {{is used as}} {{an example}} case in the United Nations Manual of Test Methods and Criteria as a {{substance}} which shows some explosive properties but which {{does not have to}} be transported as Class 1 dangerous goods under the Model Regulations.

This does not count as [...] "confinement" [...] in the meaning of explosives tests: indeed, the special packing is intended to prevent over-confinement during transport.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{different}} primary bioaccumulation {{studies were}} reviewed in the European Union Risk Assessment Report, with bioaccumulation factors varying between 640 l/kg and 6740 l/kg. Given that <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> {{has a very}} high octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow = 4.9), the higher bioaccumulation factors {{were considered to be}} the more significant. The 2008 addendum considered a further laboratory study from the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry which was not available to the authors of the original Risk Assessment Report and which also showed bioaccumulation factors in fish (Cyprinus carpio) that were higher than the REACH threshold of 5000 l/kg for [...] "very bioaccumulative" [...] substances. Bioaccumulation factors of more than 5000 l/kg (wet weight basis) have also been found in carp (Carassius carassius) and eels (Anguilla anguilla) from a sewage treatment pond.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{materials}} are ubiquitous in Guerlain’s work: high quality citruses (bergamot, citron, mandarin, sweet and bitter orange), coumarin, floral absolutes (cassie, jasmine, rose, orange blossom), green notes (galbanum), violet-smelling ionones and fine qualities of orris, vanilla and ylang-ylang. He had {{a fondness for}} aromatic spices (cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, croton, nutmeg) and certain herbes de Provence (absinthe, angelica, basil, bay leaf, caraway, coriander, cumin, tarragon). He was a specialist on aromatic resins (benzoin, labdanum); indeed he used opoponax in most of his formulae, sometimes in mere trace quantities - imperceptible {{in and of itself}} though lending to the overall texture of the perfume. His base notes often consisted of strong artificial musks (musk ketone, musk ambrette, <b>musk</b> <b>xylene),</b> which he favored greatly. As to ambergris, according to a supplier, Guerlain would say, [...] "You sell this product at a shameful price; it smells of almost nothing, but my clients stop liking my perfumes when I put none in." ...|$|E
50|$|Concerns about {{chemicals}} ingested {{by children}} when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission {{to order a}} temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of {{which is based on}} an opinion by the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other phthalates (DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of phthalates (DINP, DIDP, and DNOP) “in toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth by children”. Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including <b>Musk</b> <b>Xylene,</b> MDA, HBCDD, DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in Annex XIV of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011. According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015.|$|E
40|$|The report {{provides}} the PBT {{assessment of the}} substance 5 tert butyl 2, 4, 6 trinitro-m-xylene (<b>musk</b> <b>xylene).</b> It has been prepared by The Netherlands {{in the frame of}} Council Regulation (EEC) No. 793 / 93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances, following the principles for assessment of the risks to humans and the environment, laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1488 / 94. In 2005 the environmental risk assessment for <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> concluded that there was a need for further information and/or testing because the substance {{is considered to be a}} PBT candidate chemical and a further PBT ¿ testing strategy was proposed. Conclusion regarding persistency: the extractable part of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> in sediment is subject to anaerobic degradation with half-lives of equal to or below 60 days. <b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is therefore considered to be not persistent in sediment. In this assessment the observed irreversible binding to sediment is considered as dissipation. Given the fact that the metabolites in the ocean die-away test stayed in the water phase while the parent compound <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> volatilized and the fact that the ratio metabolites : parent compound was still close to one after 159 days, it is concluded that the half-life for biodegradation in seawater is more than 150 days, which significantly exceeds the criterion of 60 days. <b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is therefore considered to be very persistent in water. Conclusion regarding bioaccumulation: The experimental bioaccumulation studies for <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> in fish showed a wide range of BCFs, among which values above the vB criterion of 5, 000 l/kg. Based on the evaluation of the critical study and its results it can be concluded that <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is very bioaccumulative. Conclusion regarding toxicity: there is no substantiated evidence that <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> can cause endocrine disrupting effects. However, <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is classified as Carcinogenic Category 3), although it is realised that it is a borderline case. The overall conclusion for <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is that regarding toxicity it is considered to be a borderline case. However, in view of the vPvB properties of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene,</b> no additional testing is required. It is concluded in the Addendum that <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> is a very persistent and very bioaccumulative substance and is considered to be borderline T.

40|$|We {{measured}} two nitro musk fragrances (<b>musk</b> <b>xylene)</b> and musk ketone) {{and five}} polycyclic musk fragrances (galaxolide [HHCB], tonalide [AHTN], celestolide [ADBI], traseolide [ATII], and phantolide [AHMI] in human blood samples from 11 cities of China (n= 204). Possible temporal trends in musk concentrations and associations with personal factors, such as gender, age, and others, were studied. Galaxolide (HHCB) showed the highest median concentration (0. 85 ng/g) followed by AHTN (0. 53 ng/g) with high detection frequency (91 and 77 %, respectively). Concentrations {{of the other}} synthetic musk fragrances, including musk ketone and <b>musk</b> <b>xylene,</b> were all below the quantification limits.

A competitive substrate transport test with rhodamine B was used to assay modulation of transport activity by musks. All tested musks inhibited the transport activity in the low lm range as indicated by increased accumulation of rhodamine B in the tissue. Compared to known substrates of mxr transporters, the effective concentration range was similar to quinidine and about 100 times higher than verapamil. Musk ketone and <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> also inhibited efflux of rhodamine B from gill tissue which was loaded with the dye and subsequently incubated with these compounds.

40|$|Synthetic musk {{compounds}} {{are used}} as additives in many consumer products, including perfumes, deodorants, and detergents. Earlier studies have reported the occurrence of synthetic musks in environmental and wildlife samples collected in the United States. In this study, human breast milk samples collected from Massachusetts, were analyzed for the determination of concentrations of synthetic musks such as <b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> (1 -tert-butyl- 3, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene), musk ketone (4 -tert-butyl- 2, 6 -dimethyl- 3, 5 -dinitroacetophenone), HHCB (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -hexahydro- 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8 -hexamethylcyclopenta[gamma]- 2 -benzopyran), AHTN (7 -acetyl- 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6 -hexamethyl- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene), and HHCB-lactone, the oxidation product of HHCB. In addition, we estimated the daily intake of synthetic musks by infants based on the ingestion rate of breast milk. Synthetic musks were found {{in most of the}} samples analyzed, and the concentrations ranged from 3 ̆c 2 to 150 ng musk xylene/g, 3 ̆c 2 to 238 ng musk ketone/ g, 3 ̆c 5 to 917 ng HHCB/g, 3 ̆c 5 to 144 ng AHTN/g, and 3 ̆c 10 to 88. 0 ng HHCB-lactone/g, on a lipid weight basis. The concentrations of HHCB were higher than the concentrations of other synthetic musks in breast milk samples. The mean concentration of HHCB (220 ng/g, lipid weight) was 5 times greater than the concentrations reported 10 years ago for breast milk samples collected in Germany and Denmark. Maternal age was not correlated with the concentrations of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene,</b> musk ketone, HHCB, or AHTN. There was a trend of decreasing concentrations of <b>musk</b> <b>xylene,</b> musk ketone, HHCB, and AHTN, with the number of children previously breast-fed, although the correlation was not significant. Based on average daily ingestion rate of breast milk, an infant is estimated to ingest 297 +/- 229 ng <b>musk</b> <b>xylene,</b> 780 +/- 805 ng musk ketone, 1830 +/- 1170 ng HHCB, 565 +/- 614 ng AHTN, and 649 +/- 598 ng HHCB-lactone per day. The ingestion rate of synthetic musks by infants in the United States is lower than that estimated for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Based on the residue patterns and accumulation features, it can be concluded that the exposure characteristics for synthetic musks are different from those of POPs, and that the major source of exposure to synthetic musks is probably via dermal absorption or inhalation...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic musks are {{perfuming}} agents {{which are}} widely used in consumer products such as personal care items and household cleaners.

40|$|International audienceA new {{analytical}} method for the simultaneous determination of eight synthetic musks compounds (SMs) including five polycyclic musks (PCMs) and three nitro musks (NMs) was validated for sediment samples {{based on a}} simple QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) sample preparation procedure followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Good analytical performances were obtained for all the target compounds. For the validation of the method, internal calibration (IC) and internal calibration with QuEChERS (ICQ) were compared. Good linearity was obtained for both calibration methods with determination coefficients (R 2) ranging between 0. 990 for <b>Musk</b> <b>Xylene</b> (MX) and 0. 999 for Tonalide (AHTN) with IC and between 0. 991 for Musk Ketone (MK) and 0. 999 for Traseolide (ATII) with ICQ. The repeatability ranges were 0. 1 %– 1. 9 % with the IC and 0. 1 %– 2. 6 % with the ICQ. The apparent recoveries obtained for SMs in the standard reference sediment (SRM 1944) varied {{in the range of}} 70 %– 98 % and 75 %– 103 % in the sediment from the Bizerte Lagoon (Tunisia). The absolute recoveries ranged between 61 % and 92 % for the SRM 1944 and between 61 % and 89 % in the sediment from the Bizerte Lagoon. The limits of detection (LOD) calculated for the two main compounds, Galaxolide (HHCB) and Tonalide (AHTN) were 0. 3 and 0. 1  ng g− 1 respectively.

40|$|Nitroaromatic musks, {{including}} {{musk ketone}} (MK; 2, 6 -dimethyl- 3, 5 -dinitro- 4 -f-butylacetophenone), are chemicals used as perfume ingredients in household products, cosmetics, and toiletries. <b>Musk</b> <b>xylene</b> (MX; l, 3, 5 -trinitro- 2 -r-butylxylene), another nitromusk, is not genotoxic {{but has been}} reported to produce mouse liver tumors in a chronic bioassay.

40|$|Natural musk (muscone) is {{a highly}} prized natural product for use in {{expensive}} consumer fragrances. Inexpensive synthetic substitutes have been commercialized over the last 40 years. Two main chemical classes are used commercially — the nitro musks (which fulfilled the original demand for inexpensive fragrance additives for personal care products such as bath soap, body lotions, perfumes, and washing detergents) and the newer polycyclic musks which have musklike smell. The commercial nitro musks include musk ketone, musk moskene, musk ambrette, <b>musk</b> <b>xylene,</b> and musk tibetene. The polycyclics include trade named compounds such as Galaxolide®, Tonalide®, Celestolide®, Traseolide®, Phantolide®, and Cashmeran®, among others. These consumer chemicals are manufactured and consumed in very large quantities worldwide. They are volatile, not amenable to normal environmental transformations, and lipophilic-all traits that should ordinarily lead to their being characterized as persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic chemicals (PBTs). 16 Their use leads to their entry into the city sewage systems (presumably from bathing and other washing activities), {{and then into the}} aquatic ecosystem, where they can bioconcentrate and bioaccumulate in the tissues of aquatic organisms.

40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{developing}} {{a method for}} the determination of 9 synthetic musk compounds in seafood products by combining the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method and determination by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS). Method detection limits (MDL) ranging between 0. 001 and 1. 94 ng g- 1 were obtained. The linearity is higher than 0. 9899 in the range MDL - 100 ng g- 1 with precision below 18 % and recoveries between 46 % and 120 % were obtained. The method was applied to quantify musk compounds in seafood products from the European southwest coast (oysters, mussels, salmon organs, glass eels). Galaxolide and Tonalide exhibited the highest concentration levels ranging between MDL - 96. 4 ng g- 1 and MDL - 6. 85 ng g- 1, respectively. Contamination levels observed for the two nitro musks (<b>musk</b> <b>xylene</b> and musk ketone) are significantly lower ranging between MDL - 0. 6 ng g- 1 and MDL - 0. 09 ng g- 1, respectively. Analysis of different organs of salmons showed higher concentrations in liver and gonad than in muscle tissues. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
3000|$|... ‘Parfum’ in the {{ingredient}} list stands {{for up to}} several hundred fragrance ingredients which are not disclosed to the consumer and often not even to the down-stream users in the supply chain. Especially some of the chemically synthetized pure constituents proved to be of toxicological and ecotoxicological relevance. Some are known sensitizers for allergic contact dermatitis [33 – 35]. Nitro- and polycyclic musk compounds have been studied with great attention since they were detected in considerable concentrations in the environment [24, 36, 37]. <b>Musk</b> <b>xylene,</b> known for its estrogenic potential, is now a substance of very high concern (SVHC) according to REACH [20] and included in the authorization list. In 2015, also the fragrance Karanal (5 -sec-butyl- 2 -(2, 4 -dimethylcyclohex- 3 -en- 1 -yl)- 5 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxane, EC 413 - 720 - 9) has been suggested for the candidate list of SVHCs ([URL] Karanal is used in perfumes, is very persistent and has a high potential for bioaccumulation. SVHCs must be authorized before they are placed on the market or used, unless they are used in cosmetic products ([20] Art. 56 (5)). With this exception for cosmetic products, it must be assumed, that the authorization will only affect other uses, but not perfume.|$|E
