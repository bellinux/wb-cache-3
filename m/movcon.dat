50|$|In 2001, the Rapid Response units {{numbered}} around 5,000 {{soldiers of}} the total of 42,000. As of 2014, {{the majority of the}} force, 17,000 out of 22,000 soldiers will be in Rapid Response units. The decrease in number of troops comes with an equal increase in quality and modern equipment. These units are motorized and are ready to be mobilized more often, than other Home Guard units. Rapid response units have more combat tasks compared {{to the rest of the}} Home Guard, including escort duties. Some battalions located near the coast also have marine companies equipped with Combat Boat 90. A few battalions have recently set up 'specialized' companies to evaluate the possibility to add new abilities to the Home Guard. These are at the time of writing eight reconnaissance/intelligence companies, four CBRN-platoons, a <b>movcon</b> platoon, an engineer platoon, and a military police unit.|$|E
