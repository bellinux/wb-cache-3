40|$|In this work, nanocomposites were {{prepared}} {{by adding a}} small amount of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to an epoxy resin aiming to study the resulting mechanical, viscoelastic and thermal properties of the nanocomposites. To optimize the processing of the nanocomposites and to favor a homogeneous dispersion of the SWCNTs on the matrix, acetone was used to reduce resin viscosity, increasing diffusion of the SWCNTs in the solution. The epoxy/SWCNTs/acetone systems were also sonicated in order to minimize entanglement of the SWCNTs. The systems were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis.

The paper presents the results of research during which the high-vanadium cast iron was subjected to spheroidisation treatmentwith magnesium Elmag 5800 master alloy. The purpose of this operation was to obtain the VC carbides of a spheroidal shape. The studyalso included metallographic examinations and testing of mechanical properties carried out on high-vanadium cast iron of a eutecticcomposition in as-cast condition and after the spheroidising treatment. The attempt to spheroidise the vanadium carbides has proved to be quite successful. The introduction of magnesium alloy has made nearly one half of the crystallised vanadium carbides acquire a spheroidal shape. The, obtained in this way, high-vanadium cast iron with vanadium carbides of a spheroidal shape showed very high mechanical andplastic properties. The tensile strength Rm increased by 60 % compared to the as-cast alloy, while ductility increased more than twenty times.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Kefiran (Kef) is a {{water-soluble}} polysaccharide {{that can}} form transparent film; however, it is brittle. Therefore, {{in order to}} improve the mechanical properties of kefiran film, a mixture with other polymers can be offered. The expansion of mixed systems can propose kefiran and polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) as a new composite film. Materials and Methods: Solutions of 20 gram per liter kef and 40 gram per liter of PVOH were prepared. A mixture of film-forming solutions of different ratios of Kef/PVOH (100 / 0, 68 / 32, 50 / 50, 32 / 68) was prepared. In this study, different experiments including the physical properties (thickness, moisture content, and film solubility in water), water vapor permeability, and mechanical properties (tensile strength, elongation at break, puncture strength, and puncture deformation) of composite films as well as the rheological properties of film forming solutions were investigated. Results: The results of physical properties such as thickness, moisture content, solubility in water and mechanical properties such as tensile strength, elongation at break, puncture deformation, puncture strength and water vapor permeability indicated that the mechanical properties, thickness and solubility in water increase with increase in PVOH content; however, moisture content and water vapor permeability decrease. Rheological characterization of different film forming solutions exhibited Newtonian fluid behavior. Conclusions: These results contribute to the establishment of an approach to optimize films’ composition based on the interactions between polymers, aiming at improving the properties of polysaccharide-based films.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the infiltration of two porous structures. In the first, two different silicon sources were used to infiltrate structures derived from different Canadian pine, beech and maple species {{for the production of}} silicon carbide (SiC). This allows the use of a precursor structure that is already available, thus saving time, energy and cost of manufacturing. Carbonized wood species measuring 15 mm x 11 mm x 13 mm were used as precursors for the production of silicon carbide (SiC) using two silicon sources (sol and powder) in order to produce a porous SiC structure mimicking that of wood. The liquid sol was vacuum infiltrated into the pyrolyzed wood species, dried and reacted at 1575 °C under a 70 L/h flow of argon. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed SiC grains formed on the interior of the tracheid walls and a high density of SiC whiskers were discovered in certain tracheids of pine and vessels of beech and maple. Both cyclic and repeated infiltration processes were undertaken. In addition, infiltration of carbonized pine wood with molten silicon was carried out in order to obtain a porous SiC structure. Infiltration was based on capillary forces within the preform and the infiltration depth was measured. Optical microscope, SEM, EDS and XRD were used for microstructure characterization and phase identification. In the second part of this work, a liquid A 356 aluminum alloy was infiltrated into a porous silicon carbide foam structure. Three dimensional silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic foams were employed as reinforcement for producing an aluminum alloy metal matrix composite with potential as a base plate material in electronic packaging. These are commonly manufactured with aluminum/silicon carbide (Al/SiC) particulate materials, nickel-iron and copper alloys. A base plate provides mechanical strength to the integrated circuit design, as well as aids in transfering the heat from the chip to the heat sink. Packaging base plate materials are required to have low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), high thermal conductivity, and low density. A 356 aluminum alloy was vacuum infiltrated into a 100 PPI (pores per inch), silicon carbide (SiC) foam network, at 775 °C using an in-house built apparatus. It has been shown that this metal matrix composite has similar properties to traditional packaging materials with the added benefit of a lower density. CTE and thermal conductivity are within the range of commercially available materials, with porosity levels of 7 %, using this method. Flexural strength and Young's modulus of the composite provide reasonable values {{as a result of the}} low reinforcement concentration employed. Secondary Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the fractured surfaces of the Charpy, flexural strength and compression tests. In the Charpy and flexural strength samples, the A 356 aluminum-silicon alloy matrix shows signs of mixed fracture; cleavage regions and some dimpling. In the network structure, the majority of the failure is from SiC layers debonding from the aluminum matrix with some SiC layer peeling (inter-delamination). Compressive loading showed internal damage in the form of failed SiC struts. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis did not detect any brittle aluminum carbide at the Al/SiC interface.
