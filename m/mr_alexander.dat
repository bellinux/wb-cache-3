25|$|Commander Alexander McVicar (or M'Vicar) was {{appointed}} to Apelles on 8 March, and recommissioned her that month for the North Sea. McVicar tested a new patent compass in July and wrote a testimonial letter on 13 June. Vice-Admiral Robert Otway had ordered him to test the compass belonging to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Alexander,</b> of Leith, and McVicar used it for some nine weeks, finding it {{better than the other}} compasses on Apelles. It was quick to come on point and held its direction in heavy seas and despite shocks such as guns firing or seas striking.|$|E
25|$|The first {{official}} BMX sanctioning body was the National Bicycle Association (NBA) started by Ernie Alexander in 1972. Like Scot Breithaupt, he had motorcycle motocross in his background, and like Scot {{he was a}} promoter but a professional one with his American Cycle Enterprises (ACE). He was also a former Hollywood stunt man who promoted races at the famous Indian Dunes, built and managed by Walt James, where many movies and TV shows were filmed. In 1970 he noticed {{a group of kids}} trying to organize a bicycle race with their Schwinn Sting-Rays. Being familiar with motorcycle racing, he lent the kids a hand. He later opened the Yarnell track, a steep downhill course every bit as treacherous by today's standards as Scot Breithaupt's BUMS track—if not more so. In 1972 he created the National Bicycle Association, modeled on the existing American Motorcycle Association (AMA). It was <b>Mr.</b> <b>Alexander</b> who built a truly nation-spanning professional sanctioning body for BMX.|$|E
500|$|The {{contract}} for the Grand Trunk Railway included all the materials required for building the bridge and the railway, including the rolling stock.

The works was managed by George Harrison with a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Alexander</b> and William Heap as assistants. The machine shop was [...] in length and included a blacksmiths' shop with 40 furnaces, anvils and steam hammers, a coppersmiths' shop, and fabrication, woodwork and pattern shops. There was also a well-stocked library and a reading room for all the workforce.|$|E

[...] "There are a lot of schools that offer it as a choice to students, but I think it should be a part of regular American history".|$|E

2500|$|As the {{property}} {{was the only one}} he owned, up until 2006, HM Revenue and Customs rules meant that capital gains tax was not payable as should someone find a buyer for their home within three years {{the property}} qualifies for relief from [...] as long as the property has been the only or main home at some point.

2500|$|Two {{days after}} being {{appointed}} {{to his new}} position, the Daily Telegraph newspaper published front-page allegations that Alexander had exploited a legal loophole to avoid the payment of capital gains tax on a property he had sold in 2007 alleging that he had profited from a [...] "morally dubious" [...] loophole to avoid paying capital gains tax. A few days earlier, the same newspaper had caused the resignation of Alexander's predecessor David Laws after finding irregularities in his expenses claims. The paper suggested that [...] "the fact that <b>Mr</b> <b>Alexander</b> has become the second Lib Dem to face questions about his finances within three days has focused attention on whether the party leadership has properly audited the financial activities of its senior figures".|$|E

2500|$|... "Mr. Alexander Muirhead Aitken was {{admitted}} {{as a special}} law agent in Singapore in 1852, and was called to the English Bar at the Middle Temple in 1864.

As has been said, he acted as Registrar of the Court for a short while in 1856; and in 1870 he acted for a month or two as Attorney-General. Otherwise he practised privately, in 1861 with Mr. Abraham Logan, leaving him the next year, and from 1871 to 1873 with Mr. Bernard Rodyk.
