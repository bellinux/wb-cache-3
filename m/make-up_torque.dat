40|$|Threaded and coupled {{connections}} generally {{present a}} non-uniform stress distribution, which {{is related to}} the higher stiffness of the box when compared to the pin. The non-uniform stress distribution can contribute to fatigue cracks and other failure modes in high pressure oil wells. An API 5 CT P 110 steel obtained from a seamless pipe was mechanically characterized. FEA models were carried out to investigate and compare two API casing connections under <b>make-up</b> <b>torque</b> and tensile efforts. A parametric study was performed using numerical models to determine the influence of some geometric features on the behavior of the API Buttress threaded connection. The API Buttress connection supported higher tensile loads than the API Short Round, however both standard connections showed high stress concentration in the last engaged thread and a non-uniform stress distribution. The manufacturing of grooves at the first and the last engaged threads proved to be an efficient way to reduce the stress concentration of Buttress casing connection and could be an alternative to the development of new products...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringIn {{this thesis}} work, a {{simulation}} and monitoring study was carried based on operational {{data obtained from}} two wells. These are South Sangu- 4 and Sangu- 11, which are situated in block 16. From the study it was found out that: Comparing the simulation data and real time data, the tripping in and tripping out coefficient of friction were back calculated. The coefficient of frictions derived from Sangu- 4 were used for planning of drilling in Sangu- 11. Calculating the Friction factor ratio on South Sangu- 4, it shows an indication of Pack off around 3000 m (MD) to 3500 m (MD). And eventually the well (South sangu 4) took a kick at the depth of 3486 m (MD). No real time Torque and Drag monitoring was done there. Getting {{the idea of the}} FF of that block 16, a simulation of drill string stresses, Hook Load and Torque was carried out based on the planned survey data. From the study, {{it was found that the}} Torque at higher Friction Factor will cross the limit of <b>make-up</b> <b>torque</b> which may cause the failure of the drill string. Based on the simulation the real time Hook Load and Torque data were monitored. The monitoring results investigated indication of higher Torque in real time for which Lubricant was added in the mud to reduce the Torque in safe limit. One most important observation in 8. 5 ’’ section was that the non-rotating protectors were not effectively reducing the Torque. Rather the use of lubricant controls the Torque in desired limi...|$|E
40|$|When {{assembling}} tubing strings in the oilfields, threaded {{connections are}} used to connect the pipes with each other. The possibility to reuse these connections is often required and {{a certain degree of}} leak tightness is required, even without the use of a sealing surface or shoulder. For this reason, the total plasticity within the connection should be limited and relative movement between pin and box ought to be restricted. Within this publication, a finite elements analysis is conducted using a 4. 5 inch buttress threaded connection as defined in API 5 B together with a connection using the enhanced SR 23 buttress thread. In addition, an experimental validation of the make-up stage is conducted by comparing the strains generated during make-up using Digital Image Correlation and infrared monitoring. In order to determine the optimal make-up, values found in literature are compared with a developed method using the magnitude and size of the plastically deformed zones during make-up. In addition, the effect of external axial and pressure loading is examined to identify the effects and critical areas. As a result, it is observed that pressure loading and make-up tend to have similar effects and {{in order to determine the}} optimal <b>make-up</b> <b>torque,</b> the pressure ratings of the assembly should be taken into account to prevent overtorqueing the connection. For the case of axial loading, a critical zone is visible near the last engaged thread and excessive loading of this thread can cause premature failure within this zone. Overall, the SR 23 connection shows limited, yet visible, advantages over the standard BTC connection as described in literature...|$|E
40|$|Threaded {{connections}} are responsible assemblies, defining sucker rod string reliability. Despite {{the variety of}} their design, industrial materials analysis shows that breakages occur in rod body and threaded connections. In the process of lowering and lifting operations, aimed at well pump replacement, screwing and unscrewing of sucker rods threaded joints is repeated, so pin threads and couplings are worn. After analyzing the method of pin threads wear determining while screwing, unscrewing, connection and breakout sucker rods tightening, proposed by S. A. Babayan, {{it has been found}} out that the amount of thread wear during the makeup is 20 30 times greater than thread wear while fastening. According to this method the last three threads are practically unworn and deterioration of the first coil is 10 - 12 times greater than the wear of the last turns. The results of calculation correspond with the wear data in the course of sucker rods operation in an industrial environment. To identify and compare the distribution of stresses in the sucker rods threaded connections using the developed computer ANSYS, finite element axisymmetric models of new and worn standard threaded connections with a diameter of 19 mm have been created. Screw connections were loaded by axial force and <b>torque</b> <b>make-up.</b> Having analyzed the simulation results we have made a conclusion that with the increase of sucker rod wear, stress distribution in pin thread becomes uniform, respectively, it has positive effect on the threaded connection durability under cyclic dynamic loads. With further deterioration, thread tensions are rising in the middle turns, and in extreme turns - are reduced, so the impact of further deterioration on the connection durability is negative. Also it have been found that at the limit thread wear maximum stresses are concentrated in the thread coupling, resulting in the fracture of its body...|$|R
40|$|Threaded {{connections}} {{as found}} in applications like rigid riser, drillstrings, and workover riser are manufactured with sharp notches. Subjected to cyclic loading, those notches lead to high stress concentrations, which {{increase the risk of}} fatigue crack initiation significantly. A common connection type that has been the basis for extensive studies is the API Line Pipe connection. The basic API thread type consists of truncated triangular threads. In order to tighten the connection the male and female part or pin and box are assembled by applying a <b>make-up</b> <b>torque.</b> This process already leads to stress in the connection that exceed the material yield strength at the roots of the threads. Subjected to cyclic loading a complex stress state arises at the thread roots of both parts of the connection. From screwed connections it is known that approximately half of the axial load is carried by the last engaged thread. Consequently, fatigue cracks develop at this location. Fatigue assessment of threaded riser connections (TRC) is commonly based on a peak stress approach. This is the prescribed method in standards and recommended practices like DNV-RP-C 203, BS 7608 or ASME B 31. 3. For this purpose, the peak stress {{at the root of the}} last engaged thread is found by finite element analysis (FEA). Subsequently, a given design curve is corrected for the notch effect of the thread root and the fatigue life of a connection can be calculated by means of linear damage accumulation. It was shown in different research projects that fatigue assessment of TRC based on this method leads to overly conservative lifetime estimates when combining design curves with FEA. In order to achieve more precise lifetime estimates, alternative fracture mechanics methods based on ASME BPVC VIII- 3 -App. D have been applied. The intention was to establish stress-life diagrams for design purposes of threaded riser connections based on alternative methods. Moreover, comparison of the chosen approach and test results was included to review the obtained results. It was found that the chosen fracture mechanics methods yield unconservative results, when compared with test data, common stress - life design curves and other methods based on the peak stress approach. </p...|$|E
40|$|Threaded pipe {{connections}} used in on-shore and off-shore applications are often subjected to cyclic loads. They generally have a conical shape which {{enables them to}} be preloaded {{as a result of}} <b>make-up</b> <b>torque.</b> This ensures that a sealed and secure connection between the different pipes is maintained. The combination of the preload and the additional external loads, together with the thread geometry results in a complex multi-axial stress distribution over the connection. The highest concentration of axial tensile stresses typically appears at the last engaged thread of the male part of the connection. Consequently, this region will be highly susceptible for fatigue crack initiation. The stress distribution over the connection depends on the connection’s geometry, interface and material properties, but the exact influence of those parameters on the fatigue life of the connections is not well documented. In the present study, the influence of geometry changes of the female part of an API Line Pipe connection on the fatigue life of the total connection is investigated. This is done by performing a parametric finite element study, using 2 D axisymmetric models. The preload is modelled by giving an initial overlap to the male and female part of the connection, corresponding to the number of make-up turns specified by the API 5 B standard. This results in a compressive hoop stress in the male part of the connection. Afterwards an additional axial tensile load is applied. The final aim of this numerical study is to reduce the acting axial tensile stress concentrations as much as possible. To validate the finite element results, four-point bending fatigue tests were carried out on threaded pipe samples with a nominal size of 1 ” (load controlled, R = 0. 1). Cracks emanated from the last engaged thread of the male part of the connection, as could be expected from the models. Through thickness cracks were detected by pressurizing the tube-samples. When a crack grows through the wall thickness of a pipe, pressure drops and the test is stopped. The number of elapsed load cycles defines the fatigue life of the connection. This way an S-N curve was obtained for the standard API Line Pipe connection and compared to the results of connections with changed geometries...|$|E
40|$|Threaded pipe {{connections}} {{are commonly used}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry in particular to connect casing strings, drillpipe strings or production and transportation risers and pipelines. In order to maintain a sealed and secure connection while in service, the connections are generally preloaded. To introduce this preload, the connections commonly have tapered threads and they are assembled by applying a certain <b>make-up</b> <b>torque.</b> The combination of the <b>make-up</b> <b>torque</b> and external loads results in a multiaxial stress distribution over the coupling, where the coupling’s threads act as stress raisers. When used in offshore environments, waves and currents cause dynamic loads acting on the pipelines. The {{pipe connections}} remain the weakest points because fatigue cracks can initiate in the connection’s threads. A wide variety of patented threaded pipe connection designs exists, all claiming to improve a connection’s fatigue life. However, experimental data for such designs, available in literature, is limited. Published studies generally comprise experiments on a single connection type. In addition, as no uniformity in testing setup, loading conditions and damage detection techniques exists, results from different studies can not be used for a detailed fatigue analysis to compare the designs. Furthermore, current design curves in codes and standards lead to overly conservative or inaccurate results. The aim of this work is to provide a better understanding of the fatigue mechanisms of threaded pipe connections and to study the effect of different design features on a connection’s fatigue life. Final goal is to formulate guidelines for new fatigue resistant connection designs. In this study, the API Line Pipe connection is used as a reference. Several modifications and design features are applied to this connection type. To simulate the influence of these modifications, a parametric 2 D axisymmetric finite element model, called ThreadGen, is developed. The results of this model are compared with a 3 D finite element simulation to prove its validity for both make-up and bending. In addition the results of the 2 D axisymmetric simulations are validated by static strain gauge measurements during a make-up test, an axial tension test, a bending test and an internal pressure test. The validated model is then used to evaluate the influence of connection properties and design features on the threaded connection’s behaviour. Test rigs are developed to perform fatigue experiments on three scales: the small scale experiments on 1 ” (33. 4 mm outer diameter) connections are performed in four-point bending; the medium scale tests on 4. 5 ” (114. 3 mm) connections are carried out under axial tension and in four-point bending; for full scale testing of specimens in the range of 150 mm to 500 mm in diameter a resonant bending fatigue setup is developed. A significant part of this work is dedicated to this last setup. Two plain pipes without a threaded connection are tested in the setup to characterize its dynamic behaviour and to measure the response of a pipe subjected to a certain excitation frequency. The testing of full scale threaded pipe connections in this setup is part of future research. The majority of the performed fatigue tests comprises small scale experiments. Several modified configurations are tested. For each configuration an S-N curve is constructed, so that the effect of a certain configuration on the connection’s fatigue life can be quantified. It is observed that a local modification of the threaded connection’s geometry as well as the connection’s contact conditions can have an important influence on the fatigue life of the connection. During the medium scale four-point bending tests, advanced measuring techniques are used to monitor the fatigue crack growth during the test. Although these are existing techniques, they are applied to crack sizing in threaded connections for the first time. A dynamic 3 D optical displacement measurement system is used to detect changes in the bending deflection shape of the pipe as a result of a propagating crack. Besides, a local crack opening measurement is carried out and modal analysis techniques are applied to monitor changes of the pipe’s eigenfrequencies. To visualize the crack fronts at different moments during the tests, a beach marking technique is used so that the exact crack shapes can be seen during post-mortem analysis. It is shown that a crack initiates at the root of the last engaged thread of the male part of the connection, and propagates gradually over a large segment of the circumference, forming a long shallow crack. When the crack penetrates the pipe wall, it rapidly increases in size along two crack fronts. The observed crack shapes do not have a semi-elliptical shape as commonly used in fracture mechanics. A fatigue crack growth analysis that considers the crack as an annular flaw, is effective in describing the crack growth behaviour. The results from the finite element simulations and the experimentally obtained S-N curves are combined in a multiaxial damage evolution law. Using this fatigue analysis, the observed trends in the fatigue lives of the configurations are explained. The general concept of using a connection’s thread load distribution as a measure for its fatigue life is proven to be inaccurate. The main reason for this is that the load distribution is related to the axial stresses over the connection. However, the fatigue life of a threaded connection is determined by the local multiaxial stress distribution and strain range around the root of the last engaged thread. These local conditions are not only the result of the load distribution, but they are also affected by the hoop stress introduced during make-up, which can additionally be affected by a changed connection stiffness. In addition, the multiaxial damage evolution law is used to analyse the influence of several features on a connection’s fatigue life. Not for all patented modifications an increased fatigue life is predicted when applied to the API Line Pipe connection. It is finally stated that to optimize a fatigue resistant connection, it is appropriate to combine several design features. The thread shape can be optimized to obtain a low stress concentration factor and reduce the local strains at the thread root. The connection global geometry and make-up conditions can be optimized to improve the load distribution over the threads and reduce local stresses and strains at the threads...|$|E
40|$|With {{the notion}} of {{evolving}} current Extended Reach Drilling, this master thesis examines if drilling 20 – 40 km is feasible. Several reservoirs offshore in the area outside of Lofoten {{in the northern part}} of Norway are reachable by 20 – 40 km in horizontal displacement. The term for these excessive lengths is Ultra Extended Reach Drilling (UL–ERD) and is the foundation for this master thesis. To solve this task a "‘Well Path and Drilling Software"’ (WP&D software) is developed to simulate the drilling operation with regard to well path, drilling, running of casing/liner and well service using wire line. Three–dimensional well path design, analysis of loads and stresses experienced, torque and drag calculation and hydraulic calculation used in the software are presented in this master thesis. Attaining UL-ERD demands innovation in all areas of drilling technology. This thesis addresses this by simulating different scenarios in the software, presenting and discussing the results. The well path designed needs least possible dog–legs and azimuthal change to avoid increased frictional forces and contribution from the capstan effect. Drilling with different drill pipe materials like steel, titanium and composite shows the advantage of using lighter materials to reduce torque and drag. The hydraulic requirements to pump down the string is overcome by having 700 bars of working pressure available on mud pumps and the use of large inner diameter of drill pipe. High Equivalent Circulating Densities (ECD) are handled by Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and its Applied Back Pressure (ABP). The flow rate used to maintain a constant annular velocity is valid if hole cleaning is fulfilled throughout the well. Larger inner diameter requires larger outer diameter which leads to excessive ECDs in small holes. Large diameter drilled holes with corresponding casing/linerOD sizes in parenthesis; 36 "(30 "), 26 "(20 "), 17 1 / 2 "(13 3 / 8 "), 17 1 / 2 "(13 3 / 8 " and 12 1 / 4 "(95 / 8 "). Expandable casing is used to have two lengths of 13 3 / 8 " liner intervals giving the ability of using large inner and outer diameter drill pipe. Setting of casing/liner is performed conventionally using casing/liner filled with mud and unconventionally with fully evacuated casing/liner with nitrogen or casing/liner with mud over nitrogen. The snubbing unit is assumed dimensioned to handle 100 tonnes to get casing/liner down. Rotation of the liner is possible when the absolute density is close to the mud weight in the hole, giving a reduced buoyant weight. Different simulation of inner and outer diameter dimension of drill pipe concludes that an 8 "outer diameter and 7 " inner diameter is the best option for UL-ERD in this thesis. This, incombination of a lighter material such as composite, leads to 40882 meters Measured Depth(MD) at 2506 meters True Vertical Depth (TVD), Horizontal Displacement (HD) of 39501 meters and a Step–Out–ratio of 15, 7. It also has a slight azimuthal change in the well path. The mud pumps deliver 700 bars and the proper flow rate to clean the wellbore using MPD. The casing/liner reaches setting depth and it is possible to run composite wire line with welltractor to perform well service, through the production tubing. Torque and drag calculationsare valid for the specified <b>Make-Up</b> <b>Torque</b> (MUT) of approximately 85 kN. The max limit of 100 kN MUT can be handled by using a tapered drill string. 5 7 / 8 " drill pipe with either steel, titanium or composite can be used to drill multiple wells and join them together to achieve one UL–ERD well. Steel drill pipe is be most preferable with regard to availability and cost. Larger tubular with light drill string material is beneficial when it comes to reducing torque and drag and hydraulic issues in these shorter wells. Obtaining UL–ERD wells in this way requires less modification with regard to the drilling process, since lengths drilled are shorter. The disadvantage is that in a somewhat pristine area as Lofoten, the Health Safety Environment (HSE) issues with drilling offshore is a valid obstacle for not choosing this solution here. This thesis recommends that when having solved the issues with torque and drag, hydraulicrequirement and available equipment, reaching UL–ERD can be performed by drilling fromone location on land, or with multiple wells from several locations on and off land joined into one well. An 8 " composite drill pipe with 7 " inner diameter could be used, lightening the casing/liner to get to setting depth and use composite wire line to perform well service. Recommendations are made on the basis of mud pumps delivering sufficient pump pressure,stronger snubbing units, use of expandable casing, torque and drag is being handled, large hole diameters, larger inner and outer diameters of tubular, the use of a tapered drill string,development and innovation of equipment found vital for the task. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} thesis is concerned with analytical, numerical and experimental studies {{of the effect of}} cold rolling on the fatigue behaviour of threaded drillstring connections. A comprehensive literature study is made of the various effects on the fatigue behaviour of residual stresses introduced by mechanical deformation of notched components. Some of the effects studied are cyclic hardening behaviour after prestraining, cyclic creep, fatigue initiation in prestrained materials, short cracks and crack growth models including crack closure. Residual stresses were introduced in the surface of a smooth pipe by a rolling device to simulate a cold rolling process and verify the calculated residual stresses by measurements. Strain hardening and contact algorithm of the two bodies were incorporated in the FE analyses. Two significant errors were found in the commercial software package for residual stress evaluation, Restan v. 3. 3. 2 a also called SINT, when using the Schajer method. The Schajer algorithm is the only hole-drilling algorithm without theoretical shortcomings, and is recommended when measuring large residual stress gradients in the depth directions. Using the Schajer method solved by in-house Matlab-routines good agreement between measured residual stress gradients and residual stress gradients from FE analyses was found. Full scale fatigue tests were performed on pipes cut used drillstrings with notches of similar geometry as threads used in drillstring connections. The simulated threads consisted of four full depth helix notches with runouts at the surface. The pipe threads were cold rolled and fatigue tested in a full-scale four-point rotating bending fatigue testing rig. The test results showed that cold rolling had an effect on the crack initiating period. A major part of the fatigue life was with cracks observed at the notch root, but due to the increased fatigue crack propagation resistance the final fracture initiated at pits inside the pipe. Therefor, an optimisation of the roll geometry and rolling parameters was not possible. However, a significant fatigue life improvement was achieved. Based on experiments, a roller with similar profile as the thread root is recommended. A rolling force of maximum 20 KN is recommended to minimise the possibility of damaging the thread profile. Shallow cracks were observed typically when 5 % of the fatigue life had expired. Re-rolling after 50 % of expected improved fatigue life, when also short cracks were observed in the notch roots further increased the fatigue improvements. Pretensioned small steel specimens with a notch were used to simulate cold rolled threats. The specimens were fatigue tested in tension with minimum load close to zero. Pretensioning increased the fatigue life form approximately 50 000 cycles to an infinite number of cycles. In these test non-propagating cracks of typically 0. 4 mm length were found. The benefit from pretensioning gradually disappeared with increasing mean stress. FE analyses indicated that an almost instant relaxation of residual stresses to a level with no monotonic strain hardening from preloading would take place when cycled to moderate mean stress. Cycled at low mean stress, an instant relaxation of the surface layer was found in analysis. All observations from notched pretensioned fatigue specimens were in good agreement with the available literature. However, preloading was found to be strain rate dependent in tests where a pretension load held for 2 minutes gave a longer fatigue life than a sinusoidal loading-unloading cycle performed over a one minute interval. Strain hardening was found not contributing to the fatigue life improvement, whereas the polishing effect from improved surface quality after cold rolling increased the fatigue initiation period. However, residual stress and subsequent early crack closure was the dominating effect at moderate cyclic mean loads. The material data required to perform FE fatigue simulation studies of a full threaded cold rolled coupling incorporating <b>make-up</b> <b>torque,</b> include cyclic stress strain behaviour at various amplitudes and mean stress caused by various degrees of prestraining. Such data are not readily available today, and are only possible to obtain in carefully planned and executed experiments. Also, 3 D FE model required for cold rolling analysis is extremely CPU time consuming. Consequently, cold rolling simulations could not be successfully implemented in this work. One of the main conclusions from this work is that drillstring connections will respond differently to thread rolling at the pin or box. A significant improvement in the fatigue life of box threads from residual stresses is expected mainly from increased resistance to crack propagation. However, the compressive residual stress is sensitive to overloading in compression, and the improvement from residual stress depends strongly on the mean stress (or R-ratio). At values of R of approximately 0. 6 or higher the beneficial of rolling therefore tends to disappear. At the critical locations of the pin, which are the last engaged thread or the stress relief groove, the effect of residual stresses introduced by rolling is therefore likely to be severely reduced by the high mean stress imposed during make-up of the connection. However, a beneficial effect of rolling is expected to remain due to improved surface condition and due to a possible effect of strain hardening. The net results of these factors on the fatigue performance of actual drillstrings can only be determined in full scale rotating bending tests. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
