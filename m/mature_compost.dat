Experimental in-vessel biowaste composts were used to study the survival of seeded Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. Four organic waste mixtures, containing various proportions of paper and cardboard, fruits and vegetables, and green waste, were composted in laboratory reactors with forced aeration.

The survival of bacteria over a 3 -month period at 25 °C was assessed with samples collected after different experimental composting times.

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of nanoparticles (NPs) has started receiving increased attention because of the knowledge gaps regarding their fate in {{the environment and the}} possible impact on the environment and human health. The production of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 -NPs) is increasing and it is expected that, due to their great number of applications, their concentration in waste streams will increase in the future. The presence of NPs in waste streams may affect the treatment process (e. g., composting) and, if they are not successfully removed from the waste streams, their presence in the treated waste (e. g., compost) may present an environmental risk. Composting of the biodegradable fractions of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a widely used waste management practice, mainly because it is a cost-effective treatment technology and the final product (i. e., compost) presents several benefits to the environment, particularly as a soil conditioner. The overall aim of this thesis is to assess the effect of Ag-TiO 2 NPs and AgNPs that may be present in the biodegradable fractions of municipal solid waste on composting and subsequent soil application of compost. For that purpose in-vessel composting of artificial municipal solid waste contaminated with commercial nanoparticles was investigated at laboratory scale, simulating a range of relevant concentration levels. Subsequently, the fate of NPs present in <b>mature</b> <b>compost</b> use as a top-layer soil conditioner was investigated using a column approach at laboratory scale. The toxicity effect of NPs present <b>mature</b> <b>compost</b> on plant growth was further investigated. The impact of NPs during composting was assessed by monitoring the temporal dynamics of organic matter (OM) using Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. The fate of NPs following application of contaminated <b>mature</b> <b>compost</b> as a top-soil conditioner and potential release to groundwater was investigated using a column leaching experiment while the phytotoxicity of <b>mature</b> <b>compost</b> contaminated with NPs was assessed using a seed germination bioassay.

However, few attempts have assessed the adequacy of compost quality considering the level of ecosystem recovery after frequent wildfires in combination with droughts. We investigated the suitability of the addition of 3 ages of compost (i. e. 3 weeks, 3 months and 9 months) crossing with 3 times since fire (i. e. 1, 5 and 18 years of recovery) to increase the soil organic and inorganic resources in frequently burned soils. We hypothesised that resource depending on quality (i. e. maturity) should improve microbial activity and its resistance and resilience against a drastic drought and could have some implication for SOM mineralisation. Our {{results showed that the}} more <b>mature</b> <b>compost,</b> richer in organic matter, increases TOC, total N, concentrations and pH but regardless the time since fire. Microbial activity weakly responded to this soil resource improvement whereas it was strongly depressed 5 years after the last fire. <b>Mature</b> <b>compost</b> resulted in a loss of resistance and resilience of the microbial activity in comparison with control soils depending on the time since fire, indicating that exogenous resource as compost affects microbial stability. The cumulative C-mineralisation clearly indicated that the loss of microbial activity and stability against drought with the more <b>mature</b> <b>compost</b> would result in an improvement of soil C-accumulation especially 5 years after the last fire.

Meanwhile, a growth test in pots with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was carried out using the selected soil and equal amounts of the composting mixture taken at different maturation steps, in order to evaluate the additions of these organic amendments in terms of fertilising value. Samples of the composting mixture, when poorly transformed through the biostabilisation process, showed high CO 2 -C releases in the soil, due to the microbial attack on easily degradable organic fractions still present in the mixture, with 24. 7 % mineralisation of the initial total organic carbon (TOC) after a 70 day incubation. On the other hand, <b>mature</b> <b>compost</b> was the most stable matrix, with only 5. 4 % of TOC mineralised after 70 days.

The effect of repeated applications of three urban composts on the nitrogen (N) dynamics in a cropped loamy soil was compared to farmyard manure application and a control receiving no amendment. Each amendment application brought on average 250 - 400 kg ha− 1 of total N. After five applications, total organic N increased in amended soils from 9 to 27 % compared to control and the increase of soil organic N corresponded to 32 - 79 % of total N brought by the amendments. The PASTIS model was used to describe the N balance in the soil-plant system during the 2 years after a sixth amendment application and provided correct predictions of N dynamics in cropped plots. The N availability increased in all treatments receiving organic amendments. The N availability in the soils amended with urban composts or manure was predominantly driven by the biodegradability of the organic amendments, their mineral N content and by the cropping conditions. Composts with high biodegradability exhibited higher proportion of N recovery by plants (21 % for the municipal solid waste compost) during the year following their application, while more stabilised composts (biowaste compost, co-compost of sludge and green wastes) increased the N availability mainly through the increase of soil organic N content and mineralisation after several compost applications (6 - 8 % of the soil organic N increase). <b>Mature</b> <b>composts</b> behaved comparably to FYM, except that for FYM very little N from the last application was available. Regular compost applications equivalent to 200 kg N ha− 1 every other year could increase N availability for crops of 50 - 70 kg N ha− 1 over the 2 years of the crop rotation.
