50|$|Mohair is a {{very soft}} yarn when {{compared}} with other natural and synthetic fibers. Due to mohair lacking prominent, protruding scales along the hair's surface, it is often blended with wool or alpaca. Blending the heavily scaled wool helps the smooth mohair fibers hold their shape and stick together when spun into <b>yarn.</b> <b>Mohair</b> is also valued for certain other unique characteristics: it is warmer than other fibers, even when {{used to make a}} light-weight garment, and is often blended with wool for this reason; and mohair fibers have a distinctive luster created by the way they reflect light. Combined with mohair's ability to absorb dyes exceptionally well, pure <b>mohair</b> <b>yarns</b> are usually recognizable for their vivid saturated colours.|$|R
5000|$|The yarn {{affects the}} bulk and drape of the knitted fabric, {{as well as}} the {{visibility}} of stitches. Complicated stitch patterns are best seen with a smooth, highly spun yarn and may be invisible with [...] "furry" [...] <b>yarns</b> such as <b>mohair</b> or novelty <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the pile}} of plush {{consisted}} of <b>mohair</b> or worsted <b>yarn,</b> but now silk by itself or with a cotton backing is used for plush, the distinction from velvet being found in the longer and less dense pile of plush. The soft material is largely used for upholstery and furniture purposes, and is also much employed in dress and millinery.|$|R
25|$|To make various yarns, besides adding novelty elements, spinners {{can vary}} {{all the same}} things as in a {{machined}} yarn, i.e., the fibre, the preparation, the colour, the spinning technique, {{the direction of the}} twist, etc. A common misconception is yarn spun from rolags may not be as strong, but the strength of a yarn is actually based on the length of hair fibre and the degree of twist. When working with shorter hairs, such as llama or angora rabbit, the spinner may choose to integrate longer fibres, such as <b>mohair,</b> to prevent <b>yarn</b> breakage. Yarns made of shorter fibres are also given more twist than yarns of longer fibres, and are generally spun with the short draw technique.|$|R
40|$|The Angora goat is an {{important}} goat breed which is specifically raised in Ankara and its surroundings. Mohair, a kind of fiber obtained from the Angora goat, has {{an important}} place in the textile industry, due to its length, strength, and brightness. Consumption patterns change every year according to current fashions. Mohair, which is the primary raw material for weaving and knitting, is also a {{source of income for}} people living in rural areas of Anatolia. Ankara sof is a type of fabric woven from mohair. Sof is made by spinning the <b>mohair</b> fiber into <b>yarn,</b> weaving the fabric from this yarn and then dyeing it. Sof fabric was preferred by the elite segments of society as a unique handcraft specific to Ankara and the Central Anatolia Region. Unfortunately, this is no longer woven and can now only be seen in museums. In this respect, Ankara sof {{has become part of the}} cultural heritage of the region. The literature review indicates that there are two samples of sof fabric in the Ankara Ethnographic Museum while in the Sadberk HanÄ±m Museum there is one. However, a study conducted in the Ankara Ethnographic Museum revealed three more samples of sof fabric in addition to the two in the literature. Considering the above, sof is culturally important and should be protected even though it is no longer woven today. This study intends to analyze the characteristics of Ankara sof by examining the five sof fabric examples in the Ankara Ethnographic Museum in terms of width, height, weft-warp density, and weaving thickness. These characteristics are analyzed, documented and information about the weaving looms is also provided...|$|R
