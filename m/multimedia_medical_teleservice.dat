40|$|Abstract—In Romania, the {{diversification}} of telecommunication networks and advances in communications technologies, including the Internet, has considerable {{potential as a}} medium for telemedicine applications. In this context, The National Communication Research Institute – INSCC develops a Romanian telemedicine project, Multimedia platform for Complex <b>medical</b> <b>teleservices</b> implementation – TELMES. The main propose of this project is to implement scalable medical telecenters networks, based on the new ITC technologies available in Romania. This paper presents the concept, structure for a pilot model of a regional medical telecenters network, based on TELMES platform, and consisting from a enabling to implement applications from the complex <b>medical</b> <b>teleservices</b> category for GPs and patients. The TELMES network also includes the capability for transmission and acquisition of medical records and remotely updating the medical regional database developed within the project. Therefore, the regional telecenters will be a support for the developing of a regional medical database, that should serve for a complex range of teleservices such as teleradiology, telepathology, teleconsulting, telediagnosis, telemonitoring and {{it should also be}} a center for continuous training tasks, by telelearning for medical personal or for informing/educating of patients.

40|$|Many current {{electronic}} {{medical record}} systems (EMRSs) are designed primarily to handle text-based data and thus cannot accommodate the increasingly important imaging components of the patient record. This is especially the case in oncology, which is particularly dependent on imaging data for the diagnosis, treatment, and followup {{of a wide variety}} of cancers. The next generation of EMRSs will support the integration of important textual, numeric, imaging, and signal-based medical data. These new multimedia EMRSs 1 require novel database models, data compression technologies, and user interfaces. Many of these technology requirements can be addressed using emerging Internet standards developed to support the security, compression, and multimedia needs of nonmedical applications. The resulting secure, Internet-based, <b>multimedia</b> <b>medical</b> record has exciting potential to address a core need of telemedicine—delivering interactive clinical data and decision support tools over a wide geographical area. Since 1993, with funding from the National Library of Medicine, we have been developing such a system.

40|$|Medicine is {{increasingly}} image-intensive. The central importance of imaging {{technologies such as}} computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in clinical decision making, combined with the trend to store many "traditional" clinical images such as conventional radiographs, microscopic pathology and dermatology images in digital format present both challenges and an opportunities for the designers of clinical information systems. The emergence of <b>Multimedia</b> Electronic <b>Medical</b> Record Systems (MEMRS), architectures that integrate medical images with text-based clinical data, will further hasten this trend. The development of these systems, storing a large and diverse set of medical images, suggests {{that in the future}} MEMRS will become important digital libraries supporting patient care, research and education. The representation and retrieval of clinical images within these systems is problematic as conventional database architectures and information retrieval models have, until recently, focused largely on text-based data. Medical imaging data differs in many ways from text-based medical data but perhaps the most important difference is that the information contained within imaging data is fundamentally knowledge-based.
