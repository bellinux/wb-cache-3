5|$|By 1939, Aquinas Hall {{dormitory}} {{had been}} built to accommodate <b>more</b> <b>students</b> enrolling in general studies, but {{with the impact of}} World War II upon enrollment, President John J. Dillon, O.P. (1936â€“1944) lobbied Rhode Island's congressional delegation to pressure the War Department to assign Providence College an Army Specialized Training Program unit. Unit #1188 arrived on campus in the Summer of 1943, allowing the college to continue operation. A class of approximately 380 soldiers-in-training studied engineering at Providence College for a year before going overseas.|$|E
5|$|By the 1860s, Seton Hall College was {{continuing}} its rapid growth {{and began to}} enroll more and <b>more</b> <b>students</b> each year. However, among other difficulties, several fires on campus slowed down the growth process. The first of several strange fires in the University's history occurred in 1867 which destroyed the college's first building. Two decades later on March 9, 1886, another fire destroyed the university's main building. In the 20th century, another campus fire burned down a classroom {{as well as several}} dormitory buildings in 1909.|$|E

In Physics, there was no distinguishable gender gap in the enrollment in early years, but the gap became apparent in the subsequent years, with <b>more</b> female <b>students</b> than male <b>students.</b> <b>More</b> male <b>students</b> enrolled in Integrated Physics and Chemistry (IPC) than female students, and the gender gap was steady.|$|R

5|$|On August 26, 2008, a {{government}} working group presented New Brunswick Education Minister Kelly Lamrock with eight recommendations for extracurricular transportation. The recommendations included that guidelines for transporting students to school-related extracurricular activities be strengthened, that {{a school bus}} be used when transporting ten or <b>more</b> <b>students,</b> that vehicles be equipped with snow tires if travelling between October 15 and April 30, and that the district superintendent be charged with responsibility for ensuring safe transportation of students to and from extracurricular activities.

5|$|The siege {{continued}} on 6 July. Negotiation talks continued between the besieged Lal Masjid administration and government authorities, without resolution.

President Pervez Musharraf issued an ultimatum on the evening of 7 July. The Pakistani army took over the operation and replaced the paramilitary troops deployed around the premises. A thirteen-year-old child escaped from the besieged mosque unharmed.|$|E
5|$|As Mormonism gained {{popularity}} in the Pacific, church-sponsored schools became more common. The Makeke School, founded by Coombs in the 1920s, became {{the foundation for the}} later established Liahona College. The church leased 276 acres near Nuku'alofa. The Liahona School opened in 1952 and led to a great expansion of the church. The Liahona School was intended to allow for <b>more</b> <b>students</b> with more hired faculty members and a broader curriculum. The education provided to Tongan students prepared them for life outside of Tonga, whether it was pursuing a secondary education or a job in America.

5|$|First {{offered in}} 1946 in the Sandusky area and later {{expanded}} to serve Erie, Huron, Lorain, and Ottawa counties, extension programs established {{a foundation for}} BGSU Firelands, the university's regional campus. The college was established at a site located near Lake Erie in Huron, Ohio when the first building (now Foundation Hall) was opened. In 2003, Cedar Point Center opened its doors on the Firelands campus. The facility houses a 450-seat divisible public meeting area, smaller conference rooms, a cyber cafe, multimedia classrooms, and two distance learning classrooms. In March 2011, BGSU Firelands unveiled a new master plan calling {{for the construction of}} three buildings to handle <b>more</b> <b>students,</b> more college/community partnerships; and expand the James H.

5|$|The Butlers founded Circus Juventas as {{a nonprofit}} {{corporation}} in October 1994, citing {{a desire to}} give back to the community as {{one of the reasons for}} its creation. It was originally known as Circus of the Star, so called for Minnesota's nickname, The North Star State. The newly opened Hillcrest Recreation Center in Saint Paul provided the couple with inspiration for the circus program, and they asked the city if they could hold classes there. The Saint Paul Parks and Recreation Department approved the program, and assumed liability for approximately fifty children who enrolled the first year. About thirty of those students stayed with the program and performed in their first show at the 1995 Highland Fest, an annual family-oriented neighborhood festival. After this performance, interest in the program increased. By 1996, 30 <b>more</b> <b>students</b> were enrolled, and by 1997, an additional 25 had joined the program. The circus was still based out of the Hillcrest Recreation Center's gym, and had to work around the schedule of the other regular activities in the facility. In 1997, the waitlist for the program was around 200 students.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} {{justifications for}} the proposition were officially advanced : Public schools require more government funding to nurture <b>student</b> learning, promote <b>more</b> <b>student</b> activities, {{and to provide}} more extracurricular activities. Getting proper funding and allocating it correctly {{have always been a}} challenge for public schools. With this funding schools can keep textbooks up to date and have adequate computer resources. With additional funds they can organize more field trips or out of class activities for the students. Sports and additional extracurricular classes can be offered with increased funding as well. Public schools demand more government funding to encourage <b>student</b> learning, promote <b>more</b> <b>student</b> activities, and to provide more extracurricular activities.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain and compare {{perceptions}} of students relative to their academic advisement experiences with professional counselors and faculty advisors. A questionnaire was mailed to 225 present or past students of 3 community colleges in the states of Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas.
