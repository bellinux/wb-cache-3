50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} cost-effective safety device is the rupture disk. Incorporated into the pressure vessel in fabrication, {{this is simply}} a port in the vessel closed off by a finely <b>machined</b> <b>plate</b> that will burst at a predetermined pressure. This plate may be made of either aluminum or carbon. The disk is fitted within a flanged assembly that discharges the autoclave's pressure out into an exhaust pipe to carry the whoosh well away from personnel. The disk is fairly inexpensive and can be replaced easily. The rupture disk {{should be used to}} back up the safety valve and sized to drop internal pressure as quickly as possible. Autoclave fires can release considerable energy into the air inside, resulting in a sudden pressure spike. The rupture disk is designed to release at a pressure slightly above that of the ASME safety valve and well below that of the hydrostatic test; it is never called into play unless there is a sudden pressure increase beyond the capacity of the safety valve. The very modest cost of even a pair of fairly large rupture disks makes this an extremely attractive option. The rupture disk should be not less than twice the diameter of the inlet to or the outlet from the vessel, whichever is larger.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Integral Airframe Structures (IAS) program was to demonstrate, for an integrally stiffened structural concept, performance and weight equal to "built-up" structure with lower manufacturing cost. This report presents results of the cost assessment for several design configuration/manufacturing method combinations. The attributes of various cost analysis models were evaluated and COSTRAN selected for this study. A process/design cost evaluation matrix was developed based on material, forming, machining, and assembly of structural sub-elements and assembled structure. A hybrid design, made from high-speed machined extruded frames that are mechanically fastened to high-speed <b>machined</b> <b>plate</b> skin/stringer panels, was identified as the most cost-effective manufacturing solution. Recurring labor and material costs of the hybrid design are up to 61 percent less than the current built-up technology baseline. This would correspond to a total cost reduction of $ 1. 7 million per ship set for a 777 -sized airplane.

40|$|The continual need {{to reduce}} {{airframe}} cost {{and the emergence of}} high speed machining and other manufacturing technologies has brought about a renewed interest in large-scale integral structures for aircraft applications. Applications have been inhibited, however, because of the need to demonstrate damage tolerance, and by cost and manufacturing risks associated with the size and complexity of the parts. The Integral Airframe Structures (IAS) Program identified a feasible integrally stiffened fuselage concept and evaluated performance and manufacturing cost compared to conventional designs. An integral skin/stiffener concept was produced both by plate hog-out and near-net extrusion. Alloys evaluated included 7050 -T 7451 plate, 7050 -T 74511 extrusion, 6013 -T 6511 extrusion, and 7475 -T 7351 plate. Mechanical properties, structural details, and joint performance were evaluated as well as repair, static compression, and two-bay crack residual strength panels. Crack turning behavior was characterized through panel tests and improved methods for predicting crack turning were developed. Manufacturing cost was evaluated using COSTRAN. A hybrid design, made from high-speed machined extruded frames that are mechanically fastened to high-speed <b>machined</b> <b>plate</b> skin/stringer panels, was identified as the most cost-effective manufacturing solution. Recurring labor and material costs of the hybrid design are up to 61 percent less than the current technology baseline...|$|E
40|$|Unwanted {{vibration}} in {{machine tools}} like milling, lathe, grinding machine {{is one of}} the main problem as it affects the quality of the machined parts, tool life and noise during machining operation. Hence these unwanted vibrations are needed to be suppressed or damped out while machining. Therefore the present work concentrates and aims on study of different controllable parameter that affect the responses like vibration amplitude and roughness of machined part. The part to be machined is kept on sandwich of plates made up of polymer and composite material. The sandwich along with the part to be machined, fixed on the slotted table of horizontal milling machine. The parameters that can easily be controlled are feed, RPM of cutter, depth of cut, and number of plates that form the secondary bed material. Polymers like Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Polypropylene (PP) plates and composites like Glass Fiber Polyester and Glass Fiber Epoxy (GFE) plates are used in the experiments to form the sandwich (secondary bed material) on which work-piece (MS Plate) was mounted and fed to the milling cutter. Four holes are made on the specimen and the plates to ensure that the sandwich of plate including the work-piece can be bolted to the slotted table. Common up-milling operation was carried out in controlled manner. Vibration signals were recorded on the screen of phosphorous storage oscilloscope and surface roughness of <b>machined</b> <b>plate</b> was found from the Talysurf. Finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out to know the resonance frequencies at which the structure should not be excited. In the course of the FEA some important facts have come up that lead to set some of the steps of precautions during the experimentation. Response surface methodology (RSM) is used to develop the model equation for each set of plate material. ...|$|E
