25|$|A {{more obvious}} {{external}} change was the fitting of large crane-like davits, each powered by {{an electric motor}} and capable of launching six lifeboats which were housed in gantries; the ship was originally designed to have eight sets of gantry davits but only five were actually installed before she entered war service, with the difference being made up with boats launched by <b>manually-operated</b> Welin-type davits as on Titanic and Olympic.|$|E
25|$|This second refit package (RP2) {{included}} {{a number of}} major capability upgrades for the ship, including the first fitting of the Royal Navy’s newest command system, DNA(2), and the replacement of the two old <b>manually-operated</b> 30mm guns with two 30 mm DS30M Mark 2 Guns. Having rejoined the ship on 20 July 2009, the crew conducted post-refits trials until January 2010, and Montrose was formally accepted back into the fleet on 11 February 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotorcraft}} {{was equipped}} with an uncovered tail boom, outfitted with twin fins and a rudder; both directional control and stability of the vehicle were provided via the controlled deflection of exhaust gases from the engine. As {{a consequence of the}} torque-free method of rotor propulsion, the Djinn did not require the presence of an anti-torque tail rotor. A simplistic wheel-equipped twin-skid arrangement was also present; this was retractable via the same <b>manually-operated</b> crank handle used for engine ignition. The Djinn could also be deployed with multiple armaments. In the ground-attack role, it could be equipped with a single machine gun, which was manned from the second seat of the cockpit. For performing anti-tank warfare, the Djinn was able to equip a guided missile; when deployed in an effective manner against an adversary, the manufacturer claimed the combination to be extremely difficult for an opposing tank to sight its adversary and to defend itself during the anticipated rapid speed of engagements.|$|E
500|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} <b>manually-operated</b> director-control tower and the separate [...] rangefinder situated above the bridge. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye.|$|E

They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye. [...] and Hereward saw {{the introduction of a}} new style of bridge that would become standard on all Royal Navy fleet destroyers from the [...] through to the [...] of 1944. This was necessary as Hereward was fitted with a prototype twin-gun mounting that had a trunnion height [...] higher than the previous weapons, therefore it was necessary to raise the wheelhouse to allow the helmsman to see over the top. Raising the wheelhouse meant it had to be placed in front of, rather than underneath, the bridge, and it was given angled sides, resulting in a characteristic wedge shape with a sloping roof.|$|E
500|$|The {{prototype}} {{was completed}} in July and was first flown on 27 July 1947. Two aircraft were shown at the Tushino Aviation Day Display on 3 August 1947. It completed its manufacturer's trials in September and underwent the State acceptance trials from 4 October 1947 to 27 February 1948 where it was redesignated as the Tu-12. The NII VVS (Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Institoot Voyenno-Vozdooshnykh Seel – Air Force Scientific Test Institute) report summarized {{the differences between the}} Tu-2 and Tu-12 as [...] "a considerable gain in speed, an improved rate of climb, a higher service ceiling, but poorer field performance and a considerably greater fuel load required to achieve the same range as the Tu-2." [...] Both the lack of a pressurized cabin that greatly reduced its effectiveness at high altitude and the lack of deicing equipment for the wing and tail leading edges and the cockpit glazing were noted as major problems. At high speeds it was virtually impossible to traverse and elevate the <b>manually-operated</b> VUB-68 and Lu-68 gun turrets. The vibration of the NS-23 cannon when firing rendered the equipment in the navigator's cabin unusable and damaged the cabin glazing. Turning on the Identification friend or foe (IFF) system adversely affected the intercom system and the radios. New generators had to be installed as the originals did not produce enough electrical power.|$|E
2500|$|This {{issue has}} led to a {{conflict}} in the United States between the vision-impaired and civil engineering communities. [...] One solution is to provide <b>manually-operated</b> pedestrian crossing signals at each entry. This increases construction and operation costs, and requires some way to disrupt traffic long enough for the pedestrian to cross (such as a HAWK beacon) that defeats the purpose of the roundabout. Signalisation also increases delays for most pedestrians during periods of light traffic, since pedestrians need to wait for a signal to change before (legally) crossing.|$|E
50|$|Backflow {{prevention}} must be automatic, and <b>manually-operated</b> valves are {{not usually}} acceptable.|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of the Ruger BX-25 25 round magazine, there is no limit to the magazine capacity for semi-automatic rim-fire rifles or <b>manually-operated</b> rifles or shotguns (i.e., lever-action, pump-action, or bolt-action).|$|E
50|$|Ralph W. Bottriel {{became the}} first American {{military}} person to jump from an aircraft using a <b>manually-operated</b> backpack parachute on 19 May 1919. He later received the Distinguished Flying Cross for this feat.|$|E
50|$|The {{abandoned}} Flatonia Railroad Tower, in {{use from}} 1902 to 1996, {{was one of}} Texas' longest standing, <b>manually-operated</b> railroad switching towers with north-south and east-west cross rails. The tower was damaged {{in an automobile accident}} on January 9, 2014.|$|E
50|$|Parts of both {{platforms}} survive at {{the site}} (though the line itself is now single track), along with a brick signal box (to work the <b>manually-operated</b> level crossing gates and protecting signals) and the now privately occupied station house.|$|E
50|$|In British use the Scarff {{ring was}} {{replaced}} in the 1930s by specialised power-operated turrets {{such as those}} made by Boulton Paul or Nash & Thompson, aircraft air speeds having by then risen {{to the point where}} a <b>manually-operated</b> gun was infeasible.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{equipped}} with optionally integrated, remote-controlled and <b>manually-operated</b> weapon stations. It is fitted with two gun ports on the roof. The optional armament mounted on the vehicle includes 7.62mm and 12.7mm machine guns, a 25mm anti-aircraft gun and a 40mm automatic grenade launcher.|$|E
5000|$|A {{desoldering}} pump, colloquially {{known as}} a solder sucker, is a <b>manually-operated</b> device {{which is used to}} remove solder from a printed circuit board.

50|$|Lining the façade of the David Brower Center {{are fixed}} {{exterior}} aluminum louvers. These louvers block the direct sun and minimize heat gains within the building. In {{addition to the}} exterior shading devices, occupants can make further adjustments from within the building using <b>manually-operated</b> interior roller fabric shades above each window.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} was a {{rear-wheel drive}} system of single shaft on the shorter chassis, and double shaft on the longer. The clutch was a <b>manually-operated</b> single-plate Verto Division Ferodo 12 LF 39 (except for the SM8 4x4). The gearbox was an horizontally-mounted 5-speed (4 synchronised) manual unit codenamed as 301.|$|E
5000|$|Cattal is at {{the western}} end of a dual track section from Hammerton. Eastbound trains are timetabled to arrive first on the dual track section, so as to clear the single line westwards towards Knaresborough. [...] The level {{crossing}} here still has <b>manually-operated</b> metal gates and a ground-level signal box. [...] The station buildings are now privately owned.|$|E
50|$|The Otis Autotronic {{system of}} the early 1950s brought the {{earliest}} predictive systems which could anticipate traffic patterns within a building to deploy elevator movement in the most efficient manner. Relay-controlled elevator systems remained common until the 1980s and their gradual replacement with solid-state, microprocessor-based controls are now the industry standard. Most older, <b>manually-operated</b> elevators have been retrofitted with automatic or semi-automatic controls.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} {{immediately}} {{to the west of}} a level crossing that provides road access to Frinton. Residents of the town who live inside the gates of the crossing attach a particular status to this fact. These wooden gates were, until 2009, the only <b>manually-operated</b> level crossing gates on the line. The level crossing is now protected by a barrier system.|$|E
50|$|After {{a delayed}} {{introduction}} due to design difficulties, Buick introduced the convertible Reatta in 1990 with a <b>manually-operated</b> top designed by ASC, available in vinyl or cloth {{with a glass}} rear window and electric defroster. When retracted, the top was protected by a rigid tonneau cover. The 1991 models featured power pull-down motors to assist in tightening the rear bow of the top to the tonneau cover.|$|E
5000|$|The Puckle gun (also {{known as}} the Defence gun) was a {{primitive}} crew-served, <b>manually-operated</b> flintlock revolver patented in 1718 by James Puckle (1667-1724) a British inventor, lawyer and writer. It {{was one of the}} earliest weapons to be referred to as a [...] "machine gun", being called such in a 1722 shipping manifest, though its operation does not match the modern use of the term.|$|E
50|$|A {{more obvious}} {{external}} change was the fitting of large crane-like davits, each powered by {{an electric motor}} and capable of launching six lifeboats which were housed in gantries; the ship was originally designed to have eight sets of gantry davits but only five were actually installed before she entered war service, with the difference being made up with boats launched by <b>manually-operated</b> Welin-type davits as on Titanic and Olympic.|$|E
50|$|In 1891, Victoria {{station was}} inaugurated. Trains to Zelaya and Capilla del Señor {{departed}} from Victoria {{for the first}} time one year later. In 1916, the Retiro-Tigre line was electrified, becoming the first electrified railway system of South America. New British Thomson-Houston (BTH) multiple units were acquired to run on the line. The CAR also installed the first crossbuck and <b>manually-operated</b> gates in the many level crossings existing by then.|$|E
50|$|Napier's bones is a <b>manually-operated</b> {{calculating device}} created by John Napier of Merchiston for {{calculation}} {{of products and}} quotients of numbers. The method was based on Arab mathematics and the lattice multiplication used by Matrakci Nasuh in the Umdet-ul Hisab and Fibonacci's work in his Liber Abaci. The technique was also called Rabdology. Napier published his version in 1617 in Rabdology., printed in Edinburgh, Scotland, dedicated to his patron Alexander Seton.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{buildings}} {{here are}} now privately occupied and {{the station is}} unmanned. The lack of ticket machines means that tickets need to purchased either on the train or in advance. [...] There are shelters and digital information screens on each platform. Step-free access is available to both platforms, which are linked by the <b>manually-operated</b> level crossing, which still (as of 2017) retains its wooden gates and ground-level signal box.|$|E
50|$|In 1891 the CAR opened Fisherton Station in {{the west}} of Rosario, {{as well as a}} new branch {{entering}} Rosario from the southwest and a stop on said line (Eloy Palacios Station). Victoria station was also opened in 1891. Trains to Zelaya and Capilla del Señor departed from Victoria for the first time one year later. The CAR also installed the first crossbuck and <b>manually-operated</b> gates in the many level crossings existing by then.|$|E
