It was as follows: Social-Political council (84.5% in first round in all constituencies, 74.82% in second round in 51 of 80 constituencies), Council of Municipalities (84.1% in first round, 74.6% in second round) and Council of Associated Labour (76.5% in first round in all constituencies, 66% in second round in 103 of 160 constituencies).|$|E

Society is confident about where {{it wants to}} go collectively, though those outside the <b>majoritarian</b> center often feel stifled by the conformity.|$|E
25|$|Political {{developments}} in Ukraine {{have led to}} repeated changes in the electoral system used for parliamentary elections. Each convocation of the Verkhovna Rada has been elected under {{a different set of}} laws gradually evolving from the purely <b>majoritarian</b> scheme inherited from the Soviet era to a purely proportional scheme, effective from 2006 until 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{executive}} {{branch of government}} is the Stadtrat (town council). It leads and represents the political community. Members are elected by all enfranchised residents of Brugg to four-year terms though a <b>majoritarian</b> system. The town council {{is responsible for the}} implementation of all resolutions approved by the resident’s council (Einwohnerrat) and is obliged to carry out all tasks assigned to it by the cantonal and federal governments.|$|E
25|$|Influenced by the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, {{when she}} worked in relief camps and the 2002 Gujarat violence, she started {{focusing}} her work on the rise of Hindu nationalism (Hindutva) in Orissa. She wrote several articles on the topic, including Orissa: A Gujarat In The making (November 2003), which warned about the impending Hindu <b>majoritarian</b> violence against minority Christian groups in Orissa, largely of Dalit and Adivasi descent, and Muslims.|$|E
25|$|In the Italian referendums of 1993, voters {{approved}} substantial changes, including {{moving from a}} proportional to an Additional Member System (with the requirement to obtain a minimum of 4% of the national vote to obtain representation) which is largely dominated by a <b>majoritarian</b> electoral system and the abolishment of some ministries (some of which have however been reintroduced with only partly modified names, as the Ministry of Agriculture being renamed Ministry of Agricultural Resources).|$|E
25|$|Jaspers valued humanism and the {{continuity}} of integral cultural tradition in political spheres. He strongly opposed totalitarian despotism and warned about the increasing tendency towards technocracy, or a regime that regards humans as mere instruments of science or of ideological goals. He was also skeptical of <b>majoritarian</b> democracy. Thus, he supported a form of governance that guaranteed individual freedom and limited government yet was rooted in authentic tradition and guided by an intellectual elite.|$|E
25|$|Given the one-party {{dominance}} in Singapore, the opposition MPs in Parliament {{play a crucial}} role in checking the executive. They enforce the doctrine of ministerial responsibility by providing constructive criticism of executive policies. They are also entitled to vote for or against bills and motions, but this may exercise little influence over <b>majoritarian</b> power. As such, the effectiveness of the opposition hinges on its ability to keep the executive, as well as the majority party, vigilant and accountable to society.|$|E
25|$|With {{regards to}} issues of {{diversity}} (bilingualism and multiculturalism), the Conservatives {{tend to be more}} <b>majoritarian,</b> favouring a reduced scope for official bilingualism and a more assimilationist approach to immigrants and Native peoples. The Liberals and NDP are more pluralistic including generous government support for minority cultures, while the BQ favour viewing Canada as two separate societies (English Canada and Quebec), and advocate strong protections for French language and culture in Quebec while remaining unconcerned about issues with other minorities or {{in other parts of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|Tihipko {{served as}} the {{minister}} of economics (1997–1999). In June 2000 Tihipko left the Yushchenko Government {{to take part in}} a parliamentary by-election on 25 June and eventually won a seat at the <b>majoritarian</b> constituency #36 in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. In November 2000 became member and leader of Labour Ukraine. At the 2002 parliamentary elections, with the Labour Ukraine being part of the For United Ukraine alliance, he was again elected into parliament. Tihipko was Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine in the years 2002-2004.|$|E
25|$|Abrams (2006) {{argues that}} the eclipse of {{liberalism}} {{was caused by a}} grass-roots populist revolt, often with a Fundamentalist and anti-modern theme, abetted by corporations eager to weaken labor unions and the regulatory regime of the New Deal. The success of liberalism in the first place, he argues, came from efforts of a liberal elite that had entrenched itself in key social, political, and especially judicial positions. These elites, Abrams contends, imposed their brand of liberalism from within some of the least democratic and most insulated institutions, especially the universities, foundations, independent regulatory agencies, and the Supreme Court. With only a weak popular base, liberalism was vulnerable to a populist counterrevolution by the nation's democratic or <b>majoritarian</b> forces.|$|E
25|$|PR {{is used by}} a {{majority}} of the world's 33 most robust democracies with populations of at least two million people; only six use plurality or a <b>majoritarian</b> system (runoff or instant runoff) for elections to the legislative assembly, four use parallel systems, and 23 use PR. PR dominates Europe, including Germany and most of northern and eastern Europe; it is also used for European Parliament elections. France adopted PR at the end of World War II, but discarded it in 1958; it was used for parliament elections in 1986. Switzerland has the most widespread use of proportional representation, which is the system used to elect not only national legislatures and local councils, but also all local executives. PR is less common in the English-speaking world; New Zealand adopted MMP in 1993, but the UK, Canada, India and Australia all use plurality/majoritarian systems for legislative elections.|$|E
25|$|The Applicant {{responded that}} the {{provisions}} used {{to ban the}} marches applied only to the safety and suitability of proposed venues rather than to a general risk of violence, and that the authorities on refusing an application for these reasons were obliged to suggest an alternative venue, which had not been done. He further contended that the Government's definition of morals was incorrect, as it referred only to <b>majoritarian</b> public opinion {{without regard to the}} concepts of pluralism or diversity. Furthermore, the proposed marches would not have been a threat to morals as they were concerned with human rights and civil liberties and would not have involved any sexually provocative content. He claimed the Government's references to public safety were unsubstantiated as they had not demonstrated an assessed risk of violence. He claimed finally that the sweeping nature of the ban was disproportionate and could not be justified {{on the grounds that it}} may have shocked or confused some parts of society (Bączkowski v Poland).|$|E
25|$|Prior to 2009, {{the mayor}} was elected by the City Assembly. It was changed to direct {{elections}} by <b>majoritarian</b> vote (two-round system) in 2009. The mayor {{is the head of}} the city administration and has two deputies (directly elected together with him/her). The term of office of the mayor (and his/her deputies) is four years. The mayor (with the deputies) may be recalled by a referendum according to law (not less than 20% of all electors in the City of Zagreb has the right to initiate a city referendum regarding recalling of the mayor; when a majority of voters taking part in the referendum vote in favour of the recall, provided that majority includes not less than one third of all persons entitled to vote in the City of Zagreb, i.e. ⅓ of persons in the City of Zagreb electoral register, the mayor's mandate shall be deemed revoked and special mayoral by-elections shall be held).|$|E
25|$|The Round Table {{agreement}} of 18 September encompassed six draft laws that covered {{an overhaul of}} the Constitution, establishment of a Constitutional Court, the functioning and management of political parties, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, the penal code and the law on penal procedures (the last two changes represented an additional separation of the Party from the state apparatus). The electoral system was a compromise: about half of the deputies would be elected proportionally and half by the <b>majoritarian</b> system. A weak presidency was also agreed upon, but no consensus was attained on who should elect the president (parliament or the people) and when this election should occur (before or after parliamentary elections). On 7 October 1989, the Communist Party at its last congress re-established itself as the Hungarian Socialist Party. In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the parliament adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election, which took place on March 24, 1990. The legislation transformed Hungary from a People's Republic into the Republic of Hungary, guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. The Soviet military occupation of Hungary, which had persisted since World War II, ended on 19 June 1991.|$|E

500|$|To Gandhi, the {{economic}} philosophy that aims at [...] "greatest {{good for the}} greatest number" [...] was fundamentally flawed, and his alternative proposal sarvodaya set its aim at [...] "greatest good for all". He believed that the best economic system not only cared to lift the [...] "poor, less skilled, of impoverished background" [...] but also empowered to lift the [...] "rich, highly skilled, of capital means and landlords". Violence against any human being, born poor or rich, is wrong believed Gandhi. He stated that mandate theory of <b>majoritarian</b> democracy shouldn't be pushed to absurd extremes, individual freedoms should never be denied, and no person should ever be made a social or economic slave to the [...] "resolutions of majorities".|$|E
500|$|The {{nomination}} of Modi for the prime ministership {{drew attention to}} his reputation as [...] "one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians." [...] During the 2014 election campaign the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader, who {{would be able to}} take difficult decisions. Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the BJP and RSS. Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and [...] "development". Nonetheless, his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy. Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a <b>majoritarian</b> and exclusionary social agenda.|$|E
500|$|The Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR) is a non-elected body {{established}} in 1970 under Part VII of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore to fulfil {{the roles of}} safeguarding minority rights and advising the Government and the Parliament of Singapore. Its general function, as articulated in the Constitution, is [...] "to consider and report on such matters affecting persons of any racial or religious community in Singapore as may be referred to the Council by Parliament or the Government". To fulfil {{its role as a}} safeguard against any parliamentary or executive propensity to <b>majoritarian</b> or sectarian politics, it may constrict the Government's freedom to discriminate against racial and religious communities by obstructing the passage of new laws and regulations that it deems to contain such [...] "differentiating measures".|$|E

500|$|The {{executive}} branch of each county's government {{is headed by}} a county prefect (county president) (...) , except that a mayor heads the city of Zagreb's {{executive branch}}. Croatia's county prefects (with two deputy prefects), mayor of Zagreb (with two deputy mayors) are elected for a four-year term {{by a majority of}} votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} voting (<b>majoritarian</b> vote, two-round system). County prefects (with deputy prefects and mayor of Zagreb with his/her deputies) can be recalled by a referendum. County administrative bodies are administrative departments and services which are established for the performance of works in the self-governing domain of the county, as well as for the performance of works of state administration transferred to the county. Administrative departments and services are managed by heads (principals) nominated by the county prefect on the basis of a public competition.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Bowers was {{formally}} overruled by Lawrence v. Texas, from which Scalia dissented. According to Mark V. Tushnet in his {{survey of the}} Rehnquist Court, during the oral argument in the case, Scalia seemed so intent on making the state's argument for it that the Chief Justice intervened. According to his biographer, Joan Biskupic, Scalia [...] "ridiculed" [...] the majority in his dissent for being so ready to cast aside Bowers when {{many of the same}} justices had refused to overturn Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In March 2009, openly gay Congressman Barney Frank described him as a [...] "homophobe". Maureen Dowd described Scalia in a 2003 column as [...] "Archie Bunker in a high-backed chair". In an op-ed for The New York Times, federal appeals judge Richard Posner and Georgia State University law professor Eric Segall described as radical Scalia's positions on homosexuality, reflecting an apparent belief that the religious stances supposedly held by the majority of US citizens should take precedence over the Constitution and characterizing Scalia's [...] "political ideal as verg on <b>majoritarian</b> theocracy".|$|E

2500|$|Some anarcho-communists {{oppose the}} <b>majoritarian</b> nature of direct democracy, {{feeling that it}} can impede {{individual}} liberty and opt in favour of a non-majoritarian form of consensus democracy, similar to Proudhon's position on direct democracy.

2500|$|... is {{animated}} by a passionate liberal spirit, albeit {{one of a}} particular type. [...] liberalism is less intimately akin to that of John Locke or Robert Nozick, or L. T. Hobhouse or John Rawls, {{than it is to}} that of Isaiah Berlin and, less proximately, John Stuart Mill. Tismăneanu shares with Berlin and Mill an uncompromising commitment to pluralism as the highest political value; a celebration of difference, nonconformity, and tolerance; a deep skepticism concerning ultimate solutions, political blueprints, and unequivocal policy prescriptions; and a wariness regarding the subtler danger of <b>majoritarian</b> authoritarianism.|$|E
2500|$|... {{then the}} {{pairwise}} majority preference {{of the group}} is that A wins over B, B wins over C, and C wins over A: these yield rock-paper-scissors preferences for any pairwise comparison. [...] In this circumstance, any aggregation rule that satisfies the very basic <b>majoritarian</b> requirement that a candidate who receives a majority of votes must win the election, will fail the IIA criterion, if social preference is required to be transitive (or acyclic). [...] To see this, suppose that such a rule satisfies IIA. [...] Since majority preferences are respected, the society prefers A to B (two votes for A > B and one for B > A), B to C, and C to A. [...] Thus a cycle is generated, which contradicts the assumption that social preference is transitive.|$|E
2500|$|Substantive {{due process}} is to be {{distinguished}} from procedural due process. The distinction arises from the words [...] "of law" [...] in the phrase [...] "due process of law." [...] Procedural due process protects individuals from the coercive power of government by ensuring that adjudication processes, under valid laws, are fair and impartial. Such protections, for example, include sufficient and timely notice on why a party is required to appear before a court or other administrative body, the right to an impartial trier of fact and trier of law, {{and the right to}} give testimony and present relevant evidence at hearings. In contrast, substantive due process protects individuals against <b>majoritarian</b> policy enactments that exceed the limits of governmental authority: courts may find that a majority's enactment is not law and cannot be enforced as such, regardless of whether the processes of enactment and enforcement were actually fair.|$|E
2500|$|Religious fundamentalists {{frequently}} {{feel that}} governments should enact laws supporting their religious tenets. The Christian right {{is a major}} force in North America. They generally support laws upholding what they consider religious values, such as opposition to abortion, contraception, sex outside marriage and to same-sex marriage and reject scientific positions on evolution and other matters where science disagrees with the Bible. Outside the West, other religious and ethnic groups are considered right-wing. In India, Hindu nationalism is sometimes considered a part of the Right. The Hindu nationalist movement has attracted privileged groups fearing encroachment on their dominant positions and also [...] "plebeian" [...] and impoverished groups seeking recognition around a <b>majoritarian</b> rhetoric of cultural pride, order and national strength. Many Islamist groups have been called [...] "right-wing" [...] including the Great Union Party and the Combatant Clergy Association/Association of Militant Clergy and the Islamic Society of Engineers of Iran.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, {{developing}} modernist ideas regarding {{politics and the}} role of government placed the role of the judiciary into flux. The courts were generally moving away from what has been called [...] "guardian review" [...] — in which judges defended the line between appropriate legislative advances and <b>majoritarian</b> encroachments into the private sphere of life — toward a position of [...] "bifurcated review". This approach favored sorting laws into categories that demanded deference towards other branches of government in the economic sphere, but aggressively heightened judicial scrutiny with respect to fundamental civil and political liberties. The slow transformation away from the [...] "guardian review" [...] role of the judiciary brought about the ideological—and, to a degree, generational—rift in the 1930s judiciary. With the Judiciary Bill, Roosevelt sought to accelerate this judicial evolution by diminishing the dominance of an older generation of judges who remained attached to an earlier mode of American jurisprudence.|$|E
2500|$|Nationwide {{protests against}} the {{perceived}} authoritarianism of Erdoğan's government began in May 2013, with an internationally criticised police crackdown resulting in 22 deaths and the stalling of EU membership negotiations. Following a split with Gülen, Erdoğan promulgated sweeping judicial reforms he insisted were needed to purge Gülen's sympathisers, but which were criticised for threatening judicial independence. A US$100billion corruption scandal in 2013 led to the arrests of Erdoğan's close allies, and incriminated Erdoğan. His government has since come under fire for alleged human rights violations and crackdown on press and social media, having blocked access to Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube on numerous occasions. Erdoğan's government lifted the bans when directed by court orders, but later reimposed them. Journalists have criticised his authoritarian tendencies; more journalists have been incarcerated in Turkey {{than in any other}} country. [...] Political commentators have stated that Erdoğan's unceasing efforts at broadening his executive powers while also minimizing his executive accountability amount to the [...] "fall of Turkish democracy," [...] and the [...] "birth of a dictator," [...] while Erdoğan supporters contend that Turkey remains a <b>majoritarian</b> democracy, claiming that the government's disputed April 2017 elections were legitimate.|$|E
2500|$|PR {{tries to}} resolve the {{unfairness}} of <b>majoritarian</b> and plurality voting systems where the largest parties receive an [...] "unfair" [...] "seat bonus" [...] and smaller parties are disadvantaged and have difficulty winning any representation at all (Duverger's law). The established parties in UK elections can win formal control of the parliament with as little as 35% of votes (2005 UK general election). In certain Canadian elections, majority governments have been formed by parties {{with the support of}} under 40% of votes cast (2011 Canadian election, 2015 Canadian election). If turnout levels in the electorate are less than 60%, such outcomes allow a party to form a majority government by convincing as few as one quarter of the electorate to vote for it. [...] In the 2005 UK election, for example, the Labour Party under Tony Blair won a comfortable parliamentary majority with the votes of only 21.6% of the total electorate. [...] Such misrepresentation has been criticized as [...] "no longer a question of 'fairness' but of elementary rights of citizens". [...] However, PR systems with a high electoral threshold, or other features that reduce proportionality, are not necessarily much fairer: in the Turkish general election, 2002, using an open list system with a 10% threshold, 46% of votes were wasted.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that a particular}} advantage of plurality electoral systems such as first past the post, or <b>majoritarian</b> electoral systems such as the alternative vote, is the geographic link between representatives and their constituents. [...] A notable disadvantage of PR is that, as its multiple-member districts are made larger, this link is weakened. [...] In party list PR systems without delineated districts, such as the Netherlands and Israel, the geographic link between representatives and their constituents is considered extremely weak. [...] Yet with relatively small multiple-member districts, in particular with STV, there are counter-arguments: about 90% of voters can consult a representative they voted for, someone whom they might think more sympathetic to their problem. In such cases it is sometimes argued that constituents and representatives have a closer link; constituents {{have a choice of}} representative so they can consult one with particular expertise in the topic at issue. [...] With multiple-member districts, prominent candidates have more opportunity to be elected in their home constituencies, which they know and can represent authentically. There is less likely to be a strong incentive to parachute them into constituencies in which they are strangers and thus less than ideal representatives. [...] Mixed-member PR systems incorporate single-member districts to preserve the link between constituents and representatives. However because up to half the parliamentary seats are list rather than district seats, the districts are necessarily up to twice as large as with a plurality/majoritarian system where all representatives serve single-member districts.|$|E

5000|$|Though common, <b>majoritarian</b> {{democracy}} is not universally accepted - <b>majoritarian</b> democracy was famously criticized as having the inherent danger of becoming a [...] "tyranny of the majority" [...] whereby the majority in society could oppress or exclude minority groups. In contrast to <b>majoritarian</b> democracy and the perceived danger of a tyranny of the majority, consensus democracy was developed in response that emphasizes rule by {{as many people as}} possible to make government inclusive, with a majority of support from society merely being a minimal threshold.
