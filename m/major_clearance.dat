A railway through Ilminster and Chard opened in 1866, and trade continue to move from the canal to the railway. In 1875 there was flooding in Westmoor, and local landowners opened Langport Lock on the River Parrett, as the Company could not afford to repair a broken culvert which carried drainage water under the river. With the lock open, no tolls could be charged, and the Somersetshire Drainage Bill was amended to allow the Somerset Drainage Commissioners to take over the whole of the River Parrett Navigation at no cost. The Bill became an Act of Parliament on 1 July 1878. Although the Act made provision for closing any of the navigations which came under their control, they took it to mean that all navigations must be closed. Users of the Westport Canal presented a petition requesting that the canal be retained in 1880, but were instructed that the Drainage Commissioners had no powers to allow this to happen. The canal was effectively abandoned as a navigation from 1875, and used as a drain for the Somerset levels from 1878.|$|E

A {{decrease}} {{in the distribution of}} 11 C-erlotinib to the <b>major</b> <b>clearance</b> organs liver and kidneys was expected to lead to an increase in plasma concentrations and a concomitant increase in lung exposure. Increase in plasma concentrations has been observed for 11 C-rosuvastatin, as a consequence of decreased hepatic and renal uptake by rifampicin [20]. Interestingly, our results indicated that rifampicin decreased the distribution of erlotinib into the main elimination organs of the body with no or negligible consequences for blood and lung exposure. The lungs contain a high vascular fraction, and the concentration of radioactivity measured with PET in the lungs can therefore be expected to be influenced by the plasma kinetics of 11 C-erlotinib, which did not differ between the control and rifampicin-treated rats.|$|E

Myc is a proto-oncogene often found to be deregulated in many cancers, and thus is an attractive target for design of cancer therapy. Therefore, understanding the relationship between anti-Myc strat-egies and autophagy will be important for development of effective therapy. Here, we show that Myc depletion inhibits autophagosome formation and impairs clearance of autophagy substrates. Myc suppression has an in-hibitory effect on autophagy via reduction of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK 1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl 2) phosphorylation.

First, ANP induced a dose-dependent reduction of ligand-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP accumulation.

PT-catalyzed [32 P]ADP-ribosylation, immunoblots with specific antisera, and Northern blot analysis demonstrated that T 2 cells contain the G-proteins Gi 2 and Gi 3 which could transduce this signal. ANP also promoted PT-insensitive, dose-dependent accumulation of cGMP, consistent with activation of a receptor guanylyl cyclase. Isoproterenol-stimulated phosphatidylcholine secretion was markedly attenuated by ANP, and this effect was inhibited by PT pretreatment, consistent with mediation by a Gi protein(s).

In order to elucidate the biological mechanism for the elongated half-life of rFVIIIFc at a cellular level we delineated the roles of VWF and the tissue-specific expression of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in the biodistribution, clearance and cycling of rFVIIIFc.

VWF reduces the clearance and the initial liver uptake of rFVIIIFc. Pharma-cokinetic studies in FcRn chimeric mice show that FcRn expressed in somatic cells (hepato-cytes or liver sinusoidal endothelial cells) mediates the decreased clearance of rFVIIIFc, but FcRn in hematopoietic cells (Kupffer cells) does not affect clearance. Immunohistochemical studies show that when rFVIII or rFVIIIFc is in dynamic equilibrium binding with VWF, they mostly co localize with VWF in Kupffer cells and macrophages, confirming a major role for liver macrophages in the internalization and clearance of the VWF-FVIII complex.

Worldwide, approximately 15 million babies are born prematurely each year. The critical question which remains is how to identify women destined to deliver preterm from those who will achieve a term delivery. Prostaglandins, in all mammals are important in the parturient process.

We have explored the potential of lentiviral vector-mediated expression of human acid alpha-glucosidase in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in a Pompe mouse model.

40|$|The {{formation}} of toxic protein aggregates {{is a common}} denominator to many neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Accumulation of toxic, possibly infectious protein aggregates induces a cascade of events, such as excessive inflammation, the production of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis and neuronal loss. A network of highly conserved molecular chaperones and of chaperone-related proteases controls the fold-quality of proteins in the cell. Most molecular chaperones can passively prevent protein aggregation by binding misfolding intermediates. Some molecular chaperones and chaperone-related proteases, such as the proteasome, can also hydrolyse ATP to forcefully convert stable harmful protein aggregates into harmless natively refoldable, or protease-degradable, polypeptides. Molecular chaperones and chaperone-related proteases thus control the delicate balance between natively folded functional proteins and aggregation-prone misfolded proteins, which may form during the lifetime and lead to cell death. Abundant data now point at the molecular chaperones and the proteases as <b>major</b> <b>clearance</b> mechanisms to remove toxic protein aggregates from cells, delaying the onset and the outcome of protein-misfolding diseases.

A <b>major</b> A尾 <b>clearance</b> pathway {{in the brain}} is cellular uptake and degradation. However, how A尾 traffics through the endocytic pathway and how AD risk factors regulate this event is unclear. Here we show {{that the majority of}} endocytosed A尾 in neurons traffics through early and late endosomes to the lysosomes for degradation. Overexpression of Rab 5 or Rab 7, small GTPases that function in vesicle fusion for early and late endosomes, respectively, significantly accelerates A尾 endocytic trafficking to the lysosomes. We also found that a portion of endocytosed A尾 traffics through Rab 11 -positive recycling vesicles. A blockage of this A尾 recycling pathway with a constitutively active Rab 11 mutant significantly accelerates cellular A尾 accumulation. Inhibition of lysosomal enzymes results in A尾 accumulation and aggregation. Importantly, apolipoprotein E (apoE) accelerates neuronal A尾 uptake, lysosomal trafficking, and degradation in an isoform-dependent manner with apoE 3 more efficiently facilitating A尾 trafficking and degradation than apoE 4, a risk factor for AD. Taken together, our results demonstrate that A尾 endocytic trafficking to lysosomes for degradation is a <b>major</b> A尾 <b>clearance</b> pathway that is differentially regulated by apoE isoforms.

Therefore, design of long-lived, less immunogenic FVIII {{remains the most}} important goal for future studies {{in the field of}} hemophilia. Here we provide insights into different receptors present on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and their role in uptake of FVIII. Moreover, we show that the C 1 domain contains a major determinant for immune recognition of FVIII by APCs. Follow up studies demonstrate that modification of an exposed loop in the C 1 domain decreases endocytosis of FVIII by human and murine APCs.

40|$|A {{major concern}} in drug {{development}} is the characterization of new molecular entities (NMEs) {{with respect to their}} safety and efficacy. Both factors are determined by the drug’s exposure within the body which itself is affected by drug clearance processes. The <b>major</b> <b>clearance</b> organs are the liver and the kidney, where an interplay of metabolic enzymes and drug transporters mediates the elimination of drugs by metabolism and/or secretion. By that, inhibition of active clearance pathways, as observed from drug-drug interactions (DDIs), can result in alterations in a drug’s exposure. Therefore, the early characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of NMEs is a major goal in preclinical drug development. However, due to lacking human in vivo PK data in this early phase of drug development, in vitro-based methods are commonly used to make a first assessment of the PK profile of NMEs. Consequently, the development, validation, and characterization of these methods is of major importance. Therefore, it was the aim of this work to investigate the prediction of human renal and hepatic drug clearances by in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) models and assess their feasibility to predict the DDI potential of drugs in human. To date, only few IVIVE approaches have been described to predict the human renal organ clearance based on filtration, secretion, and reabsorption. In a first study, we measured in LLC-PK 1 cells the transport of 20 compounds with various physiochemical and PK properties.

This interaction protects mice against intracellular pathogens, including Leishmania major and Leishmania amazonensis. ArtinM induces neutrophils activation, which is known to account for both resistance to pathogens and host tissue injury. Although exacerbated inflammation was not observed in ArtinM-treated animals, assessment of neutrophil responses to ArtinM is required to envisage its possible application to design a novel immunomodulatory agent based on carbohydrate recognition. Herein, we focus on the mechanisms through which neutrophils contribute to ArtinM-induced protection against Leishmania, without exacerbating inflammation. For this purpose, human neutrophils treated with ArtinM and infected with Leishmania major were analyzed together with untreated and uninfected controls, based on their ability to eliminate the parasite, release cytokines, degranulate, produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and change life span. We demonstrate that ArtinM-stimulated neutrophils enhanced L. <b>major</b> <b>clearance</b> and at least duplicated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β) release; otherwise, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) production was reduced by half. Furthermore, ROS production and cell degranulation were augmented. The life span of ArtinM-stimulated neutrophils decreased and they did not form NETs when infected with L. major. We postulate that the enhanced leishmanicidal ability of ArtinM-stimulated neutrophils is due to augmented release of inflammatory cytokines, ROS production, and cell degranulation, whereas host tissue integrity is favored by their shortened life span and the absence of NET formation. Our results reinforce the idea that ArtinM may be considered an appropriate molecular template for the construction of an efficient anti-infective agent...|$|E

In human liver microsome (HLM) samples, 7 - and 8 -hydroxyefavirenz accounted for 22. 5 and 77. 5 % of the overall efavirenz metabolism, respectively. Kinetic, inhibition, and correlation analyses in HLM samples and experiments in expressed cytochrome P 450 show that CYP 2 A 6 is the principal catalyst of efavirenz 7 -hydroxylation. Although CYP 2 B 6 was the main enzyme catalyzing efavirenz 8 -hydroxylation, CYP 2 A 6 also seems to contribute. Both 7 - and 8 -hydroxyefavirenz were further oxidized to novel dihydroxylated metabolite(s) primarily by CYP 2 B 6. These dihydroxylated metabolite(s) were {{not the same as}} 8, 14 -dihydroxyefavirenz, a metabolite that has been suggested to be directly formed via 14 -hydroxylation of 8 -hydroxyefavirenz, because 8, 14 -dihydroxyefavirenz was not detected in vitro when efavirenz, 7 -, or 8 -hydroxyefavirenz were used as substrates. Efavirenz and its {{primary and secondary}} metabolites that were identified in vitro were quantified in plasma samples obtained from subjects taking a single 600 -mg oral dose of efavirenz. 8, 14 -Dihydroxyefavirenz was detected and quantified in these plasma samples, suggesting that the glucuronide or the sulfate of 8 -hydroxyefavirenz might undergo 14 -hydroxylation in vivo. In conclusion, efavirenz metabolism is complex, involving unique and novel secondary metabolism. Although efavirenz 8 -hydroxylation by CYP 2 B 6 remains the <b>major</b> <b>clearance</b> mechanism of efavirenz, CYP 2 A 6 -mediated 7 -hydroxylation (and to some extent 8 -hydroxylation) may also contribute.

The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s. The Old Town became an increasingly dilapidated, overcrowded slum with high mortality rates. Improvements carried out under Lord Provost William Chambers in the 1860s began the transformation of the area into the predominantly Victorian Old Town seen today. More improvements followed in the early 20th century {{as a result of the}} work of Patrick Geddes, but relative economic stagnation during the two world wars and beyond saw the Old Town deteriorate further before <b>major</b> slum <b>clearance</b> in the 1960s and 1970s began to reverse the process. University building developments which transformed the George Square and Potterrow areas proved highly controversial.|$|R
40|$|Heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} mediate multiple {{aspects of}} triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism through non- covalent interactions with several lipases and apolipoproteins. In the circulation, lipoprotein lipase {{bound to the}} luminal side of the microvascular endothelium catalyzes the lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, resulting in lipoprotein remnants. In the liver, remnant lipoproteins are cleared from the circulation by three <b>major</b> endocytic <b>clearance</b> receptors, including the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan- 1. This dissertation describes {{the identification of the}} lipoprotein ligands responsible for heparan sulfate mediated clearance and studies suggesting a role for endothelial heparan sulfate proteoglycans in lipolysis. Chapter 1 provides background information on the structure and function of heparan sulfate, its putative role in lipolysis, and its participation in the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants. The protein components of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that bind to heparan sulfate are described. Chapter 2 provides evidence that led to the identification of the physiologic proteins responsible for lipoprotein binding to hepatic heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Chapter 3 describes studies of several mutant cell lines and mice that suggest a role for endothelial heparan sulfate proteoglycans in lipolysis. Chapter 4 presents on-going and future studies and the relevance of these findings to human diseas...|$|R
