He also hired many former Kodak employees to work at his firm. From these actions, Worden was able to obtain a book containing every secret Kodak <b>manufacturing</b> <b>formula</b> with details of every chemical makeup of film base and coating, a book containing specifications for a $500 million film sensitizing facility, a collection of secret trouble-shooting procedures for the manufacturing of acetate, {{and a collection of}} techniques for inspecting and testing finished film base.|$|E
50|$|Why is {{this concept}} important? Compare how often Coca Cola changes {{the formula for}} Coke with how often the {{packaging}} is changed. If the formula and packaging recipes are linked, then every time the packaging changes, the formula would need modification. Likewise, when the formula is changed, all of the packaging recipes {{would have to be}} changed. This increases maintenance costs and chances for error. In process <b>manufacturing,</b> the <b>formula</b> for making the product and the recipe for packaging the product exist in separate structures to reduce the ongoing maintenance function.|$|R

40|$|DENTAL {{amalgams}} {{constitute a}} {{most important and}} very high proportion of individual tooth restorations. The physical properties of finished amal-gams, upon which the restorations depend for satisfactory service, vary with the alloy <b>formulas,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> methods, mixing procedures, and condensa-tion technics. Previous studies of amalgams have established the effects of many variables and the American Dental Association and Federal Specifications for Dental Amalgams have established performance standards which are generally ac-cepted. In the earlier tentative drafts of these specifications, the physical qualities governed by detailed requirements included setting expansion, flow, and crush-ing strength. In later revisions the crushing strength requirements were eliminated primarily because those amalgams which met the flow requirements also met the crushing strength requirements. Notwithstanding the discontinu-ance of this early and rather low requirement, the crushing strength of amal...|$|R
40|$|Blending {{experiments}} and storage trials {{were carried out}} to assess the feasibility of <b>manufacturing</b> infant <b>formula</b> through dry blending of high fat whey powder (HFWP) with whole milk powder (WMP) or a base powder (BP) made from skim milk, sucrose and corn oil. An indication of cohesiveness {{of the components of}} the blends was obtained by measuring compressibility using an Instron testing machine. Compressibility decreased in the following order: BP, wmp, HFWP, lactose and ascorbic acid. Particle size determination using a laser sizer indicated that the particle size increased in the above sequence. Scanning electron microscopy revealed no evidence of an ordered mixture for either whey powder with milk powder or the powders mixed with ascorbic acid. The mixtures did not exhibit complete randomness and segregation. They are thus termed 'pseudorandom mixtures'. HFWP was blended with WMP or BP to achieve a target ratio 50 : 50 in both an experimental ribbon blender and a pilot ribbon blender. Using Response Surface Methodology, load ratio and mixing time but not rotation speed were found to have significant effects on the homogeneity with the experimental ribbon blender. At load ratio 0. 4, the time for reaching a certain homogeneity was shorter than that at load ratio 0. 8. The cohesiveness of BP impaired its mixing. A mixing index based on a satisfactory sample standard deviation has an acceptable value of 1. Both powder ratio scores and ascorbic acid level could be mixed below a MI of 1. 5 but above 1. As to protein, fat, carbohydrate, the mixtures reached the acceptable MI. The secondary nutritional requirements such as the ratio of whey protein to casein and the ratio of unsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid were above 1 when the powder ratio MIs were higher than 1. After mixing WMP and HFWP for 10 minutes differences of sensory quality could not be detected by the taste panelists even though the MI was still above 1. Unblended and blended samples of WMP and HFWP were tested through a 180 day storage trial at 20 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C. There {{was no significant difference between}} unblended and blended samples on the criteria of TBA, PV, HMF, oxidised flavour and caramel flavour at the 5 % probability level. Using the Arrhenius approach, at 20 °C, the shelf lives of unblended and blended samples were estimated as 1628 days and 1090 days respectively, with an oxidised flavour limit of 3. 5 out of 7 points. The shelf lives were 480 days and 466 days based on a PV limit of 2 milliequivalents O 2 per kg fat. Dry blending is a feasible technique for <b>manufacturing</b> infant <b>formula,</b> with acceptable homogeneity of the main components of the blended samples and with normal storage stability. The cohesiveness of the components and the design of blender are important factors in improving homogeneity. Further trials are recommended in both experimental and commercial plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{marketing}} of infant feeding products {{is almost impossible}} as the infant nutrition industry is highly regulated. Despite operating under strict regulations, the infant <b>formula</b> <b>manufacturing</b> companies still generate high revenues on an annual basis. The infant <b>formula</b> <b>manufacturing</b> industry operates under a value chain {{which can be broken}} down into six sequential steps. These steps are: (1) Translational science; (2) Product development; (3) Clinical research; (4) Product notification; (5) Reimbursement granting and (6) Product marketing. Medical nutrition companies aspire to understand product requirements of healthcare professionals and medical representatives. This is to enable direct investment to acquire market share without wasting resources. The medical nutrition industry currently makes use of medical representatives to execute product marketing. Manufacturing companies invest a lot of money into developing their products, employing and training medical representatives and trust that this will be enough to persuade healthcare professionals to recommend their products to parents. This study analyses the main contributing factors that enhance prescription of specialised infant formula by healthcare professionals. This study was conducted in a positivistic paradigm by making use of a quantitative approach. Healthcare professionals from Port Elizabeth, working with paediatric patients were included in this study. The healthcare professionals were chosen by a convenience sampling method and were then interviewed. The empirical interview results were substantiated with the interpretive findings which were in the form of verbatim statements extracted directly from the research questionnaire. Linkage between the dependable variable (prescription) and independent variables (manufacturing company; product composition; cost of product; medical representative and peers) were established and analysed. The research revealed that prescription behaviour is an important construct which can be measured in medical practices. Prescription behaviour is correlated with positive business and medical outcomes and manufacturing companies are able to exert influence over it through the identified variables. Of these variables, efficacy of vii a product, trusted manufacturing company and the medical representatives were found to have direct and significant effects. Healthcare professionals tend to prescribe a specialised infant formula if they have seen results and trust the outcome of the product. It is advisable for manufacturing companies to exert great effort before appointing a medical representative, {{to make sure that the}} right candidate represents the face of the company...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that breastfeeding is the best food for newborns. Mother’s milk provides all the nutritive elements for normal growth and development of infants being considered the first functional food in life. Because it contains a variety of compounds playing {{a key role in}} the adequate feeding of newborns, such as oligosaccharides, probiotics, polyunsaturated fatty acids and lactoferrin. Lactoferrin from human milk has been demonstrated to be responsible for the resistance of newborns to infections and also has many biological activities that are essential for an adequate health of infants. Recently, there is also a growing interest in the potential use of lactoferrin for the improvement of bone health and cancer prevention. Milk substitutes and infant formulas play a vital role in infant nutrition when the breastfeeding is not available. The design of infant formula is modeled on the composition of human milk and the current trend in the infant <b>formulas</b> <b>manufacturing</b> is looking to provide not only nutritional compounds but also similar functional effects than human milk...|$|R
40|$|Trophic {{homeostasis}} {{together with}} oxygen provision {{is known to}} {{form the basis for}} the body’s vital activity and a prerequisite to the elimination of many abnormalities [1]. Support of trophic homeostasis along with its intrinsic factor is determined not only by the capabilities and reality of providing an organism with essential nutrients, but also by the relevant conditions for their effective assimilation, particularly {{in the presence of a}} severely progressive pathological process [1, 2]. The last decades of the 20 th century were marked by the rapid development of clinical nutrition science, giving rise to the whole industry of <b>manufacturing</b> various <b>formulas</b> for both the parenteral and enteral feedings of patients (the injured). Due to the fact that there is a great variety of feeding formulas (FFs), we have now a right to tell not only about the adequate substrate provision of patients in all directions, but also about the fact that we can perform differential nutritive metabolic therapy for an existing pathological condition. At present we have a good chance of implementing the qualitative nutritive support (NS) for any category of patients. At the same time, it should be noted that recently physicians of different specialties in our country are much better aware of the importance and necessity of timely using active NS in seriously ill patients (victims) [1 — 3]. This paper presents the comparative characteristics of the most popular and Russia’s registered balanced polymer FFs. All information on the properties of the products has been taken from either their original package, or the advertising matters distributed by this or that manufacturer. The key properties of FFs, such as chemical composition, osmolarity, formulations, and package, have been compared. hypermetabolism; feeding formulas; composition; osmolarity; choice</p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of processing on polyamines and peptide release after the digestion of a commercial infant formula designed for children during {{the first months of}} life. Polyamine oxidase activity was not suppressed during the manufacturing process, which implicates that polyamine concentrations were reduced over time and during infant formula self-life. In gel electrophoresis, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of samples with reduced amount of enzymes and time of digestion shows an increase in protein digestibility, reflected in the increase in nonprotein nitrogen after digestion and the disappearance of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin bands in gel electrophoresis. Depending on the sample, between 22 and 87 peptides were identified after gastrointestinal digestion. A peptide from β-casein f(98 - 105) with the sequence VKEAMAPK and antioxidant activity appeared in all of the samples. Other peptides with antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial activities were frequently found, which could have an effect on infant health. The present study confirms that the infant <b>formula</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process determines the polyamine content and peptidic profile after digestion of the infant formula. Because compositional dissimilarity between human milk and infant formula in polyamines and proteins could be responsible for some of the differences in health reported between breast-fed and formula-fed children, these changes must be taken into consideration because they may have a great effect on infant nutrition and development.

40|$|Alleen digitaal verschenen Niet beschikbaar Adequate methods {{with known}} {{performance}} characteristics {{used for the}} assessment of the amount of nutrients in formula are essential in the evaluation whether the composition deviates from the legal amounts. Many standardised analytical methods for the analysis of nutrients in formula are internationally available. Currently, EU regulation regarding formula (commission directive 2006 / 141 /EC) does not provide any indication on reference methods to be used in official controls for the analysis of vitamins, choline and inositol in formula. Therefore, an overview of the available standardised methods of analysis for the measurement of vitamins, inositol and choline in infant and follow-on formula is provided. 89 standardised analytical methods from both national and international organizations developing standard analytical methods have been collected and their performance characteristics (i. e. analytical technique, target compound, matrixes validated, LOD, LOQ, analytical range, repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy/spike recovery) are described. For most nutrients studied, several standardised analytical methods are available, with a maximum of 12 for vitamin A. Especially for water-soluble vitamins some current standardised methods are more than 25 years old. However, methods of analysis based on more modern analytical technologies have been developed in the recent decades. 11 new official AOAC methods for the analysis of Vitamin A, D, E, B 12, Folic acid and based on more advanced techniques have been adopted as First Action method in 2011 and new AOAC official methods of analysis are expected to be approved in the near future for other nutrients. For several nutrients the overall activity is the sum of the activities of several forms of the compound. However, it is important to notice that the analytical methods available may not always measure the overall activity but only a limited proportion based on specific forms of the compound. In the EU legislation the compound forms that may be used in the <b>manufacturing</b> of <b>formula</b> are listed, however, it does not provide unambiguous specification about the forms of the vitamin to be assessed. Moreover, the minimum and maximum values are provided per energy content, logic from a nutritional point of view. This means that both the uncertainty in the energy calculation and the uncertainty in the measurement of the target nutrient contribute to the total uncertainty in the assessment of the nutrient content when this is provided per energy content. The existence of many different available methods with different performance characteristics and possibly different target forms of the nutrients is identified as a serious gap in the current harmonisation status. In absence of relevant European Union rules, the choice of the best method of analysis for each of the target nutrients in formula should be based on several factors, such as the capacity of the method to assess all the forms of the vitamin that are nutritionally relevant in formula and the analytical performances of the method (i. e. accuracy/spike recovery, reproducibility, lower and upper limit of quantification). As CODEX is the most internationally recognized organization publishing standardised analytical methods, the methods of analysis recommended by CODEX might, although arbitrarily chosen, be taken as guidance for the choice. <br...|$|R
