Producing the film with an initial budget of $60,000, Aronofsky premiered Pi at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, where he won the Best Director award.

500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the {{economic}} disruption {{caused by the}} Napoleonic Wars caused United States gold coins to be worth more as bullion than as <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> vanished from circulation. Governmental response to this shortage was hampered {{by the fact that}} officials did not clearly understand what had happened. In 1830, Treasury Secretary Samuel D. Ingham proposed adjusting the ratio between gold and silver in US currency to 15.8:1, which had for some time been the ratio in Europe. It was not until 1834 that Congress acted, changing the gold/silver ratio to 16.002:1. This was close enough to the market value to make it uneconomic to export either US gold or silver coins. When silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to the California Gold Rush, silver coinage was worth more than face value, and rapidly flowed overseas for melting. Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative (and future president) Andrew Johnson, the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853. [...] Silver was now undervalued at the Mint; accordingly little was presented for striking into money.|$|E

Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E
500|$|The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza {{tour with}} Metallica, who {{had insisted on}} Soundgarden's {{appearance}} on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: [...] "We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> expect you {{to come out and}} play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] At the tour's last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction." [...] Cameron later said that Soundgarden was [...] "eaten up by the business". The band released a greatest hits collection entitled A-Sides on November 4, 1997, composed of 17 songs, including the previously-unreleased [...] "Bleed Together," [...] which had been recorded during the Down on the Upside recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|The first parody {{recorded}} for {{the album was}} [...] "Cavity Search", a parody of U2's hit [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me". The song, which recounts the horror of {{having to go to}} the dentist, features the sound of an actual dental drill. To enhance the dental theme of the song, Yankovic called in his actual dentist, who brought a real drill and a human tooth, which the two took turns drilling while recording to create a genuine sound effect. The second parody was a pastiche of TLC's hit [...] "Waterfalls" [...] called [...] "Phony Calls", about prank calls. During the bridge, a clip from The Simpsons second season episode [...] "Blood Feud" [...] is played on top of the music. Because the sound clip was from a preexisting episode, Yankovic noted that [...] "it was a pretty sweet deal for the Simpsons' voice actors – they each got a nice pile of <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> didn't even have to come to the studio!" [...] The next parody {{recorded for}} the album was [...] "Gump", a parody of [...] "Lump" [...] by The Presidents of the United States of America. The song recounts the basic plot to the 1994 film Forrest Gump about a naïve and slow-witted yet athletically prodigious native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of {{the latter half of the}} 20th century in the United States. [...] "Gump" [...] was released as the second single from the album, and received a video.|$|E

500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} plugger James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite clear that we couldn't bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's <b>money.</b> <b>And</b> <b>they</b> were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E

His group Hootie and the Blowfish's 1995 hit single [...] "Only Wanna Be With You" [...] quotes an entire verse from Dylan's 1975 song [...] "Idiot Wind". When the record began selling big, the [...] "Dylan camp" [...] took issue, and Dylan was ultimately credited as a co-writer.

2500|$|In May 2014, Spirit bassist Mark Andes and a trust {{acting on}} behalf of California filed a {{copyright}} infringement suit against Led Zeppelin and injunction against the [...] "release of the album containing the song" [...] in an attempt to obtain a writing credit for California, who died in 1997. A lack of resources was cited as {{one of the reasons that}} Spirit did not file the suit earlier; according to a friend of California's mother, [...] "Nobody had any <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> thought the statute of limitations was done ... It will be nice if Randy got the credit." [...] If the Spirit lawsuit had been successful, past earnings due to the song—estimated at more than US$550 million—would not have been part of the settlement, but the publisher and composers may have been entitled to a share of future profits.|$|E

[...] Lake, though, was installed as the Apostolic minister in Indianapolis, and Bosworth seems to have decided to move on in search of a leadership position.
