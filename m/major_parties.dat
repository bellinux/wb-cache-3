5|$|As in {{many other}} African societies, prebendalism and high rates of {{corruption}} continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> have practised vote rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to corruption since independence.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Left Alliance's loss of seats, its {{chairman}} Paavo Arhinmäki was still reasonably {{satisfied with the}} party's performance in the election, due to his claims that the media had concentrated on the four <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> during the campaign. However, Arhinmäki got the most personal votes in his electoral district of Helsinki. The Left Alliance's support was highest in Lapland with 16.7% of the votes and lowest in Southern Savonia with 2.2%.|$|E

5000|$|Whether {{or not a}} party {{counts as}} a <b>major</b> <b>party</b> is a {{sometimes}} heated argument, since [...] "major parties" [...] as defined by Ofcom are entitled to more party political broadcasts than minor ones. Because of the regionalist nature of many parties, it's possible to be a <b>major</b> <b>party</b> {{in one part of}} the country and not another: for example, UKIP is officially a <b>major</b> <b>party</b> in England and Wales, but a minor one in Scotland. No mainland British party is classed as a <b>major</b> <b>party</b> in Northern Ireland.|$|R

5|$|In 1939 Keynes had {{the option}} to enter Parliament as an {{independent}} MP with the University of Cambridge seat. A by-election for the seat was to be held due to the illness of an elderly Tory, and the master of Magdalene College had obtained agreement {{that none of the}} <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> would field a candidate if Keynes chose to stand. Keynes declined the invitation as he felt he would wield greater influence on events if he remained a free agent.|$|E

He focused on gaining enough support to win {{a place in the}} League of Women Voters-sponsored presidential debates.|$|E
5|$|Since {{before the}} Civil War, the two <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> were the Republicans and the Democrats, {{and after the}} end of the Reconstruction Era in 1877, the {{national}} electorate was closely divided between them. Party membership was only partly based on ideology; party identification often reflected ethnic and religious background, as well as Civil War loyalties that were still keenly felt by many voters. Most Northern Protestants voted Republican, as did black Southerners. On the other hand, white Southerners and Northern Catholics generally voted Democratic.|$|E
5000|$|Independents {{may hold}} a centrist {{viewpoint}} between those of <b>major</b> political <b>parties.</b> Sometimes they hold a viewpoint more extreme than any <b>major</b> <b>party,</b> have an ideology comprising ideas {{from both sides}} of the political spectrum, or may have a viewpoint based on issues that they do not feel that any <b>major</b> <b>party</b> addresses.|$|R

5|$|The United States has {{operated}} under a two-party system {{for most of}} its history. For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.|$|E
5|$|Alliance members {{gathered}} that December in Ocala, Florida, and formulated a platform, {{later called}} the Ocala Demands, {{that called for}} looser money, government control of the railroads, a graduated income tax, and the direct election of senators. Weaver endorsed the message in the Tribune and corresponded with the group's leader, LeonidasL. Polk. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for {{a break from the}} two <b>major</b> <b>parties,</b> and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E
5|$|As {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{presided over}} the state Senate. Members of both <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> praised Collins for her impartiality and knowledge of parliamentary procedure in this role. She was twice called upon to break tie votes in the Senate, once on a bill allowing the state's teachers to engage in collective bargaining and another on a bill to allow branch banking across county lines within the state; in both instances she voted in the negative, killing the bill. During her tenure, she also chaired the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors, becoming {{the first woman to}} hold that position. In 1982, she was named to the board of regents of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.|$|E
5000|$|Under state law, the American Constitution Party's vote {{share in}} the 2010 gubernatorial {{election}} elevated the party from minor to <b>major</b> <b>party</b> status. Any party that earns 10% {{or more of the}} votes cast for governor is a [...] "major party." [...] <b>Major</b> <b>party</b> status gives the party a place at or {{near the top of the}} ballot in the 2014 gubernatorial election. However, because of the additional organizational, financial, and compliance requirements triggered by <b>major</b> <b>party</b> status, ACP leaders have been ambivalent about the change.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Agnew's legacy was {{perceived}} largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most of the running mates selected by the <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> after 1972 were seasoned politicians – Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Dick Cheney – some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009 the SNP {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} hold a referendum on independence in November 2010. Opposition from all other <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> led to an expected defeat. After the 2011 elections gave the SNP an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, a referendum on independence for Scotland was held on 18 September 2014. The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%. During the campaign, the three main parties in the UK Parliament pledged to extend {{the powers of the}} Scottish Parliament. An all-party commission chaired by Lord Smith of Kelvin was formed, which led to a further devolution of powers through the Scotland Act 2016.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese {{immigration}} entered the race. Both <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages. On October 20, however, a Democratic newspaper published a letter, purportedly from Garfield {{to a group of}} businessmen, pledging to keep immigration at the current levels so that industry could keep workers' wages low. Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon. Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East, but it likely weakened him in the West.|$|E

5|$|Of the Northern states, Harrison {{lost only}} Illinois and New Hampshire; {{he won his}} home state of Ohio, and also his home county (Hamilton). Voters in the Kentucky {{district}} Johnson once represented in the House of Representatives had backed Van Buren by 1,600 votes in 1836, but favored Harrison by 251 votes in 1840. Both <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> saw an increase in vote, in part because 51 percent more people voted in 1840 than in 1836. The Democrats alleged that Harrison had won the popular vote with bribed and ineligible voters; the Whigs responded by accusing their rivals of being unwilling to accept the will of the people.|$|E
5|$|The Kirk {{that had}} been {{established}} at the Reformation, had been largely united since the Declaration of the Covenant in 1638. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar, it became divided, partly {{in the search for}} scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> as Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} {{of the welfare state}} was by 1957 accepted by both <b>major</b> <b>parties.</b> Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with the}} cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E

5|$|The main Whig contenders in 1848 were Clay again, and two {{war hero}} generals with little {{political}} experience, Winfield Scott and Zachary Taylor. Seward supported the nominee, General Taylor. The former governor was less {{enthusiastic about the}} vice-presidential candidate, New York Comptroller Millard Fillmore, a rival of his from Buffalo. Nevertheless, he campaigned widely for the Whigs against the Democratic presidential candidate, former Michigan senator Lewis Cass. The two <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> did not make slavery {{an issue in the}} campaign. The Free Soil Party, mostly Liberty Party members and some Northern Democrats, nominated former president Van Buren. The Taylor/Fillmore ticket was elected, and the split in the New York Democratic Party allowed the Whigs to capture the legislature.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} of the Agreement (formally {{referred to as the}} Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.|$|E
5|$|After the {{execution}} of the King in January 1649, England was declared a commonwealth and the Scots declared his son king as Charles II. The English responded with an invasion and, after defeats for the Scots at Dunbar in 1650 and Worcester in 1651, the English occupied the country in 1652, declaring Scotland part of the Commonwealth. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar the Kirk became deeply divided, partly in the search for scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> as the Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and the more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations.
