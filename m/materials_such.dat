5|$|Rammed {{earth is}} a {{technique}} for building walls using natural raw <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as earth, chalk, lime or gravel.|$|E
5|$|The Past wall is {{designed}} by Taiwanese artist Tsai Ken. He stacked traditional building <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as bricks, tiles, stones, wood, and bamboo {{to present the}} Hakka culture of the building.|$|E
5|$|Although shoe polish is {{primarily}} intended for leather shoes, some brands specify {{that they may}} be used on non-porous <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> as vinyl. The polish is generally the same colour as the shoes it will be used upon, or it may be neutral, lacking any intrinsic colour.|$|E
50|$|A palliasse or tick {{is a large}} bag made of strong, stiff <b>material</b> <b>such</b> as canvas, linen or sackcloth. This is then {{filled with}} <b>material</b> <b>such</b> as straw, horsehair, wool or {{feathers}} to make a mattress.|$|R
50|$|Hybrid {{libraries}} are mixes {{of traditional}} print <b>material</b> <b>such</b> as books and magazines, {{as well as}} electronic based <b>material</b> <b>such</b> as downloadable audiobooks, electronic journals, e-books, etc. Hybrid libraries are the new norm in most public and academic libraries.|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} goal of Python's developers {{is making it}} fun to use. This {{is reflected in the}} origin of the name, which comes from Monty Python, and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> as using examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.|$|E
5|$|As aforementioned, {{while its}} exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often {{believed}} to be a dish created by slaves, made from slave owners’ unwanted food <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> as animal innards or fatty cuts. African-American slaves often exchanged or combined ingredients {{in order to make the}} dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community and identity among them.|$|E
5|$|Austrian and Czech foreign {{exchange}} reserves were soon seized by the Nazis, as were stockpiles of raw <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as metals and completed goods such as weaponry and aircraft, which were shipped back to Germany. The Reichswerke Hermann Göring industrial conglomerate took control of steel and coal production facilities in both countries.|$|E

5|$|Changes that predate {{magnetic}} observatories {{are recorded}} in archaeological and geological <b>materials.</b> <b>Such</b> changes {{are referred to}} as paleomagnetic secular variation or paleosecular variation (PSV). The records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting geomagnetic excursions and reversals.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{hardness}} {{depends on}} its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the <111> direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice). Therefore, whereas {{it might be possible}} to scratch some diamonds with other <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> as boron nitride, the hardest diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of <b>materials.</b> <b>Such</b> probes include effects of electric and magnetic fields, measuring response functions, transport properties and thermometry. Commonly used experimental methods include spectroscopy, with probes such as X-rays, infrared light and inelastic neutron scattering; study of thermal response, such as specific heat and measuring transport via thermal and heat conduction.|$|E

5|$|For {{adventitious}} protection, {{an animal}} uses <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as twigs, sand, or pieces of shell to conceal its outline, for example when a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case, {{or when a}} decorator crab decorates its back with seaweed, sponges and stones.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{work was}} {{influenced}} by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. He considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He also introduced new techniques {{in the treatment of}} <b>materials,</b> <b>such</b> as trencadís which used waste ceramic pieces.|$|E
5|$|Ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, are {{primarily}} composed of low-boiling-point <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as water, methane, and ammonia, with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).|$|E

50|$|The test is a {{skeletal}} structure, made of hard <b>material</b> <b>such</b> as calcium carbonate, silica, chitin or composite <b>materials.</b> As <b>such,</b> {{it allows}} {{the protection of the}} internal organs and the attachment of soft flesh.|$|R
5|$|In some colonial polyps, a chitinous {{periderm}} gives {{support and}} some protection to the connecting sections {{and to the}} lower parts of individual polyps. Stony corals secrete massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons. A few polyps collect <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with sediment particles.|$|E
5|$|More recently, 87Sr/86Sr ratios {{have also}} been used to {{determine}} the source of ancient archaeological <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as timbers and corn in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. 87Sr/86Sr ratios in teeth may also be used to track animal migrations.|$|E
5|$|Mouthpieces are {{generally}} made of hard rubber, although some inexpensive mouthpieces {{may be made}} of plastic. Other <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as crystal/glass, wood, ivory, and metal have also been used. Ligatures are often made of metal and plated in nickel, silver, or gold. Other materials include wire, wire mesh, plastic, naugahyde, string, or leather.|$|E

5|$|Nuskhuri, like Asomtavruli, is {{also often}} highly stylized. Writers readily formed {{ligatures}} and abbreviations for nomina sacra, including diacritics called karagma, which resemble titla. Because writing <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as vellum were scarce and therefore precious, abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in manuscripts and hagiography by the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} major volcanoes in Washington, only Glacier Peak and Mount St. Helens have had large eruptions {{in the past}} 15,000 years. Since both volcanoes {{generate}} magma of dacitic origin, the viscous magma builds up since it cannot flow through the eruptive vent. Gradually, the pressure grows, culminating in an explosion that ejects <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as tephra, which in its simplest form, is ash.|$|E
5|$|Polyphenols {{of several}} classes are {{widespread}} in medicinal plants; these substances likely fight infection and reduce grazing by herbivorous insects. They include hormone-mimicking phytoestrogens, and astringent tannins. In Ayurveda, the astringent rind of the pomegranate {{is used as}} a medicine, while polyphenol extracts from plant <b>materials</b> <b>such</b> as grape seeds are sold for their potential health benefits despite the lack of evidence.|$|E
