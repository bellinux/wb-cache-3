These studies range {{all the way from}} lipid monolayers at the air-water interface to the regions of membrane-membrane contact that are important in immunology. An important contribution was the introduction of supported lipid bilayers to mimic cell surfaces. For example, this system was used to <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> presentation whereby a specific molecule of the major histocompatibility complex is incorporated into the bilayer, a specific antigenic peptide is added, and the combined system used to stimulate a specific T - helper cell.|$|E
40|$|Anti-idiotypic {{antibodies}} {{have been}} used to <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> in the mouse antiphosphorylcholine response in order to investigate the induction of precursors of antibody-forming cells. We have shown that interaction of anti-idiotype antibody with receptor antibody molecules induces the formation of antibodies that are specific for phosphorylcholine and carry the idiotypic determinants. This induction is dependent on the recognition of carrier determinants on the anti-idiotype antibody by helper T cells. We conclude that receptor antibody molecules {{on the surface of the}} precursors of antibody-forming cells deliver the antigenic signal for the induction of these cells...|$|E

Here, {{we show that}} HIV- 1 virions transmitted in trans from in vitro derived DCs to T cells principally originate {{from the surface of}} DCs. Selective neutralization of surface-bound virions abrogated trans-infection by monocyte-derived DCs and CD 34 -derived Langerhans cells. Under conditions <b>mimicking</b> <b>antigen</b> recognition by the interacting T cells, most transferred virions still derived from the cell surface, although a few were transferred from an internal compartment.

40|$|The use of nucleic acid-based {{vaccines}} {{is a novel}} {{approach to}} immunization that elicits immune responses similar to those induced by live, attenuated vaccines. Administration of nucleic acid vaccines results in the endogenous generation of viral proteins with native conformation, glycosylation profiles, and other posttranslational modifications that <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> produced during natural viral infection. Nucleic acid vaccines {{have been shown to}} elicit both antibody and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses to diverse protein antigens. Advantages of nucleic acid-based vaccines include the simplicity of the vector, the ease of delivery, the duration of expression, and, to date, the lack of evidence of integration. Further studies are needed to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this new and promising technology...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies {{directed}} against the T-cell antigen receptor-T 3 complex <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> and lead to cellular changes consistent with activation. When cells of the human T-cell line Jurkat were stimulated with a monoclonal antibody {{directed against}} T 3, inositol phosphates were produced. In addition to inositol trisphosphate, which {{is the product of}} phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate cleavage, a second inositol polyphosphate was formed. This compound was more polar than inositol trisphosphate but less polar than inositol pentakisphosphate. It cochromatographed with inositol tetrakisphosphate from ostrich erythrocytes. In permeabilized Jurkat cells, this compound was shown to be formed from inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate, but only in the presence of ATP, and 32 P was incorporated into it from [gamma- 32 P]ATP. There also was coincident formation of inositol 1, 3, 4 -trisphosphate. We conclude that the more polar compound is inositol tetrakisphosphate, which is formed by phosphorylation of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate and may be the precursor of inositol 1, 3, 4 -trisphosphate...|$|E
40|$|One {{concept for}} immune therapy of cancer {{involves}} induction of antigen mimic antibodies {{to trigger the}} immune response against tumor cells. Anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against the antigen-binding site of antibodies specific for tumor antigen may functionally and even structurally <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> and induce anti-anti-idiotypic immune response. Monoclonal antibody WJ 02 is one of such anti-idiotypic antibodies, which contains internal image of CA 125. In order to improve the immunospecificity of mAb WJ 02, we constructed a single chain of mAb WJ 02 in Vl-linker-Vh orientation. The scFv-WJ 02 could be expressed and secreted in the recombinant Pichia pastoris system. The secreted scFv protein with a molecular weight of 30 kD retained the biological activity of mAb WJ 02, which was proved by a direct binding assay and inhibition experiment. Our {{results indicated that the}} scFv-WJ 02 {{could be used as a}} possible tool for idiotypic therapy against ovarian cancer, which might enhance the possibility of eliminating nonspecific responses induced by mAb WJ 02.

40|$|We have {{developed}} {{a new model of}} autoimmune arthritis in DBA/ 1 mice by feeding chick type II collagen (CII) for 2 - 3 week intervals over a 15 week period. Clinically evident arthritis occurred in 8 / 10 mice receiving native CII (nCII; 100 /ig/mouse) alone at 9 - 13 weeks. Arthritis was aggravated by the further ingestion of CII, while remission occurred after withdrawal of the CII. Heat-denatured CII (dCII; 200 /*g/mouse) was also arthritogenic if co-administered with ovoinhibitor (OVI; 2 mg/mouse), a proteinase inhibitor. Co-oral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 /ig/mouse) with CII enhanced the antibody production and T-cell responses to CII, and induced a more chronic arthritis that progressed spontaneously without further administration of CII or LPS. Long-term oral administration of LPS alone also induced a mild arthritis characterized by destruction of bone rather than cartilage. These observations suggest that abnormal gastrointestinal absorption of dietary <b>mimic</b> <b>antigens</b> and intestinal bacterial toxins can potentially disrupt self-tolerance mechanisms, thereby precipitating or exacerbating autoimmune disease in genetically susceptible individuals...|$|R
40|$|The immune {{response}} {{is thought to}} be regulated by a delicate balance of idiotypic-antiidiotypic interactions (1). Introduction of antigen leads to clonal expansion of idiotypic B cells that secrete antibodies. These antibodies in turn stimulate an antiidiotypic {{immune response}} that may suppress the initial idiotypic B cell response. The antiidiotypic antibody may <b>mimic</b> the <b>antigen</b> and thus (even in a naive host) initiate an antigen-specific (idiotypic) B cell response (2, 3). I...|$|R

Here, we introduce nanopatterned <b>antigen</b> arrays that <b>mimic</b> the <b>antigen</b> presenting cell surface during T cell activation. The assessment of activation related events revealed the requirement of a minimal density of 90 - 140 stimulating major histocompatibility complex class II proteins (pMHC) molecules per μm(2).

40|$|To {{determine}} whether culturing {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} at atmospheric oxygen levels skews responses {{in comparison with}} culturing lymphocytes at physiologic oxygen levels, we cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 5 %, 10 %, and atmospheric (20 %) gas-phase oxygen for 5 days. We found that incubator oxygen levels influenced lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by two commonly used stimuli: Con A and antibodies that crosslink surface CD 3 and CD 28 to <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> presentation. In both cases, proliferation increased as gas-phase oxygen levels increased. In contrast, oxygen levels did not influence proliferation stimulated by phytohemagglutinin, another commonly used mitogen. Similarly, oxygen levels did not impact cell viability in unstimulated cultures. Thus, we conclude that the influence of oxygen levels on proliferation depends on the stimulus, and, most importantly from the standpoint of immune responses, culturing cells at atmospheric rather than physiologic oxygen levels results in significantly increased proliferation responses to the CD 3 /CD 28 crosslinking, a proliferation stimulus commonly used to mimic T cell antigen receptor signaling...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} human T cell leukemias were compared, using antiidiotype- like murine monoclonal antibodies. In {{each case}} these antibodies immunoprecipitated disulfide-linked heterodimer molecules from their respective leukemic cells. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) {{analysis of the}} two idiotype-bearing molecules a major difference in molecular weight was observed, which {{could be attributed to}} a similar difference in size of the heavily iodinated chain of either heterodimer. The lightly iodinated chains of both molecules co-migrated at 43 Kd, but appeared to have different isoelectric points on two-dimensional gel analysis. The possibility that these two different heterodimers correspond to different classes of the putative T cell receptor for antigen is discussed. Assays of proliferation of the leukemic cells using Sepharose-bound antiidiotype- like monoclonal antibody showed that one of the leukemic cell types proliferated readily in response to its antiidiotypic antibody. This proliferation was not associated with measurable production of IL- 2 and appeared to be a direct effect of the antiidiotypic antibody, which may <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> in its interaction with the T cell receptor for antigen. The other leukemic cell type did not respond to Sepharose-bound antiidiotypic antibody and was generally unresponsive to lymphokines and mitogens. It is possible that the two leukemic cell types represent different stages of T cell differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene in T {{cells is}} {{activated}} by {{the combination of}} phorbol ester (phorbol myristate acetate) and calcium ionophore (A 23187), which <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> stimulation through the T-cell receptor. We have previously shown that a fragment containing bp - 95 to + 27 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter can confer inducibility to reporter genes in the human Jurkat T-cell line. Here we use an in vitro transcription system to demonstrate that a cis-acting element (positions - 54 to - 40), referred to as CLE 0, is a target for the induction signals. We observed induction with templates containing intact CLE 0 but not with templates with deleted or mutated CLE 0. We also observed that two distinct signals were required for the stimulation through CLE 0, since only extracts from cells treated with both phorbol myristate acetate and A 23187 supported optimal induction. Stimulation probably was mediated by CLE 0 -binding proteins because depletion of these proteins specifically reduced GM-CSF transcription. One of the binding factors possessed biochemical and immunological features identical {{to those of the}} transcription factor AP 1. Another factor resembled the T-cell-specific factor NFAT. The characteristics of these two factors are consistent with their involvement in GM-CSF induction. The presence of CLE 0 -like elements in the promoters of interleukin- 3 (IL- 3), IL- 4, IL- 5, GM-CSF, and NFAT sites in the IL- 2 promoter suggests that the factors we detected, or related factors that recognize these sites, may account for the coordinate induction of these genes during T-cell activation...|$|E
50|$|As on T cells, several surface {{molecules}} {{form the}} antigen receptor {{and form a}} complex on B lymphocytes. The (almost) B cell-specific CD19 phosphoglycoprotein {{is one of these}} molecules. The others are CD21 and CD81. These surface immunoglobulin (sIg)-associated molecules facilitate signal transduction. On B cells, anti-immunoglobulin antibody <b>mimicking</b> exogenous <b>antigen</b> causes CD19 to bind to sIg and internalize with it. The reverse process has not been demonstrated, suggesting that formation of this receptor complex is antigen-induced. This molecular association has been confirmed by chemical studies.|$|R
40|$|Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) {{responsiveness}} of T lymphocytes {{is controlled}} through transcription of the IL- 2 receptor (IL- 2 R) α subunit by antigen and by IL- 2 itself. IL- 2 induces IL- 2 Rα transcription via an IL- 2 -responsive enhancer (IL- 2 rE), whose activity {{depends on the}} cooperative binding of IL- 2 -induced STAT 5 to two sites and of constitutively active Elf- 1 to a third one. Here we describe the changes in IL- 2 rE chromatin that occur in normal T lymphocytes upon activation of IL- 2 Rα expression. In cells induced to transiently express IL- 2 Rα with concanavalin A (which <b>mimics</b> <b>antigen),</b> none of the IL- 2 rE sites is occupied {{despite the presence of}} Elf- 1 and STAT 1, which bind to the IL- 2 rE in vitro. The two STAT binding sites are occupied rapidly upon IL- 2 stimulation, concomitantly with STAT 5 activation. Occupation of the Elf- 1 binding site is delayed, although Elf- 1 concentration and binding activity are not modified by IL- 2. Digestion of T-cell chromatin with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease shows that IL- 2 induces the appearance of nuclease-hypersensitive sites flanking the IL- 2 rE. Thus IL- 2, in addition to activating STAT 5, appears to regulate IL- 2 Rα transcription by making IL- 2 Rα chromatin accessible to transcription factors...|$|R
40|$|Mimicry of host antigens by {{infectious}} agents {{may induce}} cross-reactive autoimmune responses to epitopes within host proteins which, in susceptible individuals, may {{tip the balance}} of immunological response versus tolerance toward response and subsequently lead to autoimmune disease. Epitope mimicry may indeed {{be involved in the}} pathogenesis of several diseases such as post-viral myocarditis or Chagas disease, but for many other diseases in which it has been implicated, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitis or rheumatoid arthritis, convincing evidence is still lacking. Even if an epitope mimic can support a cross-reactive T or B cell response in vitro, its ability to induce an autoimmune disease in vivo will depend upon the appropriate presentation of the <b>mimicked</b> host <b>antigen</b> in the target tissue and, in the case of T cell mimics, the ability of the mimicking epitope to induce a proliferative rather than anergizing response upon engagement of the MHC-peptide complex with the T cell receptor. B cell presentation of <b>mimicking</b> foreign <b>antigen</b> to T cells is a possible mechanism for instigating an autoimmune response to self antigens that in turn can lead to autoimmune disease under particular conditions of antigen presentation, secondary signalling and effector cell repertoire. In this review evidence in support of epitope mimicry is examined {{in the light of the}} necessary immunological considerations of the theory...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{induction}} of protective antibodies against a bacterial pathogen in mice {{was used as}} a model for idiotype vaccine development. The antibody responses induced in different strains of mice by the hapten phosphorylcholine (PC) coupled to ovalbumin, PC-OVA, were compared with the responses induced by carrier conjugates of two different anti-idiotopic antibodies. One anti-idiotope, 4 C 11, exhibits the characteristics of an internal image of phosphorylcholine, and therefore is classified as an Ab 2 beta; the other, F 6, does not <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen,</b> and therefore is classified as an Ab 2 alpha. The analysis of the temporal kinetics of the IgM and IgG 1 anti-PC responses induced by nominal and idiotope antigens revealed dynamic responses characterized by changes in {{the quality and quantity of}} the antibody populations during the course of the immune response. All three antigens could stimulate antibodies that were PC-specific and T 15 idiotope-positive in BALB/c and A/St mice. The highest titre of T 15 + anti-PC antibodies was achieved with an immunization protocol which involved priming with Ab 2 alpha followed by challenge with PC-OVA. Antibodies specific for the extended hapten, diazophenylphosphorylcholine, and hapten-carrier bridge determinants were being stimulated late in the responses to PC-OVA. BALB-c, A/St and CBA/N (Xid) mice all produced, late in the response to Ab 2 alpha, high T 15 + antibody titres which do not bind PC. The induction of T 15 +, non-PC binding, antibody suggests that T 15 is a regulatory idiotope, expressed on antibodies having differing antigenic specificities. With regard to vaccine development, these results support the contention that effective induction of antibodies does not depend on stimulating a unique idiotope but can be achieved by anti-idiotypes reacting with different idiotopes. In addition, these results suggest that the combined use of idiotope and nominal antigens in an immunization protocol may provide the maximal protective immunity...|$|E
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{establishes}} a latent {{infection in the}} human host. In order to produce infectious virus particles EBV must reactivate from latency and enter its lytic cycle. BZLF 1 is the immediate early gene in EBV that mediates the switch between latency and the lytic cycle. The BZLF 1 gene is {{under the control of}} the Zp promoter. Reactivation from latency is studied in EBV positive Akata cell lines where EBV can be reactivated by crosslinking the B-cell receptor (BCR) using antibodies to <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> binding. This system uses stably transfected reporter plasmids to study Zp regulation. Mutagenesis identified additional regions of the promoter that contribute to regulation and the ZID MEF 2 binding site was demonstrated to be functionally important during the initial stages of Zp activation. XBP- 1 splicing, previously implicated in Zp reactivation, was found to occur rapidly in this system in response to BCR crosslinking and parallels the transient induction of Zp. Chromatin remodelling also plays an important role in Zp regulation. An inducible BZLF 1 expression system, independent of BCR signalling, was developed in Akata cells that accurately mimics BZLF 1 activity and provides a novel approach to study repression at Zp. The BZLF 1 protein is related to the bZIP family of transcription factors. BZLF 1 contains a bZIP motif in which C-terminal residues fold back against a zipper region that forms an a-helical coiled-coil. The 208 SSENDRLR 215 sequence in the zipper region is conserved between BZLF 1 and C/EBP. Point mutagenesis in this sequence revealed the importance of individual residues for transactivation and progression to DNA replication. The restoration of BZLF 1 DNA replication activity by complementation of two deleterious mutations (S 208 E and D 236 K) indicated that the interaction of the C-terminal tail and the core zipper region is required for DNA replication, identifying a functional role for this structural feature unique to BZLF 1.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) 1 restriction has by necessity become the cornerstone of all models of helper and cytotoxic T cell antigen recognition. Alloreactivity, h]storically the first example of T cell recognition of MHC determinants, has been variously viewed as an inexplicable property of a subset of T cells or as a cross-reaction of self-MHC-restricted cells. The finding that monoclonal sources of T cells can be activated either by antigen and self-MHC or by allogeneic MHC alone at frequencies that mimic mixed cell populations (1) strengthens the view that alloreactivity is indeed a cross-reactive byproduct of the molecular mechanism of antigen and self-recognition. However, {{it is not known}} if a single receptor complex can recognize both self-Ia plus foreign antigen and non-self-Ia. Recently (2 - 7), probes in the form of monoclonal antibodies specific for individual clones of T cells have become available to directly identify the cell surface structures involved in antigen and Ia recognition and to dissect the cell biology of the process of T cell activation. This study uses a murine helper T cell clone that is induced to proliferate either by hen's egg conalbumin and I-A k or by I-A b alone. As previously described (2), these cloned T cells can also be activated by a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a cell surface determinant unique to this clone. We now demonstrate that this antibody can <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> and Ia in the activation of this clone at concentrations as low as 10 -ll M. In monovalent form, this antibody no longer activates but rather blocks specific activation by I-A b or by antigen and I-A k, strongly supporting the hypothesis that a single molecular species is indeed involved in recognition of both moieties. The target antigen of this antibody is a cell surface glycoprotein, a disulfide-linked heterodimer. Both surface and internal forms of this protein have been identified by immunoprecipitation an...|$|E
40|$|Antigen/antibody {{complexes}} can efficiently target antigen presenting {{cells to}} allow {{stimulation of the}} cellular immune response. Due {{to the difficulty of}} manufacture and their inherent instability complexes have proved inefficient cancer vaccines. However, anti-idiotypic antibodies <b>mimicking</b> <b>antigens</b> have been shown to stimulate both antibody and T cell responses. The latter are due to T cell mimotopes expressed within the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies that are efficiently presented to dendritic cells in vivo. Based on this observation we have designed a DNA vaccine platform called ImmunoBody™, where cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T cell epitopes replace CDR regions within the framework of a human IgG 1 antibody. The ImmunoBody™ expression system has a number of design features which allow for rapid production {{of a wide range of}} vaccines. The CDR regions of the heavy and light chain have been engineered to contain unique restriction endonuclease sites, which can be easily opened, and oligonucleotides encoding the T cell epitopes inserted. The variable and constant regions of the ImmunoBody™ are also flanked by restriction sites, which permit easy exchange of other IgG subtypes. Here we show a range of T cell epitopes can be inserted into the ImmunoBody™ vector and upon immunization these T cell epitopes are efficiently processed and presented to stimulate high frequency helper and CTL responses capable of anti-tumor activity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Genetic {{immunization}} {{is expected}} to induce the expression of antigens in a native form. The encoded peptide epitopes are presented on endogenous MHC molecules, <b>mimicking</b> <b>antigen</b> presentation during a viral infection. We have explored the potential of enfuvirtide (T 20), a short HIV peptide with antiviral properties, to enhance immune response to HIV antigens. To generate an expression vector, the T 20 sequence was cloned into a conventional plasmid, the novel minicircle construct, and a replicon plasmid. In addition, three conventional plasmids that express the envelope of HIV- 1 subtypes A, B and C and contain T 20 in their gp 41 sequences were also tested. Results: All combinations induced HIV-specific antibodies and cellular responses. The addition of T 20 as a peptide and as an expression cassette in the three DNA vectors enhanced antibody responses. The highest anti-HIV- 1 Env titers were obtained by the replicon T 20 construct. This demonstrates that besides its known antiviral activity, T 20 promotes immune responses. We also confirm {{that the combination of}} slightly divergent antigens improves immune responses. Conclusions: The antiretroviral T 20 HIV- 1 sequence can be used as an immunogen to elicit binding and neutralizing antibodies against HIV- 1. These, or similarly modified gp 41 genes/peptides, can be used as priming or boosting components for induction of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies. Future comparative studies will reveal the optimal mode of T 20 administration. </p...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{have been}} shown to affect haematopoietic differentiation, acting as {{important}} determinants of cellular fate specification. The aim of this work is to investigate the role of miRNAs in the activation of T lymphocytes. By microarray analysis, we observed differential expression of miRNAs in distinct subclasses of T lymphocytes: CD 8 + naïve, CD 8 + memory effector, CD 8 +central memory; CD 4 + naïve, CD 4 + memory effector and CD 4 + central memory. We found that miR- 146 a is expressed in separated primary T cells, in both CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells, but not in naïve T cells. Furthermore, a significative up-regulation of miR- 146 a expression levels was also obtained in the Jurkat T cell line, stimulated with αCD 3 -αCD 28 antibodies, or with PMA and ionomycin, which are stimuli that <b>mimic</b> <b>antigen</b> recognition by TCR. Therefore, we attempted to discover the mechanisms of miR- 146 a transcriptional regulation. Some indications about the pathways possibly involved were obtained by treatment of induced Jurkat cells with specific pharmacological inhibitors of pathways triggered by TCR signalling [...] We found that Cyclosporine (CsA), a Calcineurin inhibitor, significantly impaired miR- 146 a up-regulation, thus suggesting that the pathways affected by CsA {{play a key role in}} the induction of miR- 146 a upon TCR engagement. This observation prompted us to further investigate with molecular tools the transcription factors which are responsible for miR- 146 a expression in T lymphocytes. A deeper investigation to carefully characterize the cis regulatory elements involved in miR- 146 a regulation was performed through a bioinformatic analysis of miR- 146 a promoter and a luciferase assay. These approaches allowed us to identify conserved consensus sites for T lymphocytes-specific transcription factors, which are involved in pathways triggered by TCR signalling and are required for miR- 146 a induction. The results obtained indicate that NF-κB and c- ETS are involved in miR- 146 a induction in T cell activation pathway. Moreover, we also demonstrated that miR- 146 a is also induced in Jurkat cells by an inflammatory stimulus, TNF-α treatment, and NF-κB is the main transcription factor responsible of miR- 146 a induction. Another intriguing aspect of miRNAs study is the identification of miRNAs biological role in a cell. We identified miR- 146 a targets 5 taking advantage of a 3 ’-untranslated region (UTR) luciferase reporter assay. We tested a number of predicted miR- 146 a targets, relevant for T cell physiology. In particular, we report here that miR- 146 a downmodulates the apoptosis process via translational inhibition of FADD and it reduces AP- 1 transcriptional activity, through the downregulation of c-FOS Altogether, our findings reveal miR- 146 a involvement in T cell activation process, significantly affecting key properties of lymphocytes...|$|E

Using monocytes, T lymphocytes, and granulocytes isolated by magnetic sorting and dried blood spots (DBS) derived from 50 μl of peripheral blood, we evaluated the response of metallothionein (MT), zinc transporter, and cytokine genes to a modest (15 mg of Zn per day) dietary zinc supplement in human subjects. Transcript abundance was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR). Zinc supplementation increased MT mRNA abundance by up to 2 -fold in RNA from leukocyte subsets, and 4 -fold in RNA from DBS. Transcript levels for the zinc transporter genes ZnT 1 and Zip 3 were increased and decreased, respectively, by zinc supplementation. Expression of the ZnT and Zip genes among leukocyte subsets differ by up to 270 -fold. Monocytes and granulocytes from supplemented subjects were activated by LPS, whereas T lymphocytes were activated by <b>mimicking</b> <b>antigen</b> presentation. With zinc consumption, TNF-α and IL- 1 β expression was greater in activated monocytes and granulocytes, and IFN-γ mRNA levels were higher in activated T lymphocytes. These studies show that QRT-PCR is a tool to reliably measure transcript abundance for nutritionally responsive genes in human subjects, and that {{a small sample of}} whole dried blood, when appropriately collected, can be used as the source of total RNA for QRT-PCR analysis.

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel, testable theory of autoimmunity, outline novel predictions {{made by the}} theory, and illustrate its application to unravelling the possible causes of idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). Pairs of stereochemically complementary antigens induce complementary immune responses (antibody or T-cell) that create loss of regulation and civil war within the immune system itself. Antibodies attack antibodies creating circulating immune complexes; T-cells attack T-cells creating perivascular cuffing. This immunological civil war abrogates the self-nonself distinction. If {{at least one of}} the complementary <b>antigens</b> <b>mimics</b> a self <b>antigen,</b> then this unregulated immune response will target host tissues as well. Data demonstrating that complementary antigens are found in some animal models of autoimmunity and may be present in various human diseases, especially ITP, are reviewed. Specific mechanisms for preventing autoimmunity or suppressing existing autoimmunity are derived from the theory, and critical tests proposed. Finally, we argue that Koch's postulates are inadequate for establishing disease causation for multiple-antigen diseases and discuss the possibility that current research has failed to elucidate the causes of human autoimmune diseases because we are using the wrong criteria...|$|R

40|$|Human {{lymphoproliferative}} {{responses to}} a rabbit anti-idiotypic antibody (anti-Id TB 71) and the corresponding mycobacterial protein antigen [38, 000 molecular weight (MW) ] have been investigated {{in a number of}} donors. It was found that responsiveness to anti-Id TB 71 correlated with responder and non-responder (four subjects each) status to the 38, 000 MW antigen. Furthermore, the induction of T-cell proliferation by both the 38, 000 MW antigen and the anti-Id TB 71 was dependent on accessory cells. When taken together with the concordance between the 38, 000 MW antigen and anti-Id responsiveness, this implies that the 38, 000 MW antigen and anti-Id TB 71 stimulate related, or at least partially overlapping, repertoires of T cells. This was confirmed by the finding that cloned T cells reactive with the 38, 000 MW antigen also proliferated in response to the anti-Id TB 71. These observations are readily explained if the anti-idiotypic antibody contains an internal image of, and can therefore <b>mimic,</b> the <b>antigen...</b>|$|R
40|$|Topical antigen {{application}} is {{a focus of}} current vaccine research. This immunization route <b>mimics</b> natural <b>antigen</b> exposure across a barrier tissue and generates T cells imprinted for skin-selective homing. Soluble antigens introduced through this route require cross-presentation by DC to generate CD 8 T cell responses. Here we have explored the relative contribution of various skin-derived DC subsets to cross-priming and skin-selective imprinting. In our model, DC acquire soluble Ag in vivo from immunized murine skin for cross-presentation to naïve CD 8 T cells ex vivo. We find CD 11 b(+) migratory DC to be the relevant cross-priming DC in this model. Both Langerin(+) and Langerin(-) CD 11 b(+) migratory DC can cross-present antigen in our system, but only the Langerin+ subset can induce expression of the skin-selective addressin E-selectin ligand. Thus, the CD 11 b(+) Langerin(+) migratory DC population, comprised primarily of Langerhans cells, both cross-primes naïve CD 8 T cells and imprints them with skin-homing capabilities...|$|R
25|$|Epitope spreading, {{also known}} as {{determinant}} spreading, is another common way in which autoimmunity can occur which uses the molecular mimicry mechanism. Autoreactive T cells are activated de novo by self epitopes released secondary to pathogen-specific T cell-mediated bystander damage. T cell responses to progressively less dominant epitopes are activated {{as a consequence of}} the release of other antigens secondary to the destruction of the pathogen with a homologous immunodominant sequence. Thus, inflammatory responses induced by specific pathogens that trigger pro-inflammatory Th1 responses have the ability to persist in genetically susceptible hosts. This may lead to organ-specific autoimmune disease. Conversely, epitope spreading could be due to target antigens being physically linked intracellularly as members of a complex to self antigen. The result of this is an autoimmune response that is triggered by exogenous antigen that progresses to a truly autoimmune response against <b>mimicked</b> self <b>antigen</b> and other antigens. From these examples, it is clear that the search for candidate mimic epitopes must extend beyond the immunodominant epitopes of a given autoimmune response.|$|R
40|$|A {{panel of}} 17 mouse {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MoAb) raised against Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) antigens {{was used to}} detect antigenic determinants in normal human skin. An indirect immunoperoxidase technique was used. Eight of the MoAb detected epidermal antigens similar to patterns well known for human sera. Five of these MoAb detected determinants in the dermis, too. These observations may indicate {{a certain degree of}} similarity between the antigenic determinants occurring in M. leprae and in the human host. We propose that such a similarity on the one hand may facilitate the survival of M. leprae in the human host when the antigens are not recognized as "non-self," a situation which seems to occur in lepromatous leprosy, when the patients' tissues are loaded with bacteria virtually without any immune response. On the other hand, M. leprae <b>antigens</b> which <b>mimic</b> host <b>antigens</b> may induce an auto-immune reaction against the host's own antigens, which could explain the immune reaction in tuberculoid leprosy and during a "reversal reaction" when M. leprae is not observed in the host tissues, but extensive granuloma formation occur...|$|R
