40|$|The {{traditional}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>encoder</b> {{has been}} used to detect the position and speed of rotors in permanent magnet synchronous motor control system, which has the problems of high cost, low system reliability, being susceptible to interference and difficult to apply in a complex environment. A novel speed estimation method based on sliding mode adaptive system is proposed in this paper, which improves the speed estimation accuracy and system robustness to achieve motor speed sensorless control. The simulation results indicate that the control strategy could avoid the limitations of traditional mechanical encoders, and estimate the rotor speed and position angle accurately when suddenly applied load...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, several {{essential}} improvements of the sensorless direct {{torque control}} (DTC) strategy for interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous motor drives are presented. The studies comprising of analytical, modeling and experimental implementation clearly indicate {{the potential of}} a high-performance direct torque controlled IPM synchronous motor drive without a <b>mechanical</b> <b>encoder.</b> The DTC technique and its associated problems have been further investigated in this thesis. Its major drawback namely the high torque and flux ripples are remedied by the proposed direct torque and flux controller (DTFC). It utilizes two PI controllers to predict the most appropriate voltage vector adaptive to error amplitudes are predicted and synthesized. This results in reduced torque and flux ripples with a constant switching frequency. Several stator flux and speed estimators are proposed to achieve sensorless control. The simple open-loop estimator works well only in the medium to high speed region. This is because the other problems of the DTC such as non-linearities of the inverter, stator resistance variation and dc-offset effects are not addressed. Improved flux and speed estimation is achieved by employing closed-loop observers. A speed adaptive sliding mode observer for joint stator flux and rotor speed estimation is firstly proposed. To further improve the very low speed performance of the DTFC, another inherently speed sensorless sliding mode observer based on a novel concept called the extended rotor flux is proposed. This observer delivers satisfactory performance in the very low speed region. Nevertheless, continuous full-load operation at standstill is not possible. For persistent zero speed operation with full-load, a high frequency signal injection technique is proposed in this thesis. A carrier excitation signal was injected into the machine and the stator current response was used to extract the rotor position information. As the signal injection scheme becomes less effective at higher speeds, a hybrid signal injection and sliding mode observer is introduced to enable sensorless operation over a wide speed range. The abovementioned {{studies show that the}} problems of the DTC for IPM machines have now been significantly reduced compared to what have been achieved to date; making it a viable and cost-effective candidate for future wide speed sensorless IPM synchronous motor drives...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for the adjustment of mechanical assemblies, in particular {{for the production}} of a multi-mirror polygon, whereby the module comprises a rack (5) and at least one clamping device (3) linked to the rack (5) for attaching at least one component to be adjusted (mirror 1) with the necessary retaining force. At least one <b>mechanical</b> pulse <b>encoder</b> (4) connected to the rack acts on at least one component to be adjusted (mirror 1) {{in such a way that}} the planned final adjustment position is reachable. The <b>mechanical</b> pulse <b>encoder</b> (4) acts on a support (2) of the component to be adjusted (mirror 1) with pulses by means of a striker pin (10) similar to a moved hammer. The actual position of the component can be determined by means of a measuring instrument (7). The measuring instrument is connected to a positioning device (6) in which the actual position is comparable to the target position and the positioning device (6) is connected to at least one <b>mechanical</b> puls e <b>encoder</b> (4) so that at least one mechanical pulse can be generated so that the component (mirror 1) can be moved into the target position...|$|R

Over the coming decades, the production was enlarged with relay, rotary <b>encoder,</b> <b>mechanical</b> counter and also printer & cutter.In 1995, the company has been taken over by Danaher Corporation, an American concern which includes more than 400 companies. Today, Hengstler has various prominent customers like Siemens, IBM, Festo or Bosch.|$|R
