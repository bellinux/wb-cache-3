5000|$|CDMA is a {{spread-spectrum}} <b>multiple-access</b> <b>technique.</b> A spread-spectrum technique spreads the bandwidth of {{the data}} uniformly for the same transmitted power. A spreading code is a pseudo-random code that has a narrow ambiguity function, unlike other narrow pulse codes. In CDMA a locally generated code runs {{at a much higher}} rate than the data to be transmitted. Data for transmission is combined by bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) with the faster code. The figure shows how a spread-spectrum signal is generated. The data signal with pulse duration of [...] (symbol period) is XORed with the code signal with pulse duration of [...] (chip period). (Note: bandwidth is proportional to , where [...] = bit time.) Therefore, the bandwidth {{of the data}} signal is [...] and the bandwidth of the spread spectrum signal is [...] Since [...] is much smaller than , the bandwidth of the spread-spectrum signal is much larger than the bandwidth of the original signal. The ratio [...] is called the spreading factor or processing gain and determines to a certain extent the upper limit {{of the total number of}} users supported simultaneously by a base station.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For {{high-speed}} packet access, hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing are indispensable techniques. As the <b>multiple-access</b> <b>technique,</b> {{single carrier}} (SC) -frequency-division multiple-access (FDMA) using transmit filtering is promising. The use of squareroot Nyquist transmit filter reduces peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmit SC-FDMA signal {{and increases the}} frequency diversity gain. However, if the carrier-frequency separation among multiple-access users is kept {{the same as in}} the case of the transmit filter’s roll-off factor α= 0 (i. e., brick wall filter), the adjacent users ’ signal spectra overlap and the multi-user interference (MUI) is produced. In this paper, we propose an iterative minimum mean square error signal detection and interference cancellation (MMSED-IC) for turbo coded uplink SC-FDMA MIMO using HARQ. In the proposed MMSED-IC, not only the inter-antenna interference (IAI) and residual inter-symbol interference (ISI) but also MUI are cancelled in an iterative fashion. We evaluate the HARQ throughput performances by computer simulation, and show that the use of roll-off factor α= 1 achieves the highest throughput performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Trellis-code multiple-access (TCMA) is a {{narrowband}} multiple-access scheme {{based on}} trellis-coded modulation. There is no bandwidth expansion, so users occupy the same bandwidth as one single user. The load of the system, in number of bits per channel use, is therefore {{much higher than the}} load in, for example, conventional code-division multiple-access systems. Interleavers are introduced as a new feature to separate the users. This implies that the maximum-likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) is now too complex to implement. Iterative detectors are therefore suggested {{as an alternative to the}} joint MLSD. The conventional interference cancellation (IC) detector has lower complexity than the MLSD, but its performance is shown to be far from acceptable. Even after a novel improvement of the IC detector, the performance is unsatisfactory. Instead of using IC, another iterative detector is suggested. This detector updates the branch metric for every iteration, and avoids the standard Gaussian approximation. Simulations show that the performance of this detector can be close to single-user performance, even when the interleaver and the phase offset are the only user-specific features in the TCMA system.

40|$|Sparse code {{multiple}} access (SCMA) {{is a new}} frequency domain non-orthogonal <b>multiple-access</b> <b>technique</b> which can improve spectral efficiency of wireless radio access. With SCMA, different incoming data streams are directly mapped to codewords of different multi-dimensional cookbooks, where each codeword represents a spread transmission layer. Multiple SCMA layers share the same time-frequency resources of OFDMA. The sparsity of codewords makes the near-optimal detection feasible through iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). Such low complexity of multi-layer detection allows excessive codeword overloading in which the dimension of multiplexed layers exceeds the dimension of codewords. Optimization of overloading factor along with modulation-coding levels of layers provides a more flexible and efficient link-adaptation mechanism. On the other hand, the signal spreading feature of SCMA can improve link-adaptation {{as a result of}} less colored interference.
