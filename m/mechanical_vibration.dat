5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibration</b> to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
25|$|Fetuses between 32 and 39 weeks {{gestation}} {{were presented}} a pure tone (CS), which was {{paired with a}} vibroacoustic stimulus (US). A vibroacoustic stimulus is a low bass sound frequency that is felt by the fetus as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibration.</b> After 10-20 pairings, approximately 50% of the fetuses showed successful conditioning, unrelated to age or sex of the fetus. It is suggested that poorly prepared experimental set up, inaccurate or inappropriate response measures and unsuitable stimuli could all contribute to failed conditioning, as opposed to lack of fetal memory. Reasons for some fetuses demonstrating conditioning, while others do not, remains undetermined.|$|E
25|$|Wheatstone {{abandoned}} {{his idea of}} transmitting intelligence by the <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibration</b> of rods, and took up the electric telegraph. In 1835 he lectured on the system of Baron Schilling, and declared that the means were already known by which an electric telegraph could be made of great service to the world. He made experiments with a plan of his own, and not only proposed to lay an experimental line across the Thames, but to establish it on the London and Birmingham Railway. Before these plans were carried out, however, he received a visit from Mr William Fothergill Cooke at his house in Conduit Street on 27 February 1837, which had an important influence on his future.|$|E

25|$|GPS {{compasses}} {{share the}} main advantages of gyrocompasses. They determine true North, {{as opposed to}} magnetic North, and they are unaffected by perturbations of the Earth's magnetic field. Additionally, compared with gyrocompasses, they are much cheaper, they work better in polar regions, they are less prone {{to be affected by}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibration,</b> and they can be initialized far more quickly. However, they depend on the functioning of, and communication with, the GPS satellites, which might be disrupted by an electronic attack or by the effects of a severe solar storm. Gyrocompasses remain in use for military purposes (especially in submarines, where magnetic and GPS compasses are useless), but have been largely superseded by GPS compasses, with magnetic backups, in civilian contexts.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the issue of <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibrations</b> in control of {{parallel}} robots. The proposed control strategy consists in a nonlinear adaptive dual mode controller applied to the actuation redundant parallel manipulator Par 2. In this context, the experimental testbed is not equipped with velocity sensors. Therefore, a high-gain observer has been used to estimate the articular velocities. Real-time experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, as well as the arised <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibrations</b> that increase with acceleration (becoming an important issue for accelerations higher than 20 G). Some promising possible solutions {{to deal with the problem}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibrations</b> have been discussed for future implementation...|$|R

2500|$|Ice {{hockey pucks}} of {{regulation}} [...] diameter and [...] thickness {{may be used}} as <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibration</b> dampening isolators in places such as feet for light industrial air compressors, and air conditioning units because they are of regulation materials and therefore consistent manufacture, size and shape, and are constructed of a repeatable and consistent vulcanized rubber material. [...] Since the material is rubber, it may be drilled out or milled easily to a fixed depth as rubber feet or used as rubber spacer or gasket material. [...] A very common use of a slotted hockey puck is as an adaptor between the metal foot of a trolley jack and the sill (rocker panel) of an automobile. [...] The sill has a spot-welded lip which fits into the slot of the puck and would otherwise be bent or marked by the metal foot. [...] Hockey pucks have been used to level furniture, beverage refrigeration systems, and as paper weights or door stops. [...] The hockey puck has many uses other than its original, intended purpose by virtue of its consistent physical properties.|$|E
2500|$|The wire in a {{voice coil}} is usually made of copper, though aluminum—and, rarely, silver—may be used. [...] The {{advantage}} of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the moving mass compared to copper. [...] This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency. [...] A disadvantage of aluminum {{is that it is}} not easily soldered, and so connections are instead often crimped together and sealed. [...] These connections must be made well or they may fail in an intense environment of <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibration.</b> [...] Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the magnetic gap space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside of the gap being one pole, and the center post (called the pole piece) being the other. The pole piece and backplate are often a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.|$|E

40|$|Tonal {{noise and}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibrations</b> appear in {{flexible}} risers by throughput of dry gas flow. In this master thesis {{the effect of}} adding liquid to the fluid stream in the flexible risers is investigated, as this would possibly reduce the tonal noise and <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Since flexible risers are a concatenation of cavity-like structures, a single cavity structure was chosen as the testing configuration for the present study. The research on the cavity structure was performed experimentally by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements, for various gas velocities and liquid filling degrees of the internal cavity area. The experiments showed indications that the accumulation of liquid in the cavity area may reduce the appearance of tonal noise and <b>mechanical</b> <b>vibrations</b> in flexible risers.
