5|$|The {{companion}} {{which is}} supposed to have spun-up PSR B1937+21 is no longer present, making it one of few <b>millisecond</b> pulsars which does not have a stellar mass companion. The generally high occurrence of companions to <b>millisecond</b> pulsars is to be expected, considering a companion is necessary to spin-up <b>millisecond</b> pulsars to their short periods. However, <b>millisecond</b> pulsars do not actively accrete matter from a companion, but instead need to have only done this at some time in the past, and thus the lack of companion for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the spin-up model. Possible mechanisms for creating isolated <b>millisecond</b> pulsars include evaporation of the donor star or tidal disruption of the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} {{was involved in}} the discovery of <b>millisecond</b> pulsars, and also discovered the first pulsar in a globular cluster in 1986—a <b>millisecond</b> pulsar in the Messier 28 globular cluster. In September 2006, the results of three years of observing a double pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, with the Lovell telescope, {{as well as with the}} Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes, were announced— confirming that the general theory of relativity is accurate to 99.5%.|$|E

We found that the response time is independent from the amount of already joined devices. This result was expected. It reflects the fact, that information about already registered nodes is not retrieved during the join process.|$|R

5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a <b>millisecond</b> while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundDomperidone {{has been}} widely used in {{children}} with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Studies {{on the effects of}} domperidone on corrected QT interval (QTc) in young children are limited. Our aim was to study the effect of domperidone on the repolarization abnormalities assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG) in young children. MethodsECG was performed in children < 2 years of age before and after taking domperidone orally 0. 3  mg/kg three times/day for at least a 1 week period. Each ECG was reviewed and QT, RR, and Tpeak to Tend intervals (TpTe) were measured to calculate the QTc and TpTe/QT ratio. ResultsA total of 22 patients (12 male) with a median age of 8. 5 months (1 – 24 months) were enrolled. Most patients (59. 1 %) were under 1 year of age. The median baseline QTc (410 <b>milliseconds,</b> 350 – 450 <b>milliseconds)</b> was not significantly different from the QTc after taking domperidone (410 <b>milliseconds,</b> 320 – 560 <b>milliseconds),</b> p =  0. 159. Only two patients showed a QTc increase ≥ 450 <b>milliseconds.</b> The baseline TpTe interval and TpTe/QT (105 <b>milliseconds,</b> 60 – 170 <b>milliseconds</b> and 0. 27 <b>milliseconds,</b> 0. 15 – 0. 43 <b>milliseconds)</b> were significantly greater than the TpTe interval and TpTe/QT in children after taking domperidone (90 <b>milliseconds,</b> 60 – 140 <b>milliseconds</b> and 0. 22 <b>milliseconds,</b> 0. 15 – 0. 29 <b>milliseconds),</b> p =  0. 001 and 0. 004, respectively. ConclusionsOur data demonstrate that domperidone treatment over a short-term period in children < 2 years of age did not lengthen QTc significantly; however, QTc increased ≥ 450 <b>milliseconds</b> in two patients with concomitant lansoprazole. Routine baseline and follow-up ECG may not be necessary in each individual case receiving only domperidone...|$|R
5|$|The {{rotation}} of PSR B1937+21, {{along with other}} <b>millisecond</b> pulsars discovered later, are very stable in their rotation. They are capable of keeping {{time as well as}} atomic clocks. PSR B1937+21 is unusual in that it is one of few pulsars which occasionally emits particularly strong pulses. The flux density of the giant pulses emitted by PSR B1937+21 are the brightest radio emission ever observed. These properties of PSR B1937+21, and its unexpected discovery, are credited with helping revitalize research on pulsars.|$|E

5|$|Typical pulsar periods {{for young}} pulsars {{are of the}} order of one second, and they {{increase}} with time; the very short periods exhibited by so-called <b>millisecond</b> pulsars are due to the transfer of material from a binary companion. The pulse period of PSR B1620-26 is a few milliseconds, providing strong evidence for matter transfer. It is believed that as the pulsar's red giant companion expanded, it filled and then exceeded its Roche lobe, so that its surface layers started being transferred onto the neutron star.|$|E

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, <b>millisecond</b> pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E

Various pulsar timing arrays are using <b>millisecond</b> pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 Hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes.

The unknown isotopes 277Rg and 283Rg are also expected to have long half-lives of 1second and 10minutes respectively. Before their discovery, the isotopes 278Rg, 281Rg, and 282Rg were predicted to have long half-lives of 1second, 1minute, and 4minutes respectively; however, they were discovered to have shorter half-lives of 4.2milliseconds, 17seconds, and 2.1minutes respectively.|$|E
5|$|Anton is a {{special-purpose}} supercomputer {{built for}} molecular dynamics simulations. In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home {{were the two}} most powerful molecular dynamics systems. Anton is unique {{in its ability to}} produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories, such as one in 2010 which reached the <b>millisecond</b> range. These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems. However, Anton does not use Markov state models for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-µs Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories. In June 2011 Folding@home began added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's. However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's phase space. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.|$|E
