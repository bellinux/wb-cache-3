5000|$|The disc is {{permanently}} {{housed in}} a cartridge (68×72×5 mm) with a sliding door, similar to the casing of a 3.5" [...] floppy disk. This shutter is opened automatically by a mechanism upon insertion. The audio discs can either be recordable (blank) or premastered. Recordable MiniDiscs use a <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>system</b> to record data. A laser heats {{one side of the}} disc to its Curie point, making the material in the disc susceptible to a magnetic field. A magnetic head {{on the other side of}} the disc alters the polarity of the heated area, recording the digital data onto the disk. Playback is accomplished with the laser alone: taking advantage of the Faraday effect; the player senses the polarisation of the reflected light and thus interprets a 1 or a 0. Recordable MDs can be recorded on repeatedly; Sony claims up to one million times. As of May 2005, there were 74 minute and 80 minute discs available. 60 minute blanks, which were widely available in the early years of the format's introduction, were phased out long before and are rarely seen.|$|E

Although {{the focus is on}} magneto-optics, most sources of noise are common among the various optical recording systems and one can easily adapt the results to other media and systems. A description of the <b>magneto-optical</b> readout <b>system</b> under consideration is given, and the standard methods and the relevant terminology of signal and noise measurement are described. The characteristics of thermal noise, which originates in the electronic circuitry of the readout system, are described. The most fundamental of all sources of noise, the shot noise, is considered, and a detailed account of its statistical properties is given. Shot noise, which is due to random fluctuations in photon arrival times, is an ever-present noise in optical detection.

Indium oxide doped with magnetic transition metals is a promising material for spintronics. This study presents results on the magnetic, transport, optical and magneto-optical properties of thin films of pure and transition metal (Fe,Co) doped In 2 O 3 investigated at different transition metal concentrations and at different growth conditions. The optical and magneto-optical measurements at low temperature confirmed the formation of the defect states associated with oxygen vacancies within the forbidden range of the optical band gap energy of In 2 O 3 and located below the conduction band. The density of the donor states is tuned using the oxygen partial pressureto give oxygen vacancies or by doping with tin; this gives control over the carrier concentration in the system as well as affecting the magnetic properties. This study developed optical and <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>systems</b> and undertook the world’s first optical and magneto-optical measurements of In 2 O 3. A new lab-based alternative technique to the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structurewas developed to identify the existence of magnetic nanoparticles in addition to provide the fraction and the contribution of these nanoparticles to the magnetisation and magneto-optical properties. The Maxwell-Garnett analysis of magnetic circular dichroism was used to obtain quantitative measures of the amount of defect phases present for Co metal.

This magneto-optical method was found to be more precise than EXAFS in determining the fraction and the contribution of nanoparticles to the total response of the system. However, these nanoparticles disappeared when thin films were co-doped with tin, indicating that doping with Sn not only introduced more carriers but also inhibited the growth of defect phases in semi magnetic semiconductor thin films.

40|$|Scanning {{near-field}} {{optical microscopy}} (SNOM) is a versatile imaging technique that combines the well-known advantages of optical microscopy with a resolution beyond the classical diffraction limit. The {{development of new}} contrast mechanisms, detection geometries and tip fabrication methods has been pursued very actively during the recent years. The occurrence and suppression of artifacts are also a subject of intense discussion and research. However, gaining information by microscopy is a two-step process. The physical data acquisition itself {{is only the first}} step; an analysis of the obtained data is required to form an image that visualizes the desired information. While it is state of the art to employ sophisticated computational methods for the analysis in domains like astronomy, harnessing that power for SNOM remains a niche field. This dissertation proposes an integrated framework that combines improvements of the physical data acquisition with novel computational data exploitation methods to produce improved SNOM images. Using an existing <b>magneto-optical</b> SNOM <b>system</b> as an object of study, all the processing stages that the raw data undergo on their way from the sample to the image are reconsidered. Access is provided to the actual raw data, of which only a far less informative condensate was previously available for further processing. For magneto-optical measurements, a crosstalk of the sample topography into the magneto-optical image is demonstrated experimentally, and a method to produce topography-free magnetic test samples is subsequently developed. Improved strategies are provided for the processing of the raw data into a first raw image. To better suppress high-frequency noise, novel de-noising methods based on wavelet filtering are developed. They allow for a far better compromise between feature retention and filtering efficiency than the previously used Fourier filtering. To increase the resolution of the de-noised image beyond the usual practical limit of the aperture used for the imaging, a concept for image deconvolution is developed. Using both simulated and actual SNOM images, it is established how much can be gained in image quality by the combination of de-noising and deconvolution and how this gain depends on the purity of the initial raw data. It is also discussed to which extent de-noising and deconvolution can be applied to other types of microscopy. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that de-noising and deconvolution not only improve images, but also supply novel approaches for improving the physical data acquisition. E. g., a novel detection mode may exploit the dither motion of the tip, which is always present for the purpose of distance regulation, for an advantageous modulation of the optical signal...|$|R

The developmental work was carried out on the experimental apparatus used previously in this laboratory in order to perform experiments to study coherence effects in three- and four-level rubidium systems in the MOT. This developmental work includes the upgrading and installation of new laser systems, {{the improvement of the}} MOT, the installation of data acquisition hardware and software, and the commissioning of a new 'second generation' MOT. As part of our studies of coherence effects, we present a wide-ranging theoretical and experimental study of non-adiabatic transient phenomena in a #LAMBDA# system which exhibits electromagnetically induced transparency when a strong coupling field is rapidly switched on or off using a Pockels cell. The theoretical treatment uses a Laplace transform approach as well as standard numerical methods to solve the time-dependent density matrix equation. The results show clear Rabi oscillations and transient gain without population inversion of a weak probe in parameter regions not previously studied, and provide insight into the transition dynamics between bare a dressed states. Experimental studies of a doubly driven V system are also reported, together with a theoretical dressed-state analysis of such systems. The expected three-peak spectrum is explored for various coupling field strengths and detunings. In all this work we have found good agreement between the theory and the experimental spectra once light shifts and uncoupled absorption in the rubidium system are taken into account.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new apparatus designed to study cold, ultracold, and quantum degenerate mixtures of rubidium and caesium atoms. The Rb- Cs mixture is prepared using a double <b>magneto-optical</b> trap (MOT) <b>system</b> {{in which a}} two-species pyramid MOT acts {{as a source of}} cold atoms for a 'science' MOT. The first results of experiments on the magneto-optically trapped mixture are presented, including measurements of trap loss rates due to single-species and interspecies inelastic collisions. A technique for reducing interspecies loss by spatially separating the MOTs during loading is described. This technique allows 50 - 50 mixtures of Rb and Cs atoms to be loaded into a magnetic trap at close to their respective maximum single- species atom numbers. Alternatively, one species can be loaded with arbitrarily small amounts of the other. The displaced MOT technique is thus аn excellent starting point for investigations of interspecies Feshbach resonances and sympathetic cooling of Rb-Cs mixtures in magnetic and optical traps. In addition, a model of polarisation spectroscopy based on numerical integration of population rate equations is described. Theoretical polarisation spectra generated by the model are shown to agree with experimental spectra for the F = I + 1 / 2 → F' transitions in Rb and Cs. An investigation of the sub-Doppler dichroic atomic vapour laser locking (DAVLL) technique demonstrates how locking signals can be optimised for the Rb D 2 transitions. The role of polarisation purity in generating the spectra is discussed, and impurities are modeled using a Jones matrix approach. Comparisons with polarisation spectroscopy and DAVLL are used to enhance understanding of atom-light interactions in spectroscopic systems, and indicate methods for optimising locking signals for use in cold atom experiments.
