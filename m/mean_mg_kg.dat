40|$|Sixty-six {{spring and}} winter common wheat genotypes from Central Asian {{breeding}} programs were evaluated for grain concentrations of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). Iron showed large variation among genotypes, ranging from 25 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 1 to 56 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 1 (<b>mean</b> 38 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 1). Similarly, Zn concentration varied among genotypes, ranging between 20 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 1 and 39 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 1 (<b>mean</b> 28 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 1). Spring wheat cultivars possessed higher Fe-grain concentrations than winter wheats. By contrast, winter wheats showed higher Zn-grain concentrations than spring genotypes. Within spring wheat, a strongly significant positive correlation {{was found between}} Fe and Zn. Grain protein content was also significantly (P < 0. 001) correlated with grain Zn and Fe content. There were strong significantly negative correlations between Fe and plant height, and Fe and glutenin content. Similar correlation coefficients were found for Zn. In winter wheat, significant positive correlations were found between Fe and Zn, and between Zn and sulfur (S). Manganese (Mn) and phosphorus (P) were negatively correlated with both Fe and Zn. The additive main effects and multiplicative interactions (AMMI) analysis of genotype × environment interactions for grain Fe and Zn concentrations showed that genotype effects largely controlled Fe concentration, whereas Zn concentration was almost totally dependent on location effects. Spring wheat genotypes Lutescens 574, and Eritrospermum 78; and winter wheat genotypes Navruz, NA 160 /HEINEVII/BUC/ 3 /F 59. 71 //GHK, Tacika, DUCULA//VEE/MYNA, and JUP/ 4 /CLLF/ 3 /II 14. 53 /ODIN//CI 13431 /WA 00477, are promising materials for increasing Fe and Zn concentrations in the grain, as well as enhancing the concentration of promoters of Zn bioavailability, such as S-containing amino acids...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{concentrations}} of arsenic and heavy metals in agricultural soils {{are becoming a}} growing problem in industrialized countries. These harmful elements represent {{the basis of a}} range of problems in the food chain, and are a potential hazard for animal and human health. It is therefore important to gauge their absolute and relative concentrations in soils that are used for crop production. In this study the arsenic and heavy metal concentrations in 274 mineral soil samples and 38 organogenic soil samples taken from South Savo province in 2000 were determined using the aqua regia extraction technique. The soil samples were collected from 23 farms. The elements analyzed were arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc. The median concentrations in the mineral soils were:As 2. 90 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Cd 0. 084 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Cr 17. 0 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Cu 13. 0 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Hg 0. 060 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Ni 5. 4 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Pb 7. 7 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Zn 36. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1.

Five samples of textile packaging intended for cooked meat production were analysed as well asthe final product which was filled into packages. Subsequently an analysis {{was carried out}} (after 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of storage) of the finished meat products stored {{over the course of}} their intended shelf life at ambient temperature of 4 °C. Determination of phthalates was conducted by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with UV detection at a wavelength of 224 nm on the Zorbax Eclipse C 8 column. The content of phthalates in the final product was below the limit of quantification. According to the Regulation of the Commission (EU) No. 10 / 2011, the specific migration limit of products intended for food contact is 1. 5 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 of food simulant for DEHP and  0. 3 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 for DBP. After filling and the first day of storage of the meat product, four package samples release the said phthalates to an extent that it exceeded the limits of the Commission Regulation (EU) No. 10 / 2011. Already after the seventh day of storage, all samples (with the exception of sample 2 for DBP) exceeded SMLs. Monitoring of each phthalate migration in individual samples during storage (for 28 days) produced a rising tendency.   In sample 1, DBP increased from 0. 40 to 3. 37 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, while DEHP from 0. 58 to 14. 66 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1.

Results The content of oil in hempseed registers a slight decrease in the production records of 2011, losses due to drought {{and low levels of}} precipitation during the growth period. The greatest loss is found in Diana monoecious variety (26. 54 - 20. 82 %) followed by Zenit varieties (27. 37 - 22. 97 %), Armanca (29. 27 - 25. 32 %), Silvana (28. 89 - 25. 04 %) and Denise (26. 96 - 25. 30 %). Siccative hemp oil has a yellowish green color and an iodine index of 140 – 156 g I 2 / 100 g oil. Hemp seed are rich in mineral based Ca (144 – 955 mg/ 100 g seed), Mg (237 – 694 mg/ 100 g seed), K (463 – 2821 mg/ 100 g seed), Fe (1133 - 2400 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1), Mn (63 – 110 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) and Zn (42 - 94 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1). For the soil the following macroelements concentrations were determined: Ca (2100 – 2520 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1), <b>Mg</b> (320 – 376 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) and K (232 – 257 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1). Mn (156 – 197 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) and Zn (54 – 67 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) remain within normal limits for Romania. The soils in the experience area contain large amounts of Fe (19000 – 20430 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1). The presence of K in large quantities determines the accumulation of large quantities of Fe in the soil. Conclusion Hempseed belonging to the five Romanian varieties are rich source of nutrients (Ca, Mg, K) and unsaturated oil easily digestible by the body, but the presence of Cd concentrations above the upper limit puts a question mark over the use of seeds in various food products. Hemp extracts easily certain metals from the soil.

The protective and ameliorative effects of diphenhydramine on the signs of dichlorvos poisoning were examined and compared with those of atropine. Plasma and whole brain cholinesterase activities of chicks treated with diphen¬hydramine and/or dichlorvos were measured by an electrometric method. Results: Diphenhydramine at 10 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, intramuscularly (i. m.) im¬mediately after oral dosing with dichlorvos increased the oral LD 50 value of the insecticide from 6. 49 to 17. 14 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, whereas atropine at 2 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, i. m. increased it to 22. 55 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1. The oral dosing of dichlorvos at 8 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 caused acute signs of cholinergic poisoning in the chicks. The best effective dosage of diphenhydramine was at 10 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, i. m. immediately after the oral dichlorvos dosing, which significantly in¬creased the latencies to onset of signs of poisoning and significantly prevented the 2 h and 24 h lethalities. Diphenhydramine also significant¬ly decreased the occurrence of signs of poisoning and reduced total toxicity score in the chicks. Diphenhydramine, similar to atropine, given at times of - 15, 0 and + 5 min relative to the time of dichlorvos dosing also ameliorated dichlorvos-induced poisoning in the chicks to vary¬ing extents. Dichlorvos alone at the oral doses of 2 and 4 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 significantly reduced cholinesterase activity in the plasma and whole brain.
