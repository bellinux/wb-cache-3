He added, [...] "Many of his jokes fell flat with {{the stars in the}} Kodak Theatre, and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post commented, [...] "It's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year's Oscars, hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart, a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by." [...] Moreover, he derided the [...] "piles and piles and <b>miles</b> <b>and</b> <b>miles</b> of clips from films present and past" [...] writing that it [...] "squandered the visual luster" [...] of the ceremony. Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked, [...] "Stewart, usually a very funny guy, displayed a lack of beginner's luck as first-time host...His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar." [...] He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner's acceptance speeches calling it [...] "distracting and obnoxious." ...|$|E

Just as {{he is about to}} tell them that the {{restaurant}} is closed, Mr. Krabs suddenly appears and snatches the phone from Squidward's hands. The customer wants to order a pizza and have it delivered, an order Mr. Krabs happily accepts knowing he could get extra money. Squidward protests this by saying the restaurant doesn't serve pizza nor do they do deliveries, but Mr. Krabs spontaneously makes a pizza out of Krabby Patties and forces Squidward and SpongeBob to deliver it. After SpongeBob does a few [...] "safety checks" [...] of the delivery boat, Squidward forces him to drive. However, SpongeBob cannot drive as he is still in boating school, but Squidward insists saying [...] "it's just around the corner". SpongeBob tries to shift into reverse, but panics and ends up [...] "backing up" [...] for <b>miles</b> <b>and</b> <b>miles</b> until the boat runs out of gas {{in the middle of a}} desert. Squidward complains about this, and eventually kicks the boat out of frustration after SpongeBob mentions that the pizza is getting cold. This causes the boat to suddenly drive back to the Krusty Krab, leaving the two stranded and to continue their delivery on foot.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the album}} did not gain much {{attention}} from the general press on its original release, the album retrospectively has been given critical acclaim and has been cited {{as one of the}} most important hardcore punk albums ever released. Rolling Stone in their retrospective review says that [...] "Black Flag lived up to it, defining L.A. hardcore punk with violent guitar and the pissed-off scream of Henry Rollins, especially on [...] "TV Party" [...] and [...] "Rise Above." [...] Punks still listen to Damaged, and parents still hate it." [...] Pitchfork in their retrospective review from 2002 says [...] "Black Flag took on the essential ferocity of men about to snap, and combined that with an acidic sense of humor and these things called 'songs', a concept that many of the wannabe punkers of the day were still trying to sort out. Damaged hit in 1981, and by 1982, four bars bearing the Black Flag name had been airbrushed across <b>miles</b> <b>and</b> <b>miles</b> of spiked leather. Conflicting feelings of violence, apathy, rage, and self-satire course through this one, the essential touchstone of the entire genre of West Coast hardcore, crystallizing the turmoil of the movement. Listen to 'Rise Above' and try not to be incensed, then listen to 'TV Party' and try not to laugh out loud. That's awesome." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a very high rating of a [...] "A-" [...] and saying [...] "...Greg Ginn is the greatest noise guitarist since Johnny Thunders, new vocalist Henry Rollins can snarl along any tortured contour they serve up, and 'Rise Above', 'Six Pack', and the uproarious 'TV Party' prove they can write songs as well as gnash fragments." [...] John Dougan of AllMusic gave it a perfect five star rating saying [...] "...Although Black Flag had been recording for three years prior to this release, the fact that Henry Rollins was now their lead singer made all the difference. His furious bellow and barely contained ferocity was the missing piece the band needed to become great. Also, guitarist/mastermind Greg Ginn wrote a slew of great songs for this record that, while suffused with the usual punk conceits (alienation, boredom, disenfranchisement), were capable of making one laugh out loud, especially the protoslacker satire 'TV Party'..." [...] and also noted [...] "...Extremely controversial when it was released, Damaged endured the slings and arrows of outrageous criticism (some reacted as though this record alone would cause the fall of America's youth) to become and remain an important document of its time." ...|$|E

[...] History has not, even to this late day, justified it. [...] Many of the former acquaintances and friends of the writer were present, and some of them were killed.” [...] “It was a depressing sight for the writer who could in memory review the surrounded band in rags, shivering in cold and weak from irrepressible hunger over months of fruitless search for game to supply them what was denied them by crooked agents and grafting politicians, and had been trailed like wild animals by the relentless army, and finally driven, like cattle to the slaughter, at the unattractive fields we gazed upon.” ...|$|E
