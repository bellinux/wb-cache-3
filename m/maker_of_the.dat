5|$|The {{bidding process}} pitted Taiwan High Speed Rail Consortium (THSRC) against the Chunghwa High Speed Rail Consortium (CHSRC). THSRC's bid {{was based on}} the {{high-speed}} technology platform of Eurotrain, a joint venture between GEC-Alsthom, the main <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French TGV, and Siemens, the main <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German ICE, while CHSRC's bid was based on Japanese Shinkansen technology supplied by Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC), a joint venture of Japanese companies. THSRC, which submitted the lower bid and promised to build the line with zero net cost from the government, was chosen as preferred bidder in September 1997. The group was renamed and formally established as the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC) in May 1998. THSRC and the government signed the BOT agreement on 23 July 1998.|$|E

5|$|According to Jain texts, 24 Tirthankaras have {{appeared}} on earth in the current time cycle of Jain cosmology. Mahavira was the last Tirthankara of Avasarpiṇī (present descending phase or half of the time cycle). A Tirthankara (<b>Maker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River-Crossing, saviour, spiritual teacher) signifies the founder of a tirtha, which means a fordable passage across the sea of interminable cycles of births and deaths (called saṃsāra).|$|E
5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E

5|$|Many {{events at}} the Queen's Hall were not {{presented}} by Newman. The hall was frequently let to organisations such as the Bach Choir and the Philharmonic Society (from 1903 the Royal Philharmonic Society), and later the London Choral Society and Royal Choral Society. The hall was used {{for a wide range}} of other activities, including balls, military band concerts under Sousa, lectures, public meetings, Morris dancing, Eurythmics and religious services. On 14 January 1896, the UK's first public film show was presented at the Queen's Hall to members and wives of the Royal Photographic Society by the <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kineopticon and Fellow of the society, Birt Acres, and his colleague, Arthur Melbourne-Cooper.

Using this email address Cayce makes contact with Stella Volkova whose sister Nora is the <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film clips.|$|E
5|$|By 1900, {{the lumber}} {{industry}} had declined, and the city's economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a silk mill. In 1938, the Piper Aircraft Corporation, <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Piper Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained {{one of the}} city's biggest employers until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida. The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment {{rate of more than}} 20% in Lock Haven in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the 1880s in Castanea Township, closed in 2001. By 2005, 32% of the city's labor force was employed in health care, education, or social services, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in retail trade, 13% in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and smaller fractions in other sectors. The city's biggest employers, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania and UPMC Susquehanna Lock Haven hospital, are among the seven biggest employers in Clinton County.|$|E

5|$|Rau {{grew up in}} {{a suburb}} of Stuttgart, where early on he became active in socialist youth organizations. After {{military}} service in World War I, he participated in the German Revolution of 1918-19. From 1920 onward, he was a leading agricultural policy <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communist Party of Germany (KPD). This ended in 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power. Shortly afterward Rau was thrown in jail for two years. As an enemy of the Nazi regime in Germany he was imprisoned, in total, {{for more than half of}} the time of Hitler's reign. After his first imprisonment he emigrated in 1935 to the Soviet Union (USSR). From there, in 1937, he went on to Spain, where he participated in the Spanish Civil War as a leader of one of the International Brigades. In 1939, he was arrested in France, and was delivered by the Vichy regime back to Nazi Germany in 1942. After a few months in a Gestapo prison, he was transferred to the Mauthausen Concentration Camp in March 1943. While in the concentration camp he participated in conspiratorial prisoner activities, which led to a camp uprising in the final days before the end of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work is unknown; it is {{not signed}} or marked, and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this. There {{are a number of}} goldsmiths' names known from {{accounts}} and other records, but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker. Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of joyaux, secular and religious, produced for the extended Valois royal family and other buyers. Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what must have been a continuous flow of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various inventories of the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry. Another possibility is that the reliquary was made and given as a gift, as many such pieces were, in between inventories.|$|E
