25|$|The Turing test is {{concerned}} strictly {{with how the}} subject acts– the external behaviour of the machine. In this regard, it takes a behaviourist or functionalist approach {{to the study of}} the mind. The example of ELIZA suggests that a machine passing the test may be able to simulate human conversational behaviour by following a simple (but large) list of mechanical rules, without thinking or having a <b>mind</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
500|$|A core {{element of}} F.E.A.R. is its horror theme, which is heavily {{inspired}} by Japanese horror. The design team attempted to keep [...] " [...] {{psychology of the}} encounter" [...] in the player's <b>mind</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times, in order to [...] "get under [...] skin", {{as opposed to the}} [...] "in your face 'monsters jumping out of closets' approach". Lead designer Craig Hubbard stated in an interview that [...] "horror is extremely fragile ... you can kill it by spelling things out too clearly and you can undermine it with too much ambiguity". He remarked that he attempted to strike a balance with the narrative elements of F.E.A.R., to give players [...] "enough clues so that [...] can form [...] own theories about what's going on, but ideally [...] be left with some uncertainty". Lead level designer John Mulkey stated, [...] "Creating expectation and then messing with that expectation is extremely important, predictability ruins a scary mood".|$|E

It was later sent for rhythmic airplay in the United States on May 24, 2011, followed by an add on mainstream radio stations on June 21, 2011. In the United Kingdom, [...] "In the Dark" [...] was released in a digital extended play (EP) alongside three remixes of the track {{as well as its}} music video. Rapper Flo Rida is featured on an official remix of the song, and Dev stated that she wanted to make a remix as it would be refreshing and [...] "great for radio". She explained that a rapper would suit the song well and that she would enjoy the remix when hearing it on the radio. She elaborated on choosing Flo Rida, saying: [...] "We went in thinking about who would be cool on the radio and who would fit the fact that it's kind of a flavorful song and not really a hood rap song. Flo Rida fit, and he completely killed it." [...] 50 Cent is featured on another remix of the track, which he recorded at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza (Spain) in August 2011, while Kanye West appears on an unofficial remix, of which Dev said: [...] "That was just kind of something that floated onto the Internet and the airwaves, which I don't <b>mind</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> because it sounds absolutely amazing and it's one of my favorite remixes too." ...|$|E

I love fashion, and I think so many gay people have amazing style. So that is a compliment to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wordsworth's poetry, {{especially}} when the Lyrical Ballads had been published 26 years earlier, was such a radical departure that scarcely anyone understood it. Even at the time Hazlitt was writing this essay, [...] "The vulgar do not read , the learned, who see all things through books, do not understand them, the great despise, the fashionable may ridicule them: but the author has created himself {{an interest in the}} heart of the retired and lonely student of nature, which can never die." [...] "It may be considered as a characteristic of our poet's writings," [...] Hazlitt reflects, [...] "that they either make no impression on the <b>mind</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> seem mere nonsense-verses, or that they leave a mark behind them that never wears out. ... To one class of readers he appears sublime, to another (and we fear the largest) ridiculous." ...|$|E

"Correspondence between Andrew Preston ... and his buying {{agents in}} Jamaica reveals the former's {{concerns}} with maintaining quality {{in a competitive}} market place: [...] "he time is past when importers can make a profit on thin and ordinary fruit ... and I trust our Jamaica people will keep it in <b>mind</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times."' In a subsequent letter, Preston acknowledged that his emphasis on quality was causing tension within the company {{but he refused to}} lower his standards: [...] "I presume your people [...] think we are disposed to criticize your selections but we are driven to it by the power of competition - naturally our best customers want the best fruit and I assure you we find it difficult to hold them with fruit of poorer quality than our competitors offer them. It is very plain to my mind that the successful company of the future is the one that controls the growing of its own fruit."'" ...|$|E

5000|$|As with Spanish [...] "gringo", laowai is not {{considered}} a necessarily offensive term but may become so from context (tone, manner, situation, etc.). Among the Chinese, the term is informal and {{may be used in}} a neutral, genial, or even good-humored way; however, it is othering and some may consider it racist. Varyingly, it is ironically embraced, begrudgingly accepted, openly resented, or, most likely, not <b>minded</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> among the expatriate community.|$|R
