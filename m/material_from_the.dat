5|$|Aside from fossils clearly {{belonging}} to Plateosaurus, {{there is much}} prosauropod <b>material</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> German Knollenmergel in museum collections, most of it labeled as Plateosaurus, that {{does not belong to}} the type species and possibly not to Plateosaurus at all. Some of this material is not diagnostic; other material has been recognized to be different, but was never sufficiently described.|$|E
50|$|The Asuka Historical Museum {{primarily}} preserves {{and exhibits}} <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 6th to 8th centuries, specifically <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Asuka period (538-710) of Japanese history.

5|$|The museum's Film and Video Archive {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} film {{archives}} in the world. The archive preserves a range of historically significant film and video material, including the official British film record of the First World War. Notable among the archive's First World War holdings is The Battle of the Somme, a pioneering 1916 documentary film (which was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2005), and Der Magische Gürtel, a German 1917 propaganda film about the submarine U-35. The archive's Second World War holdings include unedited film shot by British military cameramen, which document combat actions such as the British landings on D-Day in June 1944, and the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. The archive also holds government information films and propaganda features such as Target for Tonight and Desert Victory. The archive's post-Second World War collections include <b>material</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Korean War, Cold War material, the former film library of NATO, and material produced by the United Nations UNTV service in Bosnia. As an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, the archive continues to receive <b>material</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Defence. The archive also seeks to acquire amateur film taken by both service personnel and civilian cameramen. <b>Material</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> collection was used to make a number of well-known TV documentary series including The Great War and The World at War. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its film archive as being in excess of 23,000 hours of film, video and digital footage.|$|E

5|$|Antlion larvae {{are capable}} of {{capturing}} and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods, and can even subdue small spiders. The projections in the jaws of the larva are hollow and through this, the larva sucks the fluids out of its victim. After the contents are consumed, the dry carcass is flicked out of the pit. The larva readies the pit once again by throwing out collapsed <b>material</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> center, steepening the pit walls to the angle of repose.|$|E

Arboreal termites nests can account {{for as much as}} 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood <b>material</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stems and branches of mangrove trees, namely, Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemose (white mangrove).|$|E
