40|$|This essay {{argues that}} by {{labelling}} British women’s <b>mental</b> health <b>distress</b> and treatment {{in terms of}} a purely medical model, underlying contributory social structures and phenomena such as gendered roles, ethnicity and poverty, have largely been ignored by the (male dominated) psychiatric profession. This labelling is historically rooted in the pathologisation of the feminine condition; therefore, women’s mental ill health is substantially a social construct and a product of a patriarchal society. To fully explore a way through <b>mental</b> health <b>distress</b> - a term used by MIND to emphasise the inorganic origins of many mental health problems - labels need to be unmasked and emphasis placed upon the socio-economic contexts of women’s lives. This is not to deny that men suffer from mental health distress; women and men’s patterns of mental health problems differ and the reasons for this also require discussion. All strands of feminism can touch upon women’s mental health. However, because of the socially constructed nature of <b>mental</b> health <b>distress,</b> particular attention should be paid to socialist and radical feminists’ theoretical approaches and how they can offer alleviation through translation into policy formulation and practical action...|$|R
25|$|Fields such {{as social}} psychiatry, {{clinical}} psychology, and sociology may offer non-biomedical accounts of <b>mental</b> <b>distress</b> and disorder for certain ailments and are sometimes critical of biopsychiatry. Social critics believe biopsychiatry fails to satisfy the scientific method because they believe there is no testable biological evidence of mental disorders. Thus, these critics view biological psychiatry as a pseudoscience attempting to portray psychiatry as a biological science.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{frequency}} of American Indian alcoholism, a stereotype {{has been applied to}} all American Indians. As with most groups, the incidence of substance abuse is related to issues of poverty and <b>mental</b> <b>distress,</b> both of which may be, in part, the result of racial stereotyping and discrimination. Treatment for substance abuse by Native Americans is more effective when it is community-based, and addresses the issues of cultural identification.|$|E

25|$|The 1790s saw the {{beginnings}} of moral treatment being introduced for people with <b>mental</b> <b>distress.</b> The concept of a safe asylum, proposed by Philippe Pinel and William Tuke, offered protection and care at institutions for patients who had been previously abused or enslaved. In the United States, Dorothea Dix was instrumental in opening 32 state asylums to provide quality care for the ill. Dix also {{was in charge of}} the Union Army Nurses during the American Civil War, caring for both Union and Confederate soldiers. Although it was a promising movement, attendants and nurses were often accused of abusing or neglecting the residents and isolating them from their families.|$|E
25|$|The 1808 Act {{was passed}} to empower county Justices of the Peace (JPs) to {{construct}} asylums financed {{out of the}} local rates, which proved very unpopular. As JPs faced annual re-election, they often met resistance to this policy. The cost of keeping lunatics in jails and workhouses had previously been charged to their parish of birth, and continued indefinitely as there was no attempt to cure them. To make matters worse, the Corn Laws kept food prices high while the Enclosure Act of 1813 removed the right of poor people to use the common lands to support themselves, causing added <b>mental</b> <b>distress</b> to the already impoverished.|$|E
25|$|Even as {{clinical}} psychology was growing, working {{with issues of}} serious <b>mental</b> <b>distress</b> remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists. However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment.

Due {{in large part to the}} success of these tests, assessment was to become the core discipline of {{clinical psychology}} for the next quarter century, when another war would propel the field into treatment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: Sibling {{aggression}} is common but often dismissed as benign. We examine whether {{being a victim}} of various forms of sibling {{aggression is}} associated with children 2 ̆ 7 s and adolescents 2 ̆ 7 <b>mental</b> health <b>distress.</b> We also contrast the consequences of sibling versus peer aggression for children 2 ̆ 7 s and adolescents 2 ̆ 7 mental health. METHODS: We analyzed a national probability sample (n = 3599) that included telephone interviews about past year victimizations conducted with youth aged 10 to 17 or an adult caregiver concerning children aged 0 to 9. RESULTS: Children ages 0 to 9 and youth ages 10 to 17 who experienced sibling aggression {{in the past year}} (ie, psychological, property, mild or severe physical assault), reported greater <b>mental</b> health <b>distress.</b> Children ages 0 to 9 showed greater <b>mental</b> health <b>distress</b> than did youth aged 10 to 17 in the case of mild physical assault, but they did not differ for the other types of sibling aggression. Comparison of sibling versus peer aggression generally showed that sibling and peer aggression independently and uniquely predicted worsened mental health. CONCLUSIONS: The possible importance of sibling aggression for children 2 ̆ 7 s and adolescents 2 ̆ 7 mental health should not be dismissed. The mobilization to prevent and stop peer victimization and bullying should expand to encompass sibling aggression as well...|$|R

40|$|People who endure <b>mental</b> and {{emotional}} <b>distress</b> experience {{a plethora of}} negative experiences beyond {{the effects of the}} symptoms themselves. For centuries, the designation of labels of difference; that is, those which transgress approved social norms, have affected the lived experiences of those individuals, and more widely in structuring responses, engagements with, and attitudes between society and the individual. Understanding the creation of tainted identities, particularly of those with experience of <b>mental</b> {{and emotional}} <b>distress</b> have been well rehearsed in the sociological literature of {{the second half of the}} twentieth century. Central to much of this analysis has been to understand the nature of the manufacture of deviant identities, how they are sustained and the impact of these identities on those who experience them. This paper explores the experience of those with <b>mental</b> and emotional <b>distress</b> as a victim of crime. The interconnectedness of matters of identity created though the application of a diagnosis of illness/disorder is addressed as is the crisis of criminal victimisation. This is achieved via an exploration of contemporary concerns surrounding victims of crime with experience of <b>mental</b> and emotional <b>distress,</b> including the (further) loss of voice and agency when interfacing with agencies of the State...|$|R
25|$|Psychiatric nursing {{or mental}} health nursing is the {{appointed}} {{position of a}} nursing that has specialized in mental health and cares for {{people of all ages}} with mental illness or <b>mental</b> <b>distress,</b> such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, depression, dementia and many more. Nurses in this area receive specific training in psychological therapies, building a therapeutic alliance, dealing with challenging behavior, and the administration of psychiatric medication. In most countries, a psychiatric nurse will have to have attained a bachelor's degree in nursing to become a registered nurse (RN) and specialise in mental health. Degrees vary in different countries, and are governed by country-specific regulations. Psychiatric nurses work in hospitals, mental institutes, correctional institutes, and many other facilities.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Wollersheim vs. Church of Scientology (1980), former member Larry Wollersheim sued the {{organization}} for <b>mental</b> <b>distress,</b> and was awarded $30million in damages. On appeal, the award was reduced to $2.5million. In 1996, Wollersheim was awarded an additional $130,506.71 in attorney's fees incurred while defending against a church lawsuit that was dismissed for violating a California law prohibiting strategic lawsuits against public participation. The Church vowed not to pay the award, and the case dragged through the courts for 22 years, including two separate appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States and two additional appeals to the Supreme Court of California. In early 2002, the case was finally settled, with the Church of Scientology paying Larry Wollersheim $8,674,643.|$|E
25|$|According to Eichar's theory, the {{infrasound}} {{generated by}} the wind as it passed {{over the top of}} the Holatchahl mountain was responsible for causing physical discomfort and <b>mental</b> <b>distress</b> in the hikers. Eichar claims that, because of their panic, the hikers were driven to leave the tent by whatever means necessary, and fled down the slope. By the time they were further down the hill, they would have been out of the infrasound's path and would have regained their composure, but in the darkness would be unable to return to their shelter. The traumatic injuries suffered by three of the victims were the result of their stumbling over the ledge of a ravine in the darkness and landing on the rocks at the bottom.|$|E

40|$|Background: Catastrophic {{disasters}} {{often are}} associated with massive structural, economic, and popu-lation devastation; less understood are the long-term mental health consequences. This study mea-sures the prevalence and predictors of <b>mental</b> health <b>distress</b> and disability of hurricane survivors {{over an extended period}} of recovery in a postdisaster setting. Methods: A representative sample of 1077 displaced or greatly affected households was drawn in 2006 using a stratified cluster sampling of federally subsidized emergency housing settings in Louisiana and Mississippi, and of Mississippi census tracts designated as having experienced major damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Two rounds of data collection were conducted: a baseline face-to-face interview at 6 to 12 months post-Katrina, and a telephone follow-up at 20 to 23 months after the disaster.
