Nicotero stated: [...] "On 'action', <b>my</b> <b>makeup</b> effects crew pulled the upper body apart, and the physical effects crew squibbed all the bags.

[...] Because rubber constituted {{a large percentage of}} the suit, weights were added on to ensure that it would sink in the water.

40|$|To know one’s self, the “real self”, {{without the}} {{distortion}} of an “idealized self” {{is quite a}} challenge in today’s society. Based on personal beliefs, social values, childhood experiences, and learned cultural values, individuals are forced to navigate through life abiding by certain stipulations while also being encouraged to be an individual. Do we really know and understand who we are? Can we truly be comfortable with {{who we are as}} individuals? How does this affect our ability to interact with others? As a visual artist, my work has become a public display of internal conflicts due to past experiences that result in emotional traumas to the personal psyche. This emotional build up has led me to develop a body of work that not only expresses me as an artist, but it becomes a therapeutic tool in <b>my</b> characteristic <b>makeup...</b>|$|R
500|$|The Beauty Process also {{contains}} heavier songs that {{are reminiscent of}} the band's previous albums. The song [...] "Drama" [...] features a guitar solo played with a Micro Jammers' toy guitar. Sparks explained that she was getting frustrated with it, commenting [...] "Fuck it, I can't play these riffs, let the Micro Jammers do it for $1.99." [...] The song was described by Spin as [...] " [...] off like Helmet sans pretentious time signatures". The track [...] "Bad Things" [...] was described as [...] "a full-throttle blast of urban paranoia", while [...] "The Masses Are Asses" [...] deals with social outrage and rude humor. The album's title refers to two different things: the first part, [...] "The Beauty Process", is what Sparks would call [...] "putting <b>my</b> fright <b>makeup</b> on before a show", while the second part, [...] "Triple Platinum", is a joke about L7's career as the band had yet to reach gold status.|$|R

[...] ("Love <b>my</b> <b>makeup</b> remover!"—but {{it sounds}} like a {{plausible}} German word for monkey to English-only speakers), a recurring reference to Dieter's pet monkey, Klaus. Dieter told his guests that being allowed to touch Klaus was a privilege, but Klaus would often bite them when they tried to do so.|$|E
5000|$|Basia {{was moved}} to write [...] "Cruising for Bruising" [...] by the {{perceived}} eclipsing of her relationship with Danny White who besides being her producer and keyboardist had become her romantic partner.

[...] "It's not in <b>my</b> <b>makeup</b> to be bitter. But no matter how exciting or thrilling my life now is, I will carry a sense of sadness with me. I had visualized myself dying in that job.

500|$|Rowland stated to Rap Up TV that [...] "the {{concept of}} the video is very futuristic and great.

[...] According to Love, in the clip Rowland is transformed into a fashionista, [...] "Kelly's look in this video is just utterly sexy. It's like a jungle feel. I feel like we're in Avatar somewhere, running through the woods, minus the blue paint." [...] Later one of her outfits was described as an [...] "Avatar-esque bodysuit". Rowland said [...] "I had to pull out my dancing shoes for this video!" [...] The video features [...] "Kelly Rowland facing off against herself. The two Kellys start {{what appears to be a}} voguing competition on the dancefloor, then are flanked by respective dance teams." [...] Guetta makes an appearance at the end of the clip he [...] "undergoes a 'Transformers'-like metamorphosis, turning into a mixer." [...] Paper magazine described Rowland's look in the video as [...] "superhero-esque". Joanna Goh from MSN China said that in the clip [...] " [...] sports a new femme fatale image a la the bodysuits and masculine imaging".|$|R

So that process was started before the pilot really, what was this man like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task.

5000|$|For {{his second}} feature and first studio film albeit {{independently}} financed, David Lynch furnished the musical direction and sound design. Lynch tried {{to design the}} make-up himself too, but the design didn't work. Lynch referred to that episode {{as one of the}} [...] "darkest moments of <b>my</b> life". The <b>makeup,</b> now supervised by Christopher Tucker, was directly designed from casts of Merrick’s body, which had been kept in the Royal London Hospital’s private museum. The makeup took seven to eight hours to apply each day and two hours to delicately remove. John Hurt would arrive on set at 5am and shoot his scenes from noon until 10pm. When Hurt was having his first experiences with the inconveniences of applying make-up and having to perform with it, he called his wife saying [...] "I think they finally managed to make me hate acting." [...] Because of the strain on the actor, he worked alternate days. [...] Lynch originally wanted Jack Nance for the title character. [...] "But it just wasn't in the cards," [...] Lynch says; the role went to John Hurt after Brooks, Lynch and Sanger saw his performance in The Naked Civil Servant as Quentin Crisp.|$|R

5000|$|Mims {{continued}} to race automobiles for 12 years. In 1969, Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Smith {{wrote a column}} about Mims when she visited the Los Angeles auto show. Mims described her pre-race rituals to Smith:"I psych myself. I remove all <b>my</b> <b>makeup.</b> I think stern. I bristle. I don't talk to anybody. You cannot think nice. Chivalry is dead on the racetrack. You're out there only for one thing. To win. Nobody remembers second place."She told another reporter, [...] "A lot of the male drivers think I'm out there to prove that I can beat them because they're men. That isn't so. They claim that I sometimes charge into the corners, cutting them off. I don't mean to. I'm just trying to win." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blue was {{an almost}} instant {{critical}} and commercial success, peaking in the top 20 in the Billboard Album Charts in September and also hitting the British Top 3. The lushly produced [...] "Carey" [...] was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of Blue departed further from the sounds of Ladies of the Canyon. Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on Mitchell's voice and emotions ("All I Want", [...] "A Case of You"), while others such as [...] "Blue", [...] "River" [...] and [...] "The Last Time I Saw Richard" [...] were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment.

We all suffer for our loneliness, {{but at the time}} of Blue, our pop stars never admitted these things." [...] In its lyrics, the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work, with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love (for example, in [...] "California"). Mitchell later remarked, [...] "At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study that}} engages with four major fields of study, as they are currently constituted: World Literature, Eastern European Literature, Postcolonial Studies, and World Cinema. More specifically, it {{is concerned with the}} Southeastern European historical novel about the Ottoman Empire and film narratives of the post- 1989 period. I argue that historical narratives continue to {{play a central role in}} shaping contemporary nationalisms. Analyzing the role of the Ottoman Empire in the region?s socio-political and religious <b>makeup,</b> <b>my</b> dissertation develops new analyses of frontier narratives of Southeastern Europe as texts that narrate the nation vis-?-vis imperial conflicts. This dissertation adopts a periphery-centered approach to literary and film studies and shows that historical focus on imperial centers has allowed for little consideration of frontier narratives. I broaden the scope of World Literature, World Cinema, and Postcolonial Studies by shifting the direction of analysis to imperial frontiers, which have been relegated to the margins of history and of literary and cinematic canons. By critically examining the Ottoman Empire as a colonial force, my research adds breadth to postcolonial studies and advances the discipline into nontraditional lines of inquiry. This dissertation is inherently focused on ethnic and transnational literatures and film that are underrepresented and under-distributed. By taking the case of Southeastern European literature and film, I argue that we need to rethink what constitutes regional and transnational literature and film by confronting the limitations of World Literature and Cinema, and of Postcolonial Studies...|$|R

5000|$|Rarely has a film {{centered}} on a character so superficial and unconvincing, and played with such unrelenting sameness. I didn't hate it so much as feel sorry for it ... The central question posed by [...] "My Life in Ruins" [...] is, {{what happened to the}} Nia Vardalos who wrote and starred in My Big Fat Greek Wedding? She was lovable, earthy, sassy, plumper, more of a mess, and the movie grossed more than $300 million. Here she's thinner, blonder, better dressed, looks younger and knows it. She's like the winner of a beauty makeover at a Hollywood studio. She has that don't touch <b>my</b> <b>makeup!</b> look ... Now she is rich, famous and perhaps taking herself seriously after being worked over for one too many magazine covers ...

5000|$|... "Peter" [...] {{was set in}} 1985, with a {{much younger}} Walter and Peter Bishop, and also {{features}} an appearance by Walter's wife Elizabeth. Actor John Noble used material he had created since the airing of the pilot, which he explained was his sense of [...] "what was this man like before he deteriorated." [...] The production crew tried different methods with the actor to create a younger Walter, such as changes to his hair, make-up, and wardrobe; they ultimately decided on using [...] "tabs" [...] to keep the wrinkles in his face back.

5000|$|Beautiful was {{a turning}} point in Meghana Raj's career. Although she herself was Prakash's first choice for the role, she was {{approached}} only four days before the shooting started.

I never dreamt that I could carry off the role and the entire credit goes to my director V.K Prakash.

I was asked to bring all my bindis, out of which one was selected to be my only makeup in the film." [...] Meghana admits that it was challenging to achieve the right amount of underplayed sensuality, which was part of the character of Anjali, who conveys a lot through her eyes and body language.|$|E

Introduction: The study of character, {{the study of}} the impulses which prompt humans to dreads includes also a study of one’s own impulses. In interpreting the character of these three great women I can only give to you my idea, my feeling, as to what would prompt me to the same action. I must act as a minor in which these characters are reflected, if <b>my</b> <b>makeup</b> is warped I can only give to you a warped reflection which may be so different from your idea, that it seems absurd. It is not necessary for me to speak of Shakespeare’s life. For that you call him to those who have carefully studied the history as well as the impulses of that great master soul, in whose mind all minds existed, in whose heart every passion existed, each being sovereign for a time...|$|E
40|$|I am a traditionalist - one who {{maintains}} that the representational object, the recognizable subject matter, is still a valid and important part of painting. Color, line, shape, and spatial considerations in painting have no meaning for me if disconnected from an image. I need this quality of form to attain the element of content. Within <b>my</b> <b>makeup</b> {{as a person and}} as an artist, there is a certain demand for concrete relationships, perfection, infallibility, and honesty. I strive to maintain these ideals in everyday life as well as in my painting. In the light of these ideals, I have chosen to express myself through a "photorealist" approach to painting. This particular approach or style demands the total control of the artist's visual perceptive faculties and a precise technical knowledge of the media in which he is working. I regard the photograph as a useful tool that can control temporal and environmental changes, so that I may study the intricate and subtle tonal relationships which occur within the subjects of my paintings. These relationships in fact become the subject matter of my paintings. The photograph also enables me to see details that in casual observation might never be noticed. I consider its use comparable to the use of a still-life model under controlled studio conditions. This approach implies a sterile, detached, and purely unemotional relationship to the act of creation and a totally unemotional end product; this is a fallacy. I consider myself an interpreter of reality and interpretation implies subjective selection which operates on both a conscious and an unconscious level. (See more in text. ...|$|E
