Water-melons, tomatoes, onions, and pimento, or large pepper (pimentão, siliquastrum, ndungu ya yenéne), useful to produce [...] "crocodiles' tears;" [...] mint, and parsley flourish remarkably; turnips are eatable after two months; cabbage and lettuce, beet, carrot, and endive after three or four.

Manioc ripens between the sixth and ninth month, plantains and bananas once a year, cotton and rice in four months, and maize in forty days--with irrigation it is easy to grow three annual crops. The time for planting is before the rains, which here last six weeks to two months, September and October. The staple of commerce is now the nguba, or ground-nut (plural, jinguba), which Merolla calls incumba, with sometimes a little milho (maize), and Calavance beans. Of fruits we find trellised grapes, pines, and guavas, which, as at Fernando Po, are a weed. The agrumi, limes, oranges and citrons are remarkably fine, and hold, as of old, a high place in the simple medicines of the country. A cup of lime-leaf tea, drunk warm in the morning, is the favourite emetic and cathartic: even in Pliny's day we find [...] "Malus Assyria, quam alii vocant medicam (<b>Mediam?,</b> venenis medetur" [...] (xii. 7). On the Gold Coast and in the Gaboon region, colic and dysentery are cured by a calabash full of lime- juice, [...] "laced" [...] with red pepper. The peculiarity of European vegetables throughout maritime Congo and Angola is the absence of all flavour combined with the finest appearance; it seems as though something in the earth or atmosphere were wanting to their full development.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{location}} decisions of political parties. We propose a game where agents vote according to ideology and valence, and media create candidates' charisma.

However, and more importantly, we further obtain that depending on the media outlets the voters choose to attend, the equilibrium location of candidates may differ. Thus, when voters choose among the outlets, candidates may differentiate their platforms. On the other hand, when voters are exposed to all the outlets in the economy, candidates tend more to moderate their ideology, in an attempt to get the favor of all the media. This result suggests that political competition may end in differentiation if voters only attend to the media that are ideologically close to their convictions. In contrast, political moderation is more easily reached if voters get information from various sources and therefore make more balanced judgements...|$|E

40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) is a {{plasma cell}} {{malignancy}} {{characterized by the}} accumulation of malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow (BM). MM cells interact with the microenvironment and induce pathological modifications that in turn support the growth and survival of MM cells.

The current research seeks to determine the level of the spread of drug abuse among prison inmates in the country’s prisons. To name the other objectives pursued by this research one can refer to the distinction of demographic features of the abusers, determining the type of drugs distributed, the method of consumption in prisons, existence of high-risk behaviors and its level among prison inmates as well as taking into consideration the spread of mental disorders along with drug abuse. Such a research has been carried out in the form of a qualitative and quantitative study. The collection of the required data in the qualitative study was conducted by using detailed questionnaires and through interviews in four groups comprising male and female inmates who have committed drug-related crimes or other offences, prison wards as well as prison authorities. In the quantitative study that was conducted on male inmates questionnaires related to demographic and general specifications, the assessment of the situation of drug abuse and individuals’ view towards drug abuse as well as SCL- 90 -R were used.

Participaram do estudo 239 estudantes, com idades entre 11 e 15 anos, sendo que 34, 7 % eram meninos e 65, 3 %, meninas. Construiu-se um questionário baseado em outros instrumentos que continha: questões sobre variáveis sociodemográficas; itens que investigavam a exposição dos estudantes à violência interparental e questões que <b>mediam</b> a violência física e psicológica cometida por mães e pais contra os participantes. O envolvimento em bullying foi avaliado por meio de 26 itens, desenvolvidos especialmente para os propósitos do estudo, baseados em uma versão modificada do questionário de Olweus. Foram encontradas associações entre violência doméstica e bullying, com peculiaridades de acordo com o sexo dos participantes. Estar exposto à violência interparental esteve associado com ser alvo/autor de bullying na escola, especialmente para as meninas, mas não com ser vítima de intimidação. A violência parental direta, por sua vez, aumentou a probabilidade de os meninos relatarem envolvimento em bullying como vítima e também {{a chance}} de ser vítima-agressora. Entre as meninas, sofrer violência por parte dos pais mostrou-se um fator associado somente com atuar em intimidação como alvo/autor. The {{primary purpose of}} the present investigation was {{to examine the relationship between}} bullying and different types of direct and indirect family violence. The research was conducted with 239 grades 5 - 8 students, 34. 7 % boys and 65. 3 % girls. A questionnaire was constructed, containing: questions involving socio-demographic variables; items of the Revised Conflict Tactic Scale, with the goal of examining the youngster's exposure to interparental violence; and items of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales, concerning physical and psychological abuse committed by parents against children. Bullying and victimization were measured by 26 items developed specially for the study's purpose, based on a modified version of Olweus' questionnaire. Associations were found between bullying and domestic violence, but these associations were different according to gender. Being exposed to domestic violence was associated with being a bully/victim in school (especially for girls), but not with being a victim of bullying. On the other hand, parental violence increased the probability of boys reporting being implied in bullying as victims or as bully/victims. In terms of the girls, suffering parental violence was only associated as being a bully/victim...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{walker is}} a common device {{prescribed}} for ambulatory assistance for individuals with balance difficulties or to reduce lower extremity demands following injury or surgery. The long-term use of a walker imposes significant demands on the patient's upper extremities {{that may lead to}} increased risk for development of secondary conditions such as wrist, elbow or shoulder pain. OBJECTIVE: To describe the joint kinematics, forces and moments of the wrist, elbow and shoulder in a sample of twenty patients that were using a walker as a result of total joint surgery of the hips and knees. METHODS: Three-dimensional upper extremity kinematics were recorded using a motion capture system synchronized with forces and torques transmitted through a walker instrumented with force transducers in the handles. RESULTS: Compressive forces were found to be nearly 20 % of the body weight at each of the upper extremity joints, both surgical and non-surgical sides, being the greatest force at the wrist and decreasing proximally. Compression forces were greater in the non-surgical side limb at the wrist and at the elbow. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that loads on upper extremity joints {{associated with the use of}} a walker for assisted ambulation are high and further studies are needed to address the cause-effect relationship between the actual joint loading and the development of secondary musculoskeletal upper extremity complaints in more frail patients. CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO: Um andador é um dispositivo frequentemente prescrito para auxiliar a marcha de indivíduos com dificuldades de equilíbrio ou para reduzir demandas à extremidade inferior após cirurgia ou lesão. O uso prolongado de um andador impõe significante demanda para a extremidade superior do paciente, o que pode levar a um risco aumentado de desenvolver condições secundárias, como dor no punho, cotovelo e ombro. OBJETIVO: Descrever a cinemática articular, forças e momentos do punho, cotovelo e ombro de uma amostra de 20 pacientes que faziam uso de um andador após cirurgia de substituição articular do joelho ou quadril. MÉTODOS: A cinemática tridimensional foi registrada usando um sistema de captura de movimento sincronizado com o registro de transdutores de força, que <b>mediam</b> a força transmitida através do andador. RESULTADOS: Este estudo revelou forças de até 20 % do peso corporal nos transdutores, com forças compressivas maiores do lado do membro inferior não operado, no punho e no cotovelo. CONCLUSÃO: Os achados indicam que demandas no membro superior associadas ao uso de andador como dispositivo auxiliar da marcha são grandes, e mais estudos são necessários para averiguar relações de causa-efeito entre as reais sobrecargas articulares e o desenvolvimento de queixas musculoesqueléticas no membro de pacientes em condições de debilidade...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação(mestrado) - Universidade Federal do Rio Grande, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Aqüicultura, Instituto de Oceanografia, 2009. O peixe anual Austrolebias nigrofasciatus é uma espécie endêmica do sistema lagunar Patos-Mirim, no Sul do Brasil, onde se encontra ameaçado de extinção. Os efeitos da temperatura sobre o crescimento e reprodução de A. nigrofasciatus foram estudados em cativeiro. Experimento 1 – crescimento: Ovos fertilizados naturalmente, estocados em laboratório em ambiente úmido, foram expostos a água e dentro de 12 h eclodiram. O comprimento padrão médio dos peixes recém eclodidos foi 4, 67 ± 0, 25 mm. Os juvenis foram mantidos a 16 e 22 °C por oito semanas e o crescimento foi mais rápido na temperatura mais elevada durante as primeiras semanas, mas tão logo tenham iniciado as desovas (quatro semanas após a eclosão), a taxa de crescimento foi reduzida e ao final de oito semanas eles <b>mediam</b> 23, 68 ± 3, 73 e 22, 68 ± 5, 36 mm (p> 0, 05), respectivamente em 16 e 22 °C. Fêmeas mantidas a 22 °C alcançaram 23, 00 ± 2, 83 mm e foram significativamente maiores (p 0, 05), entretanto fêmeas mantidas a 17 e 21 °C foram significativamente maiores que aquelas mantidas a 25 °C. O fator de condição também foi reduzido na temperatura mais alta sugerindo que os reprodutores de A. nigrofasciatus devem ser mantidos em temperatura reduzida para o sucesso reprodutivo. The annual fish Austrolebias nigrofasciatus, an {{endemic species}} to the coastal lagoons of Southern Brazil is {{currently}} endangered. The effects of temperature on growth and reproduction of A. nigrofasciatus were studied in captivity. Experiment 1 – growth: Naturally fertilized eggs {{were kept in}} the laboratory in a humid environment, once they were exposed to water, larvae hatched within 12 hours. Total length of newly hatched larvae was 4. 67 ± 0. 25 mm. They were kept at 16 e 22 °C for eight weeks and larvae grew faster at the higher temperature during the first weeks, {{but as soon as}} they started to spawn (four weeks after hatching), growth rate was reduced {{and at the end of}} the eight weeks they measured 23. 68 ± 3. 73 e 22. 68 ± 5. 36 mm (P> 0. 05), respectively for 16 e 22 °C. Females reared at 22 °C reached 23. 0 ± 2. 83 and were significantly larger (P 0. 05), however, females kept at 17 and 21 °C were significantly larger than those reared at 25 °C. Condition factor was also reduced at the highest temperature suggesting that brrodstock of A. nigrofasciatus should be kept at lower temperatures for successful breeding...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} blood flow cynamics in {{descending}} thoracic aorta (DAo) in normal subjects (N) and patients (Pts) with cardiovascular, diseases, we analyzed the flow velocity patterns (FVP) in DAo and its cimension {{at the level}} of mitral valve by 2 -D biplane transesophageal chocardiography (TEE) in 25 control subjects, 2 Pts with aortic stenosis (AS), 7 aortic regu rgitaion (AR), and 9 aortic true aneurysm (AN). We obtained the laminar flow at three sampling vplumes (SV) in DAo on a longitudial scanimage of DAo; median, center, and lateral sites using plused Dopper method. We measured peak flow velocity (Vp), time from the onset of the systolic flow to Vp (acceleration time; AT), deceleration time (DT) of the systolic flow, and AT/(AT＋DT) at each SV in DAo. From the M-mode echogram of DAo, we measured the maximum dimension of the aorta (Dmax), which was usually coincided with mid to late systolic phase. The central forward flow in normal subjects reached Vp with 70 ± 13 msec in AT and decelerated with 215 ± 26 msec in DT. The systolic forward flow was followed by a small reversal flow in early diastole and then by a small forward flow during holodiastole. In normal subjects, Vp was the highest at the center (64 ± 10 cm/sec), then <b>mediam</b> (60 ± 11 cm/sec) and the lowest in the lateral (56 ± 9 cm/sec; p＜ 0. 01 vs centor) site in DAo. This fashions in Vp were the same in all Pts except for AR. In Pts with AN, Vp was markedly low (33 ± 7 cm/sec; p＜ 0. 001 vs N) and the dimension-index of DAo (13 ± 2 mm/m^ 2; in N) was obviously enlarged (21 ± 7 mm/m^ 2; p＜ 0. 001 vs N), associated with swirling echo and mural thrombi at the lateral portion in DAo. AT/(AT＋DT) markedly increased in AS (0. 41 ± 0. 06; p＜ 0. 001 vs N). The significant reversal flows in holodoastole were observed in AR. Thus, we concluded that (1) TEE using longtudinal scan-plane can provide the accurate informations of flow velocities in Dao, (2) characteristic FVP was obtained in each pts group, (3) the flow velocity at the lateral site of Dao was the lowest value in all groups, (4) the swirling echo in the Dao was observed in Pts with lower flow velocities less than 40 cm/sec and dilated aorta, and (5) in all Pts with intraaortic swirling echo, mural thrombi were seen mainly at the lateral site of the significantly dilated Dao, where the flow veloctiy was lowest...|$|E
40|$|Objetivos: avaliar os resultados das primeiras 104 polipectomias histeroscópicas em nossa instituição de ensino. Métodos: estudo retrospectivo descritivo. Foram revistos os registros das primeiras 136 histeroscopias cirúrgicas {{realizadas}} no serviço, sendo 104 polipectomias. Foram avaliadas características das pacientes operadas como idade, paridade, fase da vida reprodutiva e sintomatologia; número e tamanho dos pólipos e os resultados em relação às complicações e remissão dos sintomas. Resultados: as pacientes tinham em média 52, 7 anos, sendo três quartos delas multíparas. Encontravam-se na pós-menopausa 60 pacientes (57, 7 % do grupo). Cerca de metade das pacientes apresentavam sintomas atribuíveis aos pólipos, sendo o sangramento anormal o mais comum (47, 1 %). Em 16, 3 % dos casos havia mais de um pólipo, sendo que 84 % deles <b>mediam</b> mais de 1 cm. A única complicação imediata de importância foi uma perfuração uterina, sendo que as complicações tardias foram raras e sem gravidade. O tempo médio de seguimento foi de 9 meses. Em 82 % das pacientes houve remissão das queixas. Apenas 8, 2 % das pacientes necessitaram de histerectomia complementar, todas com outras doenças uterinas, como mioma, adenomiose ou hiperplasia endometrial atípica, a qual foi encontrada em apenas 1 paciente. Conclusões: a polipectomia histeroscópica mostrou-se método simples, seguro e eficaz no tratamento dos pólipos endometriais. A seleção das pacientes deve ser rigorosa para evitar procedimentos cirúrgicos complementares. Purpose: {{to evaluate}} {{the results of the}} first 104 hysteroscopic polypectomies in a teaching hospital. Methods: a retrospective descriptive study was designed. Medical records of the first 136 operative hysteroscopies - 104 of which polypectomies - were reviewed. Patient characteristics such as age, parity, period of reproductive function and symptoms; number and size of polyps and results concerning complications and symptom relief were evaluated. Results: the average age of patients was 52. 7 years. Three quarters of them were multiparous. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were menopaused. About half of the patients had symptoms related to polyps. Abnormal bleeding was the most frequent symptom (47. 1 %). In 16. 3 % of the patients more than 1 polyp were detected and 84 % of the polyps were larger than 1 cm. The only immediate complication was a uterine perforation. Late complications were rare and mild. The follow-up period was 9 months on average. In 82 % of teh patients the symptoms were controlled. Hysterectomy was necessary in 8. 2 % of the patients, all of them with other uterine diseases such as leiomyomas, adenomyosis and atypical endometrial hyperplasia in one patient). Conclusion: hysteroscopic polypectomy is a simple, safe and effective method for the treatment of endometrial polyps. Selection of patients must be rigorous to avoid further operative procedures...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} it is {{presented}} and discussed part of the outcomes from a research, which took place between 2006 and 2009 with newly-graduated Pedagogy {{students who have been}} teachers {{in the first years of}} primary school. This study took the theoretical and methodological contributions from Bakhtin, Lahire and Chartier as reference, taking into consideration the fact that these authors, within their specificity, place in the social practices the genesis of the specifically human, highlighting in this process the role of the other and of the semiotic mediation. The data shared here refers to one participant of this research, who at that time was the main class teacher in a third grade of the Elementary and public schoo in Paraná; it talks about this professional experience. The study while of the account of the teacher’s professional experience contributed to the enlargement of the visibility of the conditions in which real subjects have become teachers of the first years of primary school, and ended up highlighting a singular entwinement with various social voices which meet, confront each other and are situated in different time and space: some of them belong to the beginning of their initial formation, mediated by formative professors, others belong to their immediate interlocutors (colleagues/pedagogical team) and there are also voices found in the local administration, which, in turn, mediate the educational policy signaling broader determinations which mark an specific historical epoch. [URL]   Neste trabalho, apresenta-se e discute-se parte dos resultados de uma pesquisa que foi realizada entre 2006 e 2009 com alunas egressas do curso de Pedagogia que se tornaram professoras. Tal estudo tomou como referência as contribuições teóricas e metodológicas de Bakhtin, Lahire e Chartier, levando-se em conta que estes autores, em suas especificidades, situam nas práticas sociais a gênese do especificamente humano, destacando o papel do outro e da mediação semiótica nesse processo. Os dados aqui compartilhados referem-se a um dos sujeitos desta pesquisa, que, à época, era professora do terceiro ano do Ensino Fundamental em uma instituição pública de ensino no interior do Paraná e diz respeito ao relato desta experiência profissional. Seu estudo, ao pretender contribuir para ampliar a visibilidade dos processos constitutivos da profissionalidade docente nos anos iniciais, acabou colocando em evidência um entrelaçamento singular de várias vozes sociais que se encontram, confrontam-se e se localizam em diversos espaços e tempos: algumas delas pertencem ao período da sua formação inicial, mediadas pelos professores formadores; outras pertencem aos seus interlocutores imediatos, colegas de trabalho/equipe pedagógica; além de vozes que se localizam na administração local, que, por sua vez, <b>mediam</b> a política educacional, indiciando as determinações mais amplas que marcam uma determinada época histórica.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mohs {{micrographic}} surgery {{can achieve}} high cure {{rates in the}} treatment of skin cancer and remove a minimum of healthy tissue. OBJECTIVES: To characterize patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery and study issues related to the number of surgical stages. METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in a micrographic surgery reference center for the period of 2004 to 2010. Data was collected from medical records of 79 patients (83 surgeries). RESULTS: We studied 43 women and 36 men. The mean age was 57. 5 ± 14, 6 years. Skin types II and III were the most frequent, accounting for 41 % and 36. 1 %, respectively. The most frequent tumor was the basal cell carcinoma (89. 1 %), and the solid subtype was the most common (44. 6 %), followed by sclerodermiform histological subtype (32 %). The most frequent location was the nasal region (44. 6 %). The large majority of the operated tumors were recurrent lesions (72. 7 %). Half of the tumors measured 2 cm or more. In 68. 7 % of the cases two or more surgical stages were necessary for the removal of the tumors. The observation period was 2 or more years in 75 % of the tumors. There was 01 post-Mohs recurrence and 02 patients had metastases during the observation period (both with squamous cell carcinoma). CONCLUSION: The findings coincide with those of the literature, recurrent tumors and tumors larger than 2 cm needed more surgical stages for their removal, although there was no statistic difference (p= 0, 12 and 0, 44 respectively). FUNDAMENTOS: A cirurgia micrográfica de Mohs é capaz de alcançar altas taxas de cura no tratamento do câncer de pele e remover o mínimo possível de tecido saudável. OBJETIVOS: caracterizar os pacientes submetidos à cirurgia micrográgica de Mohs e estudar aspectos relacionados ao número de fases cirúrgicas. MÉTODOS: trata-se de estudo observacional, transversal e descritivo realizado em serviço de referência para cirurgia micrográfica no período de 2004 a 2010. Foram revisados os prontuários de 79 pacientes (83 cirurgias). RESULTADOS: Foram avaliados 43 mulheres e 36 homens. A média de idade foi 57, 5 ± 14, 6 anos. Os fototipos II e III foram os mais frequentes, respondendo por 41 % e 36, 1 % respectivamente. O tumor mais freqüente foi o carcinoma basocelular (89, 1 %), sendo o subtipo sólido o mais frequente (44, 6 %), seguido pelo esclerodermiforme (32 %). A localização mais freqüente foi a nasal (44, 6 %). A grande maioria dos tumores operados eram recidivados (72, 7 %). Metade dos tumores <b>mediam</b> 2 cm ou mais. Foram necessárias duas ou mais fases cirúrgicas em 68, 7 % dos tumores para sua remoção. O tempo de acompanhamento foi igual ou superior a 2 anos em 75 %. Houve 01 recidiva pós-Mohs e 02 pacientes apresentaram metástases durante o estudo (ambos carcinomas espinocelulares). CONCLUSÕES: Os achados coincidem com os da literatura, sendo que tumores recidivados e maiores que 2 cm necessitaram de mais fases cirúrgicas para sua completa remoção, apesar de não haver diferença estatística (p= 0, 12 e 0, 44, respectivamente) ...|$|E
