5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> {{tropical}} cyclones include heavy rain, strong wind, large storm surges at landfall, and tornadoes. The destruction from {{a tropical}} cyclone depends mainly on its intensity, its size, and its location. Tropical cyclones act to remove forest canopy {{as well as}} change the landscape near coastal areas, by moving and reshaping sand dunes and causing extensive erosion along the coast. Even well inland, heavy rainfall can lead to mudslides and landslides in mountainous areas. Their effects can be sensed over time by studying the concentration of the Oxygen-18 isotope within caves within the vicinity of cyclones' paths being very hazardous to people's life.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone {{acts as an}} agonist of the {{serotonin}} 5-HT1A receptor {{with high}} affinity. It is a preferential full agonist of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which are inhibitory autoreceptors, and a partial agonist of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. In accordance, an animal study found that buspirone dose-dependently decreases serotonin levels in specific brain areas while increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels. It is thought that the <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> buspirone are mediated via its interaction with the 5-HT1A receptor. Some of its effects may be mediated via oxytocin release secondary to 5-HT1A receptor agonism. Buspirone also has lower affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors.|$|E
25|$|A coroner's inquest {{into the}} death, {{conducted}} by coroner Thomas Erskine Cleland, commenced {{a few days}} after the body was found but was adjourned until 17 June 1949. The investigating pathologist John Burton Cleland re-examined the body and made a number of discoveries. Cleland noted that the man's shoes were remarkably clean and appeared to have been recently polished, rather than being in the state expected of the shoes of a man who had apparently been wandering around Glenelg all day. He added that this evidence fitted in with the theory that the body might have been brought to Somerton beach after the man's death, accounting for the lack of evidence of vomiting and convulsions, which are the two <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> poison.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{state that}} one of the <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the inquisition was to end free thought and scientific thought in Spain. As one contemporary Spaniard in exile put it: [...] "Our country is a land of ... barbarism; down there one cannot produce any culture without being suspected of heresy, error and Judaism. Thus silence was imposed on the learned." [...] For the next few centuries, while the rest of Europe was slowly awakened by the influence of the Enlightenment, Spain stagnated. However, this conclusion is contested.|$|E
2500|$|Confounding has {{traditionally}} been defined as bias arising from the co-occurrence or mixing of effects of extraneous factors, referred to as confounders, with the <b>main</b> <b>effect(s)</b> <b>of</b> interest. A more recent definition of confounding invokes the notion of counterfactual effects. According to this view, when one observes an outcome of interest, say Y=1 (as opposed to Y=0), in a given population A which is entirely exposed (i.e. exposure X=1 for every unit of the population) the risk of this event will be RA1. The counterfactual or unobserved risk RA0 corresponds to the risk {{which would have been}} observed if these same individuals had been unexposed (i.e. X=0 for every unit of the population). The true effect of exposure therefore is: RA1−RA0 (if one is interested in risk differences) or RA1/RA0 (if one is interested in relative risk). Since the counterfactual risk RA0 is unobservable we approximate it using a second population B and we actually measure the following relations: RA1−RB0 or RA1/RB0. In this situation, confounding occurs when RA0≠RB0. (NB: Example assumes binary outcome and exposure variables.) ...|$|E
