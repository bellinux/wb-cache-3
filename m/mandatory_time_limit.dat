40|$|The 1996 {{welfare reform}} law {{replaced}} the existing entitlement to cash welfare with a transitional program of temporary aid that has employment as its primary goal. Among the key {{provisions of the}} welfare reform legislation were <b>mandatory</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> on benefits and work requirements for all recipients, including those with substance use disorders. Changes {{brought about by the}} welfare reform law have important implications for the organization of substance abuse services and the well-being of disadvan taged children whose parents have substance use disorders. The overall effect of welfare reform could be positive. It gives States wide latitude to design programs to help low-income people attain self-sufficiency and has increased interest in developing innovative programming for hard-to-employ welfare populations, including those with substance use disorders (Berlin 2001).

40|$|Delaware {{has become}} {{increasingly}} active in adopting innovative arbitration laws. In 2009, Delaware adopted a confidential system of “arbitration” conducted by sitting Court of Chancery judges, which was subsequently held unconstitutional as violating the First Amendment right of public access to the courts. In 2015, it enacted the Delaware Rapid Arbitration Act (DRAA), creating a system of expedited arbitration in Delaware. Among other things, the DRAA sets <b>mandatory</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> for the completion of arbitration proceedings (with financial penalties for arbitrators who fail to comply), restricts the degree of court involvement in the arbitration process, and provides for expeditious review of arbitration awards directly to the Delaware Supreme Court. This Article analyzes the DRAA, Delaware’s most recent innovation in arbitration law. It distinguishes {{the provisions of the}} DRAA that require legislative action from those that the parties can themselves establish by contract. It also notes several potential difficulties with and uncertainties caused by the Act. Finally, it comments on the role of Delaware (as opposed to other American states) as an innovator in arbitration law...|$|R

40|$|Policy {{provision}} for naps is typical {{in child care}} settings, but there is variability in the practices employed. One practice that might modify children’s early sleep patterns is the allocation of a <b>mandatory</b> nap <b>time</b> in which all children are required to lie on their beds without alternate activity permitted. There is currently limited evidence {{of the effects of}} such practices on children’s napping patterns. This study examined the association between duration of <b>mandatory</b> nap <b>times</b> and group-level napping patterns in child care settings. Observations were undertaken in a community sample of 113 preschool rooms with a scheduled nap time (N = 2, 114 children). Results showed that 83. 5 % of child care settings implemented a <b>mandatory</b> nap <b>time</b> (range = 15 – 145 min) while 14. 2 % provided alternate activities for children throughout the nap time period. Overall, 31 % of children napped during nap times. Compared to rooms with ≤ 30 min of <b>mandatory</b> nap <b>time,</b> rooms with 31 – 60 min and > 60 min of <b>mandatory</b> nap <b>time</b> had a two-and-a-half and fourfold increase, respectively, in the proportion of children napping. Nap onset latency did not significantly differ across groups. Among preschool children, exposure to longer <b>mandatory</b> nap <b>times</b> in child care may increase incidence of napping...|$|R

50|$|WVU was {{required}} to have a Cadet Corps {{under the terms of}} the Morrill Act of 1862, which allowed for the creation of land-grant colleges. The United States Department of War—a predecessor of the U.S. Department of Defense—offered military equipment to the university at no charge, forming the basis of the school's Military Tactics department. The heavy military influence led to opposition of female enrollment that lasted through the first decade of the university. The trend changed in 1889, when ten women were allowed to enroll and seek degrees at the university. In June 1891, Harriet Lyon became the first woman to receive a degree from West Virginia University, finishing first in the class ahead of all male students. Lyon's academic success supported the acceptance of women in the university as students and educators.During the University's early years, daily chapel services and roll call for all students were <b>mandatory,</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>time</b> for student recreation. Following the removal of these obligations, students became active in extracurricular activities and established many of the school's first athletic and student organizations. The first edition of the student newspaper known as the Athenaeum, now The Daily Athenaeum, was published in 1887, and the West Virginia Law Review became the fourth-oldest law review in the United States when it was founded in 1894. Phi Kappa Psi was the first fraternity on campus, founded May 23, 1890, while Kappa Delta, the first sorority at WVU, was established in 1899. The first football team was formed in 1891, and the first basketball team appeared in 1903.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the implementation of curriculum policy regarding eight key learning areas in ACT government high schools with particular analysis concerning the Arts. The study sought to identify the discrepance between school curriculum policy and timetable allocation to the mandated curriculum areas. Analysis of time allocation to learning areas as defined by the timetable allocation of time was considered to be an appropriate method of examining curriculum practice in ACT government high schools. Fifteen ACT government high school timetables were analysed in conjunction with school curriculum documentation. <b>Mandatory</b> <b>time</b> requirements for the eight key learning areas was identified. Timetable structures were analysed in terms of allocation of time to key learning areas, pastoral care, assemblies, activities and electives. Formulae were developed in order to make comparisons between schools possible. Results indicated that disparities existed between time allocation to key learning areas within key learning areas and <b>mandatory</b> <b>time</b> (i. e. minimum guaranteed access time) requirements for key learning areas...|$|R

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> for Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment.

To this end, participants (N ¼ 43) {{were randomly assigned to}} a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition or control condition, both of which involved gambling on an EGM in a virtual reality (VR) casino. In the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants were asked (via pop-up message) to consider setting a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on play and entering that limit in an available text box prior to commencing play. In the no <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants engaged in play immediately upon accessing the EGM in the VR casino (i. e. they were not exposed to a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up message).

In this study, we use the standard labor-leisure lifetime utility to analyze the behavioral effects of imposing <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> on welfare use. Our approach is different from our predecessors (which model welfare participation) in that we model delayed enrollment in and early exit from welfare. Our results suggest that prior to <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> WEH enroll in welfare as soon as eligibility is established and remain on assistance programs until their youngest children reach adulthood. Moreover, <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> do not alter this behavior in WEH with older children.
