5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood {{with the group}} of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, {{risk-taking}} men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the frail and sickly vice-President in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Eventually <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> men in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.|$|E

25|$|On November 8, folk-rock singers David Crosby and Graham Nash {{appeared}} at Zuccotti Park {{to offer their}} support and sing to the occupiers. Three days later, on November 11, folk singer Joan Baez sang there as well. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> protesters were not familiar with her songs and were unaware of her long history as an activist.|$|E

25|$|Despite his anti-communism, {{the first}} major {{translations}} of Kipling into Russian took place during Lenin's rule in the early 1920s, and during the interwar period, Kipling was very popular with Russian readers. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Russian poets and writers such as Konstantin Simonov were influenced by Kipling. Kipling's clarity of style, his use of colloquial language {{and the way in}} which he used rhythm and rhyme were considered to be major innovations in poetry that appealed to <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Russian poets.|$|R
25|$|Starting in the 1990s, {{the growth}} of {{high-tech}} companies in Yokneam Illit also brought an influx of Israeli-born residents along with {{an increasing number of}} immigrants from Western Europe, South Africa, North America and South America. During this period, the economic problems of the Kibbutz and Moshav movements led <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> families in the Megiddo Regional Council to move to nearby Yokneam Illit.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Secker had a dissenting {{view of the}} Jollie's academy; {{according}} to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition he was frustrated by Jollie's poor teaching, famously remarking that he lost his knowledge of languages and that 'only the old Philosophy of the Schools was taught there: and that neither ably nor diligently. The morals also of <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Men were bad. I spent my time there idly & ill'.|$|E
25|$|Through his {{writings}} and {{teaching at the}} university and his association with the intellectual elite of Quebec, he had a profound influence on many people (such as Michel Chartrand and Camille Laurin). However, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> intellectuals he influenced often did not share his conservative ideology (such as his successor at the University of Montreal). Groulx's traditionalist, religious form of Québécois nationalism, known as clerico-nationalism, influenced Quebec society into the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans {{do this because}} {{they feel like they}} shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it {{can be seen as a}} racist act, but for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E
25|$|As a soldier, Mobutu wrote pseudonymously on {{contemporary}} politics {{for a new}} magazine set up by a Belgian colonial, Actualités Africaines. In 1956, he quit the army and became a full-time journalist, writing for the Léopoldville daily L'Avenir. Two years later, he went to Belgium to cover the 1958 World Exposition and stayed to receive training in journalism. By this time, Mobutu had met <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Congolese intellectuals who were challenging colonial rule. He became friendly with Patrice Lumumba and joined Lumumba's Mouvement National Congolais (MNC). Mobutu eventually became Lumumba's personal aide, though several contemporaries indicate that Belgian intelligence had recruited Mobutu to be an informer.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, the Maple Leafs {{experienced}} their longest playoff {{drought in}} the club's history. They struggled in 2005–06 and, despite a late-season surge (9–1–2 {{in their final}} 12 games), led by third-string goaltender Jean-Sebastien Aubin, Toronto was out of playoff contention {{for the first time}} since 1998. This marked the first time the team had missed under Quinn, who was later relieved as head coach. Quinn's dismissal was controversial since <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> players who were key contributors to the Leafs' late-season run had been drafted by him before Ferguson's arrival, while Ferguson's signings (Jason Allison, Belfour, Alexander Khavanov, and Eric Lindros) had suffered season-ending injuries.|$|E

25|$|Initiation of {{volcanism}} at Coso {{preceded the}} onset of Basin and Range crustal extension there, as expressed by normal faulting. The earlier of the two principal periods of volcanism began with the emplacement of basalt flows over a surface of little relief. Then, during the ensuing period of approximately 1.5 million years, eruptive activity included chemically more evolved rocks erupted upon a faulted terrain of substantial relief. Following a 1.5-million-year hiatus with few eruptions, a bimodal volcanic field of basalt lava flows and rhyolite lava domes and flows developed on Basin and Range terrain of essentially the same form as today's landscape. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> basalt flows are intercanyon, occupying parts of the present-day drainage system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Kashgari {{women were}} most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of}} the little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E
25|$|The {{linguistic}} diversity among Chinese Singaporeans {{varies according to}} age group. Most young Chinese Singaporeans speak either English or Mandarin while the elderly, though able to converse in Mandarin, have preferred other Chinese varieties, such as Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, Hakka, or Hainanese. As the south-eastern Chinese varieties are not taught in school, the number of their speakers has steadily declined. In addition, many parents have begun to communicate with their children solely in English, believing that the language is essential to attain upward social mobility. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Chinese in Singapore are unable to use their mother tongues fluently. This applies equally even to the more westernised Chinese Christian community, who prefers the English language over any other. This (the Hokkien dialect) apparently {{seems to be the}} only struggling force against the loss of Chinese cultural heritage.|$|E
50|$|Every summer {{beginning}} in 1924, MacDonald travelled to the Canadian Rockies {{to paint the}} mountainous landscapes that dominated his later work.

50|$|A {{frustrating}} {{first season}} in the National Premier Leagues Queensland in 2013 saw the Red Devils miss out on the play-offs by 3 points finishing 5th in the league.

25|$|A restless, {{creative}} man, J.P. {{found it}} hard to settle down in any profession, and the family moved often. In 1963 they relocated to Lagunitas, a small town located in western Marin County, California, into a house bought for the young family by J.P.’s parents. San Geronimo Valley was a sleepy, rural community, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s, hippies and musicians were drawn to the beauty and lush charm of the area. For a short time both the Grateful Dead and the band Big Brother and the Holding Company lived in rustic summer houses or camps nearby. The Pickens house overflowed with hippies, visiting artists and musicians from the Quicksilver Messenger Service, Electric Flag and The Youngbloods. The pastoral roads surrounding the house were filled with hippie families living in converted schoolbuses. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> players in the local acid rock scene were fascinated with J.P.'s rapid fire banjo playing, fueled by his love for the east Indian music of Ravi Shankar especially, and he would play raga-like extended compositions loosely based on old bluegrass standards, on his banjo. Many jam sessions were held at the Lagunitas house, lost to posterity but still alive in the recorded psychedelic music of the time; David Meltzer has said his and J.P.'s attempts to fuse jazz, folk, bluegrass, east Indian and rock n roll were ahead of their time, helping to create a musical genre now highly prized, fondly called Marin County Raga Folk.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{contributing}} to {{the decline in the}} population of the sand tigers. Sand tigers reproduce at an unusually low rate, {{due to the fact that}} they do not have more than two pups at a time and because they breed only every second or third year. This shark is a highly prized food item in the western northern Pacific, off Ghana and off India and Pakistan where they are caught by fishing trawlers, although they are more commonly caught with a fishing line. Sand tigers' fins are a popular trade item in Japan. Off North America, it is fished for its hide and fins. Shark liver oil is a popular product in cosmetic products such as lipstick. It is sought by anglers in fishing competitions in South Africa and some other countries. In Australia it has been reduced in numbers by spear fishers using poison and where it is now protected. It is also prized as an aquarium exhibit in the United States, Europe, Australia and South Africa because of its docile and hardy nature. Thus, overfishing is a major contributor to the population decline. All indications show that the world population in sand tigers has been reduced significantly in size since 1980. Many sand tigers are caught in shark nets, and then either strangled or taken by fishermen. Estuaries along the United States of America's eastern Atlantic coast houses <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> sand tiger sharks. These estuaries are susceptible to non-point source pollution that is harmful to the pups.|$|E
500|$|Wooden Leg {{believed}} that the chiefs had gathered the tribes in one place for defence, not to prepare to make war on the whites, though <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> men were keen to do just that.

500|$|The M.E. Church's eighty-seven members {{soon found}} {{themselves}} in financial difficulties, however, having gone heavily in debt to build their new sanctuary. The chairman of the church's building committee had advanced his personal funds to complete the construction, thereafter becoming embroiled in years of litigation with the church. By 1874, the church was drawing larger crowds under then-pastor Joseph Stitt, who was described as an [...] "excellent leader of singing". An afternoon Sunday school session was particularly popular, [...] "principally devoted to learning new hymns, which attracted <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> people of the town, especially the young men", noted one account.
