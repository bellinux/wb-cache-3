She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E

[...] Hinault fell seven times in that race, including 13km from the finish when a small black dog called Gruson ran out in a bend and ran under his wheel. Hinault had been clear with Roger De Vlaeminck, Hennie Kuiper and Marc Demeyer. The incident made Hinault angry and he raced back to the others and won in Roubaix.|$|E

[...] It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic. While the book initially inspired readers to travel to Scandinavia, it failed to retain its popularity after the publication of Godwin's Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1798, which revealed Wollstonecraft's unorthodox private life.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, who directed Beyoncé's videos, [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy". The video is inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film, The Band Wagon and has a Studio 54 style. Paired with Usher, Beyoncé dances seductively and flirts with him to portray a naughty girl. She {{felt that they were}} a [...] "perfect match" [...] for the dancing scenes in the video. According to Usher, the video is a homage to classic [...] "ultimate entertainers"; including dancers, singers and actors. He further talked about the collaboration on the video, saying, [...] "Beyoncé and me have been talking about doing a record together. She reached out to me and said she had an idea and really wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> lead in her video... I was like, 'Well let me hear the idea.' It sounded like something totally different than what had been on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, {{who worked with}} Madonna in her video for [...] "Borderline", was shot in Venice and partly in New York City in July 1984. Madonna was portrayed as a knowing virgin, a figment of the pornographic mind, as she walked through marble rooms, wearing a wedding gown. It alternated with scenes of a provocative-looking Madonna on board a gondola. She commented, [...] " [...] wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> modern-day, worldly-wise girl that I am. But then {{we wanted to go}} back in time and use myself as an actual virgin." [...] The video starts with Madonna boarding on a boat from the Brooklyn Bridge and travels to Venice. As she steps down into the city, she moves like a stripper and undulated sinuously. She wears a black dress and blue pants with a number of Christian symbol embedded jewelry around her neck. She sings the song at full volume as she watches a lion walking between the columns of the Piazza San Marco of Venice and along the statute of Saint Mark.|$|E
500|$|Gradually, Wollstonecraft {{returned}} to her literary life, becoming involved with Joseph Johnson's circle again, in particular with Mary Hays, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Sarah Siddons through William Godwin. Godwin and Wollstonecraft's unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair. Godwin had read her Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and later wrote that [...] "If {{ever there was a}} book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration." [...] Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise Political Justice. After their marriage on 29 March 1797, they moved into two adjoining houses, known as The Polygon, so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter. By all accounts, theirs was a happy and stable, though brief, relationship.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} {{which appeared in}} The New York Times, Williams said that the choices {{for many of the}} pieces of classical music were made by the studio. He also said that while he did not know why certain pieces were chosen, Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 (commonly known as the Unfinished Symphony), which features prominently in the film, was most likely included because Anderton was a big fan of classical music in the script. Some of the other choices, such as Gideon's playing of Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by Bach on an organ in the subterranean prison, were also in the screenplay, and he figured that [...] "hey are some writer's conception of what this character might have listened to." [...] Williams did choose the minuet from a Haydn string quartet (Op. 64, No. 1) which plays on the radio in the scene where Dr. Hineman is gardening in her greenhouse. He said he picked the piece because [...] "t seemed to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> kind of thing a woman like this would play on the radio." [...] The New York Times characterized the score as [...] "evocative" [...] and said it was [...] "thoroughly modern" [...] while also being [...] "interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks." [...] The piece heard when Anderton is shown entering his apartment and he tells his computer system [...] "I'm home" [...] is the 2nd movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 in B minor, known as the [...] "Pathetique" [...] Symphony.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviews were more {{critical}} of Haggard's work. Although the reviewer of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine considered it better than King Solomon's Mines, he opined, [...] "Mr. Rider Haggard has not proved as yet that he has {{anything that can be}} called imagination at all... It might be wrought up into an unparalleled stage effect: but it is rather a failure in pen and ink. The more fearful and wonderful such circumstances are intended to be, the more absurd is the failure of them". Even more scathing was Augustus Moore in the May edition of Time: A Monthly Miscellany, who declared: [...] "In Mr Haggard's book I find none of the powerful imagination, the elaborate detail, the vivid English which would entitle his work to be described as a romance... it seems to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> method of the modern melodrama". Moore was particularly dismissive of the novel's style and prose: [...] "Mr Haggard cannot write English at all. I do not merely refer to his bad grammar, which a boy at a Boarding School would deserve to be birched for... It can only have been written by a man who not only knew nothing, but cared nothing for 'English undefiled'." [...] Haggard's English was a common source of criticisms, but Moore was even dismissive of the character of She who widely garnered universal praise. [...] "Ayesha", Moore declares, [...] "is about as impressive as the singing chambermaid who represents the naughty fairy of a pantomime in tights and a tow wig". Concluding his review, Moore wondered at the success that had greeted She: ...|$|E
