Employing first chance operations then a software program to generate unexpected sequences of movement, Cunningham strains the coping mechanisms of his dancers to the limit. His choreography requires dancers to become experts at adapting their own sensorimotor instrument to the situation at hand. When dancers are asked to imitate the movement sequences of a computer-generated avatar, their bodies can truly be said to be “co-constructed”; they evolve <b>muscle</b> <b>memories</b> and skills that correspond to the technology with which they interact...|$|R

50|$|Fine {{motor skills}} are often {{discussed}} {{in terms of}} transitive movements, which are those done when using tools (which could be as simple as a tooth brush or pencil). Transitive movements have representations that become programmed to the premotor cortex, creating motor programs that result in the activation of the motor cortex and therefore the motor movements. In a study testing the motor memory of patterned finger movements (a fine motor skill) it was found that retention of certain skills is susceptible to disruption if another task interferes with one's motor memory. However, such susceptibility can be reduced with time. For example, if a finger pattern is learned and another finger pattern is learned six hours later, the first pattern will still be remembered. But attempting to learn two such patterns one immediately after the other could cause the first one to be forgotten. Furthermore, the heavy use of computers by recent generations has had both positive and negative effects. One of the main positive effects is an enhancement of children's fine motor skills. Repetitive behaviors, such as typing on a computer from a young age, can enhance such abilities. Therefore, children who learn to use computer keyboards at an early age could benefit from the early <b>muscle</b> <b>memories.</b>|$|R
50|$|End plate {{potentials}} {{are produced}} {{almost entirely by}} the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in skeletal muscle. Acetylcholine {{is the second most}} important excitatory neurotransmitter in the body following glutamate. It controls the somatosensory system which includes the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. It was the first neurotransmitter to be identified in 1914 by Henry Dale. Acetylcholine is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the neuron from choline and acetyl-CoA. Choline acyltransferase is the enzyme that synthesizes acetylcholine and is often used as a marker in research relating to acetylcholine production. Neurons that utilize acetylcholine are called cholinergic neurons and they are very important in <b>muscle</b> contraction, <b>memory,</b> and learning.|$|R
500|$|Hayley Louise Brown of Clash {{viewed the}} song as an {{important}} part of the album, musing [...] "opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad ‘Thinking About You’ and an instant confrontation with the full force of Ocean’s vocal range, the whole record echoes with extra terrestrial Odd Future synths and clumsy piano chords." [...] Lane Billings of Paste noted the song as whispy in nature, and made a case for Ocean as an R revivalist. Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown of stated that the song moves languidly, [...] "like perfect thoughts about someone missed, until the <b>muscle</b> <b>memory</b> of Ocean’s falsetto bursts into the song’s upper register." [...] She continued, [...] "while Ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs, there’s a reason Bey shed a tear the first time she heard it. Regardless of how much these lyrics were influenced by lines like, 'By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless,' the ache in Ocean’s voice is universal. MSN Music's Danielle Cheesman felt that Ocean did his followers a service by featuring the song as the album's opener, describing the track as" [...] the year-old spacey serenade to a boy that became a fan favorite." [...] She continued, [...] "despite now being enhanced with a strings intro, his falsetto - more importantly - remains in tact over the well-known warped ebb and flow." ...|$|E

So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible.

2500|$|Close order drill is an {{important}} factor in recruit training, and begins from their first formation on the yellow footprints. In the first phase, they learn all of the basic commands and movements, memorizing the timing through the use of [...] "ditties", or mnemonics, that help synchronize a recruit's movements with the rest of his or her platoon. Constant repetition and practice are used to facilitate <b>muscle</b> <b>memory,</b> so that any given movement can be rendered immediately and accurately upon order without hesitation. To aid in this development, drill movements are worked into other parts of daily life to help increase the platoon's synchronization and muscle memory—this same technique is used with other non-drill activities as well. For example, a recruit is instructed to hold his/her food tray in a similar fashion to holding the butt of a rifle during [...] "shoulder arms".|$|E
2500|$|Sharpening a graver or burin {{requires}} {{either a}} sharpening stone or wheel.

Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on [...] "feel" [...] and <b>muscle</b> <b>memory</b> to sharpen tools.

These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.|$|E
50|$|PKMζ {{is thought}} to be {{responsible}} for maintaining the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP {{is one of the major}} cellular mechanisms that are widely considered to underlie learning and memory. This theory arose from the observation that PKMζ perfused post synaptically into neurons causes synaptic potentiation, and selective inhibitors of PKMζ like zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP), when bath applied one hour after tetanization, inhibit the late phase or maintenance of LTP. Thus PKMζ is both necessary and sufficient for maintaining LTP. Subsequent work showed that inhibiting PKMζ reversed LTP maintenance when applied up to 5 hours after LTP was induced in hippocampal slices, and after 22 hours in vivo. Inhibiting PKMζ in behaving animals erased spatial long-term memories in the hippocampus that were up to one month old, without affecting spatial short-term memories, and erased long-term memories for fear conditioning and inhibitory avoidance in the basolateral amygdala. When ZIP was injected into rats' sensorimotor cortices, it erased <b>muscle</b> <b>memories</b> for a task, even after several weeks of training. In the neocortex, thought to be the site of storage for most long-term memories, PKMζ inhibition erased associative memories for conditioned taste aversion in the insular cortex, up to 3 months after training. The protein also seems to be involved, through the nucleus accumbens, in the consolidation and reconsolidation of the memory related to drug addiction. PKMζ is thus the first molecule shown to be a component of the storage mechanism of long-term memory. Although results from PKCζ/PKMζ-null mice demonstrate LTP and memory appear largely the same as wild-type mice, the normal function of PKMζ in LTP and long-term memory storage was shown to be compensated by the other atypical PKC isoform, PKCι/λ in the knock-out.|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 + influx through L-type Ca 2 + {{channels}} (LTCCs) influences numerous physiological processes {{ranging from}} contraction in <b>muscle</b> and <b>memory</b> in neurons to gene expression in many cell types. However, the spatiotemporal organization of functional LTCCs has been {{nearly impossible to}} investigate because of methodological limitations. Here, we examined LTCC function with high temporal and spatial resolution using evanescent field fluorescence microscopy. Surprisingly, we found that LTCCs operated in functionally organized clusters, not necessarily as individual proteins. Furthermore, LTCC function in these clusters {{does not appear to}} be controlled by simple stochastic gating but instead by a PKC-dependent switch mechanism. This work suggests that resting intracellular free calcium concentration in arterial myocytes is predominantly controlled by this process in combination with rare voltage-dependent openings of individual LTCCs. We propose that Ca 2 + influx via persistent LTCCs may be an important mechanism regulating steady-state local and global Ca 2 + signals...|$|R

2500|$|Adaptation due to {{practice}} {{can be a}} result of intended practice such as sports or unintended practice such as wearing an orthosis.

[...] Resistance to fatigue also comes with practice as the muscle is strengthened, but the speed at which an athlete can complete a motor task is also increased with practice. [...] Volleyball players compared to non-jumpers show more repeatable control of muscles surrounding the knee that is controlled by co-activation in the single jump condition.

2500|$|The {{left hand}} determines the {{sounding}} {{length of the}} string, and thus the pitch of the string, by [...] "stopping" [...] it (pressing it) against the fingerboard with the fingertips, producing different pitches. As the violin has no frets to stop the strings, as is usual with the guitar, the player must know exactly where to place the fingers on the strings to play with good intonation (tuning). Beginning violinists play open strings and the lowest position, nearest to the nut. Students often start with relatively easy keys, such as A Major and G major. Students are taught scales and simple melodies. Through practice of scales and arpeggios and ear training, the violinist's left hand eventually [...] "finds" [...] the notes intuitively by <b>muscle</b> <b>memory.</b> The player must correct the intonation by ear. After determining that a fingered note is too sharp, the player must subtly make the note flatter by making an alteration of the finger angle (or {{in the case of}} being significantly sharp, moving the finger to a flatter, and thus correct, pitch). If the player determines that a fingered note is too flat, the pitch is raised by altering the finger position.|$|E
40|$|A USA Air Force Master Sergeant {{suffered}} severe {{hair loss}} from the scalp and face {{a few weeks}} after receipt of his fifth dose of anthrax vaccine.

My investigation of this case revealed that hair loss and serious systemic illness have also been reported by some other individuals who received anthrax vaccine and other vaccines. Differential diagnosis was used to evaluate the medical evidence in this case to identify the causes of illness and hair loss. Treatment with zinc gluconate at a dose level of 60 mg zinc per day for a few months subsequently led to the complete reversal of hair loss in this case. It is plausible that vaccines induced a stage of zinc deficiency by activating the immune system and increased the utilization of zinc.

Despite extensive studies, the fundamental control mechanisms that regulate intracellular Ca 2 + movement remain enigmatic. We have found recently that {{activation of the}} (Na++K+) -ATPase markedly potentiates intracellular Ca 2 + transients and contractility of rat heart cells. Little {{is known about the}} pathway responsible for the activation of the (Na++K+) -ATPase-initiated Ca 2 + signaling. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism in which activation of the (Na++K+) -ATPase is coupled to increased L-type Ca 2 + channel function through a signaling cascade involving Src and ERK 1 / 2 but not well established regulators of the channel, such as adrenergic receptor system or activation of PKA or CaMKII. We have also identified Ser 1928, a phosphorylation site for the α 1 subunit of the L-type Ca 2 + channel that may participate in the activation of the (Na++K+) -ATPase-mediated Ca 2 + signaling. The findings reported here uncover a novel molecular cross-talk between activation of the (Na++K+) -ATPase and L-type Ca 2 + channel and provide new insights into Ca 2 + signaling mechanisms for deeper {{understanding of the nature of}} cellular Ca 2 + handling in heart...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Vision of the Dolls: Theorizing technology, identity and agency in Joss Whedon’s Dollhouse track. In this paper, I use Joss Whedon’s “Dollhouse” as a prism to illuminate three questions at the intersection of theories of technology, selfhood, and embodiment: 1. How is technology enacted and embodied through the people who animate it? 2. What conceptions of selfhood are forwarded through the practices of technological transformation imagined in “Dollhouse”? 3. How might current understanding of the relations among bodies, minds, and technologies offer us traction for thinking about the theory of selfhood and bodiedness offered in the Dollhouse? Technology is always animated by use – in significant ways, technology is use: people create and deploy technologies for human purposes and thus shape the possibilities of technological being. At the same time, technologies in their enactment mold our bodies and our selves – our animation of technologies necessarily implies their animation of us. “Dollhouse” provides a provocative extension of this insight through its imagining of a technology that braids together quite overtly how others might constitute our selves through technology. The machine used to imprint new somatic capacities and <b>muscle</b> <b>memories,</b> along with more usual markers of selfhood – memories, self-conceptions, and so on – hyperbolizes the transfer of self-practices arguably already a part of our usual practice of being or becoming our selves. “Dollhouse” conceives selfhood, then, as a co-produced work of art mediated by technology (or, in parallel fashion, a co-produced work of technology expressed as a work of art). In the show, the first level of this production is quite blunt: the computer scientist/neuroscience wizard Topher exalts as he patches together new and improved selves for dolls on assignment. As Season One unfurled, though, viewers witnessed a more nuanced vision of the co-production of selfhood as dolls retained fears of their rapists and loyalties to their handlers, crushes on other supposedly blank slates and desires for information they didn’t know they wanted. Thus, selfhood is figured in the show as more resilient than we might expect – and simultaneously more radically dependant on the will and existence of others than we often assume. Finally, all of this rests on an ambiguous and perhaps inaccurate vision of the role of embodiment in shaping the conditions for technological transformations of selfhood. Drawing on Shaun Gallagher’s and Alva Noe’s work on how the body shapes the mind, I finally consider how accounts of bodily being show up in light of “Dollhouse’s” conception of “where” selfhood resides. Attending particularly to the sites at which embodied resilience {{is an important part of}} the show’s narrative, I reflect on how personhood and memory are interlinked at the site of bodies. I explore a deeper conception of technologies of embodiment, noticing in particular the orientalist commitments the show maintains to disciplines like yoga, meditation, and bonzi trees...|$|R
40|$|Since Damasio {{introduced}} the somatic markers hypothesis in 1991, it has {{spread through the}} psychological community, {{where it is now}} commonly acknowledged that somatic states are a factor in producing the qualitative dimension of our experiences. Present actions are emotionally guided by those somatic states that were previously activated in similar experiences. In this model, somatic markers serve as a kind of embodied memory. Here we test whether the manipulation of somatic markers can modulate the emotional evaluation of negative memories. Because facial feedback {{has been shown to be}} a powerful means of modifying emotional judgements, we used it to manipulate somatic markers. Participants first read a sad story in order to induce a negative emotional memory and then were asked to rate their emotions and memory about the text. Twenty-four hours later, the same participants were asked to assume a predetermined facial feedback (smiling) while reactivating their memory of the sad story. The participants were once again asked to fill in emotional and memory questionnaires about the text. Our results showed that participants who had smiled during memory reactivation later rated the text less negatively than control participants. However, the contraction of the zygomaticus <b>muscles</b> during <b>memory</b> reactivation did not have any impact on episodic memory scores. This suggests that manipulating somatic states modified emotional memory without affecting episodic memory. Thus, modulating memories through bodily states might pave the way to studying memory as an embodied function and help shape new kinds of psychotherapeutic interventions...|$|R
