40|$|Objective: In 2003, {{critical}} care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock {{that would be}} of practical use for the bedside clinician, {{under the auspices of}} the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis. Design: The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller <b>meetings</b> of <b>subgroups</b> <b>and</b> key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among <b>subgroups</b> <b>and</b> among the entire committee. Methods: We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management...|$|R
40|$|Design: Modified Delphi method with a {{consensus}} conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent <b>meetings</b> of <b>subgroups</b> <b>and</b> key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among <b>subgroups</b> <b>and</b> among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding. Methods: We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment {{of quality of}} evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention’s desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations...|$|R

Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management. PARTICIPANTS. Participants included 44 critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations. RESULTS. A total of 46 recommendations plus pediatric management considerations. CONCLUSIONS. Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that will hopefully translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually, and even more rapidly when some important new knowledge becomes available...|$|R

40|$|Two {{processes}} of stereotyping, subtyping <b>and</b> <b>subgrouping,</b> are compared. Subtyping occurs when perceivers respond {{to members of}} a target group who disconfirm their stereotypes by seeing them as exceptions to the rule and placing them in a separate subcategory apart from members who confirm the stereotype. The more recently defined process of subgrouping refers to the perceiver’s organization of information in terms of clusters of individuals based on their similarities <b>and</b> differences; <b>subgroups</b> can include confirmers and disconfirmers. We consider how subtypes <b>and</b> <b>subgroups</b> are defined, operationalized, and measured, their consequences for stereotype change, {{and the role of}} typicality. It is concluded that the clearest difference between subtyping <b>and</b> <b>subgrouping</b> is in terms of their consequences (subtyping leads to the preservation <b>and</b> <b>subgrouping</b> to differentiation of the stereotype). There are, however, some similarities between the processes, and attention is drawn to what future research is required, both to deepen our knowledge of each process and clarify their distinction. Stereotypes are a type of schema or knowledg...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In 2003, {{critical}} care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for antimicrobial therapy {{for patients with}} severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, {{under the auspices of}} the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis. DESIGN: The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller <b>meetings</b> of <b>subgroups</b> <b>and</b> key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among <b>subgroups</b> <b>and</b> among the entire committee. METHODS: The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S 591. CONCLUSION: Since the prompt institution of therapy that is active against the causative pathogen is one of the most important predictors of outcome, clinicians must establish a system for rapid administration of a rationally chosen drug or combination of drugs when sepsis or septic shock is suspected. The expanding number of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral agents available provides opportunities for effective empiric and specific therapy. However, to minimize the promotion of antimicrobial resistance and cost and to maximize efficacy, detailed knowledge of the likely pathogens and the properties of the available drugs is necessary for the intensivist...|$|R

40|$|Several studies {{based on}} US and UK data have tested the moderating effects of {{corporate}} governance on R&D investment and firm performance. However, {{there have been}} no investigations for China, in part because of data unavailability and the complicated analysis involved. In this paper we take a first step towards filling this gap using a hand collected R&D data of Chinese listed manufacturing firms. We demonstrated how board of director and managerial ownership influence the relationship between R&D and firm performance. Based on Chinese listed manufacturing firm’s data, we examine the moderating effects of board of directors and managerial stock ownership on the relationship between R&D spending and firm performance by hierarchical regression <b>and</b> <b>subgroup</b> analysis. Results show that board size has no moderating effect on the R&D-firm performance relationship, while this relationship is negatively associated with board stock ownership, frequency of board <b>meeting</b> <b>and</b> managerial stock ownership...|$|R
