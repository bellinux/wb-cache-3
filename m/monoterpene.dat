5|$|The pantropical {{subfamily}} Nasutitermitinae has a specialised caste of soldiers, {{known as}} nasutes, {{that have the}} ability to exude noxious liquids through a horn-like frontal projection that they use for defence. Nasutes have lost their mandibles through the course of evolution and must be fed by workers. A wide variety of <b>monoterpene</b> hydrocarbon solvents have been identified in the liquids that nasutes secrete.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{displays}} {{are made}} by insects including the praying mantises (Mantidae) and stick insects (Phasmatodea). While undisturbed, these insects are usually well camouflaged. When disturbed by a potential predator, they suddenly reveal their hind wings, which are brightly coloured. In mantises, the wing display is sometimes reinforced by showing brightly coloured front legs, and accompanied by a loud hissing sound created by stridulation. For example, the grasshopper Phymateus displays red and yellow areas on its hind wings; it is also aposematic, producing a distasteful secretion from its thorax. Similarly the threat display of the walking stick phasmid (Peruphasma schultei) is not a bluff: the insect sprays defensive dolichodial-like <b>monoterpene</b> chemical compounds at attackers.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight time}} of the adults or imagines begins {{in the late summer}} to early autumn, but the date depends on the region and climate. The males hatch out earlier than females and create swarms which gather around the treetops. The females seek out leks and couple with the males on the {{uppermost}} shoots. Then the females search for suitable host trees, if possible choosing weak and dry wood. They orient on <b>monoterpene</b> hydrocarbon compounds, which weakened trees produce. When a tree is stressed through dryness or exterior injuries, the compounds pervade osmotic barriers and escape from the bark.|$|E
40|$|Different {{mixtures}} of <b>monoterpenes</b> (ketone, alcohol, and alkene) were loaded on paper discs and wax and their knockdown activities were evaluated against Culex pipiens adults. Some individual <b>monoterpenes</b> were also evaluated by residual toxicity technique. Citronella oil {{as a reference}} was also loaded separately or in combination with <b>monoterpenes</b> on paper discs and wax. The ketone <b>monoterpenes</b> mixture (camphor, menthone, carvone, and fenchone) on paper discs was the most active (KT 50 = 17. 20 [*]min) followed by ketone <b>monoterpenes</b> with citronella oil (KT 50 = 20. 79 [*]min) and citronella oil alone (KT 50 = 28. 72 [*]min). Wax formulations proved that the ketone and alcohol (geraniol, thymol, and menthol) <b>monoterpenes</b> gave the most activity as knockdown (KT 50 = 31. 79 and 43. 39 [*]min, resp.). Alcohol <b>monoterpenes</b> formulation recorded KT 50 = 43. 39 [*]min. Residual activity of tested individual <b>monoterpenes</b> reported that the menthol was more toxic than camphor and camphene. Generally, {{this study suggests that}} the <b>monoterpenes</b> have the properties, which make them used as eco-friendly compounds in the control programs of Cx. pipiens adult.

25|$|Epazote {{essential}} oil contains ascaridole (up to 70%), limonene, p-cymene, and smaller amounts of numerous other monoterpenes and <b>monoterpene</b> derivatives (α-pinene, myrcene, terpinene, thymol, camphor and trans-isocarveol). Ascaridole (1,4-peroxido-p-menth-2-ene) is rather an uncommon constituent of spices; another plant owing {{much of its}} character to this <b>monoterpene</b> peroxide is boldo. Ascaridole is toxic and has a pungent, not very pleasant flavor; in pure form, it is an explosive sensitive to shock.

In 2007 Oswald et al. introduced a <b>monoterpene</b> synthase from sweet basil into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a strain of yeast. This particular <b>monoterpene</b> synthase causes the de novo synthesis of large amounts of geraniol, while also secreting it into the medium. Geraniol is a primary component in rose oil, palmarosa oil, and citronella oil as well as essential oils, making it a viable source of triacylglycerides for biodiesel production.|$|E

40|$|Concentration {{levels in}} air were {{determined}} for <b>monoterpenes</b> emitted from forestry operations in south-west Sweden. Field {{samples were collected}} on Tenax cartridges and analyzed in the laboratory by techniques based on gas chromatography. Processing of Scots pine as well as Norway spruce with a harvestor gave rise to about 1000 microgram/m 3 of total <b>monoterpenes</b> near the machine.

Antioxidant capacity of <b>monoterpenes</b> were assessed using to 2, 2 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 ’- azinobis-(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assays.

2500|$|Like most Muscat varieties, Muscat of Alexandria {{is notable}} {{for being a}} {{desirable}} raisin and table grape. This {{is due in part}} to the grape's high tolerance of heat and drought conditions. While it is used in wine production (most notably on the island of Pantelleria between Sicily and Tunisia, where it makes a passito style dessert wine under the name of [...] "Zibibbo"), the grape lags far behind the reputation of Muscat blanc à Petits Grains. This is partly because Muscat of Alexandria is very vigorous and prone to produce high yields that can be easily overcropped as well as a more assertive aroma profile due to a higher concentration of the <b>monoterpene</b> geraniol, which produces a geranium scent, and lower concentration of nerol which a more fresh, sweet rose aroma.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fruit for}} singani is {{produced}} in the Andes mountains at elevations from 5,250 up to 9,200 feet above sea level. [...] For example, the vineyards at San Juan del Oro in Tarija are at 8,850 feet amsl. [...] The largest vineyards are located at around 6,000 feet, however, due to logistical difficulties at higher elevations. [...] Given the proximity to the equator, thermoclines are higher, with a lower probability of freezing even on winter nights. [...] The structure of surrounding mountain peaks protects growing regions from seasonal cold fronts (surazos) and hailstorms that can damage plants. [...] Mountain air tends to be thin, cold and dry, yet solar radiation is stronger, passing through both warming radiation and intense ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the fact that}} mountain air cannot hold heat well, grapevines experience dramatic daily air temperature fluctuations. [...] Studies of altitude vineyards by CENAVIT and other organizations suggest that fruit subject to these conditions tends to produce greater concentrations of <b>monoterpene</b> aromatics held in a free state rather than sequestered as oils. [...] This is important as oils do not survive the distillation process. [...] The soil is fluvial erosion from surrounding peaks, well structured deep clay and sandy loam with good pitch and permeability. [...] Water is derived from snow melt and mountain rain directly from the adjacent peaks of Iscayachi. [...] Because land in the mountains is mostly vertical, acreage for singani tends to be microclimate mini-plots, one of the reasons hand-cultivation is preferred over difficult-to-deploy agricultural machinery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{transfer}} of <b>monoterpenes</b> and sesquiterpenes from forages into milk fat was stud-ied {{in a group}} of cows fed successively with forages containing high and low amounts of these sub-stances. In a first 24 -d period the cows received 11 kg of a cocksfoot hay containing low quantities of <b>monoterpenes</b> and sesquiterpenes. In a second 36 -d period, 3 kg of the cocksfoot were replaced by 3 kg of yarrow, a plant rich in terpenoids. In a third 24 -d period the cows returned to the cocksfoot-based diet they were fed in the first period. The quantities of <b>monoterpenes</b> and sesquiterpenes des-orbed from the milk fat were measured by dynamic headspace – gas chromatography – mass spec-trometry. Results showed that the quantities of <b>monoterpenes</b> had increased by the first milking carried out 8 h after ingestion of yarrow, whereas the increase in the quantities of sesquiterpenes was observed only after the third milking, 32 h after the diet change. The maximal quantities of <b>monoterpenes</b> and sesquiterpenes were measured after 4 d of the yarrow-enriched diet, after which the total quantities decreased, despite the constant supply of yarrow. Four days after discontinuing yarrow the amounts of <b>monoterpenes</b> and sesquiterpenes desorbed from the milk fat reverted to those measured during the first period...|$|R
