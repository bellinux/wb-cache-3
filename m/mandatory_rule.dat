5|$|Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed {{autonomy}} and {{was attached to}} the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a Roman colonia during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the Byzantines and later empires. Its destruction by the Timurids in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under French <b>Mandatory</b> <b>rule</b> in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of Tadmur, and the ancient site became available for excavations.|$|E

Al-Wazir and his family were {{expelled}} in July 1948, along with another 50,000–70,000 Palestinians from Lydda and Ramla, following Israel's capture of the area during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. They settled in the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, where al-Wazir attended a secondary school run by UNRWA. While in high school, he began organizing a small group of fedayeen to harass Israelis at military posts near the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|As president, Quwatli {{continued}} {{to press for}} Syrian independence from France. In a bid to garner American and British support for his government, he declared war against the Axis Powers, aligning Syria with the Allies. Growing countrywide unrest in response to French <b>Mandatory</b> <b>rule</b> led to French military assaults against Damascus and other Syrian cities in May 1945. More French troops were scheduled to land in Syria to aid the authorities, but at Quwatli's request for intervention, British troops invaded Syria from Transjordan, entering Damascus on 1 June. The French military campaign came to an immediate halt as a consequence; the UK and the US had viewed the French military action in Syria as a potential catalyst for further unrest throughout the Middle East and a detriment to British and American lines of communication in the region.|$|E
40|$|Internationally <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> {{are rules}} {{relating}} to public policy {{which should be}} applied directly to certain international situations, regardless of the applicable law designated by the conflict of laws. For {{the first time in}} the history of Chinese private international law, the PRC passed the Act of the PRC on Application of Law to Foreign-Related Civil Relations, which defines the direct application of the internationally <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> in Article 4.

Subsequently it analyses the overriding <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> regulated by the EU law. These are principally provisions contained in the Rome I Regulation and Rome II Regulation. Finally, it discusses the overriding mandatory provisions {{of the law of}} the forum and overriding mandatory provisions of another foreign law regulated by the Private International Law Act.

40|$|The role of <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> in {{international}} arbitration remains a persistent source of debate. The basic {{problem is a}} straightforward one: contractual arbitration arises {{as a matter of}} the parties’ consent, but the resolution of contractual disputes can implicate <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> of law that are not waivable and are typically designed to protect broader public rights. The literature has often presented the issue in terms of conflict between the authority {{of the state and the}} party-derived authority of the arbitrator. Asserting an independent public duty to protect national mandatory laws as well as the enforceability of arbitral awards, some writers have urged arbitrators to apply a so-called “mandatory rules method” to determine, irrespective of the parties’ agreement, which particular <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> to apply in a particular dispute. This Article takes a skeptical view of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> literature and argues that arbitration of <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> is readily handled within the standard, contractual view of arbitration. Advocates of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> method rely on a mistaken view of national arbitrability doctrines that, once corrected, deprives the argument of much of its force. The consequences of this insight are nevertheless limited because modern arbitration agreements generally give arbitrators far more authority to apply <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> than many assume. Indeed, applying a special <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> method will typically narrow rather than expand the range of <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> available to the arbitrator. There may be reasons why that narrowing is prudent, but those are not reasons the existing literature has thus far discussed...|$|R
5|$|Gaza {{experienced}} destructive earthquakes in 1903 and 1914. In 1917, during World War I, British forces {{captured the}} city. Gaza grew {{significantly in the}} first half of the 20th century under <b>Mandatory</b> <b>rule.</b> The population of the city swelled as a result of the Palestinian exodus during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Gaza came under Egyptian rule until it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War. Gaza became a center of political resistance during the First Intifada, and under the Oslo Accords of 1993, it was assigned to be under the direct control of the newly established Palestinian Authority. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005. By 2007, Hamas emerged both as the victor in Palestinian elections and in factional fighting with rival Fatah in the city and in the wider Gaza Strip and has since been the sole governing authority. Israel subsequently blockaded the Strip and launched assaults against it in 2008–2009, 2012 and 2014, as a response to rocket attacks.|$|E

Egypt gained nominal independence in 1922, but Britain continued to exert {{a strong influence}} on the country until the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 which limited Britain’s presence to a garrison of troops on the Suez Canal until 1945. Lebanon became an independent state in 1943, but French troops would not withdraw until 1946, {{the same year that}} Syria won its independence from France.|$|E
25|$|In the European Union, {{copyrights}} {{have been}} harmonized amongst {{the member states}} by the EU directive 93/98/EEC on harmonising the term of copyright protection. This binding directive, which became effective on July 1, 1995, has raised the duration of copyrights throughout the union to 70 years p.m.a. It also includes in its article 7 a <b>mandatory</b> <b>rule</b> of the shorter term for works from non-EU countries. Within the EU, no comparison of terms is applied, and—as in the Berne Convention or in the UCC—existing international obligations (such as bilateral treaties) may override this rule of the shorter term. Directive 93/98/EEC was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> and international arbitration. The first facet of this relation is arbitrability, which is now no longer a debated issue since it is recognized in all systems that <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> do not hinder {{the possibility of a}} dispute being settled by arbitration. The second facet relates to the treatment of <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> by arbitrators. The article explores the approach that arbitrators must take to deciding which <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> to apply and how to apply them, including the relations with public authorities. The third facet of the problem is the approach to be taken by the courts in the review of awards involving <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules.</b> It considers the different problems that arise in relation to the review of awards according to the standard of public policy, including the extent and intrusiveness of the review, taking into consideration the primary interest of finality of awards...|$|R

40|$|Peremptory {{rules in}} {{international}} business transactions The topic of this diploma thesis covers {{the issue of}} peremptory or rather overriding <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> in international business transactions. Overriding <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> are rules which shall apply despite the choice of law made by the parties of the contract. These rules, which are usually of a public nature, serve to implement some crucial public interests and may have important impacts on business relationships. The objective of this thesis is to, firstly, characterize overriding <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> and secondly, to analyze the system of regulation of foreign trade with certain specific kinds of goods, where these rules are typically to be found. This thesis is divided into 12 chapters and also includes a general introduction and a final conclusion. The first chapters aim to provide a complex definition of overriding <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> including one on what distinguishes these rules from public policy. The process of application of these rules based on their origin is examined in detail. The closest attention {{is given to the}} process of applying these rules when {{they are part of the}} law of a third country. The following chapters then focus on an area of law of which the use of overriding <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> is characteristic., i. e. the regulation of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|While party {{autonomy}} {{has risen}} {{in the field}} of contract, this autonomy is not unfettered. Parties are allowed to choose the governing law of the contract but limitations on party choice can be seen through the operation of public policy and <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules.</b> The public policy and <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> of three laws may be imposed onto the contract: that of the lex fori, the governing law of the contract and the law of a third country with a connection to the contract. It is generally accepted that the public policy and <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> of the forum have a legitimate role to play in the regulation of the contract. Some continental, particularly German, theorists are more equivocal about whether the public policy and <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules</b> of the governing law of the contract have a similar legitimacy. Nevertheless, the most controversial issue with regard to restrictions on party autonomy is whether the law of a third country is or should be given effect.

The commission decided in July 1925 that Mosul should remain part of Iraq, that Iraq should remain under British <b>Mandatory</b> <b>rule</b> for 25 years and that Kurdish cultural rights and self-administration be recognized by the Iraqi state. Al-Hashimi was replaced by Abd al-Muhsin as-Sa'dun in June. Al-Hashimi opposed as-Sa'dun's government and in November 1925 founded the People's Party (hizb ash-sha'b) to garner opposition to the administration.

This article shows that neither this approach nor the much more pro-arbitration biased solutions proposed by critics are convincing.
