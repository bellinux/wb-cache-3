40|$|We {{present a}} new {{computational}} model for predicting {{the effect of}} blast loading on structures. The model is based in the adaptive coupling of the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element method (DEM) for the accurate reproduction of <b>multifracturing</b> and failure of structures under blast loading. In the paper we briefly describe {{the basis of the}} coupled DEM/FEM technology and demonstrate its efficiency in its application {{to the study of the}} effect of blast loading on a masonry wall, a masonry tunnel and a double curvature dam.

40|$|This paper {{presented}} a 3 D point sink model through using Dirac function. Then, 3 D point sink solution in boxed reservoirs was obtained through using Laplace transform and Fourier transform methods. Based on the flux and pressure equivalent conditions in Laplace space, a semianalytical solution for <b>multifractured</b> horizontal wells was also {{proposed for the}} first time. The production rate distribution was discussed in detail for <b>multifractured</b> horizontal wells. The calculative results show the outermost fractures had higher production ratio due to larger drainage area and the inner fractures were lower due to the strong interface between fractures. Type curves were established to analyze the flow characteristics, which would be divided into six stages, for example, bilinear flow region, the first linear flow region, the first radial flow region, the second linear flow region, the second radial flow region, and the boundary dominated flow region, respectively. Finally, effects of some sensitive parameters on type curves were also analyzed in detail...|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} {{fracture}} aperture variations {{in two and}} three fracture systems was studied by determining the thermal performance of an ensemble of fracture realizations. The wellbore spacing and the Hurst coefficient were kept constant and the standard deviation of the aperture was varied over the same range considered before. Finally, we examined the efficacy of flow control methods in minimizing any negative effects aperture variations have on the thermal performance of <b>multifracture</b> systems.|$|R
30|$|Kolditz (1995) {{suggested}} that local aperture variations {{may play a}} strong role in a reservoir’s thermal performance. Jupe et al. (1995) attempted to model spatial aperture variations by modeling separate flow paths. They used the <b>multifracture</b> parallel rectangular reservoir model described by Nicol and Robinson (1990) and treated the different flow paths as separate fractures. Their work focused on determining the wellbore spacing needed to obtain an economic EGS reservoir. By incorporating multiple flow paths, the wellbore spacing needed to obtain their desired performance criteria went from 700  m (no channeling) to 1080  m.|$|R
40|$|Short-term {{placement}} of double-J (D-J) ureteral stents after endourologic procedures and some open urological surgery is common. It is rare {{for a patient}} {{to forget about the}} indwelling D-J ureteral stent, and the major complications associated with that include infection, stone encrustation and <b>multifractured</b> stent. We report a case of a forgotten D-J ureteral stent, which had been placed 24 months previously during ureterorenoscopic lithotripsy, in a 62 -year-old man who presented with flank soreness and recurrent urinary tract infection. Radiography of the kidney, ureter and bladder, and computed tomography demonstrated stone encrustation over the whole D-J stent. Cystolithotripsy and ureterorenoscopic lithotripsy with a Holmium laser were performed to remove the D-J. We believe {{that this is the first}} case of successful removal of an intact, encrusted stent in one procedure by endoscopic manipulation...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the theory}} of the {{extended}} finite element method (XFEM), which was first proposed by Moës for dealing with the problem characterized by discontinuities, an extended finite element model for predicting productivity of <b>multifractured</b> horizontal well has been established. The model couples four main porous flow regimes, including fluid flow in the away-from-wellbore region of reservoir matrix, radial flow in the near-wellbore region of reservoir matrix, linear flow in the away-from-wellbore region of fracture, and radial flow in the near-wellbore region of fracture by considering mass transfer between fracture and matrix. The method to introduce the interior well boundary condition into the XFEM is proposed, and therefore the model can be highly adaptable to the complex and asymmetrical physical conditions. Case studies indicate that this kind of multiflow problems can be solved with high accuracy by the use of the XFEM...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} {{and performance of}} horizontal drilling and completions has increased {{during the last two}} decades. Horizontal wells are advantageous compared to vertical wells in thin reservoirs, reservoirs with favorable vertical permeability and reservoirs with water and gas coning problems. In many reservoirs, the ratio of horizontal permeability to the vertical permeability is substantially larger than one and often is close to 10. Thus, these reservoirs are very good candidates for hydraulic fracturing. By hydraulic fracturing one or more fractures are created, which can be longitudinal or orthogonal. By that, flow is altered and it mostly conducts horizontally through reservoir toward horizontal wellbore. With this altered flow, fluid is produced faster, with less pressure loss by fluid unit of produced fluid. Some of the existing mathematical models to determine the productivity of <b>multifractured</b> horizontal wells are presented in this work (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{consensus}} that preexisting natural fractures {{play an important role}} during stimulation. A novel fully coupled hydromechanical model using extended finite element method is proposed. This directly coupled scheme avoids the cumbersome process during calculating the fluid pressure in complicated fracture networks and translating into an equivalent nodal force. Numerical examples are presented to simulate the hydraulic fracture propagation paths for simultaneous <b>multifracture</b> treatments with properly using the stress shadow effects for horizontal wells and to reveal the deformation response and interaction mechanism between hydraulic induced fracture and nonintersected natural fractures at orthotropic and nonorthotropic angles. With the stress shadow effects, the induced hydraulic flexural fracture deflecting to wellbore rather than transverse fracture would be formed during the progress of simultaneous fracturing for a horizontal well. The coupled hydromechanical simulation reveals that the adjacent section to the intersection is opened and the others are closed for orthogonal natural fracture, while the nonorthogonal natural fracture is activated near the intersection firstly and along the whole section with increasing perturbed stresses. The results imply that the induced hydraulic fracture tends to cross orthotropic natural fracture, while it is prior to being arrested by the nonorthotropic natural fracture...|$|R
40|$|Tight oil {{formations}} (permeability <  1 mD) in Western Canada {{have recently}} {{emerged as a}} reliable resource of light oil supply owing {{to the use of}} <b>multifractured</b> horizontal wells. The Cardium formation, which contains 25 % of Alberta’s total discovered light oil (according to Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board), consists of conventional and unconventional (low-permeability or tight) play areas. The conventional play areas have been developed since 1957. Contrarily, the development of unconventional play is a recent event, due to considerably poorer reservoir properties which increases the risk associated with capital investment. This in turn implies the need for a comprehensive and critical study of the area before planning any development strategy. 				This paper presents performance results from the low permeability portions of the Cardium formation where new horizontal wells have been drilled and stimulated in multiple stages to promote transverse hydraulic fractures. Development of the tight Cardium formation using primary recovery is considered. The production data of these wells was first matched using a black oil simulator. The calibrated model presented was used for performance perditions based on sensitivity studies and investigations that encompassed design factors such as well spacing, fracture properties and operational constraints...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{established}} a triple porosity physical model in rectangular closed reservoirs {{to understand the}} complex fluid flowing mechanism and production behavior of <b>multifractured</b> horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs, which is more appropriate for practical situation compared with previous ones. According to the seepage theory considering adsorption and desorption process in stable state, the gas production rate of a well producing at constant wellbore pressure was obtained by utilizing the methods of Green’s and source function theory and superposition principle. Meanwhile, the volume of adsorbed gas (GL) {{and the number of}} hydraulic fractures (M) as well as permeabilities of matrix system (km) and microfractures (kf) were discussed in this paper as sensitive factors, which have significant influences on the production behavior of the wells. The bigger the value of GL is, the larger the well production rate will be in the later flowing periods, and the differences of production rate with the increasing of M are small, which manifest that there is an optimum M for a given field. Therefore, the study in this paper is of significant importance to understand the dynamic production declining performance in shale gas reservoirs...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} spatial {{aperture}} {{variations on the}} thermal performance of discretely fractured geothermal reservoirs was investigated using finite element method solutions to the convective heat transfer in the fracture coupled with a boundary integral description of conductive heat transfer in the rock. The dipolar flow was generated by a source of fluid volume at an injection well and a sink at a production well within a circular fracture. The statistics of the thermal performance of an ensemble of fracture realizations was evaluated. Fractures with self-affine aperture fields where long range correlations dominant over short range correlations were generated. The results showed that spatial aperture variations most frequently lead to diminished thermal performance by creating flow channeling that reduces the heat transfer area. Enhanced thermal performance occurred in the less common cases when the aperture was small in the region between the wellbores, causing fluid flow to sweep out greater areas of the fracture and extract heat from a larger area. The standard deviation of the apertures had the largest influence on the thermal performance, while the spatial correlation of the aperture played a secondary role. Larger values of the standard deviation led to more adverse thermal performance. For the range of standard deviations investigated, the fraction of fractures exhibiting enhanced thermal performance compared to the base case of no aperture variations ranged from 34 to 49  %. The degradation of thermal performance due to aperture variations was largest when the well bore spacing was a larger fraction of the fracture diameter. Reservoirs consisting of two non-intersecting fractures connected to the same injection and production wells were also modeled. The uneven split of the flow between the reservoirs in this case caused a further deterioration of thermal performance compared with the single fracture reservoirs. However, flow control was able to overcome {{nearly all of the}} additional loss of thermal performance for the <b>multifracture</b> reservoir.|$|R
40|$|This work {{successfully}} {{applied the}} gas-phase partitioning tracer method {{to determine the}} NAPL, water and air saturations in the vadose zone at the field scale. This project {{was one of the}} first, and still one of the few, field-scale gas-phase partitioning tracer tests. This work differs from other work in that it was conducted in a high water content, fractured clay. There were three primary components of this work. First, gas-phase tracers were identified and their NAPL-air and Henry's Law constants measured. There were four types of tracers used in this study: noble gases or nonpartitioning tracers; alkanes, which were expected to be nonpartitioning tracers; perfluorides, NAPL partitioning tracers; and halons, NAPL and water partitioning tracers. A laboratory method for measuring NAPL-air partition coefficients was developed and TCE-air partition coefficients were measured for the perfluoride and halon tracers. The second component of this study involved conducting a field-scale gas-phase partitioning tracer test, the results which were used to estimate NAPL, water and air saturations. The NAPL saturation, calculated to be an extremely low value, resulted in an estimate of NAPL mass present that is similar to the amount that has subsequently been extracted from the test site via SVE remediation. The alkane tracers, which had been used previously in laboratory column studies as nonpartitioning tracers, were more retarded than the perfluoride tracers at this site. It was the alkane tracers, and not the halon tracers, that were used to determine the water content. The water content was estimated to be approximately 90 %, which is unexpectedly high for a vadose zone. Additionally, the tracer response time, vacuum data, and other geological data indicated that the tracer test was performed in fractured clay. The third component of this work comprised an analysis of the tracer test data to determine transport parameters. The analysis employed matching eight simple mathematical models to the experimental data. All of the models tested: two porous, three double-porosity, and three fracture-based (single fracture, <b>multifracture,</b> fracture-matrix) models could reasonably match the experimental data and no one model resulted in consistently superior predictions than the others...|$|R
40|$|This paper shows a new {{multidisciplinary}} interpretation {{approach to}} the internal structure of Tenerife Island. The central core of this work is {{the determination of the}} three-dimensional attenuation structure of the region using P-waves and the coda normalization method. This study has been performed using 45, 303 seismograms recorded at 85 seismic stations from an active experiment (air gun shots) conducted in January 2007. The interpretation of these new results is done combining the new images with previous studies performed in the area such as seismic velocity tomography, magnetic structure, magnetotelluric surveys or gravimetric models. Our new 3 D images indicate the presence of seismic attenuation contrasts, with areas of high and low seismic attenuation patterns. High seismic attenuation zones are observed both in shallow and in deeper areas. The shallowest area of Las Cañadas caldera complex (1 – 3 km thick) is dominated by high attenuation behavior, and it is interpreted as the combined effect of sedimentary and volcanoclastic deposits, <b>multifracture</b> systems and the presence of shallow aquifers. At the same time, the deeper analyzed area, more than 8 km below sea level, is dominated by a high attenuation pattern, and it is interpreted as the consequence of the effect of high-temperature rocks in the crustal–mantle boundary. This interpretation is compatible and confirmed by previous models that indicate the presence of underplating magma in this region. On the contrary, some low attenuation bodies and structures have been identified at different depths. A deep low attenuation central body is interpreted as the original central structure associated with the early stage of Tenerife Island. At shallower depths, some low attenuation bodies are compatible with old intermediate magmatic chambers postulated by petrological studies. Finally, in the north of the island (La Orotava valley) we can interpret the low attenuation structure as the headwall of this valley, supporting the idea that Las Cañadas caldera and this valley resulted from two different destructive processes. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

40|$|Effective rate-time {{analysis}} {{during a}} declining production in an oil or gas wells {{is an important}} tool for establishing a successful management.   The reasons behind the production decline include reservoir, fracture and well conditions. A well's decline rate is transient, signifying that the pressure wave propagates freely from the wellbore, leading to depletion when the outer boundary for the well is reached and to the wave propagation coming to a halt. This thesis studies the transient decline, with emphasis on a horizontal well with fracture wellbore responses. It also deals with the depletion decline, investigating the wellbore pressure responses for a vertical well producing under variable rate conditions of Arps decline. The well decline model solutions are analytical, and the modelling itself is carried out in two steps. The first step involves modelling the transient well responses of a <b>multifractured</b> horizontal well. These responses originate from an infinitive reservoir and are considered as full-time rate-time responses. Multi-fractured horizontal well rate-time responses represent the solutions to a diffusion equation with varying boundary conditions and different fracture options (i. e., with or without fracture, a variety of fracture orientations, various frature lengths, etc). The transient model calculates individual fracture rates, productivity indexes and an equivalent wellbore radius for the multi-fractured well. For the transient decline of a fractured-horizontal well model, well data is matched and the servoir diagnosis and production prognosis are improved through the individual fracture production, with a model screening ability, and novel model features that can handle wellbore conditions changing from rate-to-pressure. Screening analyses can generate valuable information for fracture diagnosis {{in addition to a}} well and fracture production prognosis. Further model runs are carried out to match the real well data. The model solution is complementary to the reservoir simulation. More geology features should be considered to fully take advatage of the modelling findings. The starting point of the second modelling step concerns late time vertical-well responses or decline curves involving empiracal solution of Arps type. This includes an investigation of well pressure responses for a rate decline of an Arps-type variable-rate of a wellbore for selected exponets, b. The modelling explores pressure wellbore responses during a variable-rate production, and the approach intorduces a no-flow specified boundary that moves outwards from a wellbore axis with a predifined speed. For the specific speed of a no-flow moving boundary, the model generates pressure profiles causing the decline exponents, b. Known b values were selected and each of them was empirically derived through the inflow performance relationships to a frive mechanism. This modelling approuch with analytically derived pressure solutions can be extended to a horizontal well. Furthermore, the continuously measured well rates and pressure models can be calibrated and verified.
