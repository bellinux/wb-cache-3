500|$|The inquest in August 1971 was {{not able}} to {{establish}} the exact sequence of events. [...] It was established that all three were shot at very close range, probably in a line. All had been drinking, and Joseph was found to be severely intoxicated. The jury was told that the three were probably shot whilst relieving themselves beside the road. The coroner commented: [...] "You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this was not only murder, but one of the vilest crimes ever heard of in living memory". The bodies were heaped {{on top of each other}} with two beer glasses lying near to them. After failing to return to their barracks by 18:30 the three were listed as AWOL. Their bodies were found by children at 21:30.|$|E
500|$|Section 4 {{creates the}} defence of public good, which applies both to prosecutions for {{publication}} of obscene materials {{and to the}} forfeiture proceedings described in Section 3. This allows for a valid defence if the defendant can show that {{the publication of the}} materials was justifiable as for the [...] "public good", which is defined as [...] "in the interests of science, literature, art or learning, or of other objects of general concern". Experts and their testimony are admissible for determining the value of such publications. This section was initially treated very strictly by trial judges, but this attitude was reversed after the 1976 trial of the book Inside Linda Lovelace, where the jury found the publishers not guilty despite the judge saying that [...] "if this isn't obscene, members of the jury, you <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> nothing is obscene". Three years later the Williams Committee recommended that restrictions on written pornography be lifted, and these restrictions have been largely abandoned.|$|E

Rather, the blessed Virgin and St. John shall sit beside the supreme Judge as assessors. The mercy which is extended now will have no place then. There will only be strict justice at that day.|$|R

Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] is [...] "a sunny pop track that finds Lea Michele and Cory Monteith railing against conformity and celebrating their individuality in their verses". Other cast member lyrics include the lyric [...] "You may think I'm a freak show", responded to by Naya Rivera with the spoken [...] "I don't care". The song features self-empowerment lyrics which revolve around revenge fantasies, such as in Monteith's lines - [...] "I could be a superstar / I'll see you when you wash my car". According to Melinda Newman of HitFix the song is about [...] "being a loser now, but turning in to a winner now who never, ever looks back". Aly Semigran of MTV News said the lyrics of the [...] "peppy pop ditty" [...] keep [...] "in tune with the themes of the show".|$|E
500|$|Edward Latessa, {{professor}} {{and head of}} division of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati, declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated. Latessa stated that the prisoners <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they are getting {{something out of the}} performances, when, in reality, they are not. He described it as having a potentially harmful effect. The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs, like substance abuse or family reunification programs, should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor. The detention workers disagreed with the assessment, deeming the activities to {{be an integral part of}} rehabilitation. [...] "It combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance", Thomeczeck argued. [...] "In more ways than one, it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration. It's a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually. That's good, isn't it?". Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Now that's a 'breakout' hit: The clip of inmates at a high-security prison in the Philippines performing an intricately choreographed dance to Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller" [...] has nabbed more than 42 million views since 2007." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the 1985 event, {{described}} by two wine writers as [...] "the best ever", the annual barrel tasting moved to California.

The move was {{in part because of the}} event's popularity; so many people sought places each year that the restaurant was having to refuse tickets to some of its regular customers. The venue used in 1986, San Francisco's Stanford Court Hotel, could accommodate twice as many guests. [...] "Woody Allen <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> going West and dying are the same thing," [...] Asher explained, [...] "but we're going to prove him wrong." [...] The first barrel tasting in San Francisco was also considered a success by most who attended, with the main difference being the atmosphere, which Barbara Ensrud, a wine writer who had attended every barrel tasting so far, said was [...] "a lot more relaxed than it ever was in New York." ...|$|E
