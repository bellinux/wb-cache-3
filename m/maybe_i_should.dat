[...] Vulović declined therapy to help her cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist.

500|$|After {{five years}} of {{substance}} abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs {{and a return to}} his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{vacationing in}} the Bahamas and Costa Rica in 2008, Saadiq {{observed}} people there listening to classic soul music and {{was inspired to}} pursue it as a musical direction for his next album. He recounted the experience in an interview for Blues & Soul, saying that [...] "I was like 'Wow, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> tap into this vibe, because it’s actually what I LOVE!' ... I realised that, though {{you can hear it}} in many of the records I've done throughout my career, I'd never paid 100% attention to going in that direction before. So the difference this time is that I took a more focused route." [...] As a part of Tony! Toni! Toné! during the late 1980s and 1990s, Saadiq had incorporated influences from the music of Motown in his songwriting for the group. Before recording The Way I See It, Saadiq signed to Columbia Records. Label executive Rick Rubin visited Saadiq's home studio and was impressed by his material there. He said of Rubin's visit and advice to him as a solo artist, [...] "He told me to never box myself in. I just have to be myself. You've got to follow your own path. I've always gone down the road less traveled, but now I do it even more aggressively." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers in both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Although Bird spoke of his satisfaction of controlling {{the pace of the}} feature race, he believed he was fortunate because of him receiving a new rear wing after being impacted by Ceccon at the first start, [...] "It’s an amazing to be able to win my first GP2 race in Monaco. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have done it already in the past in GP2, but it felt pretty right today." [...] Ceccon stated he was [...] "happy" [...] to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of Evans, [...] " [...] It’s my first GP2 podium and it’s {{two years in a row}} that I finish on the podium here since I finished third last year in GP3 here as well. Today, I finished in P2 in race 1. It’s good." [...] When asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish, Evans replied yes as he struggled with grip on his supersoft compound tyres at the restart and was being pressured by Bird on the harder soft compound tyres. Evans believed that had he overtaken Ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to Bird and felt the best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept the result.|$|E

Busch climbed out of his demolished car and until paramedics came, whenever he saw Spencer driving by him under caution, he pointed at Spencer and repeatedly shouted at him.

50|$|Funny thing is, Epitaph, who's under {{pressure}} here, didn't {{have anything to}} do with making the video at all. The only money spent on this video came out of my pocket—I'd been saving up checks from art jobs just to shoot this second video for our new record—one that there was no budget for in our recording contract, but that I was passionate about, and knew that people would be tickled to see. Epitaph didn't even know we were making a video! When we brought back the footage, they were thrilled, and then totally got behind us—helping us get great online coverage, and hopefully TV as well. Having them behind us gets our video and song much more potential coverage. <b>Maybe</b> instead <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have just slipped the thing online right when we finished it.

[...] He praised the staff's helpfulness in finding another place to valet-park his car with two bicycles on top, and the two half-liter water bottles and Toblerone candy bars on the desk when he came in. He had a few minor complaints: at the time (2007) the hotel did not have free Wi-Fi, the room's light switch could not function as a dimmer, and the hotel would stock the mini-bar only on a guest's request.|$|E

On 12 July 2012, Reddy returned to the musical stage at Croce's Jazz Bar in San Diego and for a benefit concert for the arts at St. Genevieve High School in Panorama City, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. Reddy also sang a duet ("You're Just in Love") with senior choir member Rosalind Smith.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Jackson {{and his new}} teammates was strained due to an interview with SPORT magazine writer Robert Ward. During spring training at the Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Jackson and Ward were having drinks at a nearby bar. Jackson's {{version of the story}} is that he noted that the Yankees had won the pennant the year before, but lost the World Series to the Reds, and suggested that they needed one thing more to win it all, and pointed out the various ingredients in his drink. Ward suggested that Jackson might be [...] "the straw that stirs the drink."
