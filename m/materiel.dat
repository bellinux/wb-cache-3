5|$|Finland had {{a limited}} defence budget after its {{independence}} {{and especially in}} the 1930s. Consequently, the Finnish Defence Forces were lacking military <b>materiel</b> in almost all branches. Much of the military's <b>materiel</b> was outdated, and even proved unsuitable for the field during the Winter War. During the Winter War the material situation improved, but it still lagged behind the more modern and well-equipped Red Army.|$|E

5|$|After the {{initiation}} of U.S. naval interdiction efforts in coastal waters, known as Operation Market Time, the trail had to do double duty. <b>Materiel</b> sent from the north was stored in caches in the border regions that were soon retitled Base Areas, which, in turn, became sanctuaries for NLF and PAVN forces seeking respite and resupply after conducting operations within South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor and the {{beginning}} of the Malayan Campaign on 7 December 1941, Centaurs run was curtailed to Broome, Western Australia.

5|$|Relations with France were {{important}} after World War I {{and in the}} 1920s, as France {{played a leading role}} in the new European security arrangements. In the 1930s France started to fear the rise of Nazi Germany and initiated a rapprochement with the Soviet Union, which strained Franco-Finnish relations. However, during the Winter War France was one of the most important suppliers of military <b>materiel.</b>|$|E

5|$|The U.S. 21st Infantry Regiment {{suffered}} 228 killed, 61 wounded, 215 captured, and 27 {{missing in}} the battle; a total of 531 casualties. Of those, 130 of the captured and 20 of the missing died. Additionally, 23 other American units engaged in the region suffered 31 killed, 79 wounded, 15 captured and 9 missing; in total a further 134 casualties. This brought {{the total number of}} casualties for the three-day period to 665 and made Chochiwon the bloodiest battle for American forces yet in the conflict; greater than the casualty counts at Osan, Pyongtaek and Chonan combined. The loss of <b>materiel</b> was also great with the 21st Infantry Regiment losing enough equipment and <b>materiel</b> to outfit two rifle battalions, and enough clothing to equip 975 men. Against these losses North Korean casualties could not be estimated {{due to a lack of}} communication among fighting units, which limited the value of American signals intelligence.|$|E
50|$|The D.31 {{was owned}} by the Centre d'Essais de <b>Matériels</b> Aériens (CEMA) at Villacoublay. it {{remained}} registered there in June 1935 but had gone two years later, prompting speculation {{that it may have}} been used by Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War.|$|R

5|$|UN forces, {{consisting}} {{primarily of}} {{troops from the}} Republic of Korea (ROK), the United States (US), and United Kingdom (UK), enjoyed overwhelming air and sea superiority during the battle.

5|$|After Midway and the {{exhausting}} attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in <b>materiel</b> (particularly aircraft carriers) and men (especially well-trained pilots and maintenance crewmen) rapidly became insufficient {{to cope with}} mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial and training capabilities made losses far easier to replace. The Battle of Midway, along with the Guadalcanal Campaign, is widely considered {{a turning point in}} the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army, needing transports to get its men and <b>materiel</b> to France, had a select committee of shipping executives pore over registries of American shipping. The committee selected El Occidente and thirteen other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough fuel in their s for transatlantic crossings, and, most importantly, were in port or not far at sea. After El Occidente discharged her last load of passengers and cargo, she was officially {{handed over to the}} Army on 30 May.|$|E

50|$|Nord-Aviation (Northern Aviation) was a {{state-owned}} French aircraft manufacturer.

50|$|Curriculum {{included}} Polish language, Latin, Greek, English, mathematics, physics, history, geography, religion, {{physical education}} and singing. Young men exclusively were attending State Classical Grammar School. As soon as school year 1920/1921 started, a great care was put to acquire scientific equipments and class <b>materiels,</b> such as physics furniture or equipment for drawing room. the number labs increased almost every year. Much attention was devoted to re-equip the library collections.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1961, General Maxwell D. Taylor, President John F. Kennedy's special {{military}} representative, had {{become interested in}} the prospect of erecting a physical barrier to halt the increasing infiltration of PAVN <b>materiel</b> (and later, manpower) through their Laotian logistical corridor and into the border regions of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). He then held talks with the Deputy Director of the Pentagon's Office of Special Operations, Edward G. Lansdale, who convinced him that a better solution to the infiltration dilemma would be the creation of mobile units to attack the infiltrators.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable <b>materiel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brett {{departed}} for the Western Front in November 1917 but suffered {{a case of}} appendicitis, resulting {{in the loss of}} his flight status. After making a partial recovery, he served in France as senior <b>materiel</b> officer under Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, attaining the temporary rank of major on 7 June 1918. After briefly returned to the United States to serve in Office of the Director of Military Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. from 1 August to 23 September 1918, Brett went to England to command the United States Army Air Service Camp at Codford.|$|E
5000|$|In Charles Becker’s paper titled [...] "Vestiges historiques, trémoins <b>matériels</b> du passé clans {{les pays}} Sereer", {{two types of}} Serer relics were noted: [...] "the non-material remains which are {{cultural}} in nature" [...] and [...] "material remains, which are many revealed through products or artefacts."The historical vestiges of Serer country in modern-day Senegambia, the diversity of Serer culture manifested across dialects, family and social organisation which reflect different historical territories were observed.|$|R

A second C.580 was built (F-ANAT) but their history after the spring of 1935 is not recorded in the French aviation journals.

50|$|Obtained a {{fleet of}} Douglas DC-7C and DC-7CF {{aircraft}} (with {{the assistance of the}} Rhodesian Government) which were registered in Gabon, when the airline became {{a major part of the}} Rhodesian sanctions-busting operations. They flew beef to Gabon, from where it was flown out by aircraft of its associate company Affretair. Essential <b>materiels</b> for the Rhodesian security forces were brought into the country on the return flights. Affretair migrated to Zimbabwe after independence, when it replaced Air Trans Africa.|$|R
