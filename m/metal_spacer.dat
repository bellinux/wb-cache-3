25|$|However, <b>metal</b> <b>spacers</b> conduct heat (unless {{the metal}} is {{thermally}} improved), undermining {{the ability of}} the insulated glass unit (IGU) to reduce heat flow.

To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces condensation on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall U-value.|$|R
50|$|Japanese Handles {{are made}} of ho wood burned in and {{friction}} fitted to a hidden tang with a buffalo horn bolster capping the handle-blade junction to prevent splitting. This allows easy installation and replacement. The wood is porous and fine grained so as to not split and to retain grip when wet. More decorative woods as ebony, yew, cherry, or chestnut (often charred on the outside to improve grip and water resistance) are used and are heavier and some {{are more prone to}} cracking if not well cured or cared for properly in exposure to humidity. A silver colored <b>metal</b> <b>spacer</b> is sometimes seen in ebony handles to celebrate the completion of a chef's apprenticeship. The handle is lighter and greater in volume than most Western counterparts. The general shapes are chestnut (or D) and octagon among other variations of these shapes, with most tapering slightly larger toward the tail end. Some sand the ho wood handles as they do retain particles of dirt or sharpening swarf and discolor. Chefs who prefer a more blade-heavy knife, a lighter knife overall, a larger handle for other wise cramped hands, cutting techniques associated with sensitive knife feel, generally lower cost, and easily replaceable handles prefer the Japanese handle.|$|E

40|$|Background: Guidelines advise weekly {{cleansing}} of spacers, {{with one}} of the reasons being to prevent the spacers from becoming colonized with respiratory pathogens. Earlier work in clinical settings showed conflicting results. Methods: Common respiratory pathogens and Candida albicans were applied on Petri dishes with and without inhaled corticosteroids and in 3 brands of spacer devices, with and without inhaled corticosteroids. Growth was measured. Results: After 24 hours, Staphylococcus aureus grew in 7 of 18 spacers (39 %); Pseudomonas aeruginosa grew in 12 out of 18 spacers (67 %); and C albicans survived in 5 of 18 spacers (28 %). Microorganisms survived on Petri dishes with fluticasone and beclomethasone but not when budesonide was applied. One out of 30 metal Nebuhalers (3 %) was colonized after 24 hours, whereas of 30 Volumatics 3 (27 %) and Aerochambers, 17 (57 %) still had viable microorganisms. Application of inhaled steroids did not affect growth in the spacers. Conclusion: The colonization of <b>metal</b> <b>spacers</b> is lower than of spacers made of polycarbonate or polyethylene.

40|$|Objective: We present our {{experience}} of treating nine consecutive cases of rheumatoid arthritis involving the craniovertebral junction by atlantoaxial joint manipulation and attempts towards restoration of craniovertebral region alignments. Material and results: Between November 2001 and March 2004, nine cases of rheumatoid arthritis involving the craniovertebral junction were treated in our department of neurosurgery. Six patients had basilar invagination and &#x 0027;fixed&#x 0027; atlantoaxial dislocation and three patients had a retroodontoid process pannus and mobile and incompletely reducible atlantoaxial dislocation. The patients ranged from 24 to 74 years in age. Six patients were males and three were females. Neck pain and spastic quadriparesis were the most prominent symptoms. Surgery involved attempts to reduce the atlantoaxial dislocation and basilar invagination by manual distraction of the facets of the atlas and axis. Reduction of the atlantoaxial dislocation and of basilar invagination and stabilization of the region was achieved by placement of bone graft and <b>metal</b> <b>spacers</b> within the joint and direct inter-articular plate and screw method of atlantoaxial fixation.

40|$|Soft x-ray {{fluorescence}} spectroscopy {{has been used}} to examine the electronic structure of deeply buried silicide thin films that arise in Fe/Si multilayers. These systems exhibit antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling of the Fe layers, despite their lack of a noble <b>metal</b> <b>spacer</b> layer found in most GMR materials. Also, the degree of coupling is very dependent on preparation conditions, especially spacer layer thickness and growth temperature.

The dipole-dipole array defined by the integer parameter n = 6 could not be implemented, as the positioning of suitable "spring" shafts requires 6 mm holes and an adequate space could not be available to carry out the drilling.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{magnetic}} coupling between iron layers across nonmagnetic metal interlayers {{has been investigated}} by means of magneto-optic methods. The epitaxial growth and crystalline quality of the layered structures were controlled by RHEED, SPA-LEED and AES techniques. Magnetic properties of ultrathin Fe films from 1. 5 to 16 atomic layers have been studied by Brillouin light scattering (BLS) and magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE). Interlayer coupling in Cr spacer systems has been investigated systematically. On large GaAs substrates two period oscillations in the coupling {{as a function of}} the interlayer thickness have been observed, the thermal stability and temperature dependence of the coupling have been investigated up to 700 K. The oscillation periods and the attenuation of the oscillation amplitudes can be understood with the help of the nesting effect in the Fermi-surface of Cr, on the basis of RKKY type interaction. The origin of biquadratic coupling and absence of phase-slips in the fine oscillations have been interpreted as due to reduced quality of the crystalline structure of the Cr interlayer and the Fe/Cr interfaces. The influence of interface roughness on oscillatory coupling has been studied by adding an Ag layer between the Cr interlayer. The additional Ag layer results in weaker bilinear coupling, but stronger biquadratic exchange due to introducing interface roughness. The two period oscillations of the magnetic coupling across noble <b>metal</b> <b>spacers</b> can be reproduced on the basis of the RKKY type interaction theory. It has been confirmed in the case of the noble metals that the oscillatory periods depend on the extremal distances in the Fermi-surfaces of the interlayer elements. Annealing investigations on the coupling have been performed in the layered structures with different interlayers. Both the structure effect of the interlayer and the interface effect have been observed in Cu-Au alloy systems. Antiferromagnetic coupling in these systems can be largely enhanced after annealing at an appropriate temperature due to improvement of the interlayer crystallinity. In addition, in an Au/Cu superlattice spacer structure an antiferromagnetic coupling has been observed after annealing, which coupled ferromagnetically before the annealing. (orig.)
