5000|$|... ===Masonry drill bits=== The <b>masonry</b> <b>bit</b> {{shown here}} is a {{variation}} of the twist drill bit. The bulk of the tool is a relatively soft steel, and is machined with a mill rather than ground. An insert of tungsten carbide is brazed into the steel to provide the cutting edges.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Masonry</b> <b>bits</b> of {{the style}} shown are {{commonly}} available in diameters from 3mm to 40mm. For larger diameters, core <b>bits</b> are used. <b>Masonry</b> <b>bits</b> up to [...] long {{can be used with}} hand-portable power tools, and are very effective for installing wiring and plumbing in existing buildings.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Masonry</b> <b>bits</b> {{typically}} are {{used with a}} hammer drill, which hammers the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every hammer blow. [...] Hammer drill bits often use special shank shapes such as the SDS type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.|$|R
2500|$|Rotary hammers, {{also called}} [...] "combi drills," [...] {{are similar in}} that they also pound the drill bit in and out while it is spinning. However, they use a piston {{mechanism}} instead of a special clutch. This causes them to deliver a much more powerful hammer blow, {{making it possible to}} drill bigger holes much faster. Rotary hammers have such force, in fact, that the usual <b>masonry</b> <b>bits</b> are no longer adequate. Their smooth shanks would be pounded loose from the tool's chuck in a few seconds. Rotary hammers require special bits which lock into the rotary hammer and continue spinning while smashing away.|$|R

25|$|The diamond <b>masonry</b> mortar <b>bit</b> is {{a hybrid}} drill bit, {{designed}} {{to work as a}} combination router and drill bit. It consists of a steel shell, with the diamonds embedded in metal segments attached to the cutting edge. These drill bits are used at relatively low speeds.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, {{extensive}} {{damage was done}} to the site by tomb raiders. Sparked by rumors of gold, looters have destroyed many tombs. [...] "The looters are looking not only for gold but for ceramics, glassware, lamps, <b>masonry</b> and <b>bits</b> of jewelry, all of which quickly {{find their way into}} the global antiquities trade." ...|$|R
50|$|The hammer {{action is}} {{provided}} by two cam plates that make the chuck rapidly pulse forward and backward as the drill spins on its axis. This pulsing (hammering) action is measured in Blows Per Minute (BPM) with 10,000 or more BPMs being common. Because the combined mass of the chuck and bit is {{comparable to that of}} the body of the drill, the energy transfer is inefficient and can sometimes make it difficult for larger bits to penetrate harder materials such as poured concrete. The operator experiences considerable vibration, and the cams are generally made from hardened steel to avoid them wearing out quickly. In practice, drills are restricted to standard <b>masonry</b> <b>bits</b> up to 13 mm (1/2 inch) in diameter. A typical application for a hammer drill is installing electrical boxes, conduit straps or shelves in concrete.|$|R
2500|$|A {{hammer drill}} has a {{specially}} designed clutch that allows it to not only spin the drill bit, but also to punch it in and out (along the axis of the bit). The actual distance the bit travels in and out and the force of its blow are both very small, and the hammering action is very rapid—thousands of [...] "BPM" [...] (blows per minute) or [...] "IPM" [...] (impacts per minute). Although each blow is of relatively low force, these thousands of blows per minute are more than adequate to break up concrete or brick, using the <b>masonry</b> drill <b>bit's</b> carbide wedge to pulverize it for the spiral flutes to whisk away. For this reason, a hammer drill drills much faster than a regular drill through concrete or brick. Holes in hard materials are needed for anchor bolts, concrete screws and wall plugs.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} {{standard}} sizes of SDS: SDS-plus (or SDSplus or SDS+), SDS-Top and SDS-max. SDS-plus {{is the most}} common by count of tools manufactured, with masonry drills from 4 mm diameter to 30 mm (and from 5/32" [...] to 1-1/4") diameter ordinarily available. The shortest SDS-plus <b>masonry</b> drill <b>bits</b> are about 110 mm overall length, and the longest 1500 mm. SDS-max is more common for larger rotary hammers and chipping guns, and common sizes start at 1/2" [...] diameter up to 1-3/4" [...] diameter. Standard lengths are between 12" [...] - 21". SDS-Top has been largely phased out in North America and is not common except for older tools. Hilti's TE-S system is similar to these SDS systems, but is designed for chipping only (no rotation) in tools for applications larger than could be handled by SDS-Max (e.g. demolition of concrete walls or floors).|$|R
