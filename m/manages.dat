40|$|In {{order to}} assess the effect of {{clinical}} training and didactic instruction on medical student attitudes toward <b>managed</b> care, we conducted a survey of all medical students at the midpoint of their third year clerkships at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The students were exposed to clinical training in <b>managed</b> care settings and a 2 -day required course on the principles underlying <b>managed</b> care. The main outcome measures were student attitudes toward the concepts of <b>managed</b> care, <b>managed</b> care organizations, and future careers in <b>managed</b> care. Students also assessed the attitudes of medical faculty toward <b>managed</b> care. Attitudes of students with previous clinical training in <b>managed</b> care settings {{did not differ from}} those of students without such exposure toward the concepts underlying <b>managed</b> care or <b>managed</b> care organizations and were less positive about careers in <b>managed</b> care. Student responses before and after the 2 -day course on <b>managed</b> care demonstrated that attitudes moved in a significantly positive direction. Seventy-one percent of students reported that the opinions they had heard from medical faculty about <b>managed</b> care were negative. Preparing medical students to practice medicine effectively in <b>managed</b> care settings will require focused attention on <b>managed</b> care issues in the medical school curriculum and the combined efforts of academic health centers and <b>managed</b> care organizations...|$|R

40|$|Using nationally {{representative}} data from 1995 and 2000, {{this study examines}} trends in <b>managed</b> care penetration and activity among outpatient drug treatment organizations in the United States. Further, it investigates how <b>managed</b> care activity varies across different types of treatment providers and for public and private <b>managed</b> care programs. Overall <b>managed</b> care activity has increased, with {{a greater proportion of}} units having <b>managed</b> care arrangements and a larger percentage of clients covered by <b>managed</b> care. In general public <b>managed</b> care activity has increased and private <b>managed</b> care activity has decreased. Treatment providers report that they have fewer <b>managed</b> care arrangements, which may reflect consolidation in the <b>managed</b> behavioral care sector. Finally, growth in <b>managed</b> care among outpatient substance abuse treatment units affiliated with hospitals and mental health centers may signal a preference for providers that can effectively link substance abuse treatment with medical and social service provision, or, alternatively, that linkages with such organizations may provide the size necessary to assume the risks associated with <b>managed</b> care contracts...|$|R
