Ramon Revilla Sr. on the Birthday of his Son, Ramon Joseph, Who Has Been Under Detention for Two Years Now:"Para akong nabagsakan ng mundo ng malaman ko na ang aking anak na si Ramon Joseph ay hindi nabigyan ng piyansa ng hukuman. (I felt like the world fell on me when I was informed that my son Ramon Joseph was not allowed by the court to post bail.)Ako po ay naniniwalang hindi magagawa ng anak ko ang ganiyang bagay na karumaldumal. (I do believe that my son cannot do anything like that.)Ang mga anak ko ay lumaki sa salita ng Panginoon. Isa siyang <b>mabait</b> na anak. (My children {{grew up in the}} word of God. He is a nice son.)HINULI SIYA NG WALANG WARRANT OF ARREST AT HALOS DALAWANG TAON NA SIYANG NAGDURUSA SA KULUNGAN. INOSENTE PO ANG AKING ANAK. (He was arrested without a warrant of arrest and for almost two years he has been suffering in jail. My son is innocent.)TULUNGAN PO NINYO KAMI SA PANALANGIN PARA SA KATARUNGAN NG AKING MGA ANAK NA SINA RAMGEN, RAMONA, AT RAMON JOSEPH. (Help us in prayers for justice for my children Ramgen, Ramona, and Ramon Joseph.)"Former Senator Ramon Revilla Sr.Rancho Bacoor, Cavite, Oct. 17, 2013. Ramon Revilla, Sr.|$|E
