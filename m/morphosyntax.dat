25|$|Romansh is a {{descendant}} of the spoken Latin language of the Roman Empire, which by the 5th century AD replaced the Celtic and Raetic languages previously spoken in the area. Romansh retains {{a small number of}} words from these languages. Romansh has also been strongly influenced by German in vocabulary and <b>morphosyntax.</b> The language gradually retreated to its current area over the centuries, being replaced in other areas by Alemannic and Bavarian dialects. The earliest writing identified as Romansh dates from the 10th or 11th century, although major works did not appear until the 16th century, when several regional written varieties began to develop. During the 19th century the area where the language was spoken declined, but the Romansh speakers had a literary revival and started a language movement dedicated to halting the decline of the language.|$|E
25|$|In <b>morphosyntax,</b> {{the use of}} the {{auxiliary}} verb kho 'to come' as opposed to wird 'will' in phrases such as leg di warm a, sunscht khunscht krank ('put on warm clothes, otherwise you will get sick') in Grisons-German is sometimes attributed to Romansh, as well as the lack of a distinction between the accusative and dative case in some Grisons-German dialects and the word order in phrases such as i tet froge jemand wu waiss ('I would ask someone who knows'). In addition, some words, neuter in most dialects of German, are masculine in Grisons-German. Examples include der Brot 'the bread' or der Gäld 'the money'. Common words of Romansh origin in Grisons-German include Schaffa (derived from Romansh scaffa 'cupboard'), Spus/Spüslig 'bridegroom' and Spus 'bride', Banitsch 'cart used for moving dung', and Pon 'container made of wood'. In areas where Romansh either is still spoken or has disappeared recently, Romansh words are even more common in the local dialects of German.|$|E
2500|$|The Cheyenne verb {{system is}} very complex and verb constructions {{are central to}} the <b>morphosyntax</b> of the language, to the point that even {{adjectives}} and even some nouns are largely substantive in nature. [...] Verbs change according to a number of factors, such as modality, person and transitivity, as well as the animacy of the referent, each of these categories being indicated by the addition of an affix to the basic verb stem. There are also several instrumental, locative and adverbial affixes that add further information to the larger verb construction. [...] This can result in very long, complex verbs that are able to stand alone as entire sentences in their own right.|$|E
50|$|Vafsi is a split ergative {{language}}: Split ergativity {{means that}} a language has in one domain accusative <b>morphosyntax</b> and in another domain ergative <b>morphosyntax.</b> In Vafsi the present tense is structured the accusative way and the past tense is structured the ergative way. Accusative <b>morphosyntax</b> means that in a language subjects of intransitive and transitive verbs are treated {{the same way and}} direct objects are treated another way. Ergative <b>morphosyntax</b> means that in a language subjects of intransitive verbs and direct objects are treated one way and subjects of transitive verbs are treated another way.|$|E

50|$|Minderico {{does not}} show the {{characteristics}} of secret languages anymore: It very soon ceased to be restricted to a particular social group and was used in every context of daily life; its vocabulary is not reduced to special contexts and adapts itself continuously to the new social, economic and technical realities; contrary to secret languages, its <b>morphosyntax</b> is complex and different from Portuguese <b>morphosyntax</b> (Minderico is not a Portuguese dialect!). Minderico is not restricted to the oral informal register {{but it is also}} used in the oral formal and written register.

5000|$|The {{definition}} of a direct-inverse language is a matter under research, but it is widely understood to involve different grammar for transitive predications according to the relative positions of their [...] "subject" [...] and their [...] "object" [...] on a person hierarchy, which, in turn, is some combination of saliency and animacy specific to a given language. The direct construction is the unmarked one. The direct construction is used when {{the subject of the}} transitive clause outranks the object in the person hierarchy, and the inverse is used when the object outranks the subject. The existence of direct-inverse <b>morphosyntax</b> is usually accompanied by proximate-obviative <b>morphosyntax.</b> The direct-inverse dimension subsumes the proximate-obviative dimension. Across languages, obviation almost always involves the third person, but second-person obviation is reported for some Nilo-Saharan languages), and the direct-inverse alternation is usually presented as being a way of marking the proximate-obviative distinction between two (or more) third person arguments of a sentence. However, {{there are at least two}} languages with inverse systems, the Mesoamerican languages Zoque and Huastec, in which inverse <b>morphosyntax</b> is never used when both subject and object are third person, but only when one of these arguments is third person and the other is a speech act participant (SAP), the first or second person [...]|$|E

5000|$|Hagit Borer is a {{professor}} of linguistics at Queen Mary University of London. Her research falls within the area of Generative Grammar. Her theoretical approach shifts the computational load from words to syntactic structure, and pursues the consequences of this shift in <b>morphosyntax,</b> in language acquisition, in the syntax-semantics interface, and in syntactic inter-language variation. She initiated the eXoSkeletal framework in Morphology, which implements this idea.|$|E
5000|$|The intransitive case (abbreviated [...] ), also {{denominated}} passive case or patient {{case is a}} grammatical case used in some languages to {{mark the}} argument of an intransitive verb, but not used with transitive verbs. It is generally seen in languages that display tripartite nominal morphologies; it contrasts with the nominative and absolutive cases employed in other languages' <b>morphosyntax</b> to mark the argument of intransitive clauses.|$|E
50|$|More than 95% of Bislama {{words are}} of English origin; the {{remainder}} combines {{a few dozen}} words from French, {{as well as some}} vocabulary inherited from various languages of Vanuatu, essentially limited to flora and fauna terminology.

50|$|The eXoSkeletal Model in linguistics, or XSM, is a {{generative}} {{framework in}} morphology and <b>morphosyntax,</b> {{introduced in the}} work of Hagit Borer, professor of linguistics at the Queen Mary University of London and previously professor of linguistics at University of Southern California. The main idea of the eXoSkeletal Model is that Lexical items do not have a syntactic category. Rather, they take on whatever syntactic category is imposed on them by their syntactic context.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of these}} {{differences}} both {{with the rest of}} the Basque dialects and also with Standard Basque, and respecting their corresponding uses, the Euskaltzaindia has produced a Model for Written Biscayan (in Basque: Bizkaieraren idatzizko ereduaren finkapenak), a set of rules mainly focused on <b>morphosyntax.</b> The official use of the dialects of Euskera is regulated through Regulation 137 of the Euskaltzaindia, according to which the use of Batua should be limited to the fields of communication, administration and teaching.|$|E
50|$|Early German sources besides Plehn are Seidel (1899), Funke (1920), and Westermann (1922). Important {{linguistic}} {{work was}} done in the 1970s by Kevin Ford in collaboration with Robert Iddah, a speaker of Lolobi, but most of this remains unpublished (Ford & Iddah 1973, 1987).

Some linguistic material can furthermore be found in various publications by Kofi Agawu on Northern Ewe and Akpafu ethnomusicology.|$|E
5000|$|The catena {{concept was}} {{introduced}} to linguistics by William O'Grady in 1998 and has been seized upon by other linguists and applied to the syntax of idiosyncratic meaning of all sorts, such as ellipsis mechanisms (e.g. gapping, stripping, VP-ellipsis, pseudogapping, sluicing, answer ellipsis, comparative deletion), predicate-argument structures, and discontinuities (topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling, extraposition, etc.). The catena concept has also been taken {{as the basis for}} a theory of <b>morphosyntax,</b> i.e. for the extension of dependencies into words; dependencies are acknowledged between the morphs that constitute words.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first two}} {{characteristics}} {{have to do}} with simple <b>morphosyntax,</b> and from them, it is quite obvious the syntactic pivot in English (and most other European languages) is called the subject. An English verb cannot lack a subject (even in the imperative mood, the subject is implied to be [...] "you" [...] and is not ambiguous or unspecified) and cannot have just a direct object and no subject; and (at least in the present tense, and for the verb to be) it agrees partially with the subject.|$|E
