500|$|The song {{begins with}} a short call-and-response audio clip from The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour as Beyoncé asks the crowd [...] "Lemme hear you say 'Hayyy Ms. Carter!'". It then {{transitions}} into what Andrew Hampp of Billboard magazine called the [...] "lady thug anthem" [...] of [...] "Yoncé". Beyoncé delivers half-rapped verses on {{the first half of}} the song, in which the female protagonist teases male subjects in a club as she turns heads. In the first verse, she warns the other women in the club, [...] "Every girl on here gotta look <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> / All on Instagram cake by the pound". The singer adds on the second verse, [...] "I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker." [...] "Yoncé" [...] closes with the bridge as Beyoncé sings repeatedly, [...] "Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor", while an ascending siren echoes over a staccato bass that hits heavily and uniformly in the background.|$|E

Smith said that the two first met during the premiere of the film The Ladies Man. He said, [...] "I'm looking at Will and thinking, 'People really think I look like him? I don't fucking look like that. He looks <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> and says, 'You're very handsome,' and walks away. Totally deadpan. I was like, 'You're funny. You're funny.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was well received by game critics {{and has been}} noted for her sex appeal. Both David Rakoff of The New York Times and Darek Pasturczak of Wirtualna Polska called her [...] "beautiful but deadly." [...] Dreamcast Magazine ranked her as the seventh top [...] "girl on the Dreamcast" [...] in 2000, commenting: [...] "With an oriental flavour to her moves and style, Xianghua {{is a bit of}} a minx even though she looks sweet and innocent." [...] GameSpy's Dave Kosak wrote a better translation of Xianghua's victory one-liner could be [...] "Don't you want to just lick <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> like a popsicle?" [...] and GamesRadar's Shane Petterson described her official artwork for Soulcalibur IV as [...] "screwing you with her eyes." [...] Arcade Sushi's John Llewellyn Martin called Xianghua one of the series' [...] "most beloved characters" [...] and Kotaku's Alex Jaffe listed her among [...] "the world's best fighting characters".|$|E

2500|$|Returning to London in 1946, Lee {{was offered}} his old job back at Beecham's, with a {{significant}} raise, but he turned them down as [...] "I couldn't think myself back into the office frame of mind." [...] The Armed Forces were sending veterans with an education in the Classics to teach at universities, but Lee felt his Latin was too rusty and didn't care for the strict curfews. Having lunch with his cousin Nicolò Carandini, now the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Lee was detailing his war wounds when Carandini said, [...] "Why don't you become an actor, Christopher?" [...] Lee liked the idea and after assuaging his mother's protests by pointing to the successful Carandini performers in Australia, which included his great-grandmother Marie Carandini, {{who had been a}} successful opera singer, he met Nicolò's friend Filippo Del Giudice, a lawyer-turned-film producer. The head of Two Cities Films, part of the Rank Organisation, Giudice, [...] "looked <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down...</b> concluded that I was just what the industry had been looking for". He was sent to see Josef Somlo for a contract, who immediately announced that he was [...] "much too tall to be an actor". Somlo sent him to see Rank's David Henley and Olive Dodds, who signed him on a seven-year contract.|$|E
