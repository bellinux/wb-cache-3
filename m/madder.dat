5|$|All of the trams {{are painted}} white with rose <b>madder</b> and {{platinum}} stripes, a livery mandated by Transport for Edinburgh shared with minor variation by Lothian Buses.|$|E
5|$|Buses for routes 37, 47 and X47 between Edinburgh and Penicuik were branded as Penicuik City Link, {{with blue}} uppers and roofline, and the {{positions}} of the red and <b>madder</b> on the skirting transposed. In 2011, one of these buses was repainted into <b>madder</b> and white, with no roof colour. However, the other vehicles in Penicuik City Link colours were repainted into the new <b>madder</b> and white livery with a turquoise mint coloured roof and the name Pen-Y-Cog. This is to celebrate the history of the area as Pen-Y-Cog is the original name for Penicuik. These buses were de-branded in 2014 due to high fuel consumption of the B7TL's used and the 37/47/X37 is now worked by standards liveries Volvo B9TL's.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011 Lothian Buses {{introduced}} 60 new {{double deck}} buses. These buses continued {{with the same}} <b>madder</b> red and white pattern {{on the outside of}} the bus but Lothian Buses changed the seats to a matching <b>madder</b> red colour. They also changed the entrance to the bus to a more wooden effect. Routes 4, 5, 19, 23 and 27 were the first buses to receive this branding.|$|E

5|$|A third {{example was}} applied to bus 720 on route 3, with the legend 3 Connect. The base colour here is yellow, and was applied {{together}} with a new interpretation of the classic <b>madder</b> and white livery. The 3 Connect branding was replaced by The Lady Victoria branding in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|El Greco painted {{many of his}} {{paintings}} on fine canvas and employed a viscous oil medium. He painted with the usual pigments of his period such as azurite, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, <b>madder</b> lake, ochres and red lead, but he seldom used the expensive natural ultramarine.|$|E

40|$|The spindle {{checkpoint}} prevents anaphase {{from occurring}} until all chromosomes have attached properly to the mitotic spindle. The checkpoint components <b>Mad</b> 1 and <b>Mad</b> 2 associate with unattached kinetochores and are probably involved in triggering the checkpoint. We now demonstrate that in Xenopus egg extracts <b>Mad</b> 1 and <b>Mad</b> 2 form a stable complex, whereas {{a fraction of}} <b>Mad</b> 2 molecules is not bound to <b>Mad</b> 1. The checkpoint establishment and maintenance are lost upon titrating out free <b>Mad</b> 2 with an excess of <b>Mad</b> 1 or a truncated <b>Mad</b> 1 (amino acids 326 – 718, <b>Mad</b> 1 C) that contains the <b>Mad</b> 2 -binding region. <b>Mad</b> 1 N (amino acids 1 – 445) that binds kinetochores, but not <b>Mad</b> 2, reduces <b>Mad</b> 1 and <b>Mad</b> 2 at kinetochores and abolishes checkpoint maintenance. Furthermore, the association between <b>Mad</b> 2 and Cdc 20, the activator for the anaphasepromoting complex, is enhanced under checkpoint-active condition compared with that at metaphase. Immunodepletion analysis shows that the <b>Mad</b> 1 -free <b>Mad</b> 2 protein is unable to bind Cdc 20, consistent with the model that kinetochore localization of <b>Mad</b> 2 facilitates the formation of <b>Mad</b> 2 –Cdc 20 complex. This study demonstrates that the ratio between <b>Mad</b> 1 and <b>Mad</b> 2 is critical for maintaining a pool of <b>Mad</b> 1 -free <b>Mad</b> 2 that {{is necessary for the}} spindle checkpoint. We propose that <b>Mad</b> 2 may become activated and dissociated from <b>Mad</b> 1 at kinetochores and is replenished by the pool of <b>Mad</b> 1 -free <b>Mad</b> 2...|$|R

5|$|Route 31 was Ace of Spades – {{cutting across}} the city and Midlothian with orange uppers and roofline, and a black spade symbol, which was worn by buses 751–768. However, these buses have been repainted into <b>madder</b> and white with no route branding.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the modern, {{sweeping}} version of the <b>madder</b> and white livery was recognisable enough {{to be used with}} different colours; when East Lothian Buses (later Lothian Country Buses) was set up, their fleet used a version in green and beige (the colours of Scottish Midland Buses, which had once run similar routes before being absorbed by First).|$|E
5|$|Ayers Rock {{were formed}} in the Australian pop-music scene of the early 1970s, which {{included}} artists {{in a number of}} genres: mainstream pop (Zoot and Liv Maessen), blues rock (Chain), heavy rock (Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs), and boogie (Carson). Bands such as Blackfeather and <b>Madder</b> Lake combined mainstream and progressive rock. Most pop and rock listeners had never heard jazz fusion; when Ayers Rock incorporated the music into their sets, it was rarely performed by fellow Australian artists.|$|E

5|$|Route {{branding}} {{has been}} increasingly used by Lothian since {{the introduction of}} low floor vehicles. Route branding highlights the route of certain services making the buses easier to be spotted throughout Lothian. Since May 2010 the Harlequin livery used to identify low floor buses has started to be phased out, as the company is now a full low floor operation, with {{a return to the}} traditional <b>madder</b> and white livery although the style has been altered slightly to suit the lines of modern buses. Each type of bus owned directly by Lothian Buses has had at least one of their type painted in the new livery.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{took up the}} {{practical}} art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He {{spent much of his}} time at Staffordshire dye works mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, such as the red derived from <b>madder,</b> which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines. Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{complete}} control of the Firm, Morris took an increased interest {{in the process of}} textile dyeing and entered into a co-operative agreement with Thomas Wardle, a silk dyer who operated the Hencroft Works in Leek, Staffordshire. As a result, Morris would spend time with Wardle at his home on various occasions between summer 1875 and spring 1878. Deeming the colours to be of inferior quality, Morris rejected the chemical aniline dyes which were then predominant, instead emphasising the revival of organic dyes, such as indigo for blue, walnut shells and roots for brown, and cochineal, kermes, and <b>madder</b> for red. Living and working in this industrial environment, he gained a personal understanding of production and the lives of the proletariat, and was disgusted by the poor living conditions of workers and the pollution caused by industry; these factors greatly influenced his political views. After learning the skills of dyeing, in the late 1870s Morris turned his attention to weaving, experimenting with silk weaving at Queen's Square.|$|E

5|$|Turahan {{also took}} several {{measures}} {{to restore order}} and prosperity in his province, most notably the foundation (or re-foundation) {{of the town of}} Tyrnavos, which before was a small pastoral settlement. To attract and protect the local Greek Orthodox population, he granted it special privileges, such as special administrative status as a waqf (a religious endowment) of the Sharif of Mecca, tax exemptions and the prohibition of Ottoman troops from passing through the town. He also endowed it with both a mosque (destroyed after the Greek annexation of Thessaly in 1881) and a church, St Nicholas Turahan, which survives to this day. Turahan also endowed many other public buildings such as mosques, monasteries, madrasas, schools, caravanserais, bridges and baths across the province. He also took care to maintain and foster the Thessalian cotton, silk and wool textile industry, to the extent that later generations attributed to him the introduction of new dye techniques based on yellow berries, <b>madder</b> and the kali plant, used in the manufacture of potash. From there these materials spread to the rest of Rumelia and thence to Western Europe.|$|E
