There were points I thought, 'You know what, I don't {{know if this is}} going to happen'. But with the help from my friends and my family, they all kept telling <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in myself and keep on doing it and I did and now I'm here and thank you so much to them.|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, {{during the}} week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its {{ambassador}} for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had {{played a part in}} {{the amount of time that}} it had taken to write and record the album. [...] "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." [...] Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. [...] "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that it won't come out in 2016".|$|E

2500|$|Others come to {{different}} conclusions. In 2006, veteran black project watcher and aviation writer Bill Sweetman said, [...] "Does Aurora exist?

2500|$|He has {{explained}} that he feels the evidence all over the planet clearly shows evolution {{to be the best}} way to explain the diversity of life, and that [...] "as far as [...] concerned, if there is a supreme being then he chose organic evolution as a way of bringing into existence the natural world". In a BBC Four interview with Mark Lawson, he was asked if he at any time had any religious faith. He replied simply, [...] "No." [...] He has also said [...] "It never really occurred to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in God".|$|E
2500|$|It was claimed at {{the time}} by Mr. J. E. Burke, the {{governing}} director of John Burke, Limited shipping company that the Dorrigo [...] "was exceedingly sea worthy and we were perfectly satisfied, with her. I cannot understand how the vessel foundered, more particularly as last week {{she was in the}} cyclone that dealt severely with the Cooma, and she entered port only a few hours late. She was a speedy vessel, and invariably did the trip from Brisbane to Sydney in 41 or 42 hours. These facts, combined with the knowledge that she was on her second voyage since her last overhaul, leads <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that something very remarkable lies contributed to her destruction." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael {{stated that}} his early fantasies were about women, which [...] "led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> I {{was on the}} path to heterosexuality", but at puberty he started to fantasise about men, which he later said [...] "had {{something}} to do with my environment". At the age of 19, Michael told Andrew Ridgeley and close friends that he was bisexual. Michael also told one of his two sisters, but he was advised by friends not to tell his parents about his sexuality. In a 1999 interview with The Advocate, Michael told the Editor in Chief, Judy Wieder, that it was [...] "falling in love with a man that ended his conflict over bisexuality".|$|E
2500|$|By 1846 Bourget {{found that}} many of his plans for {{expansion}} and renovation of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada were being frustrated by Archbishop Signay, who disliked Bourget and was distrustful of Bourget's changes. [...] On September 25, 1846, Bourget wrote to Signay and said, “For a long time I have been thinking that Your Grace should give up the administration of your archdiocese, contenting yourself with retaining the title of metropolitan. I shall use the occasion of my journey to Rome to put before the Holy See the reasons leading <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that it might be time for you to relieve yourself of this burden." [...] With this in mind, Bourget travelled to Rome in late 1846 to petition the Pope for Signay's resignation. [...] He was supported in this cause by Charles-Félix Cazeau, secretary to Archbishop Signay.|$|E
2500|$|After {{performing}} another set, Riot Control, at Hull's Gondola Club, {{the premises}} was raided by police and closed soon after; most local clubs blamed COUM and unofficially banned them. COUM {{drew up a}} petition to gain support for the group, attaining a booking at the local Brickhouse; their first performance in which the audience applauded and called for an encore. The petition had contained their phallic logo, and the police charged P-Orridge and Nobb with publishing an obscene advert, although the charges were later dropped. As they gained coverage in the music press, interest in the band grew, and they supported Hawkwind at St. George's Hall in Bradford in October 1971, where they performed a piece called Edna and the Great Surfers, where they led the crowd in shouting [...] "Off, Off, Off". The following month, the band attracted the interest of music journalist John Peel, who publicly remarked that [...] "ome might say that Coum were madmen but constant exposure to mankind forces <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that we need more madmen like them." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was noted}} that Mayor Koch held steadfast in {{his support of}} Ward. [...] Although Koch said he was [...] "shocked" [...] by the {{videotape}} of the police response, {{as he had done}} in the past he refused to utter a negative word about Ward. [...] "The day I think that a commissioner, including a police commissioner, isn't as good as he should be to run whatever he's running, that's the day I will ask him to submit his resignation," [...] said Koch. [...] "I think Ben Ward will go down {{as one of the greatest}} police commissioners this city has ever had. Bob McGuire is the other, and I appointed both of them." [...] However, Koch's support eroded as evidence mounted that municipal disorganization and a lack of police leadership that night likely sparked the riots. [...] "The film that I saw causes <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that there may have been an overreaction. I was not happy with what I saw on film. [...] Those films were disturbing to me, and I think they disturbed Ben Ward as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Less impressed, Rolling Stone {{continued}} to regard Harrison in an unfavourable light after what Elliot Huntley terms its [...] "volte-face" [...] in 1974. The magazine's reviewer, Ken Tucker, noted {{the accessibility of}} [...] "fast, cheerful numbers" [...] such as [...] "Woman Don't You Cry for Me" [...] and [...] "This Song" [...] but lamented both [...] "George's persistent preaching" [...] elsewhere and that Scott's presence rendered the album as [...] "music with the feeling and sincerity of cellophane". NME critic Bob Woffinden admired Harrison's guitar playing but dismissed him as a lyric writer, before concluding: [...] "Harrison's general demeanour is more encouraging... While it is an album of no particular merit in itself, it is one which leads <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that his best work {{may not necessarily be}} behind him." [...] Four years later, however, Woffinden offered a more positive assessment, writing that [...] "His spiritual convictions no longer seemed to be cramping his style, but affording him a generous and open heart. An excellent production and frequently inspired guitar work were amongst the other positive qualities which the album could boast." ...|$|E
2500|$|Israeli Defense Force spokesmen {{initially}} {{reported that}} the building had collapsed several hours after Israeli bombing. According to the IAF Chief of Staff, Brigadier-General Amir Eshel, the building was attacked a little after midnight. He also alleged {{that he did not}} know when the building collapsed, but [...] "according to foreign press reports, and this is one of the reports we are relying on, the house collapsed at 8 A.M. We do not have testimony regarding the time of the collapse. If the house collapsed at 12 A.M., it is difficult for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that they waited eight hours to evacuate it." [...] In addition, it was reported that senior IAF officers had said that the collapse could have been caused by an unexploded missile or by a Hezbollah-planted explosive device. The IDF's excuses were immediately denounced by Qana's residents and witnesses of the strike, who said the Israeli shelling was responsible for the collapse. An elderly man who survived the strike said a Hezbollah device could not be the cause of the explosion, since Israeli destruction of local infrastructure made it impossible that weaponries be moved towards the building.|$|E

2500|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, {{defensive}} back Tyrone Williams, a blocker on Green Bay's punt return team ran into returner Eric Metcalf. As a result, Metcalf muffed the kick and Atlanta fullback George Layne recovered the ball on Green Bay's 21-yard line. Packers coach Mike Sherman did not challenge the call, a mistake considering replays showed the punted ball bouncing off a Falcons player's left shoulder. Sherman said he spoke with an official on the field, [...] "but he [...] led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{it would not be}} reviewable." [...] Four plays after the turnover, T. J. Duckett's 6-yard touchdown run increased Atlanta's lead to 21–0. Green Bay responded by driving to a first and goal situation on the Atlanta 1-yard line, but over the next three plays, Favre threw two incomplete passes and Ahman Green was tackled by Smith and defensive end Johndale Carty for a 1-yard loss. On fourth down and 2, Green was dropped for a 4-yard loss by nose tackle Ellis Johnson. Then Vick led the Falcons 90 yards in 16 plays, one of them a 21-yard run by Dunn, to go up 24-0 on Jay Feely's 22-yard field goal on the last play of the half.|$|E

But the record will be done this summer". Recording of the album was completed in June 2016 once the recording for the song [...] "Hardwired" [...] was finished.|$|E
2500|$|Webb {{was found}} dead in his Carmichael home on December 10, 2004, with two gunshot wounds to the head. His death was ruled a suicide by the Sacramento County coroner's office. After a local paper {{reported}} that he had died from multiple gunshots, the coroner's office received so many calls asking about Webb's death that Sacramento County Coroner Robert Lyons issued a statement confirming Webb had committed suicide. When asked by local reporters about the possibility of two gunshots being a suicide, Lyons replied: [...] "It's unusual in a suicide case to have two shots, but it has been done in the past, and it is in fact a distinct possibility." [...] News coverage noted that there were widespread rumors on the Internet at the time that Webb had been killed as retribution for his 'Dark Alliance' series, published eight years before, but Webb's ex-wife Susan Bell told reporters that she believed Webb had committed suicide. [...] "The way he was acting {{it would be hard for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it was anything but suicide," [...] she said. According to Bell, Webb had been unhappy for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper. He had sold his house the week before his death because he was unable to afford the mortgage.|$|E
