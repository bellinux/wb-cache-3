25|$|Nicaraguan {{music is}} a mixture of {{indigenous}} and European, especially Spanish, influences. Musical instruments include the marimba and others common across Central America.

The marimba is made with hardwood plates, placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four hammers.

The pair had England on the back foot as their victory target neared closer and closer, edging virtually everything.

25|$|Overall, Jean-Jacques Furer {{concludes that}} the {{shrinkage}} of the Romansh-speaking areas is continuing, though at different rates depending on the region. At the same time, he notes that Romansh is still very <b>much</b> <b>alive,</b> a fact that is obvious in those areas where it retains a strong presence, such as {{most parts of the}} Surselva and the Lower Engadine. It is also assured that Romansh will continue to be transmitted for several more generations, even though each succeeding generation will be more and more rooted in German as well as Romansh. As a result, if the overall linguistic situation does not change, speakers will slowly become fewer and fewer with each generation. He also concludes however, that there are still enough speakers to ensure that Romansh will survive in the long term at least in certain regions. He considers the Romansh-language school system to be the single most crucial factor in this.|$|E
