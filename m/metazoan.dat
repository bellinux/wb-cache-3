40|$|The {{origin of}} neurons {{was a key}} event in evolution, {{allowing}} <b>metazoans</b> to evolve rapid behavioral responses to environmental cues. Reconstructing the origin of synaptic proteins promises to reveal their ancestral functions and might {{shed light on the}} evolution of the first neuron-like cells in <b>metazoans.</b> By analyzing the genomes of diverse <b>metazoans</b> and their closest relatives, the evolutionary history of diverse presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins has been reconstructed. These analyses revealed that choanoflagellates, the closest relatives of <b>metazoans,</b> possess diverse synaptic protein homologs. Recent studies have now begun to investigate their ancestral functions. A primordial neurosecretory apparatus in choanoflagellates was identified and {{it was found that the}} mechanism, by which presynaptic proteins required for secretion of neurotransmitters interact, is conserved in choanoflagellates and <b>metazoans.</b> Moreover, studies on the postsynaptic protein homolog Homer revealed unexpected localization patterns in choanoflagellates and new binding partners, both which are conserved in <b>metazoans.</b> These findings demonstrate that the study of choanoflagellates can uncover ancient and previously undescribed functions of synaptic proteins...|$|R

Nicole King has done work {{looking at the}} genome of Monisiga brevicollis, and has found key protein domains that are shared between <b>metazoans</b> and choanoflagellates. These domains play a role in cell signalling and adhesion processes in <b>metazoans.</b> The finding that choanoflagellates also have these genes is an incredible discovery because it was previously thought that only <b>metazoans</b> had genes responsible for cell-cell communication and aggregation. This suggests that these domains {{play a key role in}} the origins of multicellularity since it ties a unicellular organism (choanoflagellates) to multicellular organisms (<b>metazoans).</b> It shows that the components required for multicellularity were present in the common ancestor between <b>metazoans</b> and choanoflagellates.|$|R

5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of <b>metazoan</b> tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E

5|$|The {{diseases}} and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods {{are known to}} be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and <b>metazoan</b> parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genusAggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate immune system, and the haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes {{play an important role in}} the recognition and elimination of foreign bodies and wound repair. Captive animals have been found to be more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones. A gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio lentus, has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of octopuses in extreme cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified <b>metazoan</b> (animal) life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important {{to our understanding of the}} early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the <b>metazoan</b> taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins totalizing ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Extracellular {{digestion}} is {{a frequent}} mode of dissolution of dispersed organic detritus in marine sediments. Two geometric modes of deploying this digestive attack are extracorporeal: prokaryotic unicells, and intracorporeal: <b>metazoans</b> with flow-through guts. Enclosed digestive geometry gives <b>metazoans</b> greater ability both to retain digestive agents and to obtain digestive products, allowing them to create digestive conditions more intense than are generally found with communities of sedimentary bacteria. <b>Metazoans</b> hence can dissolve food substrate more quickly. Extracellular hydrolytic enzymes are sorptive for bacteria and dissolved for animals, enhancing both speed and net digestive gain for their respective geometries. Experiments showed little evidence for mass loss of digestive agents to sediments transiting deposit feeders. Standing stocks of sedimentary bacteria-ubiquitously {{on the order of}} 10 ° bacteria (cc pore water) - '-set a cap on digestive rates by bacterial inoculations of sediment, and provide <b>metazoans</b> a further kinetic advantage at food concentrations greater than the bacterial biomass. <b>Metazoans</b> therefore have digestive advantage on substrates amenable to concentrated, quick dissolution, suited to their role as high wattage consumers of sedimentary food.

In this study, we describe an aggregative multicellular stage in the protist Capsaspora owczarzaki, a close unicellular relative of <b>metazoans.</b> Remarkably, transition to the aggregative stage is associated with significant upregulation of orthologs of genes known to establish multicellularity and tissue architecture in <b>metazoans.</b> We further observe transitions in regulated alternative splicing during the C. owczarzaki life cycle, including the deployment of an exon network associated with signaling, a feature of splicing regulation so far only observed in <b>metazoans.</b> Our results reveal the existence of a highly regulated aggregative stage in C. owczarzaki and further suggest that features of aggregative behavior in an ancestral protist may had been co-opted to develop some multicellular properties currently seen in <b>metazoans.</b> © Sebé-Pedrós et al.
