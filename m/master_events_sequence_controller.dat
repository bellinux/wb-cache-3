40|$|Abstract—GUI {{testing is}} an active {{research}} area. The open challenge is the judicious generation of <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> (an <b>event</b> <b>sequence</b> encodes a user interaction). A major advance in this direction {{is the use of}} a black-box model to systematically generate <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> that are executable on the GUI. The black-box model can be, e. g., an Event Flow Graph (EFG) or an <b>Event</b> <b>Sequence</b> Graph (ESG). In this paper we propose a new approach to select relevant <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> among the <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> generated by a black-box model. We express the relevance of an <b>event</b> <b>sequence</b> by a precisely defined dependency between a fixed number of events in the <b>event</b> <b>sequence.</b> Departing from a pure black-box approach we apply a static analysis to the bytecode of the application. This allows us to infer a dependency graph, which we call Event Dependency Graph (EDG). We use the EDG together with a black-box model to construct a set of relevant <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> among the executable ones. We have implemented our approach in a new tool. We evaluate the approach on four open source GUI applications. With the specific choice of a lightweight static analysis, the approach scales to large applications and, at the same time, leads to an informed selection of <b>event</b> <b>sequences.</b> Using our approach we are able to find previously undetected bugs...|$|R

When the controller receives the trigger signal for starting, the time sequential control circuit module, consisting of the microcontroller and the FPGA, it can generate a delay trigging signal according to the preset delay value, which will activate the testing device after being driven. The delay value is import by the computer or the dial on the panel.

40|$|Seismic {{monitoring}} of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty using waveform cross correlation requires a uniform coverage of the globe with <b>master</b> <b>events</b> well recorded at array stations of the International Monitoring System. The essence of cross correlation as a monitoring tool consists in a continuous comparison of digital waveforms at a given station with waveform templates from the global set of <b>master</b> <b>events.</b> At array stations, cross correlation demonstrates a higher resolution because the time delays at individual sensors from <b>master</b> and slave <b>events</b> are the same but they may differ from theoretical ones used in standard beamforming. In the regions where <b>master</b> <b>events</b> and thus waveform templates are available, one can reduce the amplitude threshold of signal detection {{by a factor of}} 2 to 3 relative to standard beamforming and STA/LTA detector used at the International Data Centre. The gain in sensitivity corresponds to a body wave magnitude reduction by 0. 3 to 0. 4 units and doubles the number of detected events. This gain is crucial for seismic monitoring under the CTBT. The coverage by real <b>master</b> <b>events</b> is sparse and confined to areas with historical seismicity, however. In two parts of this study, we investigate the possibility to populate the global grid with real and synthetic <b>master</b> <b>events.</b> In Part I, we replicate a high-quality <b>master</b> <b>event</b> over a regular grid several hundred kilometers from its actual position. In Part II, we model waveform templates using synthetic seismograms with the aim to apply them in aseismic zones. Both approaches are tested using the aftershock sequence of the April 11, 2012 Sumatera earthquake (Ms(IDC) = 8. 2). We used sixteen <b>master</b> <b>events</b> to recover the aftershocks in the Reviewed Event Bulletin of the IDC. Comment: 39 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the local}} {{seismicity}} in the Ruhr Basin can be separated into characteristic clusters of similar, mining induced earthquakes. Each cluster can be represented by a strong <b>master</b> <b>event.</b> Therefore, {{it is possible to}} associate weak events to the corresponding clusters by <b>master</b> <b>event</b> comparison. The seismic signal matching is performed by a nonlinear correlation termed DWM for the entire seismogram length. DWM permits stretchings and shortenings between the two signals and overcomes the ambiguities in phase correlation by a consistent matching path. The automatic cluster association searches for the best DWM-correlation between the actual <b>event</b> and all <b>master</b> <b>events</b> of the appropriate epicenter region. Knowing the P- and S-onsets of the <b>master</b> <b>event,</b> they can be transposed to the actual event by the correlation path with one sample accuracy. The method has been applied to all BUG small array recordings 1987 – 1990 of local events from the Hamm-region to investigate spatial and temporal clustering. Within the clusters, a high percentage of weak events could be located relative to its <b>master</b> <b>event.</b> The temporal clustering resolved seismic activities that typically last a few months per cluster, but single aftershocks occur in the following years...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Recent developments in switching theory have not been adequately exploited for industrial control applications. Consequently, the design of most industrial control systems is carried out on an intuitive basis. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop systematic techniques for the logical design of <b>sequence</b> <b>controllers,</b> which control the repetitive occurrences of a number of machine operations taking place in a definite order. Machine operations, for this study, were broadly divided into two classes, namely, pulse mode operations involving switching on or off of various control elements, and level mode operations for which the control output is maintained to hold the controlled position of the control element (like a spring return actuator). The design of a <b>sequence</b> <b>controller</b> for a large number of actuators has been simplified by an approach in which the controller is realised by a number of subsystems. Two standard circuits, namely, a standard actuator control circuit and an actuator control module have been developed -for level mode operations; the realisation of the controller using these circuits is straightforward and does not require an expertise in switching circuit theory. Two different circuit modules, a 'combinational module' and a 'sequential module', have been developed for cascade realisation of <b>sequence</b> <b>controllers</b> for pulse mode operations. A generalised model of programmable <b>sequence</b> <b>controllers</b> (PSC's), which are suitable for industries requiring frequent changes in the sequence of operations, has been proposed. The basic tape realisation of the PSC, in which the controller reads information from a tape and executes the corresponding operation, has been extended to control a larger number of operations. A systematic study has been carried out for an asynchronous sequential circuit realisation of a PSC using read-only memories (ROIiP s). A considerable reduction in the memory capacity of the ROM has been achieved by generating the present state variables by a counter. Control systems were constructed for the experimental verifications of some of the theoretical results; the machine operations for testing the systems were simulated by electronic circuits. The study provides a general basis to systematise the design of <b>sequence</b> <b>controllers</b> for industrial automation...|$|R

40|$|Automated {{software}} testing aims to detect errors by produc-ing test inputs that cover {{as much of}} the application source code as possible. Applications for mobile devices are typ-ically event-driven, which raises the challenge of automat-ically producing <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> that result in high cover-age. Some existing approaches use random or model-based testing that largely treats the application as a black box.

40|$|Life {{can often}} be {{described}} as a series of events. These events contain rich information that, when put together, can reveal history, expose facts, or lead to discoveries. Therefore, many leading organizations are increasingly collecting databases of <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> : Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), transportation incident logs, student progress reports, web logs, sports logs, etc. Heavy investments were made in data collection and storage, but difficulties still arise {{when it comes to making}} use of the collected data. Analyzing millions of <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> is a non-trivial task that is gaining more attention and requires better support due to its complex nature. Therefore, I aimed to use information visualization techniques to support exploratory data analysis [...] -an approach to analyzing data to formulate hypotheses worth testing [...] -for <b>event</b> <b>sequences.</b> By working with the domain experts who were analyzing <b>event</b> <b>sequences,</b> I identified two important scenarios that guided my dissertation: First, I explored how to provide an overview of multiple <b>event</b> <b>sequences?</b> Lengthy reports often have an executive summary to provide an overview of the report. Unfortunately, there was no executive summary to provide an overview for <b>event</b> <b>sequences.</b> Therefore, I designed LifeFlow, a compact overview visualization that summarizes multiple <b>event</b> <b>sequences,</b> and interaction techniques that supports users' exploration. Second, I examined how to support users in querying for <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> when they are uncertain about what they are looking for. To support this task, I developed similarity measures (the M&M measure 1 - 2) and user interfaces (Similan 1 - 2) for querying <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> based on similarity, allowing users to search for <b>event</b> <b>sequences</b> that are similar to the query. After that, I ran a controlled experiment comparing exact match and similarity search interfaces, and learned the advantages and disadvantages of both interfaces. These lessons learned inspired me to develop Flexible Temporal Search (FTS) that combines the benefits of both interfaces. FTS gives confident and countable results, and also ranks results by similarity. I continued to work with domain experts as partners, getting them involved in the iterative design, and constantly using their feedback to guide my research directions. As the research progressed, several short-term user studies were conducted to evaluate particular features of the user interfaces. Both quantitative and qualitative results were reported. To address the limitations of short-term evaluations, I included several multi-dimensional in-depth long-term case studies with domain experts in various fields to evaluate deeper benefits, validate generalizability of the ideas, and demonstrate practicability of this research in non-laboratory environments. The experience from these long-term studies was combined into a set of design guidelines for temporal <b>event</b> <b>sequence</b> exploration. My contributions from this research are LifeFlow, a visualization that compactly displays summaries of multiple <b>event</b> <b>sequences,</b> along with interaction techniques for users' explorations; similarity measures (the M&M measure 1 - 2) and similarity search interfaces (Similan 1 - 2) for querying event sequences; Flexible Temporal Search (FTS), a hybrid query approach that combines the benefits of exact match and similarity search; and case study evaluations that results in a process model and a set of design guidelines for temporal <b>event</b> <b>sequence</b> exploration.
