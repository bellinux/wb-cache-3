50|$|Storage is {{implemented}} using <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> with a <b>storage</b> width of 72 bits, which comprise 64 data bits (8 bytes, or one doubleword) plus 8 parity bits. The IBM 2365 model 1 contains 131,072 (128 K) bytes of memory; all other models contain 262,144 (256 K) bytes. The model 2 could {{be converted in}} the field to a model 13.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 2361 Large Capacity Storage was a {{component}} of the IBM System/360 models 50, 65 (when not being used as a multiprocessor), and 75 computers. Storage was implemented using <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores,</b> the cycle time was 8 microseconds and the access time was 3.6 microseconds. This component was also called IBM 2361 <b>Core</b> <b>Storage,</b> IBM 2361 Large <b>Core</b> <b>Storage,</b> and LCS.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 738 <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Storage</b> used on 709 {{was also}} a {{milestone}} of hybrid technology. Although the core array drivers are all vacuum tube, the read sense amplifiers were a very early use of transistors in computing.|$|E
5000|$|Controls are {{included}} in the 704 for: one 711 Punched Card Reader, one 716 Alphabetic Printer, one 721 Punched Card Recorder, five 727 Magnetic Tape Units and one 753 Tape Control Unit, one 733 Magnetic Drum Reader and Recorder, and one 737 <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Storage</b> Unit.|$|E
50|$|All users utilize a 2,000 word 24,000 digit, <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> <b>storage</b> unit. Each of {{the planes}} {{is divided into two}} {{sections}} of 50 by 40 cores, making 2,000 cores in each section. Each section contains one core - for one binary position (bit) - of every one of the 2,000 words. The same relative binary position of the other half-word is held in a core in the same physical location in the other section of the plane. Thus each plane contains two binary positions in each of 2,000 words; the first and 43rd, for example, or the 9th and 52nd. Physically the memory is a rectangular prism 7.25 * 10 * 12.75 in.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system has}} a CPU cycle time of 500 nanoseconds, 25% {{faster than the}} Model 40 and 40% slower than the Model 65. Processor <b>storage</b> is <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> memory that {{transfers}} four bytes per 2 microsecond cycle. It has [...] "protected" [...] and [...] "local" [...] <b>core</b> <b>storage</b> for registers and internal buffers with cycle times of 200 and 500 nanoseconds respectively.|$|R

50|$|Fourteen 702s were built. The {{first one}} was used at IBM. Due to {{problems}} with the Williams tubes, {{the decision was made}} to switch to <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> memory instead.

50|$|The S/360-67 {{operated}} {{with a basic}} internal {{cycle time}} of 200 nanoseconds and a basic 750 nanosecond <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> <b>storage</b> cycle, {{the same as the}} S/360-65. The 200 ns cycle time put the S/360-67 {{in the middle of the}} S/360 line, between the Model 30 at the low end and the Model 195 at the high end. From 1 to 8 bytes (8 data bits and 1 parity bit per byte) could be read or written to processor storage in a single cycle. A 60-bit parallel adder facilitated handling of long fractions in floating-point operations. An 8-bit serial adder enabled simultaneous execution of floating point exponent arithmetic, and also handled decimal arithmetic and variable field length (VFL) instructions.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{function}} generation is discussed {{based on the}} use of hybrid digital analogue techniques. A brief description of a quantizer is given together with some experimental results. The purpose of this unit is to give the derivative with respect to time (in quantized form) of a variable. Units of this type used in conjunction with pulse modulators, which are also described, are shown to be capable of performing a wide variety of analytic functions. The application to correlation functions, using <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> <b>storage</b> for time delays, is also discussed. Another application is a fast analogue/digital converter with an incremental bit resolution time of one micro-second.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to understand the characteristics of <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> in order to design the RF system of the JHF proton synchrotrons. We have developed a measurement system using the GP-IB for a test cavity to measure {{the characteristics of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores.</b> This system also enables us to control the most of measurement devices and to take measured results by a PC. 1 INTRODUCTION In the design of the RF system of the JHF (Japan Hadron Facility) proton synchrotrons, {{it is very important to}} find a <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> to which satisfies the required condition of the JHF accelerators[1]. Ferrite cores are usually used for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> of the proton synchrotron, however there are some problems. Generally, some ferrite cores have non-linear characteristics which depend on the RF magnetic field. And, there is a size-dependence of the characteristics. Thus, it is required to measure the characteristics of large size <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores.</b> To measure characteristics of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores,</b> we have de [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Consequently, only a {{few studies}} {{addressed}} transformers with liquid <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores.</b> The liquid <b>magnetic</b> <b>core,</b> ferro-nanofluid, with its distinguishing features of low electric conductivity and super-paramagnetism {{is regarded as a}} solution to the core losses of eddy current and hysteresis. In this study, a ferro-nanofluid was applied as a liquid <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> in a transformer. The performance of the transformer with the ferro-nanofluids was measured, simulated, and compared with that of a transformer with an air core.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The novel soft {{magnetic}} materials and <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> structure used in planar transformer have been studied. The frequency, electrical and structure feature of the planar transformer with matrix structure was described. Then the novel {{magnetic materials}} used in the planar transformer were discussed, which were very different from ferrite block. The silicon steel strip was first represented, the magnetic characteristic of which was related to its geometric dimension, working frequency and the component. The microcrystallite alloy and amorphous alloy magnetic materials were then indicated, including iron-base nanocrystal and cobalt-base amorphous alloy. The magnetic materials of the above amorphous alloy and microcrystallite alloy were compared respectively. These {{soft magnetic materials}} {{could be used as}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> in planar transformer, and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> could be composed of thin strip and line. The structure of <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> was flexible, which could benefit the planar transformer to reduce its volume.
