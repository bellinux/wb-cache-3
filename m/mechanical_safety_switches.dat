50|$|The {{launcher}} {{is normally}} {{operated by a}} crew of two, a loader and a gunner. The launcher is loaded by attaching a rocket container {{to the rear of}} the launcher. When the container is attached, the electrical firing circuit is connected. The rocket container is 626 millimetres long and weighs approximately 3.2 kilograms. On the left side of the launcher is the 3× APX M 309 optical sight, which is graduated between 100 and 1,000 metres. The launcher has a shoulder rest and forward pistol grip, both of which may be adjusted to suit the firer. The forward pistol grip contains a <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> and the firing mechanism. When the safety is off, pulling the trigger generates a charge which fires the rocket.The watertight rear plug of the rocket container is removed just before firing, which closes the firing circuit and allows the rocket to be fired. The rocket is propelled by a large number of long sticks of tubular propellant that produce a constant pressure while burning, providing constant acceleration. The engine burns out before the rocket leaves the launcher at a velocity of approximately 300 metres per second. As soon as the rocket leaves the launcher, nine fins fold backwards from the rear. These fins provide stability for the rocket while it is in flight. There are two safeties. The first is a bore-riding pin located mid-body of the projectile that blocks the warhead firing circuit. After the projectile leaves the tube, the bore-riding pin falls out releasing the second safety which prevents detonation until the rocket has traveled at least 10 metres from the launcher. The rocket reaches a range of 330 metres in about 1.25 seconds, and 360 metres in 1.36 seconds.|$|R

40|$|DE 102008063976 A 1 UPAB: 20100712 NOVELTY - The switch (100) has {{a housing}} (101) fixed {{in a vacuum}} chamber such that {{pressure}} within the chamber acts on a compensator pipe (104) and on a flexible membrane. A form or position of the pipe and membrane is changeable in dependence of the pressure. A contactless-detection is made whether deformation or position change of the pipe and the membrane reaches a desired value, using a commercial <b>safety</b> magnet <b>switch</b> (107). The magnet switch actuates a switching contact or produces a signal when the deformation or position change of the pipe and the membrane reaches the value. USE - Pressure <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> for a vacuum chamber that is utilized for coating substrates.

40|$|Abstract – With {{the active}} {{development}} of {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV), the application of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) has been expanded. As wide driving region of IPMSM for electric vehicle (EV) traction motor is required, many studies are conducted to improve characteristics of a motor in both low and high-speed driving regions. A motor in high-speed driving region generates (produces) large stress to the rotor. Thus, the rotor needs to be designed considering the <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety.</b> Therefore, in this paper, we conducted stress analysis and electromagnetic analysis to determine the centerpost’s distance which is considered important during the design of IPMSM for EV traction motor {{in order to secure}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> and satisfy specifications of output requirement...|$|R

40|$|Summary We do {{not know}} why trees exhibit changes in wood {{characteristics}} as a function of cambial age. In part, the answer may lie in the existence of a tradeoff between hydraulic properties and mechanical support. In conifers, longitudinal tracheids represent 92 % of the cells comprising the wood and are involved in both water transport and mechanical support. We used three hydraulic parameters to estimate hydraulic safety factors at several vertical and radial locations in the trunk and branches: vulnerability to cavitation; variation in xy-lem water potential (Ψ); and xylem relative water content. The hydraulic safety factors for 12 and 88 percent loss of conduc-tivity (SH 12 and SH 88, representing the hydraulic safety factors for the air entry point and full embolism point, respectively) were determined. We also estimated the <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> fac-tor for maximum tree height and for buckling. We estimated the dimensionless hydraulic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> factors for six seedlings (4 years old), six saplings (10 years old) and six mature trees (> 110 years old) of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Over the natural range of Ψ, SH 12 decreased linearly from treetop to a minimum of 0. 95 at the tree base. Young and ma-ture trees had SH 12 values 1. 4 and 1. 3 times higher, respec-tively, at their tips (juvenile wood) than at their bases (mature wood). Modeling analyses indicated that if trees were made en-tirely of mature wood, SH 12 at the stem base would be only 0. 7. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> factor was 1. 2 times higher for the base of the tree than {{for the rest of the}} tree. The minimum me-chanical safety factor— 1. 6 for the critical buckling height and 2. 2 for the critical buckling load—occurred at the base of the live crown. Modeling analysis indicated that if trees were made only of mature wood, these values would increase to 1. 7 and 2. 3, respectively. Hydraulic safety factors had values that were less than half those for <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety</b> factors, suggesting that wood structure in Douglas-fir has evolved primarily as a result of se-lection for hydraulic <b>safety</b> rather than <b>mechanical</b> <b>safety.</b> The results suggest that forest managers must consider the role of juvenile wood in tree physiology to avoid producing planta-tions vulnerable to drought...|$|R
