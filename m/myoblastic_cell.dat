To investigate the mechanism underlying this process, we examined whether recombinant bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) converts the differentiation pathway of the clonal <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cell</b> line, C 2 C 12, into that of osteoblast lineage. Incubating the cells with 300 ng/ml of BMP- 2 for 6 d almost completely inhibited the formation of the multinucleated myotubes expressing troponin T and myosin heavy chain, and induced the appearance of numerous alkaline phosphatase (ALP) -positive cells.

40|$|The Rho {{family of}} small GTPases are {{signalling}} molecules involved in cytoskeleton remodelling and gene transcription. Their activities {{are important for}} many cellular processes, including myogenesis. In particular, RhoA positively regulates skeletal-muscle differentiation. We report {{in the present study}} that the active form of RhoA increases the expression of utrophin, the autosomal homologue of dystrophin in the mouse C 2 C 12 and rat L 8 <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Even though this RhoA-dependent utrophin increase is higher in proliferating myoblasts, it is maintained during myogenic differentiation. This occurs via two mechanisms: (i) transcriptional activation of the utrophin promoter A and (ii) post-translational stabilization of utrophin. In addition, RhoA increases plasma-membrane localization of utrophin. Thus RhoA activation up-regulates utrophin levels and enhances its localization at the plasma membrane...|$|E

40|$|Desminopathies, a {{subgroup}} of myofibrillar myopathies (MFMs), the progressive muscular diseases {{characterized by the}} accumulation of granulofilamentous desmin-positive aggregates, result from mutations in the desmin gene (DES), encoding a muscle-specific intermediate filament. Desminopathies often lead to severe disability and premature death from cardiac and/or respiratory failure; no specific treatment is currently available. To identify drug-targetable pathophysiological pathways, we performed pharmacological studies in C 2 C 12 <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cells</b> expressing mutant DES.

In this report we investigated the immunohistochemical reactivities of myogenin and MyoD in two canine bladder botryoid rhabdomyosarcomas that were different {{in the degree of}} differentiation. MyoD was stained in the Ki- 67 antigen–positive undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, which had proliferative activity similar to myoblasts differentiated from mesoblasts. In contrast, multi-nucleated neoplastic cells were positive for myogenin and -sarcomeric actin but not for Ki- 67 antigen, similar to the myotubes differentiated from <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cells.</b> The expressions of myogenin and MyoD were closely correlated to the histologic features of myogenic neoplastic cells.

40|$|We {{examined}} the expression and intracellular localization of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP 2) during the differentiation of skeletal muscle cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. In isolated single myofibers, VAMP 2 was expressed in quiescent satellite cells, downregulated in proliferating myoblastic cells, and re-expressed with differentiation. In the <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cell</b> line C 2 C 12, VAMP 2 was expressed {{at a low}} level in the proliferating stage, and then increased after differentiation into myotubes. Based on these results, we propose that VAMP 2 {{can be used as}} a molecular marker for both quiescent satellite cells and myotubes, but not for proliferating myoblasts. We also found the partial colocalization of VAMP 2 with transferrin- or Rab 11 -labeled vesicles in myotubes, suggesting a role of VAMP 2 in the trafficking of recycling endosomes...|$|E

A dose of 50 μg of Tf venom (crude venom, and three kinds of the phospholipase A 2 isozymes of Tf venom; [Asp 49]PLA 2, BPI and BPII) produced a large area of necrosis in QFM. Myonecrosis was evident 30 minutes after the injection, and over the following 72 hours the necrotic muscles remained acellular and devoid of inflammatory reaction except at the very edge where liquefaction necrosis associated with inflammatory infiltrate was marked from the beginning. Blood vessels {{in and around the}} necrotic foci were often involved in inflammatory changes and thrombosis, to some degree. However, marked hemorrhage was never noted.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the role of}} interleukin (IL) 17 in multilineage commitment of C 2 C 12 <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cells</b> and investigated associated signaling pathways. The results concerning the effects on cell function showed that IL- 17 inhibits the migration of C 2 C 12 cells, while not affecting their proliferation. The data regarding the influence on differentiation demonstrated that IL- 17 inhibits myogenic differentiation of C 2 C 12 cells by down-regulating the myogenin mRNA level, myosin heavy chain expression and myotube formation, but promotes their osteogenic differentiation by up-regulating the Runt-related transcription factor 2 mRNA level, cyclooxygenase- 2 expression and alkaline phosphatase activity. IL- 17 exerted these effects by activating ERK 1, 2 mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway, which in turn regulated the expression of relevant genes and proteins to inhibit myogenic differentiation and induce osteogenic differentiation. Additional analysis showed that the induction of osteogenic differentiation by IL- 17 is independent of BMP signaling. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of IL- 17 not only to inhibit the myogenic differentiation of C 2 C 12 myoblasts but also to convert their differentiation pathway into that of osteoblast lineage providing new insight into the capacities of IL- 17 to modulate the differentiation commitment...|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} suggested that, in muscular dystrophies, {{the excessive}} accumulation of adenosine {{as a result}} of an altered purine metabolism may contribute to progressive functional deterioration and muscle cell death. To verify this hypothesis, we have taken advantage of C 2 C 12 <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cells,</b> which can be differentiated in vitro into multinucleated cells (myotubes). Exposure of both proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes to adenosine or its metabolically-stable analog, 2 -chloro-adenosine, resulted in apoptotic cell death and myotube disruption. Cytotoxicity by either nucleoside did not depend upon extracellular adenosine receptors, but, at least in part, by entry into cells via the membrane nitro-benzyl-thio-inosine-sensitive transporter. The adenosine kinase inhibitor, 5 -iodotubercidin, prevented 2 -chloro-adenosine-induced (but not adenosine-induced) effects, suggesting that an intracellular phosphorylation/activation reaction plays a key role in 2 -chloro-adenosine-mediated cytotoxicity. Conversely, adenosine cytotoxicity was aggravated by the addition of homocysteine, suggesting that adenosine effects may be due to the accumulation of S-adenosyl-homocysteine, which blocks intracellular methylation-dependent reactions. Both nucleosides markedly disrupted the myotube structure via an effect on the actin cytoskeleton; however, also for myotubes, there were marked differences in the morphological alterations induced by these two nucleosides. These results show that adenosine and 2 -chloro-adenosine induce apoptosis of myogenic cells via completely different metabolic pathways, and are consistent with the hypothesis that adenosine accumulation in dystrophic muscles may represent a novel pathogenetic pathway in muscle diseases...|$|R

The current challenge is to find factors capable of limiting muscle degeneration and/or potentiating the inherent regenerative program mediated by a specific type of <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cells,</b> the satellite cells. Recent studies from our groups and others have shown that the bioactive lipid, sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P), promotes myoblast differentiation and exerts a trophic action on denervated skeletal muscle fibres. In the present study, we examined the effects of S 1 P on eccentric contraction (EC) -injured extensor digitorum longus muscle fibres and resident satellite cells. After EC, skeletal muscle showed evidence of structural and biochemical damage along with significant electrophysiological changes, i. e. reduced plasma membrane resistance and resting membrane potential and altered Na and Ca 2 current amplitude and kinetics. Treatment with exogenous S 1 P attenuated the EC-induced tissue damage, protecting skeletal muscle fibre from apoptosis, preserving satellite cell viability and affecting extracellular matrix remodelling, through the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9) expression. S 1 P also promoted satellite cell renewal and differentiation in the damaged muscle. Notably, EC was associated with the activation of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK 1) and with increased endogenous S 1 P synthesis, further stressing the relevance of S 1 P in skeletal muscle protection and repair/regeneration. In line with this, the treatment with a selective SphK 1 inhibitor during EC, caused an exacerbation of the muscle damage and attenuated MMP- 9 expression.

Twelve and 24 weeks after implantation, the volume of calcium-deficient HA granules was significantly {{less than that of}} stoichiometric HA granules, and the biodegradability of calcium-deficient HA granules was confirmed. The larger number of osteoclasts, larger osteoblast surface and larger bone volume in the implanted area of calcium-deficient HA than those of stoichiometric HA suggested that osteoclastic resorption of calcium-deficient HA affected osteogenesis in that area. To analyze the direct contribution of osteoclasts to osteogenesis, C 2 C 12 multipotent <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cells,</b> which have the potential to differentiate into osteoblasts in the presence of bone morphogenetic protein 2, were cultured with supernatants of osteoclasts cultured on calcium-deficient HA, stoichiometric HA, beta-tricalcium phosphate disks or plastic dishes, or bone marrow macrophages cultured on plastic dishes. Supernatants of osteoclasts but not bone marrow macrophages stimulated the expression of Runx 2 and osteocalcin in C 2 C 12 cells in concert with bone morphogenetic protein 2. The expression of alkaline phosphatase was stimulated with supernatants of osteoclasts cultured on ceramic disks.

In proliferating cultures of both cell types preloaded with [3 H]taurine, exposure to 27 % hypotonicity activated a 10 - to 20 -fold increase in [3 H]taurine efflux (Jtau). This effect was blocked by the C 1 - channel inhibitors NPPB and flufenamic acid. Thrombin and the thrombin receptor agonist SFLLRN also activated Jtau that was abolished by NPPB and flufenamic acid. Together, hypotonicity and thrombin synergistically activated Jtau. In differentiated myocytes, the effect of thrombin was abolished, while that of hypotonicity was significantly reduced.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We have used microarray, quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR), Western blot, and bioinformatics tools to study the effects of TNF-a on various molecular pathways and gene networks in C 2 C 12 cells (a mouse <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cell</b> line). Microarray analyses of C 2 C 12 myotubes treated with TNF-a (10 ng/ml) for 18 h showed differential expression of a number of genes involved in distinct molecular pathways.

The expression of some of the genes in microarray dataset showed good correlation in independent QRT-PCR and Western blot assays.

In the parental cells, which fuse efficiently to multinucleated myotubes, merosin expression is upregulated {{as a function of}} differentiation while laminin expression is downregulated. Cells from fusion-deficient clones do not express either protein, but laminin or merosin added to the culture medium induced their fusion. Clonal variants which fuse, but form unstable myotubes, express laminin but not merosin. Exogenous merosin converted these myotubes to a stable phenotype, while laminin had no effect. Myotube instability was corrected most efficiently by transfection of the merosin-deficient cells with the merosin alpha 2 chain cDNA. Finally, merosin appears to promote myotube stability by preventing apoptosis. Hence, these studies identify novel biological functions for merosin in myoblast fusion and muscle cell survival; furthermore, these explain some of the pathogenic events observed in congenital muscular dystrophy caused by merosin deficiency and provide in vitro models to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of this disease...|$|E

Although satellite cells have long been established as the providers of <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cells,</b> very little is really known (apart from their anatomical location in relation to muscle fibres and their ability to migrate) about the precise role of satellite cells in myogenesis. Numerous techniques for labelling mpc have been devised, but none of these has proven to be completely reliable in firmly establishing the origin of myogenic cells. The use of tritiated thymidine to label DNA in proliferating mpc (which are not specifically distinguishable at the time) and the subsequent location of their labelled progeny in myotube nuclei has revealed a great deal of data on the timing of myogenesis, but not about the nature of mpc themselves. DNA synthesis can also be detected by antibodies to the thymidine analogue, bromodeoxyuridine, and also by antibody staining for proliferating nuclear cell antigen. Like tritiated thymidine, these other markers are not specific for muscle but are general markers for DNA synthesis.

Methods were developed for incorporation of an azido fatty acid analogue of myristic acid (12 -azidododecanoic acid - 12 ADA) onto C 2 C 12 myoblast proteins. Detection and analysis were carried out utilizing copper-catalyzed click chemistry. 12 ADA labeled C 2 C 12 lysates were reacted with fluorescent probes and analyzed via SDS-PAGE, allowing identification of proteins labeled via myristoylation relative to the entire proteome of C 2 C 12 lysate.

Layer-by-layer (LbL) is a promising and versatile technique to modify biomaterials' surfaces, and has allowed tailoring interactions with cells. In this study, LbL is used to construct biomimetic stimuli-responsive coatings using elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs). The recombinant nature of ELRs provides the ability to introduce specific bioactive sequences and to tune their physicochemical properties, making them attractive for biomedical and biological applications. By using complementary clickable ELRs, we were able to construct multilayer coatings stabilized by covalent bonds, resulting from the Huisgen 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of azides and alkynes.

While induction of collagen type I and alkaline phosphatase (AP) expression coincided with Cbfa 1 expression, Cbfa 1 mRNA was strikingly downregulated at the onset of expression of osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) genes, reflecting the mature osteoblast phenotype. TGF-beta 1 treatment effectively suppressed myogenesis and induced Cbfa 1 expression but was insufficient to support osteoblast differentiation reflected by the absence of ALP, OPN, and OCN. We addressed whether induction of Cbfa 1 in response to BMP- 2 results in the transcriptional activation of the OC promoter which contains three enhancer Cbfa 1 elements. Transfection studies show BMP- 2 suppresses OC promoter activity in C 2 C 12, but not in osteoblastic ROS 17 / 2. 8 cells. Maximal suppression of OC promoter activity in response to BMP- 2 requires sequences in the proximal promoter (up to nt - 365) and may occur independent of the three Cbfa sites. Taken together, our results demonstrate a dissociation of Cbfa 1 expression from development of the osteoblast phenotype. Our findings suggest that Cbfal may function transiently to divert a committed myoblast to a potentially osteogenic cell. However, other factors induced by BMP- 2 appear to be necessary for complete expression of the osteoblast phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{detection}} of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, {{is important to}} understand the underlying mechanism of cell development. At present, apoptosis detection resorts to fluorescence or colorimetric assays, which may affect cell behavior and thus not allow long-term monitoring of intact cells. In this work, we present an image analysis method to detect apoptosis in time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy, which is nondestructive imaging. The method first detects candidates for apoptotic cells based on the optical principle of phase-contrast microscopy in connection with the properties of apoptotic cells. The temporal behavior of each candidate is then examined in its neighboring frames in order to determine if the candidate is indeed an apoptotic cell. When applied to three C 2 C 12 <b>myoblastic</b> stem <b>cell</b> populations, which contain more than 1000 apoptosis, the method achieved around 90 % accuracy in terms of average precision and recall...|$|R
40|$|Tenascin-C is an adhesion-modulating matrix {{glycoprotein}} {{that has}} multiple effects on cell behavior. Tenascin-C transcripts {{are expressed in}} motile cells and at sites of tissue modeling during development, and alternative splicing generates variants that encode different numbers of fibronectin type III repeats. We have examined the in vivo expression and cell adhesive properties of two full-length recombinant tenascin-C proteins: TN- 190, which contains the eight constant fibronectin type III repeats, and TN-ADC, which contains the additional AD 2, AD 1, and C repeats. In situ hybridization with probes specific for the AD 2, AD 1, and C repeats shows that these splice variants are expressed at sites of active tissue modeling and fibronectin expression in the developing avian feather bud and sternum. Transcripts incorporating the AD 2, AD 1, and C repeats are present in embryonic day 10 wing bud but not in embryonic day 10 lung. By using a panel of nine cell lines in attachment assays, {{we have found that}} C 2 C 12, G 8, and S 27 <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cells</b> undergo concentration-dependent adhesion to both variants, organize actin microspikes that contain the actin-bundling protein fascin, and do not assemble focal contacts. On a molar basis, TN-ADC is more active than TN- 190 in promoting cell attachment and irregular cell spreading. The addition of either TN- 190 or TN-ADC in solution to C 2 C 12, COS- 7, or MG- 63 cells adherent on fibronectin decreases cell attachment and results in decreased organization of actin microfilament bundles, with formation of cortical membrane ruffles and retention of residual points of substratum contact that contain filamentous actin and fascin. These data establish a biochemical similarity in the processes of cell adhesion to tenascin-C and thrombospondin- 1, also an “antiadhesive” matrix component, and also demonstrate that both the adhesive and adhesion-modulating properties of tenascin-C involve similar biochemical events in the cortical cytoskeleton. In addition to these generic properties, TN-ADC is less active in adhesion modulation than TN- 190. The coordinated expression of different tenascin-C transcripts during development may, therefore, provide appropriate microenvironments for regulated changes in cell shape, adhesion, and movement...|$|R
40|$|The lesions {{caused by}} {{sublethal}} doses of Trimeresurus flavoviridis (Tf) venom {{injected into the}} anterior thigh muscle (quadriceps femoris muscle; QFM) of rats were studied using paraffin sections. A dose of 50 f*g of Tf venom produced a large area of necrosis in the QFM together with the neighboring muscles. Phagocytosis of necrotic remnants was followed by marked regeneration of muscle fibers. Myonecrosis was microscopically evident 30 minutes after injection, and over the following 72 hours the necrotic muscles remained acellular and were devoid of inflammatory reaction, except at the very edge where liquefaction necrosis associated with inflammatory infiltrate was marked from the beginning. Blood vessels {{within and outside the}} necrotic foci were occasionally involved in collapse and/or in inflammatory changes with thrombosis, to some degree. However, marked hemorrhage was never noted in and around the foci. Phagocytosis of debris proceeded from the periphery, and after 24 hours the muscle was replaced by granulation tissue containing many regenerating <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cells.</b> Abscesses developed {{in the vicinity of the}} injection site in several rats receiving Tf venom but never after injection of its phospholipase A 2 isozymes, PLA 2, BPI, or BPII. Muscle necrosis after envenomation of Tf venom seems to be due primarily to direct action of the venom, although vascular thrombosis and ischemia may also contribute. Interestingly, in rats, myonecrotic Tf venom itself may cause marked and extensive activation of muscle fiber regeneration. The venom seems to be a strong myotoxin but not a hemorrhagenic toxin. Tf serum proteins were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation to six portions depending on its degree of saturability, 0 - 20 %, 20 - 30 %, 30 - 40 %, 40 - 50 %, and 50 - 70 %. The effects of these proteins on Tf venom-induced rat skeletal muscle damage were investigated with closer attention to histopathological features of impairment, necrosis, and regeneration of muscle fibers. The results indicated that the rats injected with Tf crude venom together with the serum protein fraction of ammonium sulfate saturation 40 - 50 % showed necrotic changes were smallest of all in the rats treated together with the other serum protein fractions. The knowledge that Tf serum proteins are effective in preventing local lesions caused by Tf venom should shed light on effective medical treatment following Tf snake bites...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} examine the early events in {{osteoblast}} differentiation, three different model systems for osteoblast differentiation were compared: mouse pre-osteoblastic cell line MC 3 T 3; mouse <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cell</b> line C 2 C 12 and primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts. Quantitative RT-PCR conditions were set for analysis of 8 markers of the osteoblast differentiation process: alkaline phosphatase, Msx 2, Cbfa 1, parathyroide hormone receptor, osteocalcin, osteopontin, osteonectin and collagen I α 1. Expression of these genes was analyzed in all three systems upon treatment with oesteogenic supplement, at days 1 and 3, by comparison with a non-stimulated time-matched control. In addition, classical cytochemical tests for following the osteoblast differentiation process, ALP and mineralization staining, were used. MC 3 T 3 cells were shown {{to be the best}} model for examining osteoblast differentiation on the cytochemical, {{as well as on the}} transcriptional level, with most marker genes upregulated. Then, Affymetrix GeneCHIP analysis was used to probe the changes induced by differentiation stimuli in MC 3 T 3 cells. These cells were stimulated for 1 and 3 days with an osteogenic stimulus containing BMP- 2. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed with Affymetrix GeneCHIP oligonucleotide arrays. A regulated expression of 394 known genes and 295 ESTs was tedected. The sensitivity and realiability of detection by microarrays was shown by confirming the expression pattern for 20 genes by radioactive quantitative RT-PCR. Extensive functional classification of regulated genes was performed. The most interesting finding was concomitant activation of TGF-β, Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, confirmed by strong upregulation of their target genes by PCR. The TGF-β pathway is activated by stimulated production of the growth factor itself, while the exact mechanism of Wnt and Notch activation remains elusive. We showed BMP- 2 stimulated expression of Hey 1, a direct Notch target gene, in mouse MC 3 T 3 and C 2 C 12 cells, in human mesenchymal cells and in mouse calvaria. Small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of Hey 1 induction led to an increase in osteoblast matrix mineralization, suggesting that Hey 1 is a negative regulator of osteoblast maturation. This negative regulation is apparently achieved via interaction with Runx 2, as Hey 1 completely abrogated Runx 2 transcriptional activity. These findings identify the Notch-Hey 1 pathway as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation / maturation, which is a completely novel aspect of osteogenesis and could point to possible new targets for bone anabolic agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{implantation}} of {{bone morphogenetic protein}} (BMP) into muscular tissues induces ectopic {{bone formation}} {{at the site of}} implantation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this process, we examined whether recombinant bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) converts the differentiation pathway of the clonal <b>myoblastic</b> <b>cell</b> line, C 2 C 12, into that of osteoblast lineage. Incubating the cells with 300 ng/ml of BMP- 2 for 6 d almost completely inhibited the formation of the multinucleated myotubes expressing troponin T and myosin heavy chain, and induced the appearance of numerous alkaline phosphatase (ALP) - positive cells. BMP- 2 dose dependently induced ALP activity, parathyroid hormone (PTH) -dependent 3 ', 5 '-cAMP production, and osteocalcin production at concentrations above 100 ng/ml. The concentration of BMP- 2 required to induce these osteoblastic phenotypes was the same as that required to almost completely inhibit myotube formation. Incubating primary muscle cells with 300 ng/ml of BMP- 2 for 6 d also inhibited myotube formation, whereas induced ALP activity and osteocalcin production. Incubation with 300 ng/ml of BMP- 2 suppressed the expression of mRNA for muscle creatine kinase within 6 h, whereas it induced mRNA expression for ALP, PTH/PTH-related protein (PTHrP) receptors, and osteocalcin within 24 - 48 h. BMP- 2 completely inhibited the expression of myogenin mRNA by day 3. By day 3, BMP- 2 also inhibited the expression of MyoD mRNA, but it was transiently stimulated 12 h after exposure to BMP- 2. Expression of Id- 1 mRNA was greatly stimulated by BMP- 2. When C 2 C 12 cells pretreated with BMP- 2 for 6 d were transferred to a colony assay system in the absence of BMP- 2, more than 84 % of the colonies generated became troponin T-positive and ALP activity disappeared. TGF-beta 1 also inhibited myotube formation in C 2 C 12 cells, and suppressed the expression of myogenin and MyoD mRNAs without inducing that of Id- 1 mRNA. However, no osteoblastic phenotype was induced by TGF-beta 1 in C 2 C 12 cells. TGF-beta 1 potentiated the inhibitory effect of BMP- 2 on myotube formation, whereas TGF-beta 1 reduced ALP activity and osteocalcin production induced by BMP- 2 in C 2 C 12 cells. These results indicate that BMP- 2 specifically converts the differentiation pathway of C 2 C 12 myoblasts into that of osteoblast lineage cells, but that the conversion is not heritable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{enormous}} potential and impact that stem cells may have on regenerative medicine, {{there has been a}} rapidly growing interest for tools to analyze and characterize the behaviors of these cells in vitro in an automated and high throughput fashion. Among these behaviors, mitosis, or cell division, is important since stem cells proliferate and renew themselves through mitosis. However, current automated systems for measuring cell proliferation often require destructive or sacrificial methods of cell manipulation such as cell lysis or in vitro staining. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for automated mitosis detection using phase-contrast time-lapse microscopy, which is a nondestructive imaging modality, thereby allowing continuous monitoring of cells in culture. In our approach, we present a probabilistic model for event detection, which can simultaneously 1) identify spatio-temporal patch sequences that contain a mitotic event and 2) localize a birth event, defined as the time and location at which cell division is completed and two daughter cells are born. Our approach significantly outperforms previous approaches in terms of both detection accuracy and computational efficiency, when applied to multipotent C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 mesenchymal and C 2 C 12 <b>myoblastic</b> stem <b>cell</b> populations.

40|$|During {{muscle tissue}} differentiation, in {{particular}} {{in the formation of}} myotubes from the myoblasts, plasma membrane changes its morpho-functional characteristics. In this study, muscle cell membrane behaviour has been studied along the differentiation of C 2 C 12, a mouse <b>myoblastic</b> adherent <b>cell</b> line. Flat undifferentiated cells, cultured for 3 - 4 days in the differentiation medium, progressively become thick, long and multinucleated myotubes covered with microvilli. They lose stress fibers and adhesion to the underlying substrate evidentiating an actin redistribution, followed by the spatial organization of thick and thin myofilaments. Sarcomeres and myofibrils occasionally appear, even if a certain percentage of "myosacs" containing randomly oriented filaments can be identified all along the differentiation. M-cadherin, a molecule involved in cell-cell adhesion, also appears in the early differentiation stage, during myoblast fusion. Occasional focal contractions can also be observed in myotubes, which prompt an electrophysiological membrane analysis. When studied by means of patch clamp technique, resting membrane potential appears to undergo a transient depolarization, while input resistance increases until day 5 after differentiation induction, then successively decreases. Capacitance declines until day 5, later appearing enhanced. Moreover, with the induction of differentiation, the pattern of functional voltage-dependent ion channels changes. Therefore, during myogenesis, cell maturation is coupled with changes in cell membrane morphological features and functional characteristics...|$|R

Continuous cell culture (in vitro) systems have several technical advantages over in vivo systems and became widely used tools for discovering physiological/ pathophysiological mechanisms in muscle. In particular, myoblast cell lines are suitable model systems to study complex biochemical adaptations occurring in skeletal muscle and cellular responses to altered genetic/ environmental conditions. Whereas most in vitro studies use extensively characterized murine C 2 C 12 cells, a comprehensive description of an equivalent human cell line, not genetically manipulated for immortalization, is lacking. Therefore, we characterized human immortal <b>myoblastic</b> RCMH <b>cells</b> using scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and proteomics. Among more than 6200 identified proteins we confirm the known expression of proteins important for muscle function. Comparing the RCMH proteome with two well-defined nonskeletal muscle cells lines (HeLa, U 2 OS) revealed a considerable enrichment of proteins important for muscle function. SEM/TEM confirmed the presence of agglomerates of cytoskeletal components/intermediate filaments and a prominent rough ER. In conclusion, our results indicate RMCH as a suitable in vitro model for investigating muscle function-related processes such as mechanical stress burden and mechanotransduction, EC coupling, cytoskeleton, muscle cell metabolism and development, and (ER-associated) myopathic disorders.

40|$|Abstract Background Osteoblasts are {{considered}} to primarily arise from osseous progenitors within the periosteum or bone marrow. We have speculated that cells from local soft tissues may also take on an osteogenic phenotype. Myoblasts are known to adopt a bone gene program upon treatment with the osteogenic bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP- 2,- 4,- 6,- 7,- 9), but their osteogenic capacity relative to other progenitor types is unclear. We further hypothesized that the sensitivity of cells to BMP- 2 would correlate with BMP receptor expression. Methods We directly compared the BMP- 2 sensitivity of <b>myoblastic</b> murine <b>cell</b> lines and primary cells with osteoprogenitors from osseous tissues and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts forced to undergo myogenic conversion by transduction with a MyoD-expressing lentiviral vector (LV-MyoD) were also examined. Outcome measures included alkaline phosphatase expression, matrix mineralization, and expression of osteogenic genes (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and bone morphogenetic protein receptor- 1 A) as measured by quantitative PCR. Results BMP- 2 induced a rapid and robust osteogenic response in myoblasts and osteoprogenitors, but not in fibroblasts. Myoblasts and osteoprogenitors grown in osteogenic media rapidly upregulated Bmpr- 1 a expression. Chronic BMP- 2 treatment resulted in peak Bmpr- 1 a expression at day 6 before declining, suggestive of a negative feedback mechanism. In contrast, fibroblasts expressed low levels of Bmpr- 1 a that was only weakly up-regulated by BMP- 2 treatment. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed the presence of myogenic responsive elements in the proximal promoter region of human and murine BMPR- 1 A/Bmpr- 1 a. Forced myogenic gene expression in fibroblasts {{was associated with a}} significant increase in Bmpr- 1 a expression and a synergistic increase in the osteogenic response to BMP- 2. Conclusion These data demonstrate the osteogenic sensitivity of muscle progenitors and provide a mechanistic insight into the variable response of different cell lineages to BMP- 2. </p...|$|R
