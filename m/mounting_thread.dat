50|$|The Centa Vision was {{the only}} 2× {{horizontal}} stretch anamorphic adapter with an Iscorama style form-factor that ISCO ever produced, and closely resembled the Iscorama 42 visually. ISCO-manufactured Centa Visions were always multicoated. Confusingly, ISCO also marketed a batch of re-branded Kowa Prominar 16-H lenses under the Centavision name. These were manufactured by Kowa in Japan, and were optically identical to the other versions of this lens (Kowa 8Z, Kowa for Bell & Howell, Elmoscope II), but differed physically in three respects: the ISCO version included a front filter thread (72mm), had a standard diameter rear <b>mounting</b> <b>thread</b> (49mm), and featured a dual unit metric/imperial focus scale. The Kowa-manufactured version of the Centavision utilised a standard anamorphic focus mechanism, rather than ISCO's patented system.|$|E
50|$|The metal-bodied Iscorama 54 was {{the next}} {{anamorphic}} adapter to be released by ISCO, and was the largest of all Iscoramas. Although it was a totally different physical design to the original Iscorama and the Iscorama 36/Cinegon, the optical and mechanical configuration was very similar, with all three lenses sharing an identical focus and anamorphic alignment mechanism. Because of its large rear anamorphic element, and wide diameter <b>mounting</b> <b>thread</b> (77mm), the 54 can be attached to a much wider range of taking lenses than other Iscoramas without vignetting occurring (although a 35mm focal length {{seems to be the}} limit on APS-C cameras). One of the downsides of the Iscorama 54’s larger dimensions is the 95mm front filter thread, which has negative ramifications for the cost of filters and close-up lenses. Fortunately, it is possible to fix smaller (67mm and larger) filters within the recessed front opening of the lens without causing excessive vignetting.|$|E

As an authorized tube trailer inspection organization {{by the government of}} China, China Special Equipment Inspection and Research Institute has carried out periodical inspection of tube trailers in China since 2004. A statistical analysis was done based on 4059 periodical inspection reports of tube trailers from 2004 to 2013, which include 3687 tube trailers and 31627 cylinders.

40|$|The current {{method of}} molding teeth, {{especially}} primary teeth, cannot accurately reproduce internal tooth structures. Therefore, {{there is a}} need for primary teeth to be made anatomically accurate on-demand with the ability to customize a model for specific patients. This project aims that any tooth extracted digitally from a Dental Cone Beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan of a child 2 ̆ 7 s mouth can be 3 D printed into an accurate replicate with which dental students can practice. Constraints include viable materials that can be printed by a 3 D printer, represent tooth anatomy and provide desirable mechanical properties compatible with the dental drilling operation. A free software (ITK-SNAP) was utilized to translate the CBCT scanned DICOM file into a format usable by a 3 D modeling program. The target tooth was separated from its surrounding gingival and bone tissues, and a smoothing algorithm was applied to the tooth profile. The 3 D model was then printed on a high resolution inkjet 3 D printer (Objet Eden 260 VS) with UV curable materials. The 3 D printed primary teeth successfully reflected the internal tooth structures, e. g. pulp chamber and root canal, which enable dental students to perform tooth preparation similar to that on a real tooth. In addition, the team also designed a <b>mounting</b> <b>thread</b> on the 3 D tooth model to assemble on a typodont. This process will have significant impacts on the dental eduaiton. Dental schools can now provide their own tooth models on-demand, much quicker, and anatomically more accurate than current standards for just a fraction of its cost. [URL]...|$|E

50|$|Historically, The Royal Photographic Society {{recommended}} the thread standard for attaching older cameras to tripods was 3/16-24 BSW (3/16 inch nominal diameter, 24 threads per inch), or 1/4-20 BSW for smaller cameras and 3/8-16 BSW for larger cameras and pan/tilt heads. In this application, the BSW and UNC thread profiles are similar enough {{that one can}} mount a modern camera on a legacy tripod and vice versa.

It was first used in Zeiss' Contax S of 1949; this East German branch of Zeiss also sold cameras under the Pentacon name; after merger with other East German photographic manufacturers, the name Praktica was used. M42 <b>thread</b> <b>mount</b> cameras first became well known under the Praktica brand, and thus the M42 mount is known as the Praktica <b>thread</b> <b>mount.</b> Since there were no proprietary elements to the M42 mount, many other manufacturers used it; this has led to it being called the Universal <b>thread</b> <b>mount</b> or Universal screw mount by many.
