40|$|Indian nuclear establishments having {{multiple}} facilities generate substantial {{quantities of}} radioactive solid-waste per year. Bulk of this waste comprises of assorted waste and filters. Indian waste management program employs compaction and incineration {{as the two}} major techniques for their volume reduction. Incineration gives a very good volume reduction factor of around 50. However incineration systems are complex, capital oriented, and high <b>man-Rem</b> consuming due to requirements of ash fixation facility, elaborate off-gas treatment facility, high temperature safeguards and appreciable energy consumption. Only a limited spectrum of waste is amenable to incineration due to various limitations. In comparison, compaction gives a moderate volume reduction of around 5. However these systems are simple, economical, operating at ambient temperatures and consuming nominal <b>man-Rem</b> expenditure. Compaction is a technique of void volume reduction under application of external force. Higher the applied force, higher is the effectiveness of compaction in terms of better volume reduction factor and lower spring-back. First generation compaction system...|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} consequences and {{the probability of}} conceivable accidents occurring during the high level waste preparation (HLWP) phase of the Commercial Nuclear Waste Vitrification Project (CNWVP) were analyzed. The maximum {{environmental consequences}} of postulated accidents were calculated to result in low radiation doses: a 50 -year dose commitment of 0. 3 rem to the whole body for a maximum individual, and of 20 <b>man-rem</b> to the whole body for the surrounding population. This may be compared to Department of Energy (DOE) values, in Manual Chapter Appendix 0524, of 0. 5 -rem whole-body annual dose commitment to individuals at points of maximum probable exposure in uncontrolled areas. The calculated whole-body relative dose risk to individuals from accidents is low (1. 6 x 10 {sup - 6 } rem/yr) as compared to that received from natural background radiation (approximately 1. 5 x 10 {sup - 1 } rem/yr) and as compared to levels specified in Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements for routine releases from nuclear power reactors (5. 0 x 10 {sup - 3 } rem/yr).

40|$|The {{dynamism}} {{and ongoing}} changes that the electricity markets sector is constantly suffering, {{enhanced by the}} huge increase in competitiveness, create the need of using simulation platforms to support operators, regulators, and the involved players in understanding and dealing with this complex environment. This paper presents an enhanced electricity market simulator, based on multi-agent technology, which provides an advanced simulation framework {{for the study of}} real electricity markets operation, and the interactions between the involved players. MASCEM (Multi-Agent Simulator of Competitive Electricity Markets) uses real data for the creation of realistic simulation scenarios, which allow the study of the impacts and implications that electricity markets transformations bring to different countries. Also, the development of an upper-ontology to support the communication between participating agents, provides the means for the integration of this simulator with other frameworks, such as <b>MAN-REM</b> (Multi-Agent Negotiation and Risk Management in Electricity Markets).

40|$|Safety {{and cost}} {{information}} is {{developed for the}} conceptual decommissioning of a commercial uranium hexafluoride conversion (UF{sub 6 }) plant. Two basic decommissioning alternatives are studied to obtain comparisons between cost and safety impacts: DECON, and passive SAFSTOR. A third alternative, DECON of the plant and equipment with stabilization and long-term care of lagoon wastes. is also examined. DECON includes the immediate removal (following plant shutdown) of all radioactivity in excess of unrestricted release levels, with subsequent release of the site for public use. Passive SAFSTOR requires decontamination, preparation, maintenance, and surveillance {{for a period of}} time after shutdown, followed by deferred decontamination and unrestricted release. DECON with stabilization and long-term care of lagoon wastes (process wastes generated at the reference plant and stored onsite during plant operation} is also considered as a decommissioning method, although its acceptability has not yet been determined by the NRC. The decommissioning methods assumed for use in each decommissioning alternative are based on state-of-the-art technology. The elapsed time following plant shutdown required to perform the decommissioning work in each alternative is estimated to be: for DECON, 8 months; for passive SAFSTOR, 3 months to prepare the plant for safe storage and 8 months to accomplish deferred decontamination. Planning and preparation for decommissioning prior to plant shutdown is estimated to require about 6 months for either DECON or passive SAFSTOR. Planning and preparation prior to starting deferred decontamination is estimated to require an additional 6 months. OECON with lagoon waste stabilization is estimated to take 6 months for planning and about 8 months to perform the decommissioning work. Decommissioning cost, in 1981 dollars, is estimated to be $ 5. 91 million for OECON. For passive SAFSTOR, preparing the facility for safe storage is estimated to cost $ 0. 88 million, the annual maintenance and surveillance cost is estimated to be about $ 0. 095 million, and deferred decontamination is estimated to cost about $ 6. 50 million. Therefore, passive SAFSTOR for 10 years is estimated to cost $ 8. 33 million in nondiscounted 1981 dollars. DECON with lagoon waste stabilization is estimated to cost about $ 4. 59 million, with an annual cost of $ 0. 011 million for long-term care. All of these estimates include a 25 % contingency. Waste management costs for DECON, including the net cost of disposal of the solvent extraction lagoon wastes by shipping those wastes to a uranium mill for recovery of residual uranium, comprise about 38 % of the total decommissioning cost. Disposal of lagoon waste at a commercial low-level waste burial ground is estimated to add $ 10. 01 million to decommissioning costs. Safety analyses indicate that radiological and nonradiological safety impacts from decommissioning activities should be small. The 50 -year committed dose equivalent to members of the public from airborne releases during normal decommissioning activities is estimated to &#x 27;Je about 4. 0 <b>man-rem.</b> Radiation doses to the public from accidents are found to be very low for all phases of decommissioning. Occupational radiation doses from normal decommissioning operations (excluding transport operations) are estimated to be about 79 <b>man-rem</b> for DECON and about 80 <b>man-rem</b> for passive SAFSTOR with 10 years of safe storage. Doses from DECON with lagoon waste stabilization are about the same as for DECON except there is less dose resulting from transportation of radioactive waste. The number of fatalities and serious lost-time injuries not related to radiation is found to be very small for all decommissioning alternatives. Comparison of the cost estimates shows that DECON with lagoon waste stabilization is the least expensive method. However, this alternative does not allow unrestricted release of the site. The cumulative cost of maintenance and surveillance and the higher cost of deferred decontamination makes passive SAFSTOR more expensive than DECON. Several methods to assure that the licensee has adequate funds for decommissioning are considered. The methods investigated (all based on expected decommissioning costs) range from a single payment when plant operations begin, to payments into a sinking fund during the normal plant operating period, to a single payment when normal plant operations cease and decommissioning begins...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The cost of {{ionizing}} radiation exposure {{to people and}} property has been estimated as between 10 and 250 per <b>man-rem</b> by several investigators in the early 70 's. These values were considered acceptable by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). However, in the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) "Numerical guide for design objectives and limiting conditions for operation to meet the criterion 'as low as practicable' for radioactive material in Light Water Cooled Nuclear Power Reactor effluents", the value 1, 000 /man-rem {{is used as a}} standard for cost/benefit evaluation. It is the discrepancy between NRC's 1, 000 /man-rem and the much lower values accepted by the ICRP that initiated the interest of this study. Since the lower values were obtained by intuitive assumptions and simple calculations, {{the purpose of this study}} is to develop a more detailed method in an effort to estimate more precisely the costs due to radiation exposure, and hence the economic risk from nuclear power. Using the frequency distribution data for the various risks from nuclear accidents given in the NRC's Reactor Safety Study (RSS, 1975), this study will first calculate the expected (average) risks from this source. With the aid of various economic models, the expected risks are then converted to costs. Results obtained in this way will not only provide some insight for examining the cost effectiveness of different rule-settings, but also improve public understanding of the risk of nuclear accidents by expressing them in simple monetary terms...|$|E
