40|$|This slide {{presentation}} reviews some of {{the issues}} concerning the aging of the materials in a Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV). The basic composition of the COPV is a Boss, a composite overwrap, and a <b>metallic</b> <b>liner.</b> The lifetime of a COPV is affected by the age of the overwrap, the cyclic fatigue of the <b>metallic</b> <b>liner,</b> and stress rupture life, a sudden and catastrophic failure of the overwrap while holding at a stress level below the ultimate strength for an extended time. There is information about the coupon tests that were performed, and a test on a flight COPV...|$|E
40|$|Metal-lined {{continuous}} {{fibre reinforced plastic}} (FRP) over-wrapped pressure vessels are used in aerospace applications, for storage of breathing air in fire fighting and scuba diving and for the storage of compressed gaseous fuels on natural gas and hydrogen vehicles. Continuous fibres, generally about 15 micro m in diameter and made of glass, carbon or kevlar, are embedded in a polymer matrix. The <b>metallic</b> <b>liner</b> is made of a ductile material - generally steel or aluminum alloy. After the <b>metallic</b> <b>liner</b> has been wrapped, the composite vessel is subjected to a process termed Autofrettage. In that process the vessel is internally pressurized {{to the point that}} the ductile metal liner undergoes a small amount of plastic deformation (unlike elastic deformation which disappears upon removal of stress, plastic deformation remains after the stress has been removed). Upon de-pressurization of the vessel, the <b>metallic</b> <b>liner</b> remains under compression and the FRP under tension. Acoustic emissions associated with fiber breakage are being developed currently as a non-destructive means of assessing the structural integrity of metal-lined continuous FRP over-wrapped vessels. Laboratory experiments have been carried out with flaws such as cracks and saw cuts of varying dimensions oriented in an axial-radial plane and located in the <b>metallic</b> <b>liner,</b> in the FRP or in both. Pressurization of the flawed vessel leads to fiber breakage, the extent of which is being examined with the intent that it will be a measure of structural integrity of the vessel. The results, however, suggest that the acoustic emissions attain a maximum for an intermediate flaw size. Low emissions are recorded when on the one hand the vessel has insignificant flaws, or on the other if the vessel has serious flaws. This non-monotonic variation of acoustic emission occurs whether the flaws are located in the <b>metallic</b> <b>liner,</b> in the FRP or in both. The experiments suggest that the stress intensity at the discontinuity (crack tip) attains a maximum at an intermediate flaw size. A mathematical corroboration is desired...|$|E

40|$|Onboard any space-launch vehicle, {{composite}} over-wrapped {{pressure vessels}} (COPVs) may be utilized by propulsion or environmental control systems. The {{failure of a}} COPV {{has the potential to}} be catastrophic, resulting in the loss of vehicle, crew or mission. The latest COPV designs have reduced the wall-thickness of the <b>metallic</b> <b>liner</b> to the point where the material strains plastically during operation. At this time, the only method to determine the damage tolerance lifetime (safe-life) of a plastically responding <b>metallic</b> <b>liner</b> is through full-scale COPV testing. Conducting tests costs substantially more and can be far more time consuming than performing an analysis. As a result of this cost, there is a need to establish a qualifying process through the use of a crack growth analysis tool. This paper will discuss fracture analyses of plastically responding metallic liners in COPVs. Uni-axial strain tests have been completed on laboratory specimens to collect elastic-plastic crack growth data. This data has been modeled with the crack growth analysis tool, NASGRO 6. 20 to predict the response of laboratory specimens and subsequently the complexity of a COPV...|$|E

The weave of the fabric and the high strength capability of the individual fiber {{in combination with the}} thermal conductivity and chemical stability of specific <b>metallic</b> <b>liner,</b> result in a very efficient light weight heat rejection system. Primary investigation included aluminum, copper, stainless steel and titanium as liner materials, and three different ceramic fabrics - Astroquartz II (a trademark of JPS Co., Slater, SC), Nextel (a trademark of 3 M Co., St. Paul, MN) and Nicalon (a trademark of The Nippon Carbon Co., Japan).

Closed-end cylindrical, and oblate spheroid-shaped vessels were fabricated in 4 - and 8 -inch diameter sizes.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} conducted to assess the feasibility of and benefits derived from the use of high temperature composite materials in aircraft turbine engine combustor liners. The study included a survey and screening of the properties of three candidate composite materials including tungsten reinforced superalloys, carbon-carbon and silicon carbide (SiC) fibers reinforcing a ceramic matrix of lithium aluminosilicate (LAS). The SiC-LAS material was selected as offering the greatest near term potential primarily on the basis of high temperature capability. A limited experimental investigation was conducted to quantify some of the more critical mechanical properties of the SiC-LAS composite having a multidirection 0 / 45 /- 45 / 90 deg fiber orientation favored for the combustor linear application. Rigorous cyclic thermal tests demonstrated that SiC-LAS was extremely resistant to the thermal fatigue mechanisms that usually limit the life of metallic combustor liners. A thermal design study led to the definition of a composite liner concept that incorporated film cooled SiC-LAS shingles mounted on a Hastelloy X shell. With coolant fluxes consistent with the most advanced <b>metallic</b> <b>liner</b> technology, the calculated hot surface temperatures of the shingles were within the apparent near term capability of the material. Structural analyses indicated that the stresses in the composite panels were low, primarily because of the low coefficient of expansion of the material and it was concluded that the dominant failure mode of the liner would be an as yet unidentified deterioration of the composite from prolonged exposure to high temperature. An economic study, based on a medium thrust size commercial aircraft engine, indicated that the SiC-LAS combustor liner would weigh 22. 8 N (11. 27 lb) less and cost less to manufacture than advanced <b>metallic</b> <b>liner</b> concepts intended for use in the late 1980 's...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides the}} theoretical background and concept for analyzing the filament-wound pressure vessels with thin metallic liners. The thin <b>metallic</b> <b>liner</b> is serving mainly as a permeation barrier to hold liquid or gas, while the composite is sized to carry {{majority of the}} pressure loads. The bilinear material model is selected to simulate the material stress-strain curve which governs the metal linear behavior. An equivalent Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio is proposed {{to take into account}} the apparent change of Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio when liner stress exceeds the yield strength of material. The subjects investigated in this dissertation are classical lamination theory, quadratic failure criterion, bilinear material model, finite element analysis for axisymmetric solids, and linear elastic fracture mechanics. The objective of this dissertation is to establish a rational analysis procedure for filament-wound pressure vessels with metal liners. ^ Four sample cases are analyzed to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed finite element program FEASY 4 ND in solving the axisymmetric shell problems. The cases investigated include the parametric study on Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio, the thick-walled and thin-walled sphere analyses, and analysis of a sample filament-wound pressure vessel with a thin <b>metallic</b> <b>liner.</b> The filament-wound pressure vessel is analyzed at proof, operating, and design burst pressures. The liner cycle life is calculated based on the principle of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The effect of crack geometry (a/ 2 c), compressive effectivity factor f, proof pressure, operating pressure, and edge effect on the liner cycle life are also investigated. An empirical formula for conservatively predicting the liner cycle life of the sample pressure vessel in terms of the ratio of operating and proof pressures, and compressive effectivity factor is derived using least-squares curve-fit technique. ...|$|E

40|$|Composite {{pressure}} vessels, {{used extensively}} for gas and fuel containment in space vehicles, are generally constructed with a <b>metallic</b> <b>liner,</b> while the fiber reinforcement carries the {{major portion of}} the pressure-induced load. The design {{is dominated by the}} liner s low strain at yield since the reinforcing fibers cannot operate at their potential load-bearing capability without resorting to pre-stressing (or autofrettaging). An ultra high-efficiency pressure vessel, which operates at the optimum strain capability of the fibers, can be potentially achieved with a liner-less construction. This paper discusses the design and manufacturing challenges to be overcome in the development of such a pressure vessel. These include: (1) gas/liquid containment and permeation, (2) design and structural analysis, and (3) manufacturing process development.

40|$|Rising {{numbers of}} flights and aircrafts cause {{increasing}} aircraft noise, {{resulting in the}} development of various approaches to change this trend. One approach is the application of <b>metallic</b> <b>liners</b> in the hot gas path of aero-engines. At temperatures of up to 600 °C only metallic or ceramic structures can be used. Due to fatigue loading and the notch effect of the pores, mechanical properties of porous metals are superior to the ones of ceramic structures. Consequently, cellular metals like metallic foams, sintered metals, or sintered metal felts are most promising materials. However, acoustic absorption depends highly on pore morphology and porosity. Therefore, both parameters must be characterized precisely to analyze the correlation between morphology and noise reduction performance.

40|$|AbstractMotivation to {{decrease}} weight {{and cost of}} composite-overwrapped pressure vessels used in space exploration leads to designs that challenge the current qualification standards and methods for predicting fatigue life of the structures. Namely, as thickness of the metallic, overwrapped liners is reduced (potentially to tens of grains through-thickness), plastic deformation extends to the liner bounds, and linear elastic fracture parameters become invalid for fatigue crack growth characterization. In this case, fatigue crack growth is likely governed by microstructural features of the material. Life predictions should ultimately reflect this microstructural dependence. In this work, we design a study that involves both experimental and computational modeling aspects to gain three-dimensional perspective of the microstructural features influencing fatigue crack growth in a thin aluminum alloy reminiscent of a <b>metallic</b> <b>liner</b> material. High-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy is explored as a method for characterizing microstructural morphology, including crystallographic orientations, in a volume of material containing a microstructurally small fatigue crack.

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} in nuclear engineering to use concrete as shielding material for nuclear facilities, thanks to its versatility, cheapness but also its capacity to absorb radiation, due to its intrinsic water content, namely hydrogen. The presence of this light-atomic weight element in the mixture of concrete is responsible for slowing down the produced neutrons, which is the reason why, in the nuclear field, concrete {{is referred to as}} a “biological” barrier. For gamma-rays shielding purposes, heavy elements are conceived of having good shielding properties, instead; therefore ordinary concrete mixtures are often enriched with heavy aggregates to ensure a good absorption of secondary radiation. Hence, the knowledge of the moisture content evolution with the work history of a nuclear facility is fundamental to ensure the maintenance of its biological shielding, which justifies the suggested thermo-hygro-mechanical approach for the durability assessment of a concrete radiation shielding, through a FEM research code developed in agreement with the theory of porous media, already implemented in its fundamental lines and upgraded to account for radiation damage effects on exposed concrete. The required damage law has been defined based on the enveloping curve of several empirical data describing the behaviour of the Young modulus of exposed specimens, with respect to that proper of blank samples, in function of the neutron fluence. The damage parameter is supposed to follow the isotropic damage theory. The main physical quantities, included realistic neutron fluence values for the design condition of a facility under study, have been defined through a Monte Carlo tool developed by CERN and INFN of Milan, able to handle 3 D radiation transport calculations in matter. The combined use of the Monte Carlo technique and the FEM code, upgraded {{to take into account the}} radiation exposure effects on concrete, has allowed us to identify in the thermal aspect, i. e. the temperature rise in the shielding due to radiation energy deposition, the most severe factor for prescribing a work scenario, for the nuclear facility under study, consistent with concrete durability, when no other protective device is present, such as outer <b>metallic</b> <b>liners</b> working as coats for the biological shield or the presence of a cooling systems of the walls...|$|R
