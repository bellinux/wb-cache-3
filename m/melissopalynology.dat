40|$|Identifying {{the floral}} {{composition}} of honey provides {{a method for}} investigating the plants that honey bees visit. We compared <b>melissopalynology,</b> where pollen grains retrieved from honey are identified morphologically, with a DNA metabarcoding approach using the rbcL DNA barcode marker and 454 -pyrosequencing. We compared nine honeys supplied by beekeepers in the UK. DNA metabarcoding and <b>melissopalynology</b> were able to detect the most abundant floral components of honey. There was 92 % correspondence for the plant taxa that had an abundance of over 20 %. However, the level of similarity when all taxa were compared was lower, ranging from 22 - 45 %, and there was little correspondence between the relative abundance of taxa found using the two techniques. DNA metabarcoding provided much greater repeatability, with a 64 % taxa match compared to 28 % with <b>melissopalynology.</b> DNA metabarcoding has the advantage over <b>melissopalynology</b> in {{that it does not}} require a high level of taxonomic expertise, a greater sample size can be screened and it provides greater resolution for some plant families. However, it does not provide a quantitative approach and pollen present in low levels {{are less likely to be}} detected. We investigated the plants that were frequently used by honey bees by examining the results obtained from both techniques. Plants with a broad taxonomic range were detected, covering 46 families and 25 orders, but a relatively small number of plants were consistently seen across multiple honey samples. Frequently found herbaceous species were Rubus fruticosus, Filipendula ulmaria, Taraxacum officinale, Trifolium spp., Brassica spp. and the non-native, invasive, Impatiens glandulifera. Tree pollen was frequently seen belonging to Castanea sativa, Crataegus monogyna and species of Malus, Salix and Quercus. We conclude that although honey bees are considered to be supergeneralists in their foraging choices, there are certain key species or plant groups that are particularly important in the honey bees environment. The reasons for this require further investigation in order to better understand honey bee nutritional requirements. DNA metabarcoding can be easily and widely used to investigate floral visitation in honey bees and can be adapted for use with other insects. It provides a starting point for investigating how we can better provide for the insects that we rely upon for pollination. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to use <b>melissopalynology</b> to {{delineate}} the foraging preferences of bees in tropical environs. This was done by comparing pollen spectra obtained from the same hives every three months for three years at four sampling locations (in two sites) within a confined landscape mosaic. If <b>melissopalynology</b> is highly replicable, the spatial variation of the pollen spectrum from the honey samples would be much more than the temporal (inter-annual) variations. In other words, given the three factors, Month, Year and Location, honey pollen from different Locations, in a given Year and Month, would be much less similar than samples from different Years, in a given Location and Month. We then determined how the factors, Month, Year and Location, influenced the pollen influx of honey. The pollen analyses of the 42 honey samples collected during the three years yielded 80 pollen taxa/types: 72 dicotyledonous and 8 monocotyledonous, encompassing 41 botanical families spread into seven life forms namely, trees, shrubs, epiphytes, herbs, climbers, grasses, and sedges. Our results showed that pollen spectra were equally comparable between Locations and between Months and Years; the importance of this result is that it helped to demonstrate the complexity of ecological/environmental phenomena involved in the process of foraging by bees in a heterogeneous and complex landscape...|$|E

In this work the potential use of a potentiometric electronic tongue for pollinic assessment is evaluated, using monofloral and polyfloral honeys. The results showed that after splitting honeys according to color (white, amber and dark), the novel methodology enabled quantifying the relative percentage of the main pollens (Castanea sp., Echium sp., Erica sp., Eucaliptus sp., Lavandula sp., Prunus sp., Rubus sp. and Trifolium sp.). Multiple linear regression models were established {{for each type of}} pollen, based on the best sensors sub-sets selected using the simulated annealing algorithm. To minimize the overfitting risk, a repeated K-fold cross-validation procedure was implemented, ensuring that at least 10 - 20 % of the honeys were used for internal validation. With this approach, a minimum average determination coefficient of 0. 91 ± 0. 15 was obtained.

Pollen spectra gave consistent results for the same type of honey from different areas. The large variety of meliferous sources (223) enable in Romania to produce characteristic type of honeys. The interest in the production of unifloral honeys is a higher consumer preference for some honey varieties leading to a commercial interest of the beekeepers. In six sample of commercial unifloral honey, 16 pollen types were identified. These honeys are not especially rich in pollen types and compares with many honeys characteristic of Europe. Plantago pollen grains are irregularly found in these honeys, as elsewhere, although their numbers in any one sample are insignificant.

Our previous <b>melissopalynology</b> study focused on the analysis of the Omani honey from hives in 14 locations of Muscat and the Al Batinah regions. Our current study examines the pollen pellets collected from those same areas. A total of 249 pollen pellets from 22 honeycombs that were collected by Apis florea and Apis mellifera honeybees were processed and the pollen types were identified using light and scanning electron microscopy. Each pollen load was designated as a unifloral, bifloral or multifloral type. Each plant taxon identified was categorized as being utilized by honeybees for pollen only, nectar only or for both pollen and nectar. A pollen reference collection of 105 local flowering plants was prepared that enabled us to identify most of the pollen types. The quantification of 94 pollen types revealed that 67 of them belonged to 39 plant families, all of which are represented in both the pollen loads and the honey samples. Seven pollen genera were found in the pollen loads only and suggest that those plants were visited by bees just for pollen. Twenty pollen types appear only in the honey samples and suggest that bees visited them only for nectar. Major bee foraging plant species include: Ziziphus spina-christi, Acacia tortilis, Prosopis cineraria, Prosopis juliflora, Maerua crassifolia, Citrus spp., Zygophyllum spp. and Fagonia spp. These data provide a guide to the optimal utilization of floral resources by honeybees in these regions...|$|E

Honey from strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.), a typical plant in Algarve, was the focus of this study. This kind of honey has low acceptability by consumers probably because of unawareness of its existence and/or of its beneficial biological properties. Also, it may not be an obvious preference, due to its exquisite bitter taste, thus being locally called “bitter honey” (Chapter 4). Artisanal bitter honey was compared with other commercial honeys that are appreciated by Portuguese consumers (Chapter 5).

Finally, in the last stage of the work (Chapter 6), new methods for determination of botanical origin of honey were explored as potential alternatives to the traditional analysis method (melissopalynological). These non-invasive techniques namely electronic tongue, UV-Vis spectroscopy and Vis-NIR spectroscopy, were used with the help of multivariate analysis (principal component analysis, PCA), for the interpretation of data’s obtained with above techniques. It is hoped that this research will represent an enrichment of knowledge on honey from the Algarve and, especially for Arbutus unedo honey, it has been demonstrated that it has the characteristics of similar gourmet honey from Italy existing, therefore, the potential of increasing its commercial value, which would also be advantageous for the interior region of the Algarve where, since the Arab occupation, the strawberry tree is abundant...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of the principles and perspectives of Forensic Palynology, largely based on both general palynological assumptions and on the knowledge and experiences that the major international experts in this subject, Dallas Mildenhall, Patricia Wiltshire and Vaughn Bryant, shared in the last international congresses. In this moment, they are the few experts which spend time expressively to divulgate this science. They are actually involved in the investigations and surveys about criminal facts by the Security Forces, respectively, of New Zealand, Great Britain and USA. Pollen grains are a great survey’s instrument, but although this subject is treated since fifty years or longer, the two first Forensic Palynology International Meetings were held in 2004. Mildenhall and his colleagues underline the fact that main questions on this subject are: “How this science works, which are its rules, and why the use of forensic palynology in a systematic way is so important”. In general, two main features bring pollen analysis to be a very valuable tool in different research and applicative fields: a) each species has a typical pollen morphology; b) pollen grains have a very resistant external wall, the exine. Only fire and oxidation can completely destroy pollen grains, while the microbiological attack and the wet variations in the substrate can hard on or get the exine thinner. A Reference Pollen Collection must support the pollen identification. Basic assumptions for correct interpretation come from both knowledge on botany, and on pollen production and transport characteristic of each species. Archaeological and palaeoclimatic recontructions, air and food quality control are partly based on pollen analysis. Experiences in these fields give to the forensic palynologist the possibility to be supported in his analysis by a theoretical and methodological background, useful to follow the pollen traces in forensic cases. The continuative involving in forensic cases for pollen sampling and analysis could drive the interpretation quality to higher levels. Collecting data analysis, pollen lists and spectra bring information about plant sources linking them with persons, events, places and seasons. This helps to answer the questions of “where?” and “when?” a crime has been committed. Moreover, palynology is a multidisciplinary science, and can give more detailed answers when it is complementary used with other sciences like geology, biology, meteorology, legal medicine, etc [...] . As important instrument of crime solving would be used like one element of the Environmental Profiling. A forensic palynologist has to perfectly know the crime scene or the place of finding, and has to personally sample on the field some control samples, having a perfect knowledge about the sampling scene and objects. Comparison of pollen spectra from different samples is the base of palynological investigation. The more samples will be examined the more detailed pollen interpretation will be performed. So, the aspect that bring more difficulties to the systematic use of pollen analysis in the criminal investigations is the correct sampling problem and the presence of a palynologist on the crime scene. Palynology follows the Evidential Paradigm assuming {{that it is possible to}} infer a whole history by few elements, and the analysis must be trained without preconceptions, because the information that pollen analysis will bring is unpredictable. Pollen spectrum can afford remarkable information, but frequently the more interesting inferences come from abundant, or clustered, or in generally key evidence, pollen. In this paper, some case examples of pollen as important clue helping the investigations are reported such as the ‘yellow rains’, or the pollen marker of displacements or travels, witness of aggressions or robberies. Moreover, how the palynological method from other applicative fields, such as archaeobotany and <b>melissopalynology,</b> can be useful to give a contribution to the forensic sciences is discussed. This was made in order to increase the trasmission and the exchange of informations between Security Forces and botanists...|$|E
40|$|Forensic Palynology {{is still}} often {{considered}} a quite new discipline but its first applications {{go back to}} the ’ 50 s (Erdtman, 1969). Since then, and particularly in the last years, the study of pollen and spores from crime scenes and in criminalistic cases has known an endless development (Bryant et al., 1996; Mildhenhall et al., 2006 a). Pollen evidence was frequently reported as an important witness to criminalistic case solving, and a versatile investigation tool in many offences such as homicides (Milne, 1998), human remain concealment (Szibor et al., 1998), kidnapping (Mariotti Lippi and Mercuri, in press), robbing (Mildenhall, 1998), drug enforcement (Mildhenhall et al., 2006 b). "Pollen fingerprint" is specific for every kind of crime and obtainable by both sampling on the body and in the environment. Forensic Palynology is part of Forensic Botany, and would be managed by a botanist (Miller Coyle, 2005). It has roots in Palynology, with which it shares both the object of study (pollen, spores plus other palynomorphs), and the basic principles for sampling, and sample processing, analysis and interpretation. However, sampling procedure and processing may require specific behavioural rules and different treatments to isolate and fix pollen from diverse substrata and in different situations. Main aim of Forensic Palynology is to answer the questions of “where?” and “when?” a crime has been made. Records reflect the environment where the parent plants and fungi live, and more various and abundant are the pollen records, more precise and unambiguous will be the environmental picture. If a significant number of records is found, the palynologist is able to assess the pollen spectra of the case. Pollen types with their percentage (or concentration) values can be grouped in groupings useful for interpretation (for example, trees, shrubs, herbs, aquatics, exotics, cultivated plants, etc.). The pollen spectrum, obtained for example from the body of a suspected or victim, will bring pollen marks of the environment where the person has passed through, thus giving useful and sometimes key information for crime investigation. Less frequently, it also reveals the season of death. At the state of the art, the interest of police forces and investigators for this science is rapidly increasing, and interdisciplinary workshops and conferences dealing with Forensic Palynology are more frequent. But the search for pollen evidence in criminal cases is still far to be routinely applied. Some problems are main obstacle to the real development of this science: 1) Palynologists would be involved in police investigations since the first phase, but actually they were commonly excluded by key procedures such as the inspection of the crime scene. 2) It should be give more possibility to experts to disseminate the sampling and treatment modalities, and the results obtained from pollen analyses in cases that were resolved; also, scientific papers must be published. 3) Specific experimental studies should be made to simulate and reproduce false-criminal events, and to observe the pollen spectra obtained. Scientific papers on actual and experimental cases will encourage more scientists to carry out these analyses, and will improve the set of reference data useful for reasonable comparative interpretations. Some recent meetings on Forensic Palynology have notably improved the interest of experts and the exchange of experiences. The continuative involving in forensic cases for pollen sampling and analysis could drive interpretation to finer levels. In this paper, some examples of pollen clues which had helped the investigations are reported, such as the strange case of the ‘yellow rains’, the silent marker of displacements and travels, the invisible witness of aggressions and robberies. Moreover, how the method assessed from other applicative fields of palynology, such as archaeobotany and <b>melissopalynology,</b> is useful to give a contribution to the forensic sciences is discussed.
