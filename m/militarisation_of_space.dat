500|$|Star Cops {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2027—some 40 years into the future at time of broadcast—a time in which space travel has become common and mankind {{is in the process of}} {{exploiting}} and colonising the Solar System. There are five permanently manned space stations orbiting the Earth and there are bases on the Moon and Mars. Approximately 3,000 people are living and working in space. This near future setting was influenced by the potential for greater access to space promised by the burgeoning Space Shuttle programme and by the <b>militarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> through the US Government's Strategic Defense Initiative programme (also known as [...] "Star Wars") both of which were underway in the early 1980s. Accordingly, space travel and life in space is portrayed in a realistic manner with depictions of weightlessness and low gravity environments and lengthy space journeys (months or years in cases of interplanetary travel) as well as hazards such as spacesuit failures, radiation exposure and explosive decompression. This air of realism has led to Star Cops being frequently compared with the 1973 BBC drama series Moonbase 3. Similarly, the pioneering spirit evoked by the process of colonising the Solar System seen in the series has led to comparisons with the Western genre among many commentators.|$|E

40|$|The post- 9 / 11 global {{political}} climate has seen an unprecedented escalation {{in demand for}} knowledge and cultural production from Pakistan. This article explores {{the ways in which}} this shift has shaped the current academic and cultural landscape in Pakistan, with a focus on the institutional <b>space</b> <b>of</b> the art school. The recent growth in these spheres has taken place alongside a simultaneous intensification in the policing and <b>militarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> knowledge and cultural production. We consider the possibilities of formulating a dissident art/academic practice in a sphere shaped and disciplined by the dual forces <b>of</b> <b>militarisation</b> and imperialist agendas. To this end, we explore the work of three non-institutional pedagogical/cultural/community spaces in Karachi as engaged, immersive and participatory forms of knowledge production. We find in these spaces a heightened visibility of how much is at stake in conflicts and contestations over knowledge and culture in contemporary Pakistan, as well as a realisation of the possibilities of disrupting institutionalised colonial modes of knowledge production, dissemination and circulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article aims {{to analyse}} the {{increasing}} <b>militarisation</b> <b>of</b> public <b>space</b> in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, {{particularly on the}} eve of the 2016 Olympics. To this end, I briefly discuss how the concept <b>of</b> <b>militarisation</b> has been historically approached in the International Relations literature, namely within the security field. In the first section, I address the nature of the domestic security challenges Brazil faces as a developing country. In the second section, I show that the public security challenge of organised crime in Rio was securitised and confronted by increasing militarisation over the years as a result of a specific model of neo-liberal social control carried out by the country. I then analyse Brazil’s Olympics security scheme carried out in order to portray Rio as a safe city to the world. In the last section, I highlight the contradictions between accounts on the collapse in domestic security vis-à-vis official government statements to the international media to assure that ‘nothing would go wrong’ during the mega sports event. The idea is to show how the <b>militarisation</b> <b>of</b> public security, rather than mere governmental efforts to signal stability to the international community during the Olympics, is a trend likely to outlast the event that implies not only, but mainly, the perpetuation of insecurity...|$|R

50|$|Space {{weapons are}} weapons used in space warfare. They include weapons that can attack space systems in orbit (i.e. anti-satellite weapons), attack targets {{on the earth}} from space or disable {{missiles}} travelling through space. In {{the course of the}} <b>militarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>space,</b> such weapons were developed mainly by the contesting superpowers during the Cold War, and some remain under development today. Space weapons are also a central theme in military science fiction and sci-fi video games.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the safety and security measures for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the <b>militarisation</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>space</b> and policing in post-apartheid South Africa. In particular, it focuses upon how the South African state and FIFA, the owners of the World Cup franchise, worked to present the World Cup as an event which required exceptional levels of security – resulting in a historically unprecedented joint police and military operation across host cities. However, in contrast with previous research on these security measures, this thesis aims to interrogate the political and commercial forces which constructed security and positions them against a backdrop of intensified state violence and social exclusion in South Africa. Concurrently, the South African case was indicative <b>of</b> an international <b>militarisation</b> <b>of</b> major events, with policing operations comparable to national states of emergency. This is representative of the ‘new military urbanism’ in which everyday urban life is rendered as a site of ubiquitous risk, leading to the increased diffusion of military tactics and doctrines in policing and policy. While the interpenetration between urbanism and militarism has often been studied against the context of the ‘war on terror’, in the case of South Africa this has primarily been accelerated by a pervasive social fear of violent crime, which has resulted in the securitisation of cities, the remilitarisation of policing and the intensification of a historical legacy of socio-spatial inequalities. The South African government aimed to use the World Cup to ‘rebrand’ the country’s violent international image, while promising that security measures would leave a legacy of safer cities for ordinary South Africans. The concept of legacies was also responsive to the commercial imperatives of FIFA and a range of other security actors, including foreign governments and the private security industry. However these policing measures were primarily cosmetic and designed to allay the fears of foreign tourists and the national middle class. In practice security measures pivoted around the enforcement of social control and urban marginalisation while serving as a training ground for an increasingly repressive state security apparatus. Security was as much a matter of fortifying islands of privilege and aiding a project of financial extraction as protecting the public from harm.

50|$|The <b>militarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> is the {{placement}} {{and development of}} weaponry and military technology in outer space. The early exploration of space in the mid-20th century had, in part, a military motivation, as the United States and the Soviet Union used {{it as an opportunity}} to demonstrate ballistic missile technology and other technologies having the potential for military application. Outer space has since been used as an operating location for military spacecraft such as imaging and communications satellites, and some ballistic missiles pass through outer space during their flight. As yet, however, weapons have not been stationed in space, {{with the exception of the}} Almaz space station and small handguns carried by Russian cosmonauts (for post-landing, pre-recovery use).|$|E
50|$|The third current {{application}} of <b>militarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> {{can be demonstrated}} by the emerging military doctrine of network-centric warfare. Network-centric warfare relies heavily {{on the use of}} high speed communications which allows all soldiers and branches of the military to view the battlefield in real-time. Real-time technology improves the situational awareness of all of the military’s assets and commanders in a given theatre. For example, a soldier in the battle zone can access satellite imagery of enemy positions two blocks away, and if necessary e-mail the coordinates to a bomber or weapon platform hovering overhead while the commander, hundreds of miles away, watches as the events unfold on a monitor. This high-speed communication is facilitated by a separate internet created by the military for the military. Communication satellites hold this system together by creating an informational grid over the given theatre of operations. The Department of Defense is currently working to establish a Global Information Grid to connect all military units and branches into a computerised network in order to share information and create a more efficient military.|$|E

40|$|Norwegian double {{standards}} on security {{policy in the}} Arctic. It is written by a journalist and so has a journalistic style which is engaging and informative.
