40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine Henri-Georges Clouzot’s {{questioning}} of French morality in La Vérité (1960). La Vérité, which translates as The Truth, {{is not merely a}} courtroom drama about a crime passionnel; a closer look reveals that this film directed by Clouzot does not aim to judge its accused; instead, it is society’s morality that is put on trial. Viewing La Vérité resembles being prosecuted for lack of self-reflection. Clouzot holds up a mirror to the audience who are helplessly subjected to witnessing how Dominque Marceau becomes entangled deeper and deeper in a web of <b>moral</b> <b>prejudice</b> and prejudgement, only to realise that the spider is not solely the président des assises, nor the jury; it is primarily the observer who is responsible for Marceau’s predicament. In short, the truth seems susceptible to moral standards, but how, then, is the truth in fact true? And, moreover, how can truth and justice be compatible when morality interferes? Obscured by a dramatic veil of passion and beauty, these are questions that Clouzot presents his 1960 s French audience and, although it was over fifty years ago, these are still very relevant questions to address. By means of his inconclusive subtlety, Clouzot asks for an active-reflexive commitment to his pursuit and he expects the viewer to put in effort and contribute by taking a standpoint through active reasoning and reflective thinking. Although engaging and innovative, La Vérité leaves a bitter taste as the ending is disquieting to an audience who accept the mirror that Clouzot is handing and take a close and honest look at its reflection...|$|E

40|$|Esta pesquisa tem como foco a discussão sobre a Educação do Campo no Brasil e como esta possibilita o acesso dos camponeses ao ensino superior. Buscaremos compreender como os movimentos sociais do campo, através dos estudantes oriundos da agricultura {{familiar}} e assentamentos de reforma agrária, têm acessado as universidades públicas. Para tanto, caracterizaremos o projeto de campo no qual a Educação do Campo se insere, enfatizando os conflitos existentes entre o projeto hegemônico do agronegócio, a agricultura familiar e assentamentos de reforma agrária. A problematização passa pela constatação de que o Estado não respondeu com eficácia as necessidades educacionais de um contingente significativo da população do campo brasileiro em todos os níveis de ensino, havendo necessidade de mobilização social para que esse direito seja efetivado. Essas questões perpassaram a recente experiência desenvolvida pela Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG) em parceria com o Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária/Programa Nacional de Educação na Reforma Agrária (INCRA/PRONERA), por meio da qual se realizou a primeira turma de Bacharelado em Direito para camponeses. Essa conquista dos movimentos sociais encontrou apoio e oposição. A oposição tendeu a extrapolar o preconceito moral e se aproximou de uma resistência de classe, chegando inclusive a mobilizar o Ministério Público Federal de Goiás (MPF-GO), que instituiu uma Ação Civil Pública contra a turma de Direito (2007 - 2012). Ao final desta, pretendemos compreender as razões do processo jurídico, como a turma “Evandro Lins e Silva” e as suas organizações sociais atuaram durante os anos do curso e reconhecer o PRONERA como uma política pública necessária para continuar realizando novas turmas de ensino superior para os trabalhadores do campo. This research {{deals with}} the discussion regarding basic education {{in the rural areas}} of Brazil {{and the ways in which}} it facilitates access to higher education for peasants. We will try to understand how social movements in rural areas occupy academic territory through the students, who have accessed public universities, that come from family farming and the agrarian reform settlements. Therefore, we characterize the rural development project in which education in rural areas is situated, emphasizing the existing conflicts in relation to the hegemonic project of agribusiness, peasant family farming, and agrarian reform settlements. The analysis goes through the finding that the State has not responded with efficacy to the educational needs in the rural areas of Brazil, at all levels of teaching, with the need for social mobilization for the fulfillment of that right. These issues permeate the recent experience developed by the Federal University of Goiás (UFG) in partnership with the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) /National Program of Education in Agrarian Reform (PRONERA), through which the first class of Bachelors in Law for peasants was created. This achievement on the part of social movements was met with both support and opposition. The opposition tended to extrapolate <b>moral</b> <b>prejudice</b> and came close to a class resistance, up to the mobilization of the Federal Ministry of Goiás (MPF-GO), which instituted a Civil Public Action against the Bachelors in Law class (2007 - 2012). At the end of this research we seek to understand the reasons for the judicial process, how the “Evandro Lins e Silva” class (Bachelors in Law class name) and its social organizations acted during the years of the course and to recognize PRONERA as a necessary policy for the continuation of future classes in higher education for rural workers...|$|E

Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more highly organised, and to be highly organised is, I should fancy, the object of man's existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and, whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience.

40|$|If {{this thesis}} {{has to be}} {{expressed}} in one sentence and not in many thousand words, it is the following: Judges should love all those who are affected by their decisions as they love themselves. This is the key idea of the whole thesis. The argument {{for the importance of}} the principle of love starts from the consideration of two theories: the psychological theory of law developed by a Polish-Russian academic, Leon Petrazycki, and the moral theology of Thomas Aquinas. The theory of Petrazycki, which is almost unknown in the West, is important because it grounds the principle of love in the emotions and impulsions of those who are involved in the legal process. He sees the whole law as a complex interaction of individual impulsions, among which love is the most noble. The theory of Thomas Aquinas is important because it contains a developed idea of conscience. His search for the essential characteristic of a good conscience also points to love, even though he did not articulate it clearly. The combination of both theories allows us to look at the principle of love as the essential characteristic of a good conscience from different angles, and helps us to see that the whole process of judicial decision-making is a complicated phenomenon which comprises both moral intuitions and rational deliberations. The central place in the thesis is devoted to elaboration of the method of agapic casuistry which is a complex of skills and techniques of application of the principle of love in particular situations. The meaning of the principle of love is clarified through drawing on the traditions of Christian ethics. Love is understood as a care for another, as a genuine willingness to do good to others {{for the sake of the}} others. The method requires that the judges apply legal rules in a flexible way after reaching as deep an understanding as possible of the motives and moral views of the parties to the process, and after examining themselves with the purpose of neutralising <b>moral</b> <b>prejudices</b> and biases. Based on this method, the practices of impartial sympathy judgement and watchfulness are considered paramount in order for the principle of neighbourly love to operate effectively in the process of judicial decision making. The practical character of agapic casuistry is illustrated by examples of judicial decisions in four different courts: the House of Lords, the Scottish High Court of Justiciary, the Russian Constitutional Court, and the European Court of Human Rights. Four different aspects of judicial decision-making are taken in order to demonstrate that the judges can and do love their neighbours actively...|$|R
