5|$|<b>Manta</b> <b>rays</b> {{are members}} of the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of stingrays and their relatives. The genus Manta is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, to a lesser degree, morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the <b>manta</b> <b>rays,</b> and they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, M. alfredi was also {{classified}} as 'Vulnerable' with local populations {{of fewer than}} 1000 individuals and little or no interchange between subpopulations. The Manta Trust is a UK-based charity dedicated to research and conservation efforts for <b>manta</b> <b>rays.</b> The organization's website is also an information resource for manta conservation and biology.|$|E
5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand has banned the taking of <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> are used to attract tourists.|$|E

50|$|The reef <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> (<b>Manta</b> alfredi) is {{a species}} of ray in the family Mobulidae, {{one of the largest}} rays in the world. Among {{generally}} recognized species, it is the second-largest species of ray, only surpassed by the giant oceanic <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> (a currently unrecognized species from the Caribbean region also appears to be larger than the reef <b>manta</b> <b>ray).</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2009, Hawaii {{became the}} first of the United States to {{introduce}} a ban on the killing or capturing of <b>manta</b> <b>rays.</b> Previously, there was no fishery for mantas in the state, but migratory fish that pass the islands are now protected. In 2010, Ecuador introduced a law prohibiting all fishing for manta and other rays, their retention as bycatch, and their sale.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. <b>Manta</b> <b>rays</b> and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} threat to <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> is overfishing. M. birostris is not evenly distributed over the oceans, but is concentrated in areas that provide the food resources it requires, while M. alfredi is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate, overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals from elsewhere will replace them.|$|E

5|$|Both {{commercial}} and artisanal fisheries have targeted mantas for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls and harpoons. Mantas were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin; {{the latter were}} used as abrasives. Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their gill rakers, the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers, targeted fisheries have developed in Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of <b>manta</b> <b>rays,</b> primarily M. birostris, are caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation sites {{around the world are}} estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted fisheries for <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> in the Gulf of California, the west coast of Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, mantas became {{strictly}} {{protected in}} international waters {{because of their}} inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale. Although individual nations were already protecting <b>manta</b> <b>rays,</b> the fish often migrate through unregulated waters, putting them at increased risk from overfishing. The IUCN declared M. birostris to be 'Vulnerable with an elevated risk of extinction' in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Indonesia {{has brought}} in a fishing and export ban as it has {{realized}} that manta ray tourism is more economically beneficial than allowing the fish to be killed. A dead manta is worth $40 to $500 while manta ray tourism can bring in $1 million during {{the life of a}} single manta ray. Indonesia has 5.8 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles) of ocean and this is now the world's largest sanctuary for <b>manta</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sites {{at which}} <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> congregate attract tourists, and manta viewing generates {{substantial}} annual revenue for local communities. Tourist sites {{exist in the}} Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Spain, the Fiji Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, Hawaii, Western Australia and the Maldives. Mantas are popular because of their enormous size {{and because they are}} easily habituated to humans. Scuba divers may get a chance to watch mantas visiting cleaning stations and night dives enable viewers to see mantas feeding on plankton attracted by the lights.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped {{the sea and}} its animals. Their art often depicts <b>manta</b> <b>rays.</b> Historically, mantas were {{feared for}} their size and power. Sailors {{believed}} that they ate fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This attitude changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California {{found them to be}} placid and that they could interact with the animals. Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including Jaws author Peter Benchley.|$|E
5|$|While {{some small}} teeth have been found, few fossilized skeletons of <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> have been discovered. Their {{cartilaginous}} skeletons do not preserve {{well as they}} lack the calcification of the bony fish. Only three sedimentary beds bearing manta ray fossils are known, one from the Oligocene in South Carolina and two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina. Remains of an extinct species {{have been found in}} the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina. These were originally described as Manta fragilis but were later reclassified as Paramobula fragilis.|$|E

5|$|<b>Manta</b> <b>rays</b> {{are subject}} to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.|$|E
25|$|Larger fish such as Atlantic sturgeon, {{varieties}} of sharks, and stingrays visit the Chesapeake Bay. The {{waters of the}} Chesapeake Bay have been regarded {{one of the most}} important nursery areas for sharks along east coasts.
