25|$|Because {{double and}} single track may use {{different}} signalling systems, {{it may be}} awkward and confusing to mix double and single track too often. For example, intermediate <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> boxes on a double-track line can be closed during periods of light traffic, but this cannot be done {{if there is a}} single-line section in between. This problem is less serious with electrical signalling such as Centralized traffic control.|$|E
40|$|Musculoskeletal tissues {{respond to}} optimal <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> (e. g., strains) through {{anabolic}} adaptations, while <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> {{above and below}} optimal levels cause tissue catabolism. If an individual's physical behavior could be altered to generate optimal <b>mechanical</b> <b>signaling</b> to musculoskeletal tissues, then targeted strengthening and/or repair would be possible. We propose new bioinspired technologies to provide real-time biofeedback of relevant <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> to guide training and rehabilitation. In this review we provide a description of how wearable devices {{may be used in}} conjunction with computational rigid-body and continuum models of musculoskeletal tissues to produce real-time estimates of localized tissue stresses and strains.

25|$|Until 1985 {{the station}} and {{surrounding}} area was still controlled by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> box with full semaphore signalling, including double track throughout to Grimsby and beyond. However, a resignalling scheme for the entire area saw the line to Grimsby singled & the number of platforms reduced to four (numbers 1–3 and 5). Platform 5 was renumbered 4 and the Diesel Fuelling Road is {{what used to be}} platform 6. The signal box was closed & demolished and new colour light signals installed which were operated from a panel in the signal box at Pasture Street in Grimsby. In later works the platform surfaces have been rebuilt to modern specifications. Since January 2016, all signalling here is supervised from the Rail Operating Centre at York.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackgroundTendon is a {{mechanical}} tissue that transmits forces generated by muscle to bone {{in order to}} allow body motion. The molecular pathways that sense mechanical forces during tendon formation, homeostasis and repair are not known. EGR 1 is a mechanosensitive transcription factor involved in tendon formation, homeostasis and repair. We hypothesized that EGR 1 senses <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> to promote tendon gene expression. Methodology/Principal findingsUsing in vitro and in vivo models, we show that the expression of Egr 1 and tendon genes is downregulated in 3 D-engineered tendons made of mesenchymal stem cells when tension is released as well as in tendon homeostasis and healing when <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> are reduced. We further demonstrate that EGR 1 overexpression prevents tendon gene downregulation in 3 D-engineered tendons when tension is released. Lastly, ultrasound and microbubbles mediated EGR 1 overexpression prevents the downregulation of tendon gene expression during tendon healing in reduced load conditions. Conclusion/SignificanceThese results show that Egr 1 expression is sensitive to <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> in tendon cells. Moreover, EGR 1 overexpression prevents the downregulation of tendon gene expression in the absence of <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> in 3 D-engineered tendons and tendon healing. These results show that EGR 1 induces a transcriptional response downstream of <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> in tendon cells and open new avenues to use EGR 1 to promote tendon healing in reduced load conditions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> are {{important}} regulators of cell behavior. Key to understanding their role {{is the fact}} that cells are able to sense and respond to <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals.</b> In order to unravel the interplay between mechanics and biology one needs to embrace experimental and computational methods, stemming from engineering as well as biological disciplines, and integrate them into an interdisciplinary research field called mechanobiology. In this chapter we will first describe the structural and mechanical properties of a cell and its components, as these properties will have important consequences for the way <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> are converted into a biochemical response. Experimental techniques to measure and computational models to capture these properties will be highlighted. Once we have addressed some key aspects of cell mechanics, we will continue by describing some key mechanisms of how <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> can modulate cell behavior. Again, insights from experimental as well as computational studies will be reviewed. Given the broadness of the field, we will either focus on generic mechanisms, or limit ourselves to a few examples and case studies. status: publishe...|$|R

To clarify the cellular signal transduction pathway that senses and converts <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> into tissue growth in mandibular condyle, we evaluated Ihh expression {{and its relation to}} the kinetics of replicating mesenchymal cells in condylar cartilage during natural growth and mandibular advancement. Thirty-five-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were fitted with functional appliances. Experimental animals with matched controls were doubly labeled with iododeoxyuridine and bromodeoxyuridine so that we could evaluate the cycles of the proliferative mesenchymal cells. Mandibular advancement triggered Ihh expression in condylar cartilage. A higher level of Ihh expression coincided with the increase of the replicating mesenchymal cells' population and the shortening of the turnover time.
