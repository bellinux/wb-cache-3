5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingomyelin and gangliosides {{are highly}} {{concentrated in the}} brain and support synaptogenesis and myelination. In the central nervous system, sphingomyelin is a key component of the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath,</b> which insulates axons and supports efficient transmission of nerve impulses. During myelination, nerve axons are wrapped with multiple layers of cell membrane by oligodendrocyte glial cells, a process that accounts for a large portion of brain growth during late gestation and {{the first two years of}} life, but which can also continue up to 5–10 years of age. Meanwhile, gangliosides are concentrated within the brain’s gray matter and constitute approximately 6% to 10% of the total human brain lipid mass. Additionally, gangliosides are enriched at the synaptic membrane of neurons, and are functionally involved in neurotransmission and synapse formation. Brain ganglioside accretion occurs at an accelerated rate in the early years of life, coinciding with the most active period of myelination, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{dysfunction}} in Guillain–Barré {{syndrome is}} caused by an immune attack on the nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system and their support structures. The nerve cells have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the neuromuscular junction where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a sheath of Schwann cells that contain myelin. Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain–Barré syndrome feature different types of immune attack. The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> by white blood cells (T lymphocytes and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation {{of a group of}} blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant is mediated by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement.|$|E
5|$|To be specific, MS {{involves}} {{the loss of}} oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the myelin sheath—which helps the neurons carry electrical signals (action potentials). This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, {{the breakdown of the}} axons of neurons. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals. A repair process, called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath.</b> Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques. This could indicate {{that there are a number}} of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences. Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons. A number of lesion patterns have been described.|$|E

25|$|Sulfatide {{is a major}} {{component}} in the nervous system and is found in high levels in the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> in both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. Myelin is typically composed of about 70 -75% lipids, and sulfatide comprises 4-7% of this 70-75%. When lacking sulfatide, <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> is still produced around the axons; however, when lacking sulfatide the lateral loops {{and part of the}} nodes of Ranvier are disorganized, so the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> does not function properly. Thus, lacking sulfatide can lead to muscle weakness, tremors, and ataxia.|$|E
25|$|Possessing the apoE ε4 allele {{has been}} {{associated}} with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. ApoE is a protein that is involved in the transport of many lipids, including cholesterol, and thus, regulates how much sulfatide is in the central nervous system and mediates the homeostasis of the system. It has been found that higher levels of apoE are positively correlated with greater sulfatide depletion. ApoE-associated proteins take sulfatide from the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> and then degrade sulfatide into various compounds, such as sulfate. When apoE is increased, the amount of sulfatide that is taken from the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> is also increased; hence, there is more sulfatide depletion.|$|E

40|$|Recently, we {{described}} an as yet unidentified white matter disorder in eight patients which probably has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The disease {{was characterized by}} megalencephaly and leukoencephalopathy with onset during the 1 st year of life and a delayed onset of slowly progressive neurological dysfunction. No basic biochemical defect could be identified. Brain biopsy was performed {{in one of the}} patients and the histopathological findings are described in the present report. A spongiform leukoencephalopathy was revealed, without cortical involvement. Most vacuoles were covered by single five-layered membranes, representing single myelin lamellae. Some vacuoles were partially covered by multi-lamellar <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths</b> or oligodendroglial cell extensions. The vacuoles were never found in the middle or inner parts of <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths,</b> but involved the outermost lamellae of <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths</b> only, whereas the remainder of the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths</b> remained undisturbed. The histopathological findings place the disease among the vacuolating myelinopathies, although it is distinct from the well-known forms.

5000|$|In general, neurons receive {{information}} {{either at}} their dendrites or cell bodies. The axon of a nerve cell is, in general, responsible for transmitting information over a relatively long distance. Therefore, most neural pathways {{are made up}} of axons. If the axons have <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths,</b> then the pathway appears bright white because myelin is primarily lipid. If most or all of the axons lack <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths</b> (i.e., are unmyelinated), then the pathway will appear a darker beige color, which is generally called grey.|$|R
25|$|Demyelination is {{the act of}} demyelinating, or {{the loss}} of the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> {{insulating}} the nerves. When myelin degrades, conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. This leads to certain neurodegenerative disorders like multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12-dependent MTR {{reactions}} {{may also}} have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate methionine (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, {{if it is not}} regenerated from homocysteine by a B12 dependent reaction) is needed to make S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> phospholipids. Although production of SAMe is not B12 dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the essential amino acid methionine) is assisted by B12. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain neurotransmitters, catecholamines and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B12 deficiency. Methylation of the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.|$|E
25|$|Neuroregeneration {{refers to}} the {{regrowth}} or repair of nervous tissues, cells or cell products. Such mechanisms may include generation of new neurons, glia, axons, myelin, or synapses. Neuroregeneration differs between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) by the functional mechanisms and especially the extent and speed. When an axon is damaged, the distal segment undergoes Wallerian degeneration, losing its <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath.</b> The proximal segment can either die by apoptosis or undergo the chromatolytic reaction, which is an attempt at repair. In the CNS, synaptic stripping occurs as glial foot processes invade the dead synapse.|$|E
40|$|The {{localization}} of 3 H-labeled cholesterol in nerves undergoing degeneration and regeneration was {{studied by}} radioautography at the electron microscope level. Two types of experiments were carried out: (a) Cholesterol- 1, 2 - 3 H was injected intraperitoneally into suckling mice. 5 wk later, Wallerian degeneration was induced {{in the middle}} branch of the sciatic nerve, carefully preserving the collateral branches. The animals were then sacrificed at various times after the operation. During degeneration, radioactivity was found over myelin debris and fat droplets. In early stages of regeneration, radioactivity was found in myelin debris and regenerating <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths.</b> Afterwards, radioactivity was found predominantly over the regenerated <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths.</b> Radioactivity was also associated with the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths</b> of the unaltered fibers, (b) Wallerian degeneration was induced in the middle branch of the sciatic nerves of an adult mouse, preserving the collateral branches. Cholesterol- 1, 2 - 3 H was injected 24 and 48 hr after the operation and the animal was sacrificed 6 wk later. Radioactivity {{was found in the}} <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths</b> of the regenerated and unaltered fibers. The results from these experiments indicate that: (a) exogenous cholesterol incorporated into peripheral nerve during myelination remains within the nerve when it undergoes degeneration. Such cholesterol is kept in the myelin debris as an exchangeable pool from which it is reutilized for the formation of the newly regenerating fibers, especially myelin. (b) exogenous cholesterol incorporated into the nerves at the time that degeneration is beginning is also used in the formation of new <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths</b> during regeneration, (c) mature myelin maintains its ability to incorporate cholesterol...|$|R

25|$|After barrier {{breakdown}} symptoms may appear, such as swelling. Activation of macrophages and lymphocytes {{and their}} migration across the barrier {{may result in}} direct attacks on myelin sheaths within the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic demyelination event observed in MS. After demyelination has occurred, the degraded <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> components, such as myelin basic proteins and Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoproteins, are then used as identifying factors to facilitate further immune activity upon myelin sheaths. Further activation of cytokines is also induced by macrophage and lymphocyte activity, promoting inflammatory activity as well continued activation of proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases, which have detrimental effect on BBB integrity.|$|E
25|$|Ephaptic {{transmission}} is when two nerves {{communicate with each}} other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> that helps to both enhance electric transmission and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to “cross-talk” and send action potentials in both directions.|$|E
25|$|Zamboni {{and colleagues}} claimed that in MS {{patients}} diagnosed with CCSVI, the azygos and IJV veins are stenotic (abnormally narrowed) in around 90% of cases. Zamboni theorized that malformed blood vessels cause increased deposition of iron in the brain, {{which in turn}} triggers autoimmunity and degeneration of the nerve's <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath.</b> While the initial article on CCSVI claimed that abnormal venous function parameters were not seen in healthy people, others have noted {{that this is not}} the case. In the report by Zamboni none of the healthy participants met criteria for a diagnosis of CCSVI while all patients did. Such outstanding results have raised suspicions of a possible spectrum bias, which originates on a diagnostic test not being used under clinically significant conditions.|$|E

25|$|Sulfatide, {{also known}} as 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide, SM4, or sulfated galactocerebroside, is a class of sulfolipids, {{specifically}} a class of sulfoglycolipids, which are glycolipids that contain a sulfate group. Sulfatide is synthesized primarily starting in the endoplasmic reticulum and ending in the Golgi apparatus where ceramide is converted to galactocerebroside and later sulfated to make sulfatide. Of all of the galactolipids that {{are found in the}} <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath,</b> one fifth of them are sulfatide. Sulfatide is primarily found on the extracellular leaflet of the myelin plasma membrane produced by the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and in the Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. However, sulfatide is also present on the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane of many cells in eukaryotic organisms.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, HIV-1-infected {{patients}} often {{suffer from}} myelin degeneration {{in the central}} nervous system. These patients have elevated levels of sulfatide in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and anti-sulfatide antibodies in the serum. Elevated levels of anti-sulfatide antibodies can cause demyelination. This {{is caused by the}} binding of the anti-sulfatide antibodies {{to the surface of the}} <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> and/or the surface of Schwann Cells, which then activates a complete cascade of demyelination. Also, advanced stage AIDS patients can develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). Guillain–Barré syndrome is classified as an acute autoimmune polyneuropathy, which specifically affects the peripheral nervous system of the infected patient. Experimentation has shown that anti-sulfatide autoimmune antibodies may contribute to the development of Guillain–Barré syndrome in AIDS patients as well as the development of peripheral nervous system injury in HIV-1 infected patients.|$|E
25|$|Thin neurons and axons {{require less}} {{metabolic}} expense {{to produce and}} carry action potentials, but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons. The sheaths are formed by glial cells: oligodendrocytes in {{the central nervous system}} and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy. The <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1mm long, punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier, which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central nervous system.|$|E

Researchers suspect that reduced levels of vitamin A and high levels of free radicals may be the cause. This effect is thought to be specific to cats and has not been reproduced in any other animal. To produce these effects, the cats were fed solely on food that was irradiated at a dose at least five times higher than the maximum allowable dose.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} enable fast and {{efficient}} transduction of electrical signals in the nervous system, certain neuronal axons {{are covered with}} myelin sheaths. Myelin is a multilamellar membrane that enwraps the axon in segments separated by intervals known as nodes of Ranvier. It is produced by specialized cells: Schwann cells exclusively in the peripheral nervous system, and oligodendrocytes exclusively in the central nervous system. <b>Myelin</b> <b>sheath</b> reduces membrane capacitance and increases membrane resistance in the inter-node intervals, thus allowing a fast, saltatory movement of action potentials from node to node. Myelination is found mainly in vertebrates, but an analogous system has been discovered in a few invertebrates, such as some species of shrimp. Not all neurons in vertebrates are myelinated; for example, axons of the neurons comprising the autonomous nervous system are not, in general, myelinated.|$|E
25|$|Neurons {{exist in}} a number of {{different}} shapes and sizes and can be classified by their morphology and function. The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types; type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons, which can often be confused with dendrites. Type I cells can be further divided by where the cell body or soma is located. The basic morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal motor neurons, consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheath.</b> Around the cell body is a branching dendritic tree that receives signals from other neurons. The end of the axon has branching terminals (axon terminal) that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cerebral malaria (CM) is {{a severe}} {{complication}} of malaria with considerable mortality. In addition to acute encephalopathy, survivors frequently suffer from neurological sequelae. The pathogenesis is incompletely understood, hampering {{the development of}} an effective, adjunctive therapy, which is not available at present. Previously, erythropoietin (EPO) was reported to significantly improve the survival and outcome in a murine CM model. The study objectives were to assess myelin thickness and ultrastructural morphology in the corpus callosum in murine CM and to adress the effects of EPO treatment in this context. Methods The study consisted of two groups of Plasmodium berghei -infected mice and two groups of uninfected controls that were either treated with EPO or placebo (n[*]=[*] 4 mice/group). In the terminal phase of murine CM the brains were removed and processed for electron microscopy. <b>Myelin</b> <b>sheaths</b> in the corpus callosum were analysed with transmission electron microscopy and stereology. Results The infection caused clinical CM, which was counteracted by EPO. The total number of myelinated axons was identical in the four groups and mice with CM did not have reduced mean thickness of the <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths.</b> Instead, CM mice had significantly increased numbers of abnormal <b>myelin</b> <b>sheaths,</b> whereas EPO-treated mice were indistinguishable from uninfected mice. Furthermore, mice with CM had frequent and severe axonal injury, pseudopodic endothelial cells, perivascular oedemas and intracerebral haemorrhages.
