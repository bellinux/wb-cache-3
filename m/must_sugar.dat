Understanding historical trends may also aid in the assessment of likely future agricultural and horticultural changes. The timing of agricultural activities, such as grape harvest dates, is known to be influenced by climate and weather. However, fewer studies have been carried out on grapevine yield and quality. In this paper an analysis is undertaken of long-term data from the period 1805 - 2010 on grapevine yield (hl/ha) and <b>must</b> <b>sugar</b> content (°Oe) and their relation to temperature. Monthly mean temperatures were obtained for the same time period. Multiple regression was used to relate the viticulture variables to temperature, and long-term trends were calculated. Overall, the observed trends over time are compatible with results from other long term studies. The findings confirm a relationship between yield, <b>must</b> <b>sugar</b> content and temperature data; increased temperatures were associated with higher yields and higher <b>must</b> <b>sugar</b> content.

40|$|Fructose {{utilization}} by {{wine yeasts}} {{is critically important}} {{for the maintenance of}} a high fermentation rate at the end of alcoholic fermentation. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast able to ferment grape <b>must</b> <b>sugars</b> to dryness was found to have a high fructose utilization capacity. We investigated the molecular basis of this enhanced fructose utilization capacity by studying the properties of several hexose transporter (HXT) genes. We found that this wine yeast harbored a mutated HXT 3 allele. A functional analysis of this mutated allele was performed by examining expression in an hxt 1 - 7 Δ strain. Expression of the mutated allele alone was found to be sufficient for producing an increase in fructose utilization during fermentation similar to that observed in the commercial wine yeast. This work provides the first demonstration that the pattern of fructose utilization during wine fermentation can be altered by expression of a mutated hexose transporter in a wine yeast. We also found that the glycolytic flux could be increased by overexpression of the mutant transporter gene, with no effect on fructose utilization.

Yeasts were randomly isolated and identified by a combined genotypic approach consisting of {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) of 5. 8 S rRNA gene and 26 S rRNA and sequencing of D 1 /D 2 domain of the 26 S rRNA gene, which resulted in the recognition of 14 species belonging to 10 genera.

40|$|Abstract: The {{secondary}} {{products of}} alcoholic fermentation, are compounds {{that appear in}} variable quantities in addition to alcohol and CO 2 and they are: glycerol, lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, substances acetoin, 2, 3 butanediol, malic acid, succinic, propionic, citramalic,dimetilgliceric. Glycerol is formed by glycero-pyruvate fermentation. Glycerol, like secondary product of the alcoholic fermentation, has the greatest importance due to its favourable influence on organoleptic properties of wines. Its synthesis depends upon many factors. This study was conducted under laboratory conditions, using selected yeast strains from the Murfatlar vineyard, viticol Centre Medgidia, belonging to the Saccharomyces ellipsoideus, Saccharomyces italicus and Saccharomyces rosei species. The fermentation medium was Pinot gris must which was inoculated with 1. 5 to 1. 7 x 107 cells / ml, from the above mentioned yeasts. The objective was to establish the importance of several factors that determine wine glycerol concentration (e. g. <b>must</b> <b>sugar</b> and glycerol, concentration of inoculum, fermentation temperature and yeast species).

40|$|Mechanical and manual leaf {{removal of}} Nero d Avola vines {{were carried out}} in a {{commercial}} vineyard in Sclafani Bagni area, Sicily (South Italy), in the 2007 growing season. Rows were North East-South West oriented and vines were spur pruned and non-irrigated. The aim {{was to investigate the}} effects of two different ways of defoliation on plant physiology, vegetative parameters, yield and grape quality in a warm temperature area. Fruit zone defoliation consisted of mechanical (MLR) and hand leaf removal (HLR), applied either to both sides of the canopy (Northweast and Southeast). These treatments were applied when the berries had reached pea size and compared to a non-defoliated treatment (control). Hand and mechanical leaf removal caused different and significant reduction in leaf area per shoot modifying leaf-to-fruit ratio. Different vegetative activity was showed among the treatments during the vegetative season (from pea size to harvest). Consequently, differences in canopy architecture were measured at pea size and harvest. Photosynthetic activity of primary leaves was higher in leaf removal treatments than in non-defoliated.

Cluster had medium density and pyramidal shape with one wing, lower frequencies of dense or loose cluster, conical shape and two wings.

The current study focused on delineating management zones using fuzzy clustering techniques and developing a simplified approach for the comparison of zone maps. The study was carried out in a 1. 0 ha commercial vineyard in Central Greece during 2009 and 2010. Variation of soil properties across the field was initially measured by means of electrical conductivity, soil depth and topography. To estimate grapevine canopy properties, NDVI was measured at different stages during the vine growth cycle. Yield and grape composition (<b>must</b> <b>sugar</b> content and total acidity) mapping was carried out at harvest. Soil properties, yield and grape composition parameters showed high spatial variability. All measured data were transformed on a 48 -cell grid (10 x 20 m) and maps of two management zones were produced using the MZA software. Pixel-by-pixel comparison between maps of electrical conductivity, elevation, slope, soil depth and NDVI with yield and grape composition maps, set as reference parameters, allowed for the calculation of the degree of agreement, i. e. the percentage of pixels belonging to the same zone. The degree of agreement was used to select the best-suited parameters for final management zones delineation. For the year 2009 soil depth, early and mid season NDVI were used for yield-based management zones while for quality-based management zones ECa, early and mid season NDVI were utilized. For the year 2010 ECa, elevation and NDVI acquired during flowering and veraison were used for the delineation of yield-based management zones while for quality-based management zones ECa and NDVI acquired during flowering and harvest were utilized.

O experimento constou de seis tratamentos: testemunha (sem correção), sacarose, açúcar mascavo, mosto concentrado, álcool vínico e glicose de milho. Os vinhos foram elaborados em microvinificações, com seis repetições. As amostras foram avaliadas através das análises clássicas, efetuadas por métodos físico-químicos, e dos elementos minerais por absorção atômica. A sacarose foi o produto mais adequado para a correção do mosto, pois não incorporou componentes estranhos, não alterou a relação álcool em peso/extrato seco reduzido e apresentou elevado rendimento alcoólico.
