We carried out an ozone resistance test on four <b>metal</b> <b>sprays</b> and {{evaluated the}} water permeability and bond strength of the metals with superior ozone resistance, depending on the surface treatment method. In the ozone resistance test, four <b>metal</b> <b>sprays</b> and an existing ozone-proof paint were considered. In the experiment on the water permeability and bond strength depending on the surface treatment method, the methods of no treatment, surface polishing, and two types of pore sealing agents were considered.

Applying a pore sealing agent also provided the best waterproofing performance. Scanning electron microscope analysis showed that applying a pore sealing agent resulted in an excellent waterproofing performance because a coating film formed on top of the <b>metal</b> <b>spray</b> coating.

5000|$|Today, the Triumph Vitesse is much sought-after car by enthusiasts; parts {{supply is}} excellent, and the cars have a {{reputation}} for near [...] "bullet-proof" [...] mechanics. This is not completely warranted. The gearbox of the 2 litre suffered from wear of the output shaft [...] "nose" [...] that mates with the input shaft.

Nowadays it is possible to buy 'Heavy-duty' mainshafts for the overdrive gearboxes with a bigger 18mm diameter tip and a much stronger needle roller bearing. This upgrade is based on the re-designed 4-speed gearbox for later TR7 and Dolomite 1850 models, which are basically the same gearbox. The differentials were never up to the power of even the 2 litre and would not stand regular 0-60 blasts without either crown wheel tooth loss or shearing of half shafts. The idiosyncratic threaded front suspension setup is also an area where incorrect maintenance (grease instead of gear oil or no regular lubrication) leads to dramatic failures.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of Rapid Prototyping techniques opens new perspectives for Rapid Tooling. The combination of RP and <b>Metal</b> <b>Spraying</b> has been already proofed {{to be successful}} in producing directly moulds for low melting point materials. The attempt to move this technique to the production of steel dies has generally failed. A research aimed to the investigation of indirect rapid tooling techniques has been started. The purpose is to obtain an EDM electrode from a prototype and then using it to manufacture the steel die by EDM. Rapid Prototyping process considered in the investigation is Laminated Object Manufacture (LOM). In first attempt a metallic coating has been applied to the prototype by thermal spraying. In this case the distortion of the prototype can be minimised and delamination can be eliminated by a proper choice of growing direction of the LOM prototype combined with a proper set-up of spraying process including inclination of nozzle, thickness of the layers and cooling. Considering the geometry of the coated prototype this method led to unsatisfactory results. The main reasons is the fact that thickness of the coating can not be controlled and, therefore the resulting geometry of the electrode is different from the initial geometry. An alternative technique has been proposed which in principle can produce a sound electrode combining <b>metal</b> <b>spraying</b> with metal casting. In this approach the LOM object is a copy of the die instead of the manufactured part. A first layer of metal is applied to the LOM object by thermal spraying and then is filled by metal casting. A sound electrode is therefore obtained a used to manufacture the steel die. In this preliminary work simple geometry electrodes have been considered and tested in EDM process. Material Removal Rate and wear of electrodes obtained with different materials and techniques (<b>metal</b> <b>spraying,</b> metal casting) have been evaluated and compared with those of conventional machined electrodes...|$|E
