40|$|The 1980 s was a {{turbulent}} {{period for the}} financial services industry. The federal safety net-particularly deposit insurance-which was heralded by many for sustaining industry stability {{for nearly half a}} century, was suddenly criticized as a major cause of many of the industry 2 ̆ 7 s problems. In response to numerous proposals to modify the safety net, Congress enacted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). The new legislation emphasized the need to reform the safety net by shifting more of the risk of bank failures to depositors and away from the insurance fund and taxpayers. In a previous article appearing in this Journal, Professor Krishna Mantripragada discussed {{the costs and benefits of}} depositor discipline and evaluated the attributes of moving from the dollar-based insurance of FDICIA to a <b>maturity-based</b> coverage that insured only short-term deposits.

40|$|AbstractThe way to {{deal with}} the {{strongly}} increasing complexity of the company itself and its environment has become a key competitive factor. The complexity within a production company is characterized by the challenges encountered in daily business processes and can be described by the four dimensions of complexity: variety, heterogeneity, dynamics and non- transparency, as well as their interrelationships. Despite this increasing importance, only few companies have access to adequate tools for complexity management. Most companies have not introduced or implemented yet a complexity management system/approach or they do not know, if the used complexity management methods are efficient and adequate. Therefore, the question rises: How can a company be reviewed and evaluated regarding its complexity management skills?Maturity models can be used to support the analysis and assessment of skills and development-levels of products, processes or organizations by defining different levels of maturity, in order to assess the extent to which an object fulfills defined qualitative requirements. The various levels of maturity within such models can be used to describe the different achievable skill levels. Maturity models not only include methods for the assessment of skill levels, but also provide incentives and measures to increase the degree of maturity. After the introduction of measures to increase the skill level of maturity these models are also suitable to measure and evaluate the progress made. This paper presents an approach for an evaluation model of complexity management systems. First, the basics of the so-called advanced Complexity Management are given, highlighting the difference between complexity and complicacy as well as the comparing external and internal complexity. The fields and dimensions of complexity are presented as well. After that, maturity models fundamentals are presented by showing state-of-the-art maturity model approaches. Furthermore, the overall <b>maturity-based</b> approach for evaluation of complexity management systems, especially the maturity of their functionalities and capabilities regarding the needs and purposes of manufacturing enterprises, is presented by adapting and combining existing methods and models. The <b>maturity-based</b> approach describes different levels of complexity management systems within a production company, also taking into account recommendations and measures to increase the degree of maturity...|$|E

The procedures assume two-dimensional frame models, which employ both the analysis computer program (CPF) and the <b>maturity-based</b> model. The interaction of structure and compressible shoring, time-dependent concrete properties of strength, creep and shrinkage of concrete and the change in construction load during construction cycles are considered in the shoring system analysis. For wall formwork analysis, the time-dependent concrete properties of strength and the properties of wall-element parts are considered. The analytical results obtained by both the shoring system and the wall formwork analyses are checked against the field measurements and several existing methods. Various parameters that affect the construction load distribution among shores and reshores and interconnected slabs. and the fresh concrete pressure distribution on wall formwork are investigated. The present method {{can be used to}} design and construct safe and economical concrete structures, especially during concrete placing and formwork removal operations...|$|E
40|$|This essay briefly {{summarizes}} {{the current state}} of evidence on the linkage between yield curve inversions and NBER business cycle peaks. Comments welcome. Recently, the Treasury yield curve has become nearly horizontal and, at times, inverted (that is, negatively sloped) for yields less than 5 years to maturity. Consequently, some observers have expressed concern that the flattening portends a slowing of economic activity or, perhaps, a recession. There is good reason for such concern: Since 1964 —when the long-term Treasury bond market became deep enough to allow meaningful analysis of maturity-related spreads among Treasury issues—every NBER business cycle peak has been preceded by an inversion of the yield curve. Yet, this empirical regularity should not be stretched too far because the relationship between yield curve inversions and subsequent downturns in economic activity, in fact, is tenuous. What Causes The Yield-Curve Slope to Change? Asset prices and related <b>maturity-based</b> yield spreads, including the slope of the yield curve, are determined by forward-looking investors in liquid, competitive financial markets. As such, they contain information of value for monetary policymakers and analysts. Selected yield curve...|$|E

The funds are evaluated employing a single-index model and several multi-index and asset-class-factor models. In contrast to earlier studies dealing with (government) bond funds, we account for the specific risk and return characteristics of investment grade corporate bonds and use both rating-based indices and <b>maturity-based</b> indices, respectively, in our multi-factor models. In line with earlier studies, we find evidence that corporate bond funds, on average, under-perform the benchmark portfolios. Moreover, {{there is not a}} single fund exhibiting a significantly positive performance. These results are robust to the different models. Finally, we examine the driving factors behind fund performance. As well as examining the influence of several fund characteristics, particularly fund age, asset value under management and management fee, we investigate the impact of investment style on the funds' risk-adjusted performance. We find indications that funds showing lower exposure to BBB-rated bonds, older funds, and funds charging lower fees attain higher risk-adjusted performance. performance measurement, European corporate bond market, investment grade corporate bond mutual funds, multi-index model, asset-class-factor model, generalized Treynor ratio,...|$|E
40|$|The use of fly ash in {{concrete}} has received significant attention over recent years due to environmental concerns regarding its disposal {{and on the}} other hand its potential use as a cementitious material, with its ability to provide significant benefits to concrete. While a fly ash content less than 25 % of total cementitious content is routinely used {{in concrete}}, high-volume fly ash (HVFA) contents are not common used due to perceived lower early-age strengths. The objective of this research was to demonstrate that the beneficial effects of high in-place hydration might be able to compensate the slower rate strength gain of HVFA concrete that is typically observed when tested in standard laboratory conditions, in this effort, the <b>maturity-based</b> technique was used. In addition, different methods (match-cured cylinders and pullout testing) were used to estimate the early-age in-place strength of HVFA concrete to confirm the maturity predicted strengths. The results have shown that the standard and field-cured cylinder strengths underestimate the in-place concrete strength. Higher in-place temperatures due to the mass characteristics of structural elements resulted in increased early age in-place strengths, adequate for construction scheduling, as measured by match-cured cylinders,pullout testing, and th...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this experimental and analytical research project was to develop <b>maturity-based</b> guidelines for early opening-to-traffic of concrete pavements {{in the state of}} Indiana. Currently, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) specifies that pavements can be opened to traffic when the concrete reaches the strength of at least 3. 8 MPa (550 psi). During this study modulus of rupture (MOR) and maturity data were collected and strength gain characteristics were analyzed. Also, fatigue experiments were performed at different stress levels and ages. Based on the experimental results, modulus of rupture of concrete was correlated with corresponding fatigue life for a specific age. The maturity data was then linked with fatigue results through flexural strength correlation. A safe early opening age was determined based on design load used by INDOT and specifications for allowable repetitions. The results of this research should be useful to both INDOT and contractor by allowing for quantification of the impact of early opening on performance of the pavement. In addition, early pavement opening will reduce the cost to the travelling public by reducing construction time and improving safety in the construction zone. ...|$|E

Pregnant C. taurus aggregated at Wolf Rock in southern Queensland, at the most northerly part of their known range, from late summer to early winter.

40|$|Maize breeders {{continue}} to seek new sources of aflatoxin resistance, but most lines identified as resistance sources are late maturing. The vast difference in flowering time {{makes it hard to}} cross these lines with proprietary commercial lines that mature much earlier and often subjects the reproductive phase of these resistant lines to the hottest and driest portion of the summer, making silking, pollination and grain fill challenging. Two hundred crosses from the GEM Project were screened for aflatoxin accumulation at Mississippi State in 2008, and a subset of these lines were screened again in 2009. The breeding cross UR 13085 :S 99 g 99 u was identified as a potential source of aflatoxin resistance, and <b>maturity-based</b> selections were made from an S 2 breeding population from this same germplasm source: UR 13085 :S 99 g 99 u-B-B.

40|$|The {{process of}} egg release {{is a complex}} and crucial step in {{the life cycle of}} euphausiids, {{especially}} with regards mortality and recruitment success. We examined this process in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in terms of the functioning of the female genital apparatus and associated swimming behaviour. A tethering technique combined with video analysis was used to make observations of three females during the release process. We found eggs were steadily extruded over a period of up to 10 h, during which time the krill released between 1, 600 and 4, 000 eggs and the ovary reduced by a half in length and a third in height. Eggs were mainly released individually or, less commonly, in batches of between 2 and 4 eggs. Release rates were between 5 and 30 eggs min(- 1). The steady release of eggs fits well with histological evidence that mature oocytes must pass individually through tight genital ducts with narrow apertures, before coming in to close contact with the sperm plug for fertilisation, and then expulsion from the thelycum as fertilised eggs. During spawning, the female alternated between slow and rapid rates of pleopod beating with egg release occurring at the moment of beat acceleration. At the point of release, the descent of the egg was accelerated through downward beats of the 7 th thoracic leg. The cyclic pattern in pleopod beat-rate during spawning may alter swimming performance and contribute to the widely reported sex- and <b>maturity-based</b> biases within krill swarms...|$|E
40|$|The {{failure of}} many {{savings and loan}} {{institutions}} in the 1980 s bankrupted the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), forcing the FSLIC to rely on massive federal subsidies. A similar crisis subsequently struck the banking system, and {{it now appears that}} the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will also go bankrupt and require taxpayer subsidies. The vast expense of these bailouts has focused the attention of policymakers and the public on reducing the risk exposure of the federal deposit insurance system. In response to this crisis, the U. S. Treasury issued a report in 1991 in which it made specific proposals for reforming deposit insurance. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) incorporated some of the Treasury Department 2 ̆ 7 s proposals. One controversial element of the FDICIA is a plan for reforming the deposit insurance system by shifting some of the risk of bank failures from the federal insurance fund to depositors themselves. This proposal rests on the premise that depositors who bear some of the risk of bank failure are likely to discipline weak institutions by threatening to withdraw their deposits. In this Article, Professor Mantripragada discusses {{the costs and benefits of}} depositor discipline and assesses the Treasury proposals and FDICIA provisions that are designed to promote depositor discipline.

40|$|Purpose – Two main {{types of}} models are used {{worldwide}} {{in consideration of}} the impact of Information Communication Technology (ICT) processes in construction: capability maturity models(CMM) and e-readiness models. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the structure behind the different models, their applicability to construction and indicate how organisations move between the levels in a CMM. Design/methodology/approach – This study investigates the literature behind eight e-readiness models and 53 CMMs. Findings – The findings indicate 88 per cent of <b>maturity-based</b> CMM models linked to five maturity levels, with the remainder using four. CMMs have common features: the process/application is described by maturity levels; Key Process Areas (KPA) provide the features to allow movement; and the levels are arranged and attained systematically, lowest to highest. Publication dates and trends indicate the rate of CMM publication is increasing (most in 2009), conversely, e-readiness models are not (most published in 2004). Practical implications – It is expected that the number of CMMs will increase; conversely, e-readiness models may not. E-readiness models have not been adopted by other industries and applications. However, CMMs, although initiated in software engineering, have progressed to incorporate constructionmodels which cover processes as diverse as financial management and documentation. This suggests that a CMM is more applicable for applications such as e-business in construction. Originality/value – The paper significantly expands that of Man in 2007 who listed 22 CMM models.

40|$|The 2006 fly ash use survey {{conducted}} by the Ameri-can Coal Ash Associa-tion indicates that out of the 72. 4 million tons of fly ash produced annually 45 % was beneficially utilized; 59 % of this was used in cement and concrete applications. Concrete is the largest market for fly ash and offers the highest potential for increased fly-ash uti-lization. While fly ash is routinely used in concrete, the actual use of high-volumes of fly ash (> 30 % of total cementitious materials con-tent) in ready mixed concrete is limited due to perceived lower ear-ly-age strengths as documented in research studies conducted in the laboratory with standard cured strength specimens. Th e objective {{of this study was to}} demonstrate, using <b>maturity-based</b> techniques, that the actual in-place strength of High-Volume Fly Ash (HVFA) concrete in a structure is higher than that indicated by strength measured on fi eld-cured cylinders due to the higher in-place temperature resulting from the slower dissipation of heat of hydration due to the greater mass of structural members. Th e in-place strength of concrete in the structure can be determined by monitoring its temperature history over time, calculating the maturity, and by estimating the in-place strength from the pre-calibrated strength-maturity relationship. Th e maturity concept assumes hydraulic cement concrete of the same maturity will have similar strengths, regardless of the combination of time and temperature yielding the maturity.

40|$|Eco-efficiency {{improvements}} in manufacturing is a controversial subject for researchers, practitioners {{as well as}} policy makers. The widely accepted definition of "doing more with less" is not accurate enough to guide the design of improvements that can deliver products in a sustainable way. The outcome of these challenges is evident through significant environmental performance variations across various levels of manufacturing operations. The study {{is driven by the}} complexity of manufacturing systems and sought to offer design support for practitioners that aim to improve eco-efficiency. A maturity model has been developed in this work that simulates the influence of manufacturing practices on eco-efficiency. The model {{takes the form of a}} maturity grid (PMGE) that overlooks practices at process, management systems and top-management levels and incorporates 15 dimensions of performance overall. Evidence shows that practices tend to evolve from reactive to proactive as manufacturing systems mature and embrace eco- efficiency as a systemic property. It was also found that mature companies achieve {{improvements in}} energy and resources by relying on existing internal capabilities. Tools to facilitate research and intervene with practitioners in real-life problems were developed and tested. The researcher combined research findings and tools into a <b>maturity-based</b> method (PMGEM) for eco-efficiency improvements. The method intends to help practitioners plan and design eco- efficiency improvements aligned to existing internal capabilities and adopt a more proactive behaviour to environmental challenges. PMGEM was ultimately applied in two case studies with ultimate goal to help practitioners resolve real-life challenges. The applications were positively commented and encourage further work in this field. The researcher envisages that methods such as PMGEM are deeply needed in manufacturing to support practitioners approach complex concepts such as eco-efficiency.

40|$|Nowadays, many {{construction}} companies use <b>maturity-based</b> approaches to support {{decisions that have}} strong impact on costs and sustainability of the construction process, such as: age of pre-stressing operations, decision of propping/formwork removal; instant of subjection to load, etc. Current approaches to quality control through maturity consist in evaluating the compressive strength evolution of the concrete mix at a reference curing temperature (usually 20 °C), together with {{the determination of the}} apparent activation energy (Ea) of the mix. The value of Ea is usually obtained from one of these three sources: (i) reference recommendations based on the type of cement; (ii) calorimetric testing; (iii) testing of compressive strength evolution at several distinct temperatures. The only technique of determining Ea that really addresses a mechanical property is the latter one, demanding however the deployment of many specimens and tests. Furthermore, the destructive character of this technique limits the possibility of maintaining the same specimen for the entire Ea testing, thus increasing the variability/scattering of results. The present study intended to evaluate the possibility of assessing mechanical-based activation energy for concrete through continuous or quasicontinuous assessments of E-modulus since very early ages. E-modulus is a mechanical property depending on the advancement of the hydration reaction and the temperature stories during the curing, with the interesting characteristic of allowing non-destructive testing to be carried out. This paper presents an inter-laboratory and inter-technique comparative study of E-modulus evolution at several temperatures. Three laboratories were involved, contributing with specific testing techniques applied to a single mix of normal strength concrete: 1) BTJASPE (BéTon au Jeune Age, Suivi de la Prise et du module d'Elasticité), available at IFSTTAR in France; 2) EMM-ARM (Elasticity Modulus Measurement through Ambient Response Method) available at the University of Minho in Portugal; 3) TSTM (Temperature Stress Testing Machine), available at Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.

40|$|Deicing salts {{are applied}} {{to the surface of}} the {{concrete}} pavements to melt the ice and snow in an effort to improve the safety conditions for public travel. The solution that is produced (e. g., water-NaCl, CaCl 2, MgCl 2) can be absorbed into concrete pores. This solution alters the degree of saturation (i. e., the volume ratio of fluid in the sample as compared to the total maximum volume of fluid that the sample can hold) of concrete pavement, the freezing temperature of the solution within the concrete pores, and may result the damage. ^ First, a numerical model (one–dimensional finite difference model) is developed to describe the freeze-thaw thermal behavior of the mortar containing deicing salt solution. The model is used to predict the temperature and the heat flow for mortar specimens during cooling and heating. Phase transformations associated with the freezing/melting of water/ice or transition of the eutectic solution from liquid to solid are included in this model. The lever rule is used to calculate the quantity of solution that undergoes the phase transformation, thereby simulating the energy released/absorbed during phase transformation. During solidification, undercooling phenomenon is considered in the numerical model. Data from experiments performed using a low-temperature longitudinal guarded comparative calorimeter (LGCC) on mortar specimens is compared with results from the numerical model. Two types of experimental data are used for the comparison. First, data from mortar specimens that were fully saturated (i. e., 100 % degree of saturation) using varying concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 23. 3 % concentrations by mass) were considered. Second, in addition to fully saturated specimens containing sodium chloride solution, partially saturated specimens (i. e., partially saturated specimens with water at degrees of saturation equal to 75 %, 85 %, 95 %, and 100 %) are also considered. ^ Next, a numerical model (two-dimensional finite-element model) is developed to describe the mechanical behavior of cementitious systems at early-ages. This development is influenced by the temperature of the surrounding environment. The effect of aggregates is assessed on <b>maturity-based</b> predictions of early-age flexural strength development. This method is based on the concept that the strength (or property) development is proportional to the extent of chemical reaction (i. e., hydration) that has taken place. It is commonly assumed that the extent of chemical reaction (i. e., the degree of hydration) is a unique function of the product of time and temperature. It is the hypothesis of this work that aggregates can alter the relationship between the maturity and the flexural (or tensile) strength. ^ To verify this hypothesis the effective age (i. e., the degree of hydration) derived from Arrhenius function was related to the flexural strength development of paste, mortar, and concrete specimens. A linear response was detected between the flexural strength respect to the extent of the hydration for the paste specimens, while a bi-linear response respect to the extent of the hydration was observed for both the mortar and concrete specimens. The intersection point (knee point) of this bi-linear response corresponds to the critical time at which the major fraction of the aggregates begins to fail. At the very early ages (i. e., less than the critical time), the flexural behavior of the concrete is dominated by the paste or the bond failure. At the later ages, the flexural strength is governed by aggregate failure. ^ Consequently, a thermo-mechanical model will be employed to simulate the freeze-thaw damage in cementitious systems containing salt solutions. Therefore, sufficient knowledge is acquired to better understand the damage mechanism occurring due to the phase change of salt solution absorbed in to the pores of cementitious systems. ...|$|E
