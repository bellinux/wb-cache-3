These skeleton information provides <b>meaningful</b> <b>information</b> that researchers have used to model human activities which are trained and later used to recognize unknown activities.|$|E
25|$|Because Navajo has {{a complex}} grammar, {{it is not}} nearly {{mutually}} intelligible enough with even its closest relatives within the Na-Dene family to provide <b>meaningful</b> <b>information.</b> It was still an unwritten language, and Johnston thought Navajo could satisfy the military requirement for an undecipherable code. Navajo was spoken only on the Navajo lands of the American Southwest. Its syntax and tonal qualities, not to mention dialects, made it unintelligible to anyone without extensive exposure and training. One estimate indicates that at the outbreak of World War II, fewer than 30 non-Navajo could understand the language.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{elimination}} property {{held by the}} lexicographic monomial order, the corresponding Groebner bases display strong structural properties from which <b>meaningful</b> <b>informations</b> can easily be extracted. We study these properties for radical ideals of (co) dimension zero. The proof presented relies on a combinatorial decomposition of the finite set of points whereby iterated Lagrange interpolation formulas permit to reconstruct a minimal Groebner basis. This is the first fully explicit interpolation formula for polynomials forming a lexicographic Groebner basis, from which the structure property can easily be read off. The inductive nature of the proof also yield as a byproduct a triangular decomposition algorithm from the Groebner basis. Comment: Substantial revisions at many places. 23 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
25|$|Experience-induced {{changes in}} {{dendritic}} spine stability {{also point to}} spine turnover as a mechanism involved in the maintenance of long-term memories, though {{it is unclear how}} sensory experience affects neural circuitry. Two general models might describe the impact of experience on structural plasticity. On the one hand, experience and activity may drive the discrete formation of relevant synaptic connections that store <b>meaningful</b> <b>information</b> in order to allow for learning. On the other hand, synaptic connections may be formed in excess, and experience and activity may lead to the pruning of extraneous synaptic connections.|$|E
25|$|According to some {{lines of}} thinking, the ageing process is routed into a basic {{reduction}} of biological complexity, and thus loss of information. In order {{to reverse this}} loss, gerontologist Marios Kyriazis suggested {{that it is necessary}} to increase input of actionable and <b>meaningful</b> <b>information</b> both individually (into individual brains), and collectively (into societal systems). This technique enhances overall biological function through up-regulation of immune, hormonal, antioxidant and other parameters, resulting in improved age-repair mechanisms. Working in parallel with natural evolutionary mechanisms that can facilitate survival through increased fitness, Kyriazis claims that the technique may lead to a reduction of the rate of death as a function of age, i.e. indefinite lifespan.|$|E
25|$|It {{may be that}} non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, {{but that}} they are simply too far apart for {{meaningful}} two-way communication. If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, {{it is possible that}} one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain <b>meaningful</b> <b>information.</b> Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message, which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that archaeological evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{obstacles}} in inferring a protein grammar {{is the size of}} the alphabet that should encode the 20 different amino acids. It has been proposed to address this by using physico-chemical properties of amino acids to reduce significantly the number of possible combinations of right side symbols in production rules: 3 levels of a quantitative property are utilised instead of the 20 amino acid types, e.g. small, medium or large van der Waals volume. Based on such a scheme, PCFGs have been produced to generate both binding site [...] and helix-helix contact site descriptors. A significant feature of those grammars is that analysis of their rules and parse trees can provide biologically <b>meaningful</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Context-dependency {{effects on}} recall are {{typically}} interpreted {{as evidence that}} the characteristics of the environment are encoded as part of the memory trace and can be used to enhance retrieval of the other information in the trace. In other words, you can recall more when the environments are similar in both the learning and recall phases. Context cues appear to be important in the retrieval of newly learned <b>meaningful</b> <b>information.</b> In a classic study by Godden and Baddelley (1975), they demonstrated that deep-sea divers recalled their training more effectively when trained underwater, rather than being trained on land.

Concepts could be applied imperatively or permissively when a Petri (see Petri net) condition for synchronous transfer of <b>meaningful</b> <b>information</b> occurred.

For images of hand-drawn diagrams in E, we present concrete algorithms to retrieve typical geometric objects and geometric relations, as well as their labels, and demonstrate the feasibility of our algorithms with experiments. An example is presented to illustrate how nontrivial geometric theorems can be generated from retrieved geometric objects and relations and thus how implied geometric knowledge may be discovered automatically from images...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{examples}} from auditory perception research {{will be helpful}} in explaining {{the fact that our}} perceptual faculties naturally enhance and supplement our conscious experience. First, there is the [...] "cocktail party phenomenon" [...] (Moray, 1959). When someone is engaged in conversation with a group of people in a noisy room, but then they suddenly hear something or hear their name from across the room, when they were completely inattentive to the input before, that is the cocktail party phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs with words associated with danger and sex. Although people may be inattentive to a portion of their environment, when they hear specific [...] "trigger" [...] words, their auditory capacities are redirected to another dimension of perceptual awareness. This shows that we do process information outside of our immediate conscious experience. Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also enhances and supplements our experience by searching out and extracting <b>meaningful</b> <b>information</b> from our environment.|$|E
