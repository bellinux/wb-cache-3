5|$|After {{withdrawing}} from the battle, Oxford fled to France and participated in piracy of English ships, continuing his campaign against Yorkist reign. He was captured in 1473 after conquering St Michael's <b>Mount,</b> <b>an</b> island off the southwest coast of England. Twelve years later Oxford escaped from prison and joined Henry Tudor's fight against the Yorkists, commanding the Lancastrian army at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.|$|E
5|$|The Special Operations Executive were {{approached}} {{to see if}} its agents could destroy the dock gates. They decided that the mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents to carry them. The Royal Navy was also unable to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> operation, as St Nazaire is 8km (5 miles) up the Loire estuary. Any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range.|$|E

For example, the M-19 can <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> [...] outboard, the M-26-X can <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> [...] outboard and the M-26-M can <b>mount</b> <b>a</b> [...] outboard. With these large engines, the boats are capable of speeds of over 20 kn, and the M-26-M brochure shows {{a picture of the}} boat pulling a waterskier.|$|R

5|$|By October 1906, {{many in the}} U.S. government, {{including}} Secretary of State Elihu Root, {{were worried}} that war could break out in the Pacific between the United States and Japan. However, the Aleutian Islands {{were believed to be}} of little strategic importance to the United States, and were ignored by a number of pre-war strategies formulated by the U.S. armed forces, including the Naval War Board's 1896 plan, which would have brought only a few scout ships to the Islands. In 1911, the Naval War Board considered three options through which Japan could <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> invasion of the United States, one of which involved an attack on the Aleutian Islands. However, this option was discarded by the Board owing to the cold climate of the islands.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas {{administration}} had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|Duran quickly {{allied with}} the United Earth Directorate's expeditionary force, and used UED {{resources}} to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> assassination attempt on Mengsk and provided vital intelligence and strategic advice on the Dominion to DuGalle. Duran convinced DuGalle to destroy the psi disruptor, to Stukov's chagrin, and as the UED closed in on Mengsk and his allies, Duran sabotaged a key operation, allowing the emperor to escape. When Stukov reconstructed the psi disruptor, Duran killed him and revealed his allegiance was actually to Sarah Kerrigan.|$|E

5|$|For long afterwards, Grant and Buell quarreled over Grant's {{decision}} not to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> immediate pursuit with another hour of daylight remaining. Grant cited the exhaustion of his troops, although the Confederates were certainly just as exhausted. Part of Grant's reluctance to act {{could have been the}} unusual command relationship he had with Buell. Although Grant was the senior officer and technically was in command of both armies, Buell made it quite clear throughout the two days that he was acting independently.|$|E
5|$|French and Wabanaki Confederacy raiding {{activity}} {{continued in}} northern Massachusetts in 1705, {{against which the}} English colonists were unable to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> effective defense. The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the raiding while the French and English leaders negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. Raids by Indians persisted {{until the end of}} the war, sometimes with French participation.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 French agents {{reported}} that the Germans were planning to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk {{in the ground and}} served by rail links. The first signs of abnormal activity at Mimoyecques were spotted by analysts at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit in September 1943, when aerial reconnaissance revealed that the Germans were building railway loops leading to the tunnels into the eastern and western sites. Further reconnaissance flights in October 1943 photographed large-scale activity around the tunnels.|$|E

5|$|In late February, ground sensors {{detected}} the 66th Regiment, 304th NVA Division preparing to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> {{attack on the}} positions of the 37th ARVN Ranger Battalion on the eastern perimeter. On the night of 28 February the Combat Base unleashed artillery and airstrikes on possible North Vietnamese staging areas and routes of advance. At 21:30, the attack came on, but it was stifled by the small arms of the Rangers, who were supported by thousands of artillery rounds and air strikes. Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the North Vietnamese finally withdrew. NVA, however, was not through with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during the month of March.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June a patrol—designated Operation Faun Fare—consisting of 7 Platoon, C Company under Lieutenant Robert Guest, {{accompanied}} the company commander Major Ivor Hodgkinson, the Intelligence Officer and a fire control party, {{left the company}} base at Serikin to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> ambush on the Sungei Koemba river. The site of the ambush {{was to be a}} little further downstream from the successful action the previous month, being more towards the Indonesian positions at Siding. The Australian patrol occupied its intended ambush position early the next morning and proceeded to wait. During the day two boats occupied by civilians were observed and allowed to pass unhindered, as were three more the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{had already}} decided to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> {{invasion}} of southern France (Dragoon), which occurred in August 1944. Vendetta's story was agreed {{in the first week}} of May and deception work started on 9 May. Its aim was to detain German forces in Southern France for up to twenty five days following the Normandy landings. The plan threatened a landing near Sete (chosen for its distance from the Dragoon landing site) by the US Seventh Army, consisting of fictional divisions, and some French units. Vendetta was supported by a diplomatic deception, Operation Royal Flush, which requested support from the Spanish government to allow injured soldiers to be evacuated following an invasion.|$|E

5|$|The Sedan bridgeheads {{were still}} not safe. French forces were massing to the south. Guderian {{decided it was}} better to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> {{aggressive}} defence given the lack of any suitable anti-tank weapons for a defensive battle. The better option would be to attack rather than defend. The advance of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions had assisted his progress. They ran into and defeated elements of X Corps near Chemery. The French Corps was heading towards Sedan, but withdrew southward after the engagement. Any potential threat on the German western flank had been removed.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Garcian {{arrives at}} Battleship Island in Japan {{to destroy the}} last Heaven Smile. He meets with Matsuken, who {{presents}} Garcian with a choice: let him live, which allows Japan to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> assault on the US; or kill him, which lets the US discover Japan's role in rigging American elections—US forces destroy Japan's last stronghold, Battleship Island, in retaliation and wipe Japan off the map. Regardless of the player's choice, Garcian finds that the last Heaven Smile is Iwazaru, whose real identity is Kun Lan, and kills him. However, Harman and Kun Lan are revealed to be immortal beings, representing a dialectic struggle between opposites, which persists a century in the future in Shanghai as they continue their eternal battle.|$|E
5|$|After obtaining {{permission}} from the Mexican government to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> expedition into Indian territory {{to search for the}} legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six miles (10km) from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large raiding party of Indians—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and Waco, plus another 40 Caddo. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie and his group fought for their lives for the next 13hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded. In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Allied landings, Morotai was defended by {{approximately}} 500 Japanese soldiers. The main unit was the 2nd Provisional Raiding Unit, which had gradually arrived on the island between 12–19 July 1944, to replace the 32nd Division's battalions when they were withdrawn. The 2nd Provisional Raiding Unit comprised four companies and was manned by Japanese officers and Formosan soldiers. Small elements of several other infantry, military police and support units were also present on the island. The 2nd Provisional Raiding Unit's commander, Major Takenobu Kawashima, deployed the unit in the south-west sector of the island and used the smaller units to establish lookout posts and detachments around Morotai's coastline. The largest of these outposts was on the island's north-east end at Cape Sopi, which consisted of about 100 men. The Japanese force was too small and widely dispersed to be able to <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> effective defense, so the 32nd Division ordered it to build dummy camps and use other deceptions in an attempt to trick the Allies into thinking that Morotai was strongly held.|$|E
5|$|Buckner {{was given}} a medical leave of absence {{following}} Chickamauga, returning to Virginia, where he engaged in routine work while recovering his strength. His division was sent without him to support Longstreet in the Knoxville Campaign, while the remainder of Bragg's army was defeated in the Chattanooga Campaign. Buckner served on the court martial of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws after that subordinate of Longstreet's was charged with poor performance at Knoxville. Buckner was briefly given command of Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division in February 1864, and on March 8, he was given command of the reestablished Department of East Tennessee. The department was a shell of its former self—less than one-third its original size, badly equipped, and {{in no position to}} <b>mount</b> <b>an</b> offensive. Buckner was virtually useless to the Confederacy here, and on April 28, he was ordered to join Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|In his ensuing adventures, Cyan grows {{close to}} the Free Collars, yet still longs for Kokoro.

Convinced that Siam must be destroyed, Cyan confronts her and learns she was once a Free Collar until her brother, Puriam, was chased onto a road by humans and killed by a bus. Cyan is able to defeat her, and, reminded of Puriam, Siam silently wishes him farewell. Soon after, Cyan learns that Kokoro had recovered but is moving away. Saddened {{by the thought of}} leaving the Free Collars, he meets Kokoro at the train station and gives him his torn collar as a memento. Kokoro promises to visit Cyan, and Cyan returns to his new friends.|$|E
