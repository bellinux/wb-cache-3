Protests against the Vietnam War were rare and sparsely attended; however, in 1970 a tense disagreement between students regarding whether or not to lower the American flag on campus to half-mast in memory of those killed in the Kent State shootings resulted in a compromise in which a makeshift flagpole was erected by a group of liberal students so they could fly the flag at half-staff while a group of conservative students kept the flag on the <b>main</b> <b>pole</b> flying at full-staff.|$|E

30|$|The {{recorder}} picture {{shows that}} the fault current existed for 78  ms, and the time delay between the <b>main</b> <b>pole</b> and auxiliary contact was more than 36  ms. During this period, when the breaker’s <b>main</b> <b>pole</b> was “ON”, and the fault current detected by the relay was 0.77  A, which was greater than the setting value (0.1  A). Thus, the condition in logic scheme (see Fig.  2) that the current of any phase is greater than setting was considered true. Another condition indicates that the breaker position is “OFF” was also considered to be correct because the breaker position was detected by protection device as “OFF” during the time delay between the <b>main</b> <b>pole</b> and the auxiliary contact.

The combined bamboos with main bamboo are called “Yokotake”. The number of lanterns are suspended from each Yokotake. The bamboo added to lengthen Oyatake to extend the height of Kanto during a performance is called “Tsugidake”.|$|R

40|$|We present phase-resolved {{spectrophotometric}} {{observations of}} VV Puppis obtained during two different states of accretion. We confirm {{the detection of}} cyclotron lines from emission regions at both poles (Wickramasinghe et al. 1989) having significantly different field strength of B 1 ≃ 31 MG and B 2 ≃ 54 MG. Our phase-resolved data allowed the detection of phase-dependent wavelength shifts of the cyclotron lines from the main accretion pole {{which is due to}} the varying aspect of the observer. A corresponding motion of the cyclotron lines from the secondary pole appears likely. Compared to 1984, the cyclotron lines from the <b>main</b> <b>pole</b> appeared redshifted in 1989, during an episode of higher system brightness. This shift can be explained assuming either different locations of the accretion spot and, hence, variations of the magnetic field, or variations of the plasma temperature both triggered by variations of the mass accretion rate. The cyclotron lines from the second pole do not show such changes suggesting that the coupling region for the weakly accreting pole is more or less stationary whereas the coupling region of the <b>main</b> <b>pole</b> varies in space, most likely depending on the mass accretion rate.
