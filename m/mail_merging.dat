50|$|A more {{advanced}} version, which {{was able to}} handle <b>mail</b> <b>merges,</b> launched in October 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Pages used {{to feature}} {{a number of}} other {{advanced}} writing tools. Many of these have been stripped out of the current version. The [...] "Full Screen" [...] mode (introduced in Mac OS X Lion) hides the menubar and toolbars, allowing users to focus on a single document without being distracted by other windows on the screen. Earlier versions featured <b>mail</b> <b>merge,</b> which automatically populated custom fields with contact data from Address Book or from Numbers to create personalized documents. For example, if a user wanted to send one letter to three different people, <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> allowed him to create a single document with placeholder fields that were populated when printing. The <b>Mail</b> <b>Merge</b> feature was completely removed in version 5. Tables and charts pasted from Numbers are automatically updated if the original spreadsheet is changed.|$|R
50|$|Add-on {{products}} included TasMerge for <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> functionality (which {{was later}} included in Tasword III and later versions) and TasSpell for spell checker.|$|R
50|$|Along with {{conversion}} to almost all popular document formats, Aspose.Words product family supports documents rendering, printing, reporting, <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> and advanced formatting for any document elements using document object model.|$|R
50|$|The {{ease of use}} {{of tools}} like <b>Mail</b> <b>Merge</b> (combine form {{documents}} with data from any data source), 'Print as booklet', and tables (with spreadsheet capabilities and possibility to generate graphs) are also notable.|$|R
50|$|Current also {{supported}} Microsofts Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). A usable file import-export capability was included. The system could do outlines, <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> {{from its own}} addresses, and allowed the user to change colors of display elements.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>merge</b> is {{a process}} to create personalised letters and pre-addressed {{envelopes}} or mailing labels for mass mailings from a form letter. The feature is usually employed in a word processing document which contains fixed text (which is the same in each output document) and variables (which act as placeholders that are replaced by text from the data source). The feature dates back to early word processors on personal computers, circa 1980. WordStar was perhaps the earliest to provide this, originally via an ancillary program called <b>Mail</b> <b>merge.</b> WordPerfect also offered this capacity for CP/M and MS-DOS systems, and Microsoft Word added it later on.|$|R
50|$|Four add-on {{utilities}} were included: LocoSpell (a spell checker), LocoMail (a <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> program), LocoFile (a database program), and a Printer Support Pack, but (unlike in {{the earlier}} Locoscript versions) these utilities were no longer sold separately.|$|R
50|$|Besides basic word {{processing}} functionality, Pages includes templates designed by Apple to allow users to create {{various types of}} documents, including newsletters, invitations, stationery, and résumés, along {{with a number of}} education-themed templates for students and teachers, such as reports and outlines. Pages 5, a complete redesign, removed more than 100of the features of Pages 4.x, including bookmarks, <b>mail</b> <b>merge,</b> linked text boxes, multiple section capability, ability to set default zoom. It has been slowly adding some back in subsequent 5.x releases (default zoom, for example, can now be set, but still no linked text boxes, multiple select, <b>mail</b> <b>merge,</b> book marks, and more than 90 other features that were present in version 4.3).|$|R
40|$|The Main Document is {{the generic}} Word {{document}} {{that will serve}} as a template for your customized merged documents. It contains everything that will stay the same for each instance of the merge. In Word, open the file you are using for your merge, or create a new, blank document if you are starting from scratch. On the Mailings tab in the Start <b>Mail</b> <b>Merge</b> group click Start <b>Mail</b> <b>Merge.</b> Choose the type of document you are merging (letter, directory, etc.). 2. Open your Data Source Your data source is the table of individual records that will be used to customize your merge. Your data source could be an Excel spreadsheet, a table in Word or Access, or even a comma separated text list...|$|R
50|$|Simple {{examples}} include printf format strings, {{found in many}} programming languages, and snippets, found {{in a number of}} text editors and source code editors. In word processors, templates are a common feature, while automatic filling in of the templates {{is often referred to as}} <b>mail</b> <b>merge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although form {{letters are}} {{generally}} intended {{for a wide}} audience, many form letters include stylistic elements or features intended to appear specifically tailored to the recipient—for example, they might be signed by autopen and use features such as <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> to automatically insert the names of individual recipients.|$|R
50|$|According to the vendor, LocoScript 4 added a {{wider range}} of fonts, support for colour printing, a label-printing facility, and (with the {{optional}} Printer Support Pack) supported hundreds of printers (excluding those that required Microsoft Windows). Version 4 also supported the <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> program, LocoMail, and the LocoFile database program.|$|R
50|$|The {{data source}} is {{typically}} a spreadsheet or a database {{which has a}} field or column for each variable in the template. When the <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> process is run, the word processing system creates an output document for each row in the database, using the fixed text exactly as it appears.|$|R
50|$|VBA code {{written in}} Microsoft Access can {{establish}} {{references to the}} Excel, Word and Outlook libraries; this will allow creating an application that runs a query in Access, exports the results to Excel, formats the text, then writes a <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> document in Word that it automatically e-mails to {{each member of the}} original query through Outlook.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{a web-based}} service where a user can upload a {{document}} and a corresponding mailing list. The document {{can be sent to}} everyone on the mailing list. The web service currently only handles bulk mailing (where every letter is identical apart from the address), not true <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> (where every letter is customised for each recipient).|$|R
50|$|Child pages {{use those}} ContentPlaceHolder {{controls}}, {{which must be}} mapped to the place-holder of the master page that the content page is populating. The rest of the page {{is defined by the}} shared parts of the master page, much like a <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> in a word processor. All markup and server controls in the content page must be placed within the ContentPlaceHolder control.|$|R
50|$|Word Online lacks two ribbons {{that exist}} in Word 2013: References and Mailings. Mailing allows users to print {{envelopes}} and labels, and manage <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> printing of Word documents. References contains features needed for more advanced documents e.g. table of contents, citations and bibliography, captions, index, and table of authorities. Word Online cannot change the orientation of a document or insert section breaks.|$|R
50|$|In an age before PCs, when typing {{was still}} done {{primarily}} only by clerical staff, the OS/6 {{was intended for}} what IBM envisioned as centralized word processing centers at large organizations. It included features like <b>mail</b> <b>merge,</b> very high print quality with lots of formatting options and printers that could feed envelopes or sheets from two drawers, usually referred to within IBM as letterhead and second sheet.|$|R
50|$|It {{included}} all the basic features common to most word processors of the day, including automatic word wrapping, spell checking, copy and paste, underlining, and boldfacing; {{and it also}} boasted {{a few of the}} most-commonly-used advanced features, such as <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> and few others. The product was considerably easier to both learn and use than its far more fully featured and expensive DOS word processing competitors, WordPerfect, Microsoft Word and XyWrite.|$|R
40|$|Note: I {{hesitate}} somewhat {{to propose}} this session {{due to the}} general disdain that many feel toward word processors, so you should feel free to reject it or accept it {{if you need to}} fill out the program or find it particularly interesting. Confronted with the task of producing a large appendix to a report that involved a page of tables and 3 graphs for each of 186 panels, the author discovered an approach to automate this process using Stata combined with the <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> facilities of a word processor. A Stata do file produces all 558 graphs and writes an ascii file of data that also includes the graph file names for each panel. A one page <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> document is set up in the word processor and the Stata output is used as the data source to automatically create the entire 186 page appendix with all tables and graphs placed as desired. This session will outline how to employ this approach for such otherwise daunting tasks. ...|$|R
50|$|In one methodology, {{a static}} {{document}} is loaded into printer memory. The printer is instructed, through the print driver or Raster Image Processor (RIP) to always print the static document when sending any page {{out to the}} printer driver or RIP. Variable data can then be printed {{on top of the}} static document. This methodology is the simplest way to execute VDP, however its capability is less than that of a typical <b>mail</b> <b>merge.</b>|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} Protext is its programmability. A <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> {{programming}} language allows {{the user to}} input data from a text file or Prodata database. This is achieved by 'Stored commands' within {{the body of the}} text, an idea borrowed from the 'dot commands' of WordStar. Stored commands are similarly used to control formatting and layout of the text for printing. A preview mode showed the formatted layout but Protext did not display the fonts on screen.|$|R
25|$|Word {{processing}} {{added to}} the text editor {{the ability to control}} type style and size, to manage lines (word wrap), to format documents into pages, and to number pages. Functions now taken for granted were added incrementally, sometimes by purchase of independent providers of add-on programs. Spell checking, grammar checking and <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> were {{some of the most popular}} add-ons for early word processors. Word processors are also capable of hyphenation, and the management and correct positioning of footnotes and endnotes.|$|R
50|$|The PCW 9512, {{introduced}} in 1987 {{at a price}} of £499 plus VAT, had a white-on-black screen instead of green-on-black, and the bundled printer was a daisy-wheel model instead of a dot-matrix printer. These models also had a parallel port, allowing non-Amstrad printers to be attached. The 9512 was also supplied with version 2 of the Locoscript word processor program which included spellchecker and <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> facilities. In all other respects the 9512's facilities {{were the same as}} the 8512's.|$|R
50|$|Several {{newspapers}} were published weekly in Bundaberg between 1880 and 1900, with two tri-weeklies, The Star and The Mail settling {{the market in}} the early 20th century. A third newspaper, the Daily News, was launched in 1907 amid local political rivalries. In 1908, the Bundaberg Star was incorporated with the Bundaberg Daily News and, in 1925, the Bundaberg Daily News and The <b>Mail</b> <b>merged</b> to become the Bundaberg News and Mail. In 1942, the abbreviated NewsMail masthead replaced the original name.|$|R
