PhDr. Martina Šmejkalová, Ph. D. ABSTRACT: The thesis deals with {{teaching}} of syntax in language education at lower secondary schools between the years 1918 − 1939. It verifies {{to what extent}} the education was affected by social, pedagogical, didactic and linguistic factors. It analyzes the presentation of syntax in contemporary prescriptive grammar books, monitors how much syntax was implemented in the contemporary curriculum for lower secondary schools and it also focuses on the syntactic topics presented by <b>methodological</b> <b>manuals</b> for students of teaching and teachers. In particular, this thesis examines how the authors of the Czech Language textbooks, for lower secondary school pupils, presented the syntactic topics. The surveys have shown that syntax was, in this period, the focus of attention of: linguists, educationalists and methodists. Syntax {{was an integral part of}} language teaching and was properly presented in their textbooks. The surveys have shown that we can use many parts of these textbooks as high-quality sources of inspiration.

On the basis of <b>methodological</b> <b>manuals</b> the directives, for construction of multiple-choice questions are formulated as follows: 1. the scopes of particular alternatives should not overlap; 2. the list of alternatives should be exhaustive; 3. all alternatives should be formulated at the same generality level; 4. the alternatives should be presented in a certain order. However, all the problems connected with the construction and application of multiple-choice questions have not been, so far, solved satisfactorily. Doubts and reservations may arise in connection with some problems, as follows: 1. the list of alternatives may be a source of bias; 2. the task may be a source of bias; 3. the item “other - specify” may not fulfill its function; 4. the length of the list of alternatives may be excessive and the way of its presentation may cause difficulties.

40|$|Background: Due {{to lack of}} data, {{assessments}} {{often include}} modelling or simulation techniques in order to analyse long-term effects. This, in turn requires increasing cooperation of experts from different fields of science such as HTA, statistics, data management, modelling & simulation as well as visualisation. A common understanding on contents, methodology and terminology needs to be developed. In Austria, such a common understanding has hardy been elaborated in a systematic way so far. Aims of project: It is the main aim of the IFEDH project to support evidence based decision making in health care by a service tool which helps profiting from existing potentials in HTA, modelling, simulation, statistics and data analysis. AP’s 1. 2 focus is on quality standards of the discipline in general and on the evaluation of vaccination programmes in particular. The aim is to publish an English review. Research objectives: AP 1. 2 : What are general principles of standardised work in HTA? Which standards exist to examine data validity in primary studies? Which standards exist to examine data validity in systematic reviews? Which standards exist to examine economic studies? Which standards in HTA-manuals exist to examine modelling? Which standards explicitly refer on evaluating vaccination programmes? Which are the limitations that HTA is subject to, regardless of quality standards? Methods: AP 1. 2 & AP 2. 1 : Hand search based on <b>methodological</b> <b>manuals</b> of leading international institutions as well as hand search in other relevant literature.

40|$|Purpose. To {{study the}} {{efficiency}} of replacing the preparation of sturgeon hypophyses, which is traditional for sturgeon culture but scarce and expensive, with its carp analogue {{as well as with}} preparations, which induce own gonadotrophic function of brood sterlet hypophysis when producing offspring in aquaculture conditions. Methodology. The research was performed in the framework of the NULES research theme for 2013 – 2015, in the conditions of the Fishery Academic, Research and Production Laboratory of the Aquaculture Department (hatching room and fish culture facility with closed water supply in Nemishaev, Borodianka district, Kyiv region). The control in the experiment on a comparative evaluation of {{the efficiency of}} different spawning inducers for artificially reproduced sterlet was Reproginol (powder of acetoned sturgeon hypophysis in 50 mg capsules). The experimental variant 1 included acetoned hypophyses of Prussian carp and common carp (no older than a year and half since their collection). The experimental variant 2 is experimental synthetic fish spawning inducer Vadilen- 2 (the developer of the preparation is Kovalenko V. O., assistant professor of the Aquaculture Department of the NULES of Ukraine). Collection and processing of experiment data were performed using conventional aquaculture research methods. Findings. It was found that Vadilen- 2 produced inducing effect on the gonadotrophic function of sterlet hypophysis and transition from the 4 th to the 5 th stage of maturation. The effective doses of Vadilen- 2 with water temperature of 13 – 15 °C for sterlet females and males were 0. 8 – 1. 0 and 0. 5 – 0. 6 mg per 1 kg of brood fish, respectively. We observed that sterlet females, which were kept in basins of the recirculated water facility, showed worse results during incubation period when they missed winter period compared to fish, which were kept in the water with natural temperature in the winter. The possibility of replacing the preparation of sturgeon hypophysis with its carp analogue when artificially reproducing sterlet and the advisability of using tannin as a substance for eliminating egg adhesiveness has been justified. Originality. For the first time in Ukraine, a comparative evaluation of using preparations of different origins as well as the nature of the stimulating effect on induction spawning condition in artificially reproduced sterlet was performed and its efficiency was proven. Practical value. The obtained results are recommended to be implemented at enterprises of sturgeon aquaculture. The materials can also be used when writing academic and <b>methodological</b> <b>manuals</b> for training aquaculture specialists at the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine in the specialties of “Water biological resources and aquaculture” and “Water bioresources” (specialization “Sturgeon culture”) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{motivation}} for this thesis {{work is the}} need for improving reliability of equipment and quality of service to railway passengers as well as a requirement for cost-effective and efficient condition maintenance management for rail transportation. This thesis work develops a fusion of various machine vision analysis methods to achieve high performance in automation of wooden rail track inspection. The condition monitoring in rail transport is done manually by a human operator where people rely on inference systems and assumptions to develop conclusions. The use of conditional monitoring allows maintenance to be scheduled, or other actions to be taken to avoid the consequences of failure, before the failure occurs. Manual or automated condition monitoring of materials in fields of public transportation like railway, aerial navigation, traffic safety, etc, where safety is of prior importance needs non-destructive testing (NDT). In general, wooden railway sleeper inspection is done manually by a human operator, by moving along the rail sleeper and gathering information by visual and sound analysis for examining the presence of cracks. Human inspectors working on lines visually inspect wooden rails to judge the quality of rail sleeper. In this project work the machine vision system is developed based on the manual visual analysis system, which uses digital cameras and image processing software to perform similar manual inspections. As the manual inspection requires much effort and is expected to be error prone sometimes and also appears difficult to discriminate even for a human operator by the frequent changes in inspected material. The machine vision system developed classifies the condition of material by examining individual pixels of images, processing them and attempting to develop conclusions with the assistance of knowledge bases and features. A pattern recognition approach is developed based on the <b>methodological</b> knowledge from <b>manual</b> procedure. The pattern recognition approach for this thesis work was developed and achieved by a non destructive testing method to identify the flaws in manually done condition monitoring of sleepers. In this method, a test vehicle is designed to capture sleeper images similar to visual inspection by human operator and the raw data for pattern recognition approach is provided from the captured images of the wooden sleepers. The data from the NDT method were further processed and appropriate features were extracted. The collection of data by the NDT method is to achieve high accuracy in reliable classification results. A key idea is to use the non supervised classifier based on the features extracted from the method to discriminate the condition of wooden sleepers in to either good or bad. Self organising map is used as classifier for the wooden sleeper classification. In order to achieve greater integration, the data collected by the machine vision system was made to interface with one another by a strategy called fusion. Data fusion was looked in at two different levels namely sensor-level fusion, feature- level fusion. As the goal was to reduce the accuracy of the human error on the rail sleeper classification as good or bad the results obtained by the feature-level fusion compared to that of the results of actual classification were satisfactory...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{activities}} conducted by state fire supervision authorities is {{the investigation of the}} cause of fires (ZPP) and one of its areas is explosions. These cases are requiring investigators to have very specific knowledge. The intention of the MV-GŘ HZS ČR is to create updated methodological material for ZPP, which will include a section devoted to the investigation of explosions. A major source of information for the creation of this material was the American guide NFPA 921. My goal was to collect Czech and foreign material dealing with different aspects of explosions, to compare this information with the content of NFPA 921 and determine the usability of these sources for the planned <b>methodological</b> <b>manual.</b> The research question was whether current conditions for ZPP and its procedures are adequate for HZS ČR investigators in the case of explosions. I also processed data on explosions using the Incident Statistics/Response Reports (SSU/ZOZ) program. Processed data created a picture of the development of these cases in ČR. The following findings emerged from that process: the number of cases has continued to increase and the dominant area where explosions occur in, is housing. In all areas the dominant cause is human negligence. The most frequent types of explosions are gas explosions. Explosions of flammable liquid vapour dominate the number of deaths as a direct consequence. When comparing the information in Czech material with NFPA 921, discrepancies were found in the values of the properties in the tables. With the modification the information in NFPA 921 is usable for the Czech manual. When confronted with statistical outputs, the shortcomings of the topics in NFPA 921 emerge. The investigative procedures are focus largely on explosions of considerable scope. These cases form a tiny percentage in ČR and their application is limited. There is a lack of concrete information on their most common causes. Thus NFPA 921, together with Czech material, is primarily of use as a general overview. In view of these facts, I have concluded that the information base and conditions required for ZPP are not adequate for HZS ČR investigators. The text presented in the results section of this work is designed to fill this gap of ZPP and can be used {{as the basis for the}} creation of the planned <b>methodological</b> <b>manual...</b>|$|E
40|$|Topic: Organizational {{issues of}} a public mass {{marathon}} in cross-country skiing Goals of thesis: The aim of this thesis is to identify all the difficulties with planning, implementation and evaluation of public mass marathon in cross-country skiing. Further this work should give a example and <b>methodological</b> <b>manual</b> for organization of public mass marathon. This thesis is valid for Czech Republic. Method: The solution results from analysis of documents dealing with the issue. Another source of information is based on long term organizational experience of LK Slovan Karlovy Vary with organizing public mass marathon. Results: The main goal was achieved by creating detailed instructions for organization of mass race. The main contribution of this thesis is to provide the guidelines for organizers beginners of public mass marathon. The work {{is divided into two}} parts. The theoretical part describe history of mass-races in cross country skiing at home and abroad. There is also set of rules for mass races and theoretically described process of organizing sport's events in terms of economics, marketing and management. The practical part describes the preparatory phase, implementation phase and final completion of the race. Keywords: Cross-country skiing, race organisation, sport event, methodical manua...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{article is}} a <b>methodological</b> <b>manual</b> {{for those who are}} {{interested}} in chaotic dynamics. An exposition is given on the foundations of the theory of deterministic chaos that originates in classical mechanics systems. Fundamental results obtained in this area are presented, such as elements of the theory of non-linear resonance and the Kolmogorov –Arnol’d –Moser theory, the Poincare ́ – Birkhoff fixed-point theorem, and theMel’nikov method. Particular attention is given to the analysis of the phenomena underlying the self-similarity and nature of chaos: splitting of separatrices and homoclinic and heteroclinic tan-gles. Important properties of chaotic systems — unpredictabil-ity, irreversibility, and decay of temporal correlations — are described. Models of classical statistical mechanics with chao-tic properties, which have become popular in recent years — billiards with oscillating boundaries — are considered. It is shown that if a billiard has the property of well-developed chaos, then perturbations of its boundaries result in Fermi acceleration. But in nearly-integrable billiard systems, excita-tions of the boundaries lead to a new phenomenon in the en-semble of particles, separation of particles in accordance their velocities. If the initial velocity of the particles exceeds a certain critical value characteristic of the given billiard geometry, the particles accelerate; otherwise, they decelerate. 1...|$|E
40|$|The present {{guidelines}} were initially addressed to all TERRE Project Partners, {{to explain the}} capacity building and participation programme within TERRE framework and activities (contained in Work Package 5), both theoretically and practically. The guidelines have been revised {{to respond to the}} general goal of structuring participation and capacity building within a process of elaboration of local sustainable development through Renewable Energy Sources, as for the TERRE project main goal. The guidelines constitute a <b>methodological</b> <b>manual</b> to design activities of participation and capacity building, initially tailored to support each TERRE partner to achieve the project goals and objectives for their case study areas, under a common framework and understanding of the general objective of sustainable local development. The guidelines can be considered as a plot, which can be tailored on project-based and context-based process to be implemented in other case study areas under different hypothesis, goals and conditions. They can {{to be used as a}} general methodological proposal for similar activities in the same field or in other fields, considering the general organization of activities and contents. Moreover, they can be use as a plot for single activities, with respect to specific contents, tools and instruments developed within TERRE and applicable independently. In fact, the annexes of the present guidelines collect documents and formats used by partners for each activity during the different phases of the capacity building and participation process...|$|E
