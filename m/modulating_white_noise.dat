Individuals with developmental dyslexia have difficulty in the accurate neural representation of phonological aspects of speech, across languages. Recently, it was proposed that these difficulties might arise in part because of impaired phase locking to the slower modulations in the speech signal (< 10 Hz), which would affect syllabic parsing and segmentation of the speech stream (the “temporal sampling” hypothesis, Goswami, 2011). Here we measured MEG responses to different rates of amplitude <b>modulated</b> <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> in adults with and without dyslexia. In line with the temporal sampling hypothesis, different patterns of phase locking to amplitude modulation at the delta rate of 2 Hz were found when comparing participants with dyslexia to typically-reading participants.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a simplified state-variable method to solve for the nonstationary response of linear MDOF systems {{subjected to a}} modulated stationary excitation in both time and frequency domains. The resulting covariance matrix and evolutionary spectral density matrix of the response may be expressed {{as a product of}} a constant system matrix and a time-dependent matrix, the latter can be explicitly evaluated for most envelopes currently prevailing in engineering. The stationary correlation matrix of the response may be found by taking the limit of the covariance response when a unit step envelope is used. The reliability analysis can then be performed based on the first two moments of the response obtained. The method presented facilitates obtaining explicit solutions for general linear MDOF systems and is flexible enough to be applied to different stochastic models of excitation such as the stationary models, modulated stationary models, filtered stationary models, and filtered modulated stationary models and their stochastic equivalents including the random pulse train model, filtered shot noise, and some ARMA models in earthquake engineering. This approach may also be readily incorporated into finite element codes for random vibration analysis of linear structures. A set of explicit solutions for the response of simple linear structures subjected to <b>modulated</b> <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> earthquake models with four different envelopes are presented as illustration. In addition, the method has been applied to three selected topics of interest in earthquake engineering, namely, nonstationary analysis of primary-secondary systems with classical or nonclassical dampings, soil layer response and related structural reliability analysis, and the effect of the vertical components on seismic performance of structures. For all the three cases, explicit solutions are obtained, dynamic characteristics of structures are investigated, and some suggestions are given for aseismic design of structures. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Optimal {{stimulation}} {{theory and}} moderate brain arousal (MBA) model hypothesize that extra-task stimulation (e. g. <b>white</b> <b>noise)</b> could improve cognitive functions {{of children with}} attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We investigate benefits of <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> on attention and inhibition in children with and without ADHD (7 - 12 years old), both at behavioral and at neurophysiological levels. Methods: Thirty children with and without ADHD performed a visual cued Go/Nogo task in two conditions (<b>white</b> <b>noise</b> or no-noise exposure), in which behavioral and P 300 (mean amplitudes) data were analyzed. Spontaneous eye-blink rates were also recorded and participants went through neuropsychological assessment. Two separate analyses were conducted with each child separately assigned into two groups (1) ADHD or typically developing children (TDC), and (2) noise beneficiaries or non-beneficiaries according to the observed performance during the experiment. This latest categorization, based on a new index we called "Noise Benefits Index" (NBI), was proposed to determine a neuropsychological profile positively sensitive to noise. Results: Noise exposure reduced omission rate in children with ADHD, who were no longer different from TDC. Eye-blink rate was higher in children with ADHD but was not <b>modulated</b> by <b>white</b> <b>noise.</b> NBI indicated {{a significant relationship between}} ADHD and noise benefit. Strong correlations were observed between noise benefit and neuropsychological weaknesses in vigilance and inhibition. Participants who benefited from noise had an increased Go P 300 in the noise condition.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the nature}} of {{hysteretic}} response behavior of structures subjected to strong seismic excitation, is examined. The earthquake ground motion is modeled as a stochastic process and the dependence of the response on system and excitation parameters, is examined. Consideration {{is given to the}} drift of structural systems and its dependence on the low frequency content of the earthquake spectrum. It is shown that commonly used stochastic excitation models, are not able to accurately represent the low frequency content of the excitation. For this reason, a stochastic model obtained by filtering a <b>modulated</b> <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> signal through a second order linear filter is used in this thesis. A new approach is followed in the analysis of the elasto-plastic system. The problem is formulated in terms of the drift, defined as the sum of yield increments associated with inelastic response. The solution scheme is based on the properties of discrete Markov proms models of the yield increment process, while the yield increment statistics are expressed in terms of the probability density of the velocity and elastic component of the displacent response. Using this approach, an approximate exponential and Rayleigh distribution for the yield increment and yield duration, respectively, are established. It is suggested that, for duration of stationary seismic excitation of practical significance, the drift can be considered as Brownian motion. Based on this observation, the approximate Gaussian distribution and the linearly divergent mean square value of the process, as well as an expression for the probability distribution of the peak drift response, are obtained. The validation of these properties is done by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study of the random response of an elasto-plastic system. Based on this analysis, the first order probability density and first passage probabilities for the drift are calculated from the probability density of the velocity and elastic component of the response, approximately obtained by generalized equivalent linearization. It is shown that the drift response statistics are strongly dependent on the normalized characteristic frequency and strength of the excitation, while a weaker dependence on the bandwidth of excitation is noted...|$|R

This point is the solution of a constrained optimization problem, which requires calculating the response and its gradient with respect to random variables for several times. Due to {{the large number of}} standard normal random variables in stochastic dynamic, this gradient computation should be done by direct differentiation method (DDM) algorithm. Thus to apply TELM to different material models DDM algorithm for those models should be developed. In a recent work the authors have developed bi-axial Bouc–Wen DDM computation for use in TELM (Raoofi and Ghafory-Ashtiany 2013 a). TELS and the statistics of the response for a 3 D structure with rigid diaphragm supported by four columns with bi-axial Bouc–Wen material subjected to independent <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> and <b>modulated</b> filtered <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> along the structural axes have been obtained, and showed good agreement in comparison with simulation results.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides the}} foundation for an in-depth understanding and significant development of the tail-equivalent linearization method (TELM) to solve different classes of nonlinear random vibration problems. The TELM is a linearization method that uses the first-order reliability method (FORM) to define a tail-equivalent linear system (TELS) and to estimate {{the tail of the}} response distribution for nonlinear systems under stochastic inputs. The method was originally developed in the time domain for inelastic systems. It was later extended in the frequency domain for a specific class of nonlinear excitations, while the frequency domain version for inelastic systems is covered in the present work. This dissertation mathematically formalizes and extends TELM analysis with different types of discretization of the input process. A general formulation for discrete representation of a Gaussian band-limited, white-noise process is introduced, which employs the sum of deterministic and orthogonal basis functions weighted by random coefficients. The selection of the basis functions completely defines the two types of discretizations used in the earlier works. Specifically, a train of equally spaced time delta-Dirac functions leads to the current time-domain discretization, while harmonic functions with equally spaced frequencies lead to the current frequency-domain discretization. We show that other types of orthogonal basis functions can be used with advantage to represent a Gaussian band-limited <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> and in particular we employ sinc basis functions, which are {{at the base of the}} Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula. We demonstrate that this representation is suitable for reducing the total number of random variables that are necessary to describe the process, since it decouples the computational-time discretization from the band-limit of the process. Next, the dissertation tackles the problem of a nonlinear system subjected to multi-component excitations by defining an augmented standard normal space composed of all the random variables that define the multiple components of the excitation. The tail-equivalent linearization and definition of the TELS is taken in this new space. Once the augmented TELS is defined, response statistics of interest are determined by linear random vibration analysis by superposition of responses due to each component of the excitation. The method is numerically examined for an asymmetric structure with varying eccentricity and subjected to two statistically independent components of excitation. Several practical problems require analysis for non-stationary excitations. For this important class of problems the original TELM requires linearization for a series of points in time to study the evolution of response statistics. This procedure turns out to be computationally onerous. As an approximate alternative, we propose the evolutionary TELM, ETELM. In particular, we adopt the concepts of the evolutionary process theory, to define an evolutionary TELS, ETELS. The ETELS approximately estimates the continuous time evolution of the design point by only one TELM analysis. This is the essence of its efficiency compared to the standard TELM analysis. Among response statistics of interest, the first-passage probability represents the most important one for this class of problems. This statistic is efficiently computed by using the Au-Beck important sampling algorithm, which requires knowledge of the evolving design points, in conjunction with the ETELS. The method is successfully tested for five types of excitation: (I) uniformly <b>modulated</b> <b>white</b> <b>noise,</b> (II) uniformly <b>modulated</b> broad-band excitation, (III) uniformly modulated narrow-band excitation, (IV) time- and frequency-modulated broad-band excitation, and (V) time- and frequency-modulated narrow-band excitation...|$|R

We cast the problem of finding a lower bound on {{the probability of a}} union as an optimization problem that seeks to find the subset that maximizes a recent lower bound—due to Kuai, Alajaji, and Takahara—that we will refer to as the KAT bound. The improved bound, which is denoted by LB-s, is asymptotically tight [as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) grows to infinity] and depends only on the code’s weight enumeration function for its calculation. The use of a subset of the codebook to evaluate the LB-s lower bound not only significantly reduces computational complexity, but also tightens the bound specially at low SNRs. Numerical results for binary block codes indicate that at high SNRs, the LB-s bound is tighter than other recent lower bounds in the literature, which comprise the lower bound due to Séguin, the KAT bound (evaluated on the entire codebook), and the dot-product and norm bounds due to Cohen and Merhav.

As applications, we discuss the existence of Hitsuda–Skorokhod integral for Lévy processes, Kubo–Takenaka formula for Lévy processes, and Itô formula for generalized Lévy <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> functionals...|$|R
40|$|As a non-commutative {{extension}} of the Lévy Laplacian for entire functions on a nuclear space, we define the quantum Lévy Laplacian acting on <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> operators. We solve a heat type equation associated with the quantum Lévy Laplacian and study its relation to the classical Lévy heat equation. The solution to the quantum Lévy heat equation is obtained also from a normal-ordered <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> differential equation involving the quadratic quantum <b>white</b> <b>noise.</b> Key words: quantum Lévy Laplacian, heat equation, quantum <b>white</b> <b>noise,</b> Wick symbol, <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> operato...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} <b>white</b> <b>noise,</b> continuous and intermittent, upon Uchida-Krae-pelin Test. Subjects were 230 male and 230 female junior high school students. They took the test under three different conditions, namely, ordinary level of room noise (about 45 dBA), continuous <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> and intermittent one (both; about 70 dBA). The main {{findings of this study}} were as follows; 1. <b>White</b> <b>noise</b> had inhibitory effect upon the performance of the test, especially in the first period. 2. It seemed that intermittent <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> was more inhibitory than continuous <b>white</b> <b>noise,</b> but the difference was not statistically significant. 3. Inhibitory effect of <b>white</b> <b>noise</b> was clearly observed in those subjects who had the lowest skillfulness in performing the test...|$|R

In particular, the smoothness and integrability properties of Lévy <b>white</b> <b>noises</b> are characterized using the Blumenthal-Getoor indices. Our techniques rely on wavelet methods and generalized moments estimates for Lévy <b>white</b> <b>noises.</b> Comment: 26 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
