50|$|Although {{it seemed}} a lucrative deal at the time, Geffen soon had reason to regret it. Uncharacteristically, he had greatly underestimated {{the value of his}} assets—within Asylum's first year as a Warner subsidiary, albums by Linda Ronstadt and the Eagles alone had earned more than the entire value of the Asylum sale. Geffen's {{discomfort}} was compounded by the fact that, within six months of the sale, the value of his volatile Warner shares had plummeted from $4.5 million to just $800,000. He appealed to Steve Ross to intervene, and as part of a <b>make-good</b> deal, Ross agreed to pay him the difference in the share value over five years. Acting on Jac Holzman's suggestion that Kinney should take Asylum from Atlantic and merge it with Elektra, Ross then appointed Geffen to run the new combined label.|$|E
50|$|On two {{separate}} occasions, Carter {{got involved in}} Drew Galloway's matches {{with the purpose of}} aiding him. However his plans backfired when he inadvertently ended up striking Galloway with a chair on the first occasion and the second occasion he struck him with a kendo stick. Following on from this, the two began a heated rivalry, fighting each other on several occasions, including an unsanctioned fight that led to a no-contest at Destination X. Later in August, Carter was involved in the Playoff, the winner of the series would go on to main event the PPV against the reigning champion {{at the time of the}} event. Before appearing in his own semi-final match against Matt Hardy, Carter interfered in a match between Drew Galloway and Mike Bennett, during which he intended to try and <b>make-good</b> on his recent mistakes costing Galloway matches. However, as before, he once again strikes Drew Galloway costing him the match. Carter would eventually win the series defeating long-time rival Mike Bennett. Galloway challenged Carter to a match with the winner going on to face the champion at Bound for Glory. The next week, Carter defeated Galloway, with Aron Rex as special referee, to keep his spot in the main event of Bound for Glory against Lashley. At Bound for Glory, he was defeated by Lashley. After the PPV, he started a feud against Eli Drake after his Fact of Life segment on the October 6 episode of Impact Wrestling. On the October 27 episode of Impact Wretsling, Carter and Jessie Godderz were defeated by Eli Drake and Aron Rex. On the November 24 episode of Impact Wrestling, Carter defeated Eli Drake in a title shot vs. voice match where if Carter lost, he would lose his TNA World Heavyweight title shot and if Drake lost, he would not be able to talk for the rest of 2016. On the December 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, his match against Eddie Edwards for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship ended in a no contest.|$|E
5000|$|Rushton is {{co-founder and}} CEO of Telemetry, a London-based {{independent}} digital media forensics company, founded with Irwin and Chesluk in 2009. The company has offices in London and New York. Telemetry works with advertisers and agencies, providing impartial, detailed analytics in real time, tracking {{the efficiency and}} exposure gained by online digital advertising campaigns to ensure accountability: that the ads are properly delivered, are being viewed by the intended audience, alongside the proper content, and that reach and impressions are not being inflated. They have advised caution {{when it comes to}} much of the technology used for programmatic buying, which can, for instance, fail to report when ads intended for pre-roll have been placed into oft-muted banner video ads instead. In conceiving the service, Rushton drew on his prior experience as a media planner, where he observed that advertisers had to rely on partisan analytics from the vendor or traditional ad server statistics, which had not been designed to track online ad campaigns. In 2014, Telemetry investigated Verizon Wireless's online video ad purchases, finding that in excess of $1 million was spent on fake Web views. The company in turn demanded <b>make-good</b> ads. Also that year, Telemetry uncovered an ad fraud operation that had been skimming around $10 million in video ad revenue per month, affecting over 75 advertisers, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Ford. Rushton called it the most significant instance of ad fraud Telemetry has seen. Telemetry has publicly called out companies perpetrating such fraud by name. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2014 that approximately 36% of all Web traffic is considered fake, with the corresponding amount of ad views being seen by [...] "bots" [...] rather than people, cheating advertisers who pay {{based on the number of}} Web views. In August 2014, Rushton was interviewed by CNN about online advertising fraud moving away from bot fraud, in which a series of fake computers simulate a sentient being watching ads, to a type of fraud involving a genuine audience watching low-quality impressions, which are converted into premium inventory, with the fraudulent impressions sold to large advertisers. Rushton stated that he feels it is the responsibility of the vendors to ensure that the impressions they are trading are genuine impressions.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} challenge {{faced by}} media broadcasting companies {{is how to}} allocate limited advertising space between upfront (forward) contracts and the spot market (referred to in advertising as the scatter market) to maximize profits and meet contractual commitments. We develop stylized optimization models of airtime capacity planning and allocation across multiple clients under audience uncertainty. In a short-term profit maximizing setting, our results provide insight for capacity planning decisions upfront and during the broadcasting season. Our results suggest that broadcasting companies should prioritize upfront clients according to marginal revenue per audience unit. We find that accepted upfront market contracts can be aggregated across clients and served {{in proportion to the}} audience demanded. Closed-form solutions are obtained in a static setting. These results remain valid in a dynamic setting, when considering the opportunity to increase allocation by airing <b>make-goods</b> during the broadcasting season. Our structural results characterize the impact of contracting parameters, time, and audience uncertainty on profits and capacity decisions. The results hold under general audience and spot market profit models. Overall, we find that ignoring audience uncertainty can have a significant cost for media capacity planning and allocation. media planning, TV advertising, revenue management, capacity planning...|$|R
5000|$|Telemetry has exposed large frauds perpetrated in {{the online}} {{advertising}} landscape, such as their 2014 investigation of Verizon Wireless's online video advertising purchases, finding that in excess of $1 million had been spent on fake Web views. With Telemetry's advice, Verizon, the eighth-largest advertiser in the US, demanded <b>make-goods.</b> Later in 2014, Telemetry investigated a Mercedes-Benz online advertising campaign, detecting suspicious traffic activity and finding that 57% of the campaign was viewed more often by automated computer programs than human beings. Mercedes was refunded for the false impressions. Telemetry also brought to the public's attention a scheme in which ads were forcefully [...] "injected" [...] onto popular sites (including Walmart.com, YouTube and others) by third-party sellers without the site owners' knowledge, with the profits going to the third party. In June 2014, Telemetry uncovered an ad fraud scheme that {{had been going on}} for several months, in which websites running lucrative video ads were being placed in banner ads on cheaper websites, with those behind the operation skimming around $10 million in video ad revenue per month. The scheme affected over 75 advertisers, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Ford. Rushton called it the most significant instance of ad fraud Telemetry has seen. Telemetry has publicly called out such companies by name, for unethically monetizing digital ads without the site owner's permission and manipulating impressions, while often generating a negative user experience.|$|R

40|$|Penalty {{design is}} {{essential}} {{to ensure that the}} effectiveness and efficiency goals of an emissions trading scheme are achieved. We focus on penalty types and penalty levels to assess how penalty design might affect compliance strategies and market performance. Laboratory experiment using student subjects was run in order to control for market parameters under which the emissions trading scheme operates. We find that penalty design does not yield any differences in auction price. However, contrary to the theory which predicts that compliance rates will not vary with regard to penalty level {{as long as it is}} set above the permit price, our results show penalty level induces higher compliance rates within the Fixed Penalty Rate treatment, but not within the <b>Make-Good</b> Provision treatment. With regard to penalty type, we find that the <b>Make-Good</b> Provision which can be viewed as a ‘quantity penalty ’ provides a stronger investment and compliance incentive. Furthermore, our finding reveals a trade-off between efficiency and compliance in the trading scheme as penalty design which encourages higher compliance rates corresponds to lower efficiency levels. It is plausible that penalty design indirectly affects auction price under the presence of risk aversion...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavioural}} implications of penalty designs on market performance using an experimental method. Three penalty types and two penalty levels are enforced {{in a laboratory}} permit market with auctioning, including the Australian Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme proposed design of tying the penalty rate to the auction price. Compliance strategies are limited to undertaking irreversible abatement investment decisions or buying permits. We aim to assess how penalty design under the presence of subjects‟ risk preferences might affect compliance incentives, permit price discovery, and efficiency. In contrast to theory, we find that penalty levels serve as a focal point that indicates compliance costs and affects compliance strategies. The <b>make-good</b> provision penalty provides stronger compliance incentives than the other penalty types. However, the theory holds with regard to permit price discovery, as we find no evidence {{of the effect of}} penalty design on auction price. Interestingly, risk preference does not directly affect compliance decision, but it does influence price discovery, which evidently is a significant factor in compliance decisions as well as efficiency. Most importantly, a trade-off between investment incentives and efficiency is observed. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} {{theoretical}} model to examine compliance incentives and market efficiency under three penalty types: the fixed penalty rate, {{which uses a}} constant marginal financial penalty; the <b>make-good</b> provision (quantity penalty), where each missing permit {{in the current period}} is to be offset with a ratio (restoration rate) in the following period; and a mixed penalty, which combines the two penalty types. Using a simple two-period model of firm‟s profit maximisation, we analyse compliance decisions and the efficient penalty level under each penalty type. Firms‟ compliance strategies are modelled as an irreversible investment in abatement measures and permit buying in the market. Our findings indicate that the penalty type does not affect compliance decisions provided that the efficient penalty level is applied. Market efficiency is retained regardless of penalty types. Nevertheless, the mixed penalty design provides the strongest compliance incentives. Hence this finding supports the practice in which this penalty design is widely used in the existing and the proposed trading schemes. Furthermore, we discuss the policy implications of the findings with regard to permit price discovery process and the Australian proposal of tying the penalty level to the permit price. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} issues of market design for emissions trading schemes by focusing on penalty designs and initial allocation mechanisms. Penalty design is {{defined in terms of}} penalty types and levels and the allocation mechanism compare free allocation with auctioning. The first essay employs a theoretical model to examine compliance incentives and market efficiency under three penalty types: the fixed-penalty rate (FPR), the <b>make-good</b> provision (MGP), and the mixed penalty design. Using a simple two-period model of firm&# 146;s profit maximisation, we analyse compliance decisions and the efficient penalty level under each penalty type. Our findings indicate that the penalty type does not affect compliance decisions provided that the efficient penalty level is applied. Market efficiency is retained regardless of penalty types. These findings are used as the hypotheses for the second essay. The behavioural implications of penalty designs on market performance are investigated in the second essay using an experimental method. Three penalty types and two penalty levels are enforced in a laboratory permit market with auctioning wherein subjects make compliance decisions by undertaking irreversible abatement investment decisions or by buying permits. In contrast to theory, we find that penalty levels serve as a focal point that indicates compliance costs and affects compliance strategies. The MGP penalty provides stronger compliance incentives than the other penalty types. Most importantly, a trade-off between investment incentives and efficiency is observed. Using a laboratory experiment, the third essay studies how the initial distribution of permits through free allocation or auctioning, may affect price discovery, allocative and static efficiency under the presence of three penalty designs. Price discovery is not influenced by the initial allocation mechanism. Permit prices remain above the efficient level due to the presence of irrational bidding and trading behaviour as well as risk aversion. Uncertainty regarding permit prices results in a modest allocative efficiency as over-investment prevails. Auctioning evidently generates higher static efficiency due to stronger price signals. This result supports the majority of literature which argues for auctioning. An appropriate auction design is crucial to avoid the risk of overbidding which will inflate the auction price and diminish efficiency...|$|E
