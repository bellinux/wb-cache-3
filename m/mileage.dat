5|$|Exit {{numbers were}} {{originally}} sequential but are assigned today by <b>mileage</b> from south to east, the same numbering system {{used by the}} majority of U.S. states for their Interstate Highways as well. After passing the Bonner Springs interchange, exit numbers change to match the <b>mileage</b> of Interstate 70 (I-70) east from the Colorado border, which is also used on I-70 west of the turnpike. This results in discontinuous exit numbers on I-70.|$|E
5|$|The MSHD {{requested}} additional Interstate Highway <b>mileage</b> in 1968 {{under the}} Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 including a freeway along US23 between Standish and Mackinaw City. This extension {{was rejected by}} Congress on December 13, 1968; instead, Michigan was allotted additional <b>mileage</b> for an extension of I-69 to Flint. Once {{the last piece of}} I-75 was completed along the M-76 corridor in November 1973, the I-75 designation was extended north of Bay City on US23.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, {{the section}} of M-69 east of Randville was decommissioned, and the {{concurrency}} with M-95 was removed. This truncated the highway to , approximately one-fifth of its previous length. The transfer to county control {{was part of a}} program to reduce the total state highway <b>mileage</b> in the state. After October 5, 1970, this section was renamed G-30 with the beginning of the County-Designated Highway program in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July 1871, the DR {{opened its}} own tracks between Gloucester Road and High Street Kensington. These tracks, the Cromwell Curve, were opened without Parliamentary {{authority}} in an unsuccessful {{attempt by the}} DR to improve {{its share of the}} revenues between High Street Kensington and South Kensington stations which were divided on the basis of <b>mileage</b> of track owned by the two companies.|$|E

5|$|The Great North Road {{traditionally}} {{began at}} Smithfield Market and <b>mileages</b> were measured from here. The specific start was Hicks Hall, and its former location {{continued to be}} used for <b>mileages</b> even after it was demolished, soon after 1778. The road followed St John Street, and continued north, eventually leading to Edinburgh. This ended in 1829, with the establishment of the General Post Office at St Martin's-le-Grand, which became the new starting point.|$|R

5|$|As {{noted by}} a {{historical}} marker {{on the large}} hill in Central Campus, the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. The surrender of the city {{took place on the}} southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864. The next twenty years were a time of rapid industrial expansion; during this period, Georgia's manufacturing capital, railroad track <b>mileage,</b> and property values would each increase by a factor of three to four.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{existence}} or upcoming construction of two divided highway corridors between Baltimore and Annapolis, a freeway connecting I-695 and US 50 was proposed {{as early as}} 1956 {{in the form of}} the Arundel Expressway, which would relieve congestion on MD 2. The portion of the Arundel Expressway that is today MD 10 was constructed from I-695 to MD 648 in Pasadena between 1970 and 1978. MD 10 was proposed to continued south of Pasadena as a toll road to US 50, but the section of the freeway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. MD 10 was completed to its present end in Pasadena in 1991. The state of Maryland unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Highway Administration for an Interstate designation for a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway after passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. However, the state was successful in obtaining Interstate <b>mileage</b> for the Baltimore–Annapolis corridor through the 1968 Howard–Cramer amendment, which provided for minor adjustments to the Interstate System if no additional costs were incurred. Much of the <b>mileage</b> of what became I-97 was reallocated from canceled Interstate Highways in Baltimore and the Washington area.|$|E
