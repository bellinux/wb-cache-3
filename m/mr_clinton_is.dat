5000|$|The term {{adjectival}} {{phrase is}} sometimes {{used instead of}} adjective phrase. However, there is tendency to call a phrase an adjectival phrase {{in such a case}} where that phrase is functioning like an adjective phrase would, but does not contain an actual adjective. For example, in <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> a man of wealth, the prepositional phrase of wealth modifies a man the way an adjective would, and it could be reworded with an adjective, e.g. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> a wealthy man. Similarly, that boy is friendless (the adjective [...] "friendless" [...] modifies the noun [...] "boy") and That boy is without a friend (a prepositional phrase where [...] "without a friend" [...] modifies [...] "boy").|$|E
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{arrived at}} the mortuary, a gay red and white building, which had been newly erected and consecrated by a duke with much festivity and rejoicing. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> sworn with the other jurymen, and with them {{repaired}} to see the bodies on which they were to sit. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> squeamish.|$|R

60|$|One day <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> {{talking to}} a {{neighbour}} in the bedroom, the patient was so quiet that they thought him asleep.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{crossed her}} hands over her stomach and looked at her husband with self-satisfaction. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> awake, staring in front of him with wide-open, fixed eyes; various {{thoughts}} confusedly ran through his head.|$|R
60|$|The Clintons {{lived in}} the fifth house down in the Adonis Road, {{and the house was}} {{distinguishable}} from its fellows by the yellow curtains with which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> had furnished all the windows. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> a woman of taste. Before marriage, the happy pair, accompanied by Mrs Clinton's mother, had gone house-hunting, and fixed on the Adonis Road, which was cheap, respectable and near the station. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> would dearly have liked a house on the right-hand side of the road, which had nooks and angles and curiously-shaped windows. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> firm in his refusal, and his mother-in-law backed him up.|$|R
60|$|Mr Evans's {{mind was}} too truly pious for a wicked expletive to cross it; but {{a bad man}} expressing the curate's feeling {{would have said that}} <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> a damned fool.|$|R
60|$|A {{month later}} a small party were {{assembled}} in Captain Clinton's bungalow. Mrs. Humphreys {{was standing with}} a baby in each arm. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> lying upon a sofa crying bitterly. Captain <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> {{walking up and down}} the room, hot and angry. The surgeon of the regiment was standing grave and sympathetic by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Sergeant Humphreys <b>was</b> in the attitude of attention by the door, with an anxious troubled expression on his face.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> not {{henceforth}} on {{the very}} best of terms with her husband, but he always treated her with his accustomed gentleness, though he insisted on spending his nights on the dining-room sofa.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, my man,' he said, as <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> at last came in, 'what are you {{complaining}} of?... One moment,' he added, as <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> {{about to}} reply. He opened his notebook {{and took out}} a stylographic pen. 'Now, I'm ready for you. What are you complaining of?' ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Newsweek magazine, Democratic Presidential Hopeful Hillary Clinton described Helen Clark as a [...] "former" [...] prime minister of New Zealand. The comment came during {{an interview}} with the magazine when <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> asked to tell a joke.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In my bed!' screamed <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton.</b> 'Not if I know it! 'Ere, you,' she said, {{addressing}} the man, and pushing past her husband. 'Out you get! I'm {{not going to}} 'ave tramps and loafers in my 'ouse. Get out!' <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> an energetic woman, and a strong one. Catching hold of her husband's stick, and flourishing it, she opened the front door.|$|R
50|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times, Cameron Harris of Annapolis, Maryland, explains how he profited from creating fake news on his website, ChristianTimesNewspaper.com that included a false story claiming that pre-marked ballots for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>were</b> being held in boxes at a warehouse in Ohio.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> quite overcome; {{she turned}} away to hide the tears which {{suddenly}} filled her eyes, but the shock {{was too much for}} her, and she had to leave the room so that her husband might not see her emotion; she immediately sent for the doctor.|$|R
5000|$|She adds: [...] "Sexism is insidious, {{unconscious}} and affects {{women as well}} as men. Just because women didn't turn out in big enough numbers for <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> does not mean we should dismiss the troubling sexism and misogyny that marred the campaign... The fact so many women in America voted for Mr Trump over <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> a get-out-of-jail-free card: female voters weren't bothered, so it can't be sexist. It can, and it is." ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> who <b>was</b> {{but just}} {{recovering}} from her illness, was too prostrated by this terrible blow {{to be able}} to offer any suggestion.|$|R
50|$|The narrator {{tells of}} the <b>Clinton</b> family. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> a {{well-known}} novelist and a centre of literary society, whilst her husband is content to live in her shadow. He has {{let it be known}} that he also 'writes', but nothing much is known of what he writes. Eventually, a large two-volume work emerges and is taken up by his wife’s publishers more as a favour than anything else. The work is an unexpected success and the gaze of the literary set turns from <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> to her Husband.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> a little, spindly-shanked man, with weak, myopic eyes, {{protruding}} fishlike {{behind his}} spectacles. His hair was scant, worn long {{to conceal the}} baldness of the crown--and Cæsar was pleased to wear a wreath of laurel for the same purpose.... <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> wore small side-whiskers, but was otherwise clean-shaven, {{and the lack of}} beard betrayed the weakness of his mouth; his teeth were decayed and yellow. He was always dressed in a black tail-coat, shiny at the elbows; and he wore a shabby, narrow black tie, with a false diamond stud in his dickey. His grey trousers were baggy at the knees and frayed at the edges; his boots had a masculine and English breadth of toe. His top hat, of antiquated shape, was kept carefully brushed, but always looked as if it were suffering from a recent shower. When he had deserted the frivolous byways in which bachelordom is wont to disport itself for the sober path of the married man, he had begun to carry to and from the city a small black bag to impress upon the world at large his eminent respectability. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> married to Amy, second daughter of John Rayner, Esquire, of Peckham Rye....|$|R
5000|$|For <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Jordan's roles {{have been}} manifold: Golfing companion. Smoother of ruffled {{feathers}} (he put the president {{back in touch}} with Zoë Baird after the withdrawal of her nomination to be attorney general). Consoler in chief (after <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> defeated for re-election as governor in 1980, after the suicide of Vincent W. Foster Jr. in 1993). Conduit to the high and mighty (he took <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> in 1991 to the Bilderberg conference in Germany, an exclusive annual retreat for politicians and businessmen). Go-between (he told Mike Espy he had to go as secretary of agriculture, helped win Warren Christopher a larger role as secretary of state and sounded out Gen. Colin L. Powell for a Cabinet job).|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> at her wit's end. Her {{husband had}} sold out his shares, {{and the money}} was lying at the bank ready {{to be put to}} its destined use. Visions of debt and {{bankruptcy}} presented themselves to her. She saw her black satin dress in the ruthless clutches of a pawnbroker, the house and furniture sold over her head, the children down at heel, and herself driven to work for her living--needlework, nursing, charing--what might not things come to? However, she went to the doctor and told him of the failure of their scheme.|$|R
60|$|A month {{previous}} to {{the opening}} of the story she had been confined of a boy, and two days later <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> the wife of the captain of her husband's company, also became a mother. Before the week <b>was</b> over <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> taken dangerously ill, and as it was impossible for her to nurse her child, the surgeon of the regiment recommended that it should be given into the charge of the sergeant's wife, as she, being a strong and healthy young woman, could very well nurse it as well as her own. It was a month after this that Sergeant Humphreys, returning to his quarters, found his wife sitting {{by the side of the}} bed on which the two infants were asleep.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{an analytical}} approach to explaining a nearly constant high job approval rating of president Clinton between January, 1998 and February, 1999. Despite all the controversy and massive information exposure to mostly unflattering news about Mr. Clinton; the public, {{in nearly all}} major opinion polls expressed their wish that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>be</b> allowed to complete his second term in the office. The analytical approach {{is based on the}} information entropy theory of Shannon. The model is tested using the data from the polling archives of ABC/Washington Post. The results are confirmed by the Kendall's ÃÂ„ statistics...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{reached his}} office at a quarter to ten, except when the train, by some mistake, arrived up to time, {{when he arrived at}} nine-thirty precisely. On these {{occasions}} he would sit in his room with the door open, awaiting the coming of the office-boy, who used to arrive two minutes before <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> and <b>was</b> naturally much annoyed when the punctuality of the train prepared him a reprimand.|$|R
60|$|At the {{beginning}} of August, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> accustomed, {{with his wife and}} family, to desert the sultry populousness of London for the solitude and sea air of Ramsgate. He read the Daily Telegraph by the sad sea waves, and made castles in the sand with his children. Then he changed his pepper-and-salt trousers for white flannel, but nothing on earth would induce him to forsake his top hat. He entirely agreed with the heroes of England's proudest epoch--of course I mean the middle Victorian--that the top hat was the sign-manual, the mark, the distinction of the true Englishman, the completest expression of England's greatness. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> despised all foreigners, and although he would never have ventured to think of himself in the same breath with an English lord, he felt himself the superior of any foreign nobleman.|$|R
2500|$|Palin and <b>Clinton</b> <b>were</b> {{compared}} and {{contrasted with}} one another in the media. A New York Times article explains, [...] "Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Palin have little in common beyond their breakout performances at the conventions and the soap opera aspects of their family lives. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> always faces high expectations; Ms. Palin faced low expectations this week, and benefited from them. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> can seem harsh when she goes on the attack; Ms. Palin has shown a knack for attacking without seeming nasty. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> has a lot of experience; Ms. Palin, not so much. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> pantsuits; Ms. Palin is skirts." [...] Guy Cecil, the former political director of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said it was [...] "insulting" [...] for Republicans to compare Ms. Palin to Mrs. Clinton." [...] The Saturday Night Live skit [...] "A Nonpartisan Message from Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton" [...] counterpoised Palin, played by Tina Fey, against Hillary Clinton, played by Amy Poehler. The skit pointed out their opposing political views and presented Palin as unversed in global politics, as emphasized by the line: [...] "I can see Russia from my house." [...] Ex-Hewlett-Packard chief executive and former McCain advisor Carly Fiorina blasted the Saturday Night Live sketch in a television interview: [...] "They <b>were</b> defining Hillary <b>Clinton</b> as very substantive and Sarah Palin as totally superficial," [...] and an ABC news blog headline soon after ran, [...] "Now the McCain Campaign's Complaining that Saturday Night Live Skit Was 'Sexist'." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{went back}} to the office; it was his boast that for ten years he had never missed a day. But he was dazed; he did his work mechanically, and so distracted was he that, on going home in the evening, he forgot to remove his paper cuffs, and his wife remarked upon them while they <b>were</b> supping. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> a short, stout person, with an {{appearance}} of immense determination; her black, shiny hair was parted in the middle--the parting was broad and very white--severely brushed back and gathered into a little knot {{at the back of the}} head; her face was red and strongly lined, her eyes spirited, her nose aggressive, her mouth resolute. Everyone has some one procedure which seems most exactly to suit him--a slim youth bathing in a shaded stream, an alderman standing with his back to the fire and his thumbs in the arm-holes of his waistcoat--and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> expressed her complete self, exhibiting every trait and attribute, on Sunday in church, when she sat in the front pew self-reliantly singing the hymns in the wrong key. It was then that she seemed more than ever the personification of a full stop. Her morals were above suspicion, and her religion Low Church.|$|R
5000|$|After the hearing, Blumenthal said: [...] "It {{seems obvious}} that my {{appearance}} before this committee was {{for one reason}} and one reason only—politics. … They [...] "spent hours asking me questions about things {{that had nothing to}} do with Benghazi," [...] adding, [...] "I hope I have cleared up the series of misconceptions some members of the committee may have held. … My testimony has shed no light on the events of Benghazi—nor could it, because I have no firsthand knowledge." [...] Republican Committee Members asserted, however, that scrutinizing Blumenthal's work for Brock's media and messaging groups, and for the Clinton Foundation, provide a perspective into the overall Clinton political and philanthropic operations as related to the Clintons' potential conflicts of interest regarding Benghazi and other matters while <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> Secretary of State. Committee Democrats argued that the Committee’s real motive was to provide fodder for campaign attacks.|$|R
5000|$|O'Reilly has opined on many {{domestic}} issues. O'Reilly {{said the}} Bill Clinton impeachment {{stemming from the}} Lewinsky scandal was [...] "not about sex. This is about honesty and cruelty. For <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> it <b>was</b> about undermining the justice system." [...] In the same article he writes that Gary Condit, a moderate Democratic congressman from California who had an extramarital affair with Chandra Levy prior to her disappearance and death, should be held to the same standard.|$|R

2500|$|Following the {{nomination}} of Sarah Palin for the vice presidency at the Republican National Convention, Palin and <b>Clinton</b> <b>were</b> compared and contrasted {{with one another in}} the media, due to their status as women running in the 2008 presidential election.

5000|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> rated a [...] "Hard-Core Liberal" [...] {{according}} to the OnTheIssues.org scale, {{which is based on}} her public statements on social and economic issues.

5000|$|Scheib's {{mother had}} just died, and Scheib {{did not want}} to take on a new job. Scheib's wife {{submitted}} his résumé without his knowledge. He was among 4,000 applicants for the position, and one of just five asked to audition for the First Lady. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> impressed with Scheib's managerial skills and ability to prepare hundreds of first-class meals {{in a short period of}} time. She also wanted the White House to feature more distinctively American cooking techniques, dishes, and presentation, something she believed Scheib could bring to the White House. She also wanted to get away from the cream- and fat-heavy dishes of French cooking. Scheib was competing against some of the best chefs in the United States, including Nora Pouillon and Patrick Clark (then at the Hay-Adams Hotel). Scheib auditioned before the First Lady and several other women by presenting pecan-encrusted lamb, red-curried sweet potatoes, and morel sauce. While other chefs primarily brought in dishes they normally serve in their restaurants, Scheib's lunch featured a wide variety of American cuisines: Cal-Italian, Mid-Atlantic, Southwestern, Floridian, and even a vegetarian serving. [...] Hillary Clinton hired Scheib after Clark, her first choice, turned her down.|$|R
