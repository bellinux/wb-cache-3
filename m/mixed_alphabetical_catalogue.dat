40|$|The {{view that}} María Moliner wrote the Dictionary without any {{knowledge}} of lexicography is widespread.

The management of an <b>alphabetical</b> subject <b>catalogue</b> requires the creation and management by the librarian of a true lexicon, aimed at establishing an informative dialogue with the user of the catalogue. No doubt, this practice proved decisive, not only for the process of creation of the Dictionary, but also for the designing of the model itself...|$|R

60|$|I {{fear that}} arrangement, to be good, must be troublesome. Subjects are traversed by {{promiscuous}} assemblages of 'works;' both by sizes; and all by languages. On the whole I conclude as follows. The mechanical perfection of a library requires an <b>alphabetical</b> <b>catalogue</b> of the whole. But {{under the shadow}} of this catalogue let there be as many living integers as possible, for every well-chosen subdivision is a living integer and makes the library more and more an organism. Among others I plead for individual men as centres of subdivision: not only for Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, but for Johnson, Scott, and Burns, and whatever represents a large and manifold humanity.|$|R

50|$|Cogswell {{received}} the appointment, {{and would probably}} have accepted it, but, Astor finding that he was likely to lose his invaluable services, made him superintendent of the new library. After the rich merchant's death, in 1848, Cogswell traveled to Europe to purchase books. Cogswell made many acquaintances among European intellectual elites during his frequent visits to Europe, including Johann von Goethe, Alexander von Humboldt, Pierre-Jean de Béranger, Lord Byron, and Walter Scott. His general bibliographical knowledge was of great service to the Astor Library, one great work undertaken by him being the preparation of an analytical and <b>alphabetical</b> <b>catalogue</b> of the collection.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a single witness edition of The Knowing of Woman’s Kind in Childing, {{which is a}} 14 th century vernacular obstetrical and gynaecological treatise found in British Library MS Additional 12195. Purported to be emulating medical texts of French and Latin origin, The Knowing of Woman's Kind in Childing is “a novel fusing of several different texts and theoretical traditions into a single work” (Green, “Obstetrical” 64). The Knowing of Woman’s Kind in Childing is an important and significant medieval medical text {{because it has a}} self-identified female audience and a female-orientated medical focus. Accompanying notes and emendations from the four other extant witnesses are also presented: Oxford Bodley MS Douce 37 (SC 21611), Oxford MS Bodley 483 (SC 2062), Cambridge University Library MS Ii. 6. 33, and British Library MS Sloane 421 A. This thesis explores the folklore of the traditional herbs, medicinals, and compounds used in the treatise. A comparison of the material appended to all five of the extant witnesses is presented in Appendix A; Appendix B lists the incidence of rubrication found in this edition; originating source material for the Knowing of Woman’s Kind in Childing is presented in Appendix C; and an <b>alphabetical</b> <b>catalogue</b> of medicinals, in four tables, can be found in Appendix D...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Index Alphabeticus" [...] {{the first}} catalog {{compiled}} by James, {{which consisted of}} 8,700 entries, appeared in July 1605. It was dedicated to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, {{at the suggestion of}} Bodley (who thought that 'more reward was to be gained from the prince than from the king'). It includes both printed books and manuscripts, arranged alphabetically under the four classes of theology, medicine, law, and arts. A continuation of this classified index, embracing writers on arts and sciences, geography and history, {{is to be found in}} Rawlinson MS. Miscell. 730, drawn up by James after quitting the library. An <b>alphabetical</b> <b>catalogue</b> prepared by him in 1613 was not printed, but remained in the library. A second edition of the catalogue appeared in 1620. It abandoned the classified arrangement of the former catalogue, and adopts only one alphabet of names. There was also issued in 1635 'Catalogus Interpretum S. Scripturæ juxta numerorum ordinem qui extant in Bibliotheca Bodleiana olim a D. Jamesio … concinnatus, nunc vero altera fere parte auctior redditus. … Editio correcta,' Oxford. In 1604, Bodley noted some errors James had made in cataloguing the Hebrew manuscripts, suggesting that James should check with scholars fluent in Hebrew.|$|R

40|$|The {{training}} as library assistant was replaced in 1998 by the multidisciplinary training „Specialised Employee in Media and Information Services“ (FaMI in German). However, the libraries {{have not been}} able, until now, to make full use of this information specialist and have not yet found an appropriate position between the spectrum of duties of the librarian and the assistant. Most {{of the time the}} FaMI is offered a fixed-term part-time job at the front desk or, at the other extreme, is hired as a cost saving alter­native to the librarian. In both cases the practical exercise of the duties has never been adequate or relevant to the content of the formation or to the depth of the learned material. Beginners face many problems in their job application. A flexible adap­tation to the job market is essential in order to insure a successful entry in the working life. Using the example of a specialised medical library it will be shown to what extent what is being learned in the training is suitable to the requirements of the FaMI. There are more and more positions available for the FaMIs in the private sector, so that it is no longer restricted to the public one. The private sector offers now the information specialist a broad range of job challenges whose most important prerequisites are not at all the rules for <b>alphabetical</b> <b>cataloguing</b> of the media. What is much more required nowadays is a business management knowledge {{in the sense of the}} running of a library, and the secure use of modern communication and technology techniques. One should take into account these requirements in the training in order to broaden the job opportunities of the FaMI thus allowing him to become a versatile and a much in demand information specialist...|$|R
