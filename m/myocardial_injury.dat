25|$|H2S therapy uses a H2S donor, such as diallyl trisulfide (DATS), to {{increase}} the supply of H2S to an AMI patient. H2S donors reduce <b>myocardial</b> <b>injury</b> and reperfusion complications. Increased H2S levels within the body will react with oxygen to produce sulfane sulfur, a storage intermediate for H2S. H2S pools in the body attracts oxygen to react with excess H2S and eNOS {{to increase}} NO production. With increased use of oxygen to produce more NO, less oxygen is available to react with eNOS to produce superoxides during an AMI, ultimately lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, decreased accumulation of ROS lowers oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells, decreasing oxidative degeneration of BH4. Increased BH4 cofactor contributes to increased production of NO within the body. Higher concentrations of H2S directly increase eNOS activity through Akt activation to increase phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site, and decrease phosphorylation of the eNOST495 inhibition site. This phosphorylation process upregulates eNOS activity, catalyzing more conversion of L-arginine to NO. Increased NO production enables soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity, leading to an increased conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 3’,5’-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In H2S therapy immediately following an AMI, increased cGMP triggers an increase in protein kinase G (PKG) activity. PKG reduces intracellular Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscle to increase smooth muscle relaxation and promote blood flow. PKG also limits smooth muscle cell proliferation, reducing intima thickening following AMI injury, ultimately decreasing myocardial infarct size.|$|E

40|$|Background—Recent {{work has}} {{suggested}} that the formation of platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNCs) aggravates the severity of inflammatory tissue injury. Given the importance of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) for platelet function, we pursued the role of VASP on the formation of PNCs {{and its impact on the}} extent of <b>myocardial</b> ischemia-reperfusion (IR) <b>injury.</b> Methods and Results—In initial in vitro studies we found that neutrophils facilitated the movement of platelets across endothelial monolayers. Phosphorylation of VASP reduced the formation of PNCs and transendothelial movement of PNCs. During <b>myocardial</b> IR <b>injury,</b> VASP/ animals demonstrated reduced intravascular formation of PNCs and reduced presence of PNCs within the ischemic myocardial tissue. This was associated with reduced IR injury. Studies using platelet transfer and bone marrow chimeric animals showed that hematopoietic VASP expression was crucial for the intravascular formation of PNCs the presence of PNCs within ischemic myocardial tissue and the extent of <b>myocardial</b> IR <b>injury.</b> Furthermore, phosphorylation of VASP on Ser 153 or Ser 235 reduced intravascular PNC formation and presence of PNCs within ischemic myocardial tissue.

This effect may be explained by a reduction in the availability of arachidonic acid due to simultaneous inhibition of both pathways of arachidonic acid oxygenation. In another, more recent study, cyclobuxine was also found to have a protective effect on myocardial cells against ischemia and reperfusion (in an isolated rat heart model).
