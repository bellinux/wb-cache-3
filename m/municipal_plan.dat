A simple clustering analysis identified three interconnected themes that together determine the performance of PPGIS: (i) tool design and affordances; (ii) organisational capacity; and (iii) governance. The results of the case studies augment existing literature regarding the connections between the different socio-technical dimensions for the design, implementation and evaluation of PPGIS applications in <b>municipal</b> <b>planning.</b> A cyborg approach to PPGIS is then proposed to improve the theoretical basis for addressing these dimensions together...|$|R

40|$|The Saudi {{government}} has made some efforts in incorporating the principles of sustainable development into the planning process by establishing a framework for considering environmental consequences of development activities. The framework is guided by the General Environmental Code. The Ministerial Committee on the Environment (MCE) coordinates the environmental assessment of plans, policies and programmes prior to approval. However, the framework tends to focus on plans and programmes {{at the national level}} with little or no explicit provision for ensuring the assessment of <b>municipal</b> <b>plans,</b> policies and programmes. This paper evaluates the integration of environmental assessment into the <b>municipal</b> <b>planning</b> process and the plan documents. The findings indicate that the implementation of environmental assessment at the <b>municipal</b> <b>planning</b> level is minimal. Inadequate institutional framework and lack of effective environment assessment legislation are the main barriers to the implementation. Overall, the assessment shows that there is the need to improve sustainability planning practice in the Kingdom.
