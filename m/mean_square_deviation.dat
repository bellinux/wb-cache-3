The RMSD of two aligned structures indicates their divergence from one another.

5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>deviation</b> (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{homology}} model {{is dependent on the}} {{quality of the}} sequence alignment and template structure. The approach can be complicated by the presence of alignment gaps (commonly called indels) that indicate a structural region present in the target but not in the template, and by structure gaps in the template that arise from poor resolution in the experimental procedure (usually X-ray crystallography) used to solve the structure. Model quality declines with decreasing sequence identity; a typical model has ~1–2 Å root <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>deviation</b> between the matched Cα atoms at 70% sequence identity but only 2–4 Å agreement at 25% sequence identity. However, the errors are significantly higher in the loop regions, where the amino acid sequences of the target and template proteins may be completely different.|$|E

Regression coefficient, <b>mean</b> <b>squares</b> of <b>deviation</b> from regression and determination coefficients were estimated. All the genotypes were found stable for their traits of plant densitity and days to heading. There were differences in stability performances among the genotypes for the traits of plant height, grain numbers spike- 1, grain weight spike- 1, 1000 kernels weight and grain yield.

40|$|A {{retrieval}} of total column water vapour (TCWV) from MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) measurements is presented. The algorithm {{is adapted from}} a retrieval for MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) from Lindstrot et al. (2012). It obtains the TCWV for cloud-free scenes above land at a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km and provides uncertainties on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The algorithm has been extended by introducing empirical correction coefficients for the transmittance calculation within the forward operator. With that, a wet bias of the MODIS algorithm against ARM microwave radiometer data has been eliminated. The validation against other ground-based measurements (GNSS water vapour stations, GUAN radiosondes, and AERONET sun photometers) {{on a global scale}} reveals a bias between − 0. 8 and − 1. 6 mm and root <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>deviations</b> between 0. 9 and 2 mm.

40|$|Predicting crystallographic B-factors of {{a protein}} from a {{conventional}} {{molecular dynamics simulation}} is challenging, {{in part because the}} B-factors calculated through sampling the atomic positional fluctuations in a picosecond molecular dynamics simulation are unreliable, and the sampling of a longer simulation yields overly large root <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>deviations</b> between calculated and experimental B-factors. This article reports improved B-factor prediction achieved by sampling the atomic positional fluctuations in multiple picosecond molecular dynamics simulations that use uniformly increased atomic masses by 100 -fold to increase time resolution. Using the third immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, ubiquitin, and lysozyme as model systems, the B-factor root <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>deviations</b> (<b>mean</b> ± standard error) of these proteins were 3. 1 ± 0. 2 – 9 ± 1 Å 2 for Cα and 7. 3 ± 0. 9 – 9. 6 ± 0. 2 Å 2 for Cγ, when the sampling was done for each of these proteins over 20 distinct, independent, and 50 -picosecond high-mass molecular dynamics simulations with AMBER forcefield FF 12 MC or FF 14 SB.
