5|$|In 1988, Chapman made {{a routine}} {{visit to a}} dentist, who found a small, but <b>malignant</b> <b>tumour</b> {{on one of his}} tonsils, leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy. The {{following}} year, the cancer had spread into Chapman's spinal cord, where another tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus, the final time he appeared on television.|$|E
5|$|His elder {{daughter}} Elizabeth, {{the heir}} presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, taking {{the place of}} the King and Queen. The King was well enough to open the Festival of Britain in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, his left lung was removed by Clement Price Thomas after a <b>malignant</b> <b>tumour</b> was found. In October 1951, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the State Opening of Parliament in November, the King's speech from the throne was read for him by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds. His Christmas broadcast of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To provide {{information}} regarding frequency of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> through data retrieved from pathol-ogy based tumour registry of AFIP, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Methods: All <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> recorded with the AFIP tumour registry {{over a period}} of 10 years (1992 - 2001) were analysed in terms of age group, gender and type of tumour with relation to site. A comparison with the pre-viously published material from same setting, national and international studies were also done. Results: The total <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> in the 10 years period were 21, 168. Out of these, 12584 (59. 5 %) were seen in male patients while 8584 (40. 5 %) were in females.

30|$|Previous {{clinical}} studies have revealed {{the potential of}} [18 F]-fluoro-L-α-methyltyrosine (18 F-FAMT) for the differential diagnosis of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> from sarcoidosis. However, one concern regarding the differential diagnosis with 18 F-FAMT {{is the possibility of}} false negatives given the small absolute uptake of 18 F-FAMT that has been observed in some <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a usefulness of dynamic 18 F-FAMT positron emission tomography (PET) for differentiating <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> from granulomas.|$|R

25|$|In 1893, Paul Sudeck {{challenged}} the theory postulated by Grawitz by publishing descriptions of renal tumours {{in which he}} identified atypical features within renal tubules and noted a gradation of these atypical features between the tubules and neighboring <b>malignant</b> <b>tumour.</b> In 1894, Otto Lubarsch, who supported the theory postulated by Grawitz coined the term hypernephroid tumor, which was amended to hypernephroma by Felix Victor Birch-Hirschfeld to describe these tumours.|$|E
40|$|Nation-al Cancer Registry {{indicated}} a gradual {{increase in the}} incidence of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> among men, from 64, 092 thousand in 2006 to 70, 024 thousand in 2010. In the reference period, the number of deaths due to <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> among men oscillated around 52 thousand. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the incidence of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> in the male population of Poland in the period 2006 – 2010. The study material comprised data ob-tained from the National Cancer Regis-try and from the Central Statistical Of-fice, available on the websites of these institutions. The malignant-tumour incidence rate among the male population in 2006 – 2010 showed a slow but steady growth, while the death rate dropped slightly at the end of 2010. The hypothesis that the cancer-incidence risk grows with age has been proven, and a substantial increase in this risk is observed from the fourth decade of life. The most common <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> in Poland in the an-alysed period included lung cancer, fol-lowed by prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. Future prophylactic and educational programmes should be addressed to men prior to reaching the age of in-creased cancer risk.

25|$|Because {{the health}} of the Crown Prince did not improve, Mackenzie advised him to go to Italy to undergo treatment. Frederick and Victoria went to San Remo in September 1887, causing outrage in Berlin because, despite the {{continued}} deterioration in the Emperor's health, the couple didn't return to the capital. In early November, Frederick completely lost the use of speech and German doctors were summoned by Victoria to San Remo for further examinations. Finally, he was diagnosed with a <b>malignant</b> <b>tumour</b> and the only possible treatment was the removal of his larynx, but the Crown Prince refused. Victoria supported her husband in his decision, which caused a serious argument with her son William, who shortly before had arrived in Italy and accused his mother of being happy with Frederick's disease.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 2193 tumours {{of the mouth}} and jaw {{diagnosed}} at the Laboratorium Patologi Anatomi Fakultas Kedokteran Universitas Airlangga, Indonesia from 1987 to 1992, inclusive, was studied. <b>Malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> constituted 45. 3 of the lesions. Almost 71 of the <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> were squamous cell carcinomas. The remainder were salivary gland tumours (21. 5) and sarcomas (4. 5). The male to female ratio for <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> was 5. 1 : 4. 7. The incidence of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumours</b> per 100, 000 population over the 6 -year study period was 2. 64. The yearly incidence seemed to increase except in 1990, when it dropped. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma over the 6 years was 2. 1. Calculation of the odds ratio suggested that people aged 40 and over are 5. 8 {{times more likely to}} develop squamous cell carcinoma.
