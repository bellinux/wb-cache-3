5|$|About 2.5million {{people lived}} in the Willamette River basin as of 2010, about 65percent of the {{population}} of Oregon. As of 2009, the basin contained 20 of the 25 most populous cities in Oregon. These cities include Springfield, Eugene, Corvallis, Albany, Salem, Keizer, Newberg, Oregon City, West Linn, Milwaukie, Lake Oswego, and Portland. The largest is Portland, with more than 500,000 residents. Not all of these cities draw water directly from the Willamette for their municipal water supply. Other cities in the watershed (but not on the main-stem river) with populations of 20,000 or <b>more</b> <b>are</b> Gresham, Hillsboro, Beaverton, Tigard, McMinnville, Tualatin, Woodburn, and Forest Grove.|$|E

A few of these archaeocins have been characterized, but hundreds <b>more</b> <b>are</b> believed to exist, especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so they may have novel modes of action. In addition, they may allow the creation of new selectable markers for use in archaeal molecular biology.|$|E

5|$|Inflorescences are large, {{branched}} and borne {{among the}} leaves. The inflorescence {{consists of a}} main axis—the peduncle and the rachis—and a series of smaller branches, the rachillae. The rachillae, which bear the flowers, emerge from the rachis. The peduncle is the main stalk, connecting the rachis with the stem. Inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers, or are predominantly female with a few male flowers. Fruit usually {{have two or three}} seeds, although fewer or <b>more</b> <b>are</b> present in some species, and are usually brown, yellow, orange-brown or purple when mature.|$|E
