40|$|Abstract: A Distributed Vertical Line Array (DVLA) {{receiver}} able to {{span the}} full water column in {{water up to}} 6000 m deep has been developed to allow both modal and ray-based analyses of acoustic propagation. The DVLA {{is made up of}} distributed, self-recording hydrophones with timing and scheduling provided by a small number of central controllers, called D-STARs. The enabling technologies for this approach are (i) the availability of flash memory modules that can store several gigabytes of data and be located in a small pressure case at each hydrophone, making it unnecessary to transfer data from the hydrophones to the central controllers for storage, and (ii) inductive modems that allow low-bandwidth communication for command, control, and time synchronization between the D-STAR controllers and the Hydrophone Modules over standard oceanographic <b>mooring</b> <b>wire.</b> The DVLA is modular, consisting of subarrays with a nominal length of 1000 m, each of which has one D-STAR controller and up to 99 Hydrophone Modules. A D-STAR controller is shackled in-line at the top of each subarray. The Hydrophone Modules are clamped to the <b>mooring</b> <b>wire</b> at the time of deployment, making the DVLA readily configurable for different experiments. The D-STAR clocks are synchronized acoustically, avoiding electrical interconnections. The DVLA is navigated using acoustic transponders positioned on the seafloor around the mooring. The Hydrophone Modules make precision temperature measurements throughout the time that the DVLA is deployed, in order to provide the sound-speed profiles needed for beamforming...|$|R

50|$|A sweep {{is either}} a contact sweep, a wire dragged through the water by one or two ships to cut the <b>mooring</b> <b>wire</b> of {{floating}} mines, or a distance sweep that mimics a ship to detonate the mines. The sweeps are dragged by minesweepers, either purpose-built military ships or converted trawlers. Each run covers between 100 and 200 m, and the ships must move slowly in a straight line, making them vulnerable to enemy fire. This was exploited by the Turkish army in the Battle of Gallipoli in 1915, when mobile howitzer batteries prevented the British and French from clearing a way through minefields.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTFloating {{production}} {{storage and}} offloading (FPSO) facilities are used {{at most of}} the offshore oil fields worldwide. FPSO usage {{is expected to grow}} as oil fields move to deeper water, thus requiring the reliability and stability of <b>mooring</b> <b>wires</b> and risers in extreme environmental conditions. Except for the case of predictable attack angles of external loadings, FPSO facilities with turret single point mooring (SPM) systems are in general use. There are two types of turret systems: permanent systems and disconnectable turret mooring systems. Extreme environment criteria for permanent moorings are usually based on a 100 -year return period event. It is common to use two or three environments including the 100 -year wave with associated wind and current, and the 100 -year wind with associated waves and current. When fitted with a disconnectable turret mooring system, FPSOs can be used in areas where it is desirable to remove the production unit from the field temporarily to prevent exposure to extreme events such as cyclones or large icebergs. Static and dynamic mooring analyses were performed to evaluate the stability of a spider buoy after disconnection from a turret during cyclone environmental conditions...|$|R

50|$|About 7:50 pm on 4 April 1998, a tow of the M/V Anne Holly, {{comprising}} 12 {{loaded and}} two empty barges, which was traveling northbound on the Mississippi River through the St. Louis Harbor, struck the Missouri-side pier {{of the center}} span of the Eads Bridge. Eight barges {{broke away from the}} tow and drifted back through the Missouri span. Three of these barges drifted toward Admiral. The drifting barges struck Admiral, causing 8 of its 10 mooring lines to break. Admiral then rotated clockwise downriver, away from the Missouri riverbank. The captain of Anne Holly disengaged his vessel from the six remaining barges in the tow and placed Anne Hollys bow against Admirals bow to hold it against the bank. About the time Anne Holly began pushing against Admiral, Admirals next-to-last mooring line parted. Anne Holly and the single <b>mooring</b> <b>wire</b> that remained attached to Admirals stern anchor held Admiral near the Missouri bank. No deaths resulted from the accident; 50 people were examined for minor injuries. Of those examined, 16 were sent to local hospitals for further treatment. Damages were estimated at $11 million. The quick response of the tow captain and emergency services prevented what might {{have been one of the}} most deadly marine disasters in history. The Mississippi River was over flood stage at the time of the accident and the ship would not have cleared the I-64 bridge just downstream. There were over 3000 people on board at the time. If Admiral had capsized when striking the bridge there would have been many people either trapped inside the flooding ship or in the frigid and turbulent river in the dark.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical model that simulates the behaviour of an offshore point absorber {{wave energy converter}} (WEC). The model receives 1 st order irregular waves as input and delivers instantaneous displacements, velocities and power as output. The model outputs are strongly non-linear {{due to the nature}} of some parts of the device, such as the power take off system (PTO), the <b>mooring</b> <b>wires</b> and the drag forces exerted on the wet bodies. Two different devices are modelled, a two-body device consisting in a floating buoy attached to a linear generator placed at the sea bed and a three-body device, which also includes a submerged sphere located halfway from the float and the generator. For each device, the model takes into account either the heave mode only or the heave and surge modes combined. The devices have been tuned to the Mediterranean wave climate, taking particular attention to the floater dimensions and to the geometrical design of the PTO, which has been redesigned to adapt to the newly introduced surge conditions. For the two-body device, although the dynamic behaviour changes when the surge is included, no relevant differences are observed regarding the power production. When studying the three-body device, results show two clear trends. For high waves, the surge leads to a decrease in the production, whereas for smaller waves it affects positively the power absorption. Overall, the negative contribution is more relevant but also less frequent, leading to no substantial change in the power production. Including the surge mode in the model does not give significant variations in production rates and therefore, may be neglected only for energy production assessment. However, it should always be taken into account at the design stage...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three main parts. The {{first part of the}} master thesis looks at the identification of thruster dynamics and low speed ship dynamics. The relevant parameters identified are time constants and time delays in the system. Simple step tests are used for the identification. Different models for identification are suggested, both for uncoupled surge, sway, and yaw dynamics. Other test results, such as agility plots, DP 4 corner tests, and pure DP tests (stationkeeping) are reported. All the results are to be compared to similar tests performed after R/V Gunnerus has a retrofit of the thruster system. The second part discusses another problem, and that is the topic of numerically estimat- ing the body frame position of the GNSS and MRU sensors. For the GNSS position an Luenberger observer design and an adaptive scheme are proposed and analyzed. The es- timation designs are tested using numerical simulations and experimental data from the Gunnerus sea trials. A similar Luenberger observer is proposed for the MRU positions, and experimental data from the sea trials are used to test the observer. The third part discusses a hybrid augmentation of integral action. The motivation is a DP system, where typically the integral action is tuned very low to avoid oscillations due to the integral action. When there is a sudden load change, such as a ice load that hits the vessel, or if a <b>mooring</b> <b>wire</b> snaps, then a hybrid update augmentation could be useful, to speed up the convergence of the integral action. The update law is a linear update law based on the error in the states (the velocity for the DP system). The augmentation can significantly improve performance, especially for very large disturbance changes. </p...|$|R

We were therefore able to recover all of the sensors and, most importantly, the data stored in them.

40|$|The {{impact of}} fatigue damage on design of FPSO {{position}} mooring systems and specifically slender structure load carrying equipment e. g. <b>mooring</b> chains, <b>wire</b> ropes, synthetic fiber ropes and etc. has changed {{during the past}} few decades. The service location of FPSO vessels has moved from shallow water to deep and ultra-deep waters. In case of shallow water mooring systems (except for north Atlantic like environments) strength based design will most likely meet the fatigue requirements. On the other hand in case of deep-water station keeping operations fatigue is becoming the dominant factor in design of mooring systems. This matter asks for development and introduction of more reliable and accurate toolsets and approaches to provide effective, economical and reliable solutions in the future. The aim {{of this study is to}} first investigate the accuracy of different spectral fatigue estimation methods in comparison with expected fatigue damage using rainflow counting of stress cycles. Then two long term fatigue approximation methods, Wiener chaos expansion and Gaussian approximation, are implemented. Wiener chaos expansion is thought to be the solution to a variety of problems.

40|$|Lately, {{focus is}} put on {{renewable}} energy resources as the environmental concerns regarding exploitation of hydrocarbons are increasing. The enormous energy potential found in offshore wind fields is proposed utilized by installing floating wind turbines in interconnected wind farms. As for all other floating structures operating within a limited area, stationkeeping is {{needed in order to}} keep the motions of the floating structure within permissible limits. In this study, methods for selecting and optimising the mooring system for floating wind turbines in shallow water are investigated. The design of the mooring system is checked against the governing rules and standards. Initially, the forces and moments associated with such structures are identified as the various terms in the equations of motions. Furthermore, the different mooring system concepts investigated in the study are described. They include distributed mass-, clump weight-, and buoyancy element mooring system. They are all based on the Hywind design with three distributed <b>main</b> <b>mooring</b> lines, each split into two delta-lines. Software programs suitable for analysing the system behaviour are recognized as SIMO, Riflex and TDHMILL 3 D. The analysis methods include quasi-static catenary analysis, eigenvalue analysis and decay analysis, in addition to integrated time domain analysis. The mooring system concepts are studied, and the clump weight mooring system is shown to be the preferred one with respect to limiting peak tensions in the mooring lines. The selected design concept is subjected to an optimisation procedure, where the main focus is to select mooring line segments with adequate breaking strength to sustain the maximum line tension with sufficient margins and to avoid vertical forces on the anchors. From parameter studies, the size of the clump weight is shown to be the most influential design parameter. Other parameters investigated include the position of the clump weight, pretension, overall length of the mooring system, chain and wire weight/dimension, vertical fairlead position and the delta-line length. Finally, the intact optimised mooring system is checked against the Ultimate limit state, while Accidental limit state control is performed for the mooring system in damaged condition. Both the cases of loss of line and loss of clump weight are investigated. The Troll field is selected as design location. For the Ultimate limit state, the criteria given in the standards are fulfilled for all directions. For the Accidental limit state, the mooring system design fails to meet the criteria given in the standards. Lack of redundancy is shown as this may cause loss of additional anchorlines. </p...|$|R

40|$|Due to size {{limitations}} of wave basins worldwide {{it is necessary}} to employ statically equivalent truncated mooring and riser systems to test floating systems to be deployed in deep and ultra-deep waters. A procedure for the optimized design of the statically equivalent truncated mooring and riser system was developed using a Genetic Algorithm, considering that the equivalent mooring/system needs to reproduce the net static forces and moments exerted by the prototype mooring/riser system on the floater in its six rigid body degrees of freedom (surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and yaw). A fit-for-purpose program was developed to evaluate the three-dimensional static equilibrium of floating structures, considering the attached mooring and steel catenary riser systems. The static response is calculated for a set of offsets in the surge direction from the calm water equilibrium position up to a maximum user defined offset. Four study cases were considered to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of a Genetic Algorithm procedure developed for the optimize design of the statically equivalent mooring and riser system. The four study cases were a semisubmersible with a symmetric polyester mooring system, a semisubmersible with a symmetric steel <b>wire</b> <b>mooring</b> system, a semisubmersible with a non-symmetric polyester mooring and steel catenary riser system attached, and a spar with a non-symmetric polyester mooring and a steel catenary riser system attached.
