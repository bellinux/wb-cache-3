40|$|Circular <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> are {{commonly}} used for cylindrical columns, such as pylons in cabled-stayed bridges, lighting poles, electric power line posts, and even buildings. In some structures and conditions, a little gap is considered between the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> and foundation. In this case, the whole forces are transmitted to the foundation via bolts. There are several explicit methods for design of rectangular <b>base</b> <b>plates,</b> {{which can be found}} in the AISC steel design guide series and in many other books, but an explicit method has not yet been presented for design of circular <b>base</b> <b>plates.</b> Therefore, in this study, we propose a procedure for designing circular <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> with large eccentric loads in which there is a little gap between <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> and foundation through analytical and numerical methods. It is assumed that the utmost compressive anchor bolt reaches to the allowable compressive stress and also critical section for calculation of <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> thickness to be the edge of the column. Comparison of theoretical and finite element analysis confirms the assumptions. Considered parameters in this study are the axial load and its eccentricity, thickness of <b>base</b> <b>plate,</b> and diameter of anchor bolts. It is concluded that the mentioned status is very useful for columns with large eccentric axial forces, because it causes the thickness of the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> to be less in comparison with the other cases in which a gap is not considered.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining the stiffness and strength of steel storage rack <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assemblies. <b>Base</b> <b>plate</b> assemblies are usually bolted to an upright and to a concrete floor, and {{they are used to}} provide resistance against the flexural buckling of the upright and/or the overall down-aisle buckling of the frame. The semi-rigid stiffness is usually determined by means of a test of two pre-loaded uprights connected to a concrete block in a dual-actuator set-up. Guidance for conducting the test is provided in the European Standard EN 15512. However, several aspects of the test need clarification, notably the test set-up and the transducer arrangement for measuring the rotations of the <b>base</b> <b>plate.</b> This paper provides recommendations for how best to conduct the test, and proposes an alternative test method to that given in the EN 15512 Specification. The paper also identifies the contributions to the deformations of <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assemblies, including the deformations of the supporting floor, the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assembly itself and the upright, and proposes simple expressions for calculating the stiffness associated with each contributing deformation where applicable. Furthermore, the paper proposes a deformation criterion for determining the ultimate design moment for <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> tests which do not attain a peak moment.

40|$|Presented {{here is a}} robot {{friendly}} {{coupling device}} for an orbital replacement unit (ORU). The invention will provide a coupling that is detached and attached remotely by a robot. The design of the coupling must allow for slight misalignments, over-torque protection, and precision placement. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} triangular interface comprising three components. A <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assembly is located on an attachment surface, such as a satellite. The <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assembly has a cup member, a slotted member, and a post member. The ORU that the robot attaches to the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assembly has an ORU plate assembly with two cone members and a post member which mate to the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assembly. As the two plates approach one another, one cone member of the ORU plate assembly has to be placed accurately enough to fall into the cup member of the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assembly. The cup member forces alignment until a second cone falls into a slotted member which provides final alignment. A single bolt is used to attach the two plates. Two deflecting plates are attached to the backs of the plates. When pressure is applied {{to the center of the}} deflecting plates, the force is distributed preventing the ORU and <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> from deflecting. This accounts for precision in the placement of the article.

To evaluate the residual stresses induced during layered manufacturing processes, a strain gauge is attached on the bottom face of the <b>base</b> <b>plate.</b> The residual stress within the consolidated structure is calculated from the amount of strain change measured by the strain gauge when the consolidated structure is cut with an end mill. The influences of <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> thickness and consolidated structure height on the residual stresses are investigated. In addition, the effect of pre-heating and post heating by a laser beam irradiation are evaluated. The results showed that the deformation of the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> increased with the increase of the consolidated layer and the decrease of <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> thickness, and the deformation was flattened when the consolidated structure was completely removed with the end mill. The deformation was related to the induced residual stresses.
