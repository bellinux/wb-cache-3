Secondly, the amount of <b>microalloying</b> elements control the amount of C, N, S, and P in solid solution, which indirectly affects the recrystallization texture obtained after annealing.

This dissertation aims to address {{a gap in the}} literature on MEMS gyroscopes by investigating the effects of elevated temperatures on the performance of MEMS gyroscopes. MEMS gyroscopes are characterized at room and elevated temperatures for both stationary and rotary conditions. During the test, MEMS gyroscopes are subjected to five thermal cycles at each of four temperature ranges (viz. 25 degC to 85 degC, 25 degC to 125 degC, 25 degC to 150 degC and 25 degC to 175 degC). A simulation model is developed in MATLAB Simulink to simulate the temperature effect on the MEMS gyroscope. Simulation results show good agreement with experimental results and confirm that Young's modulus and damping coefficient are the dominant factors responsible for temperature-dependent bias at elevated temperatures. Solder interconnects are one of the weakest elements in MEMS devices. Thus, the reliability of solder interconnects is separately studied in this dissertation. Though, SAC 305 (96. 5 %Sn 3. 0 %Ag 0. 5 %Cu) is the industry preferred solder in combined thermal cycling and shock/drop environments, it exhibits better thermal cycling reliability than drop/shock reliability. One of the ways to improve drop/shock reliability of SnAgCu solder is by <b>microalloy</b> addition of various dopants such as Mn, Ce, Ti, Y, Ge, Bi, Zn, In, Ni, Co etc. Thus, the second part of this dissertation aims to evaluate the shock durability of SAC 305 and SAC 305 -X (where X refers to two different concentrations of Mn and Ce dopants). High temperature isothermal aging tests are conducted on selected solders using QFN 44, QFN 32 and R 2512 package types at 185 degC and 200 degC up to 1000 hours.
