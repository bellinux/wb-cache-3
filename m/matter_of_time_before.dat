The criticism has been against the conservative focus of the barons' role in national politics, ignoring the ascendancy of the commons.

After Duca's death, Carol's popularity plummeted and there were rumours that an attempt would be made on his life at the annual independence parade.

The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E
5|$|After Richard's death, King John of England {{failed to}} {{effectively}} defend Normandy against Philip's ongoing campaigns between 1202 and 1204. Château de Falaise fell to Philip's forces, {{as well as}} castles from Mortain to Pontorson while Philip simultaneously besieged Rouen, which capitulated to French forces on 24June 1204, effectively ending Norman independence. Philip laid siege to Château Gaillard, which was captured after a long siege from September 1203 to March 1204. As Philip continued the siege throughout the winter and King John {{made no attempt to}} relieve the castle, it was only a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> the castellan was forced to capitulate. The main source for the siege is Philippidos, a poem by William the Breton, Philip's chaplain.

One of the most significant of these was the collapse of the western frontier and final loss of southern Italy in 1071. However, the failures of the Byzantine Empire in the West by the eleventh century were simply the end result of much earlier problems. Following the expansion of Islam in the seventh and eighth centuries, Byzantium became more defensive and entrenched in her approach {{to the rest of the}} Mediterranean world. This took the form of an increased restriction and regulation of all trade within her borders. The closing of maritime trade routes hurt her own merchants more than anything else and contributed to the rising prosperity of the nominally Byzantine city-states of Italy along the western frontier. The merchants of these cities, as semi-independent Byzantine subjects, began to dominate the lucrative East-West trading networks of the Mediterranean. This was to weaken the Byzantine merchant marine and, as a consequence, the Byzantine navy in the West. Moreover, the Byzantine state's rigid and entrenched position prevented her from adapting to the new ideas of commerce developing in the West and from exploiting fully the emerging commercial revolution of the tenth and eleventh centuries. As a result, Byzantium's inflexibility and antiquated views began to both weaken her military strength and undermine her authority in the West. As other, more dynamic political alternatives emerged in southern Italy by the eleventh century, Byzantium was to find herself increasingly unable to enforce her political and economic will in the West. It was only a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> then <b>before</b> Byzantine authority was disregarded and eventually replaced by new powers in the regions of southern Italy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to survey East Asian {{employment}} relations in the last decade of the 20 th century. It first examines the frames of reference applied to the study of East Asian employment relations and then identifies some of the critical characteristics for selected countries. At the beginning of the decade there were signs that Japan might not be able to sustain its economic dynamic, but observers were still confident that the Asian "economic miracle" would be extended through the generations of industrialisation: it would only be a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and adjustment <b>before</b> Vietnam and other late industrialisers caught up with the "tigers", and the "tigers" with the "newly industrialised economies" (NIEs). Towards the end of the decade many East Asian countries went into a recession precipitated by a rapid transfer of capital out of the region in 1997. In 1999, however, Korea was making a strong recovery, while Indonesia's economic crisis was exacerbated by a continuing political crisis. The review makes comparisons within the East Asian employment relations context where appropriate and by addressing the question of what constitutes the regionalisation and globalisation dimensions. Attention is paid to the employment conditions of women workers, especially in the export processing zones (EPZs), and, where possible, to the effects on employment relations of the ongoing financial crisis. The review concludes with a summary that draws attention to the divers characteristics of East Asian employment relations...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} his {{paper is to}} survey the East Asian {{employment}} relations context of Korea {{in the last decade}} of the 20 th century. It identifies some of the critical characteristics for each of the countries selected, having first examined the frames of reference applied to the study of East Asian employment relations and adopted a stage of industrialisation criterion for that selection. At the beginning of the decade there were signs that Japan might not be able to sustain its economic dynamic, but observers were still confident that the Asian 'economic miracle' would be extended through the generations of industrialisation: it would only be a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and adjustment <b>before</b> Vietnam and other late industrialisers caught up with the 'tigers', and the 'tigers' with the 'newly industrialised economies' (NIEs). Towards the end of the decade East Asian countries were in recession precipitated by a rapid transfer of capital out of the region in 1997, a transfer enabled by the forces of globalisation that most East Asian countries were eager to embrace. The review identifies some of the critical characteristics for each of the countries selected according to their stage in the industrialisation process in the middle of the decade. It proceeds by making comparisons within the East Asian employment relations context where appropriate and by addressing the question of what constitute the regionalisation and globalisation dimensions. This anticipates the overview of the distinctive features of employment relations developments in East Asian countries according to their rankings in the industrialisation chain. Attention is paid to the employment conditions of women workers, especially in the export processing zones (EPZs), and, where possible, to the effects on employment relations of the ongoing financial crisis. The review concludes with a summary that highlights the main characteristics of East Asian employment relations and their implications for employment relations in Korea...|$|R
5|$|William's elder brother, the Prince of Wales, {{had been}} Prince Regent since 1811 {{because of the}} mental illness of their father, George III. In 1820, the King died, leaving the Crown to the Prince Regent, who became George IV. William, Duke of Clarence, was now second {{in the line of}} succession, preceded only by his brother, Frederick, Duke of York. Reformed since his marriage, William walked for hours, ate {{relatively}} frugally, and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was barley water flavoured with lemon. Both of his older brothers were unhealthy, and it was considered only a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> he became king. When the Duke of York died in 1827, William, then more than 60 years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, the incoming Prime Minister, George Canning, appointed him to the office of Lord High Admiral, which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of Admiralty officers. Things finally came to a head in 1828 when, as Lord High Admiral, he put to sea with a squadron of ships, leaving no word of where they were going, and remaining away for ten days. The King, through the Prime Minister, by now Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, requested his resignation; he complied.|$|E
5|$|For 6 July, Charles {{planned a}} double-envelopment {{that would require}} a quick march from the forces of his brother John, then a few {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} the battlefield. Napoleon's plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout's III Corps {{while the rest of the}} army pinned the Austrian forces. Klenau's VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat's III, opened the fighting in the second day at 4am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling. Meanwhile, a shocking development had occurred overnight. Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the key and central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, an act that seriously compromised the entire French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Massena sent in Molitor's reserve division, which slowly but surely grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To buy time for Davout's materialising assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines, but their efforts led to nothing. To secure his center and his left, Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines. As Davout's men were progressing against the Austrian left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow, oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center, although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area. Nevertheless, when Charles sized up the situation, he realised it was only a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> the Austrian position broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours after noon. His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4pm, too late to have any impact, and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well.|$|E
