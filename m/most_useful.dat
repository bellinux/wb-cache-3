5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as mutations {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E
5|$|Prophylactic cranial {{irradiation}} (PCI) {{is a type}} of radiotherapy to the brain, used {{to reduce}} the risk of metastasis. PCI is <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.|$|E

This measure was <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> in Arctic latitudes with extended twilight and frequent fog and cloud cover. Purity of color {{was important for}} full realization of the Purkinje effect where some colors appear lighter and some appear darker at low levels of illumination. Darkening the pattern increased course deception, but increased visibility at night and in haze.|$|E

5|$|The {{geologic}} temperature record can be reconstructed from sedimentary evidence. Perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> {{indicator of}} past climate is the fractionation of oxygen isotopes, denoted '18O. This fractionation is controlled mainly {{by the amount}} of water locked up in ice and the absolute temperature of the planet, and has allowed a timescale of marine isotope stages to be constructed.|$|E

5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels {{from all over the}} south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of small craft. The <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E
5|$|Although the MSS was the <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> {{instrument}} on Landsat 2, {{sometimes the}} data recorded was anomalous. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them. Known {{issues on the}} MSS are: banding, coherent noise, data loss, impulse noise, oversaturation, scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission striping. Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in post processing.|$|E

50|$|The <b>most</b> {{synthetically}} <b>useful</b> {{ammonium salts}} are the substituted DABCO bis(ammonium) ions, including Selectfluor.

5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to form. When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E
5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E

5|$|In ES MS spectrum, a given {{oligonucleotide}} {{generates a}} set of ions that correspond to different ionization states of the compound. Thus, the oligonucleotide with molecular mass M generates ions with masses (M– nH)/n where M is the molecular mass of the oligonucleotide {{in the form of}} a free acid (all negative charges of internucleosidic phosphodiester groups are neutralized with H+), n is the ionization state, and H is the atomic mass of hydrogen (1 Da). <b>Most</b> <b>useful</b> for characterization are the ions with n ranging from 2 to 5. Software supplied with the more recently manufactured instruments is capable of performing a deconvolution procedure that is, it finds peaks of ions that belong to the same set and derives the molecular mass of the oligonucleotide.|$|E
5|$|In folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often {{play the}} role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most {{harmless}} case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was <b>most</b> <b>useful</b> for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>useful</b> ATP analogs {{cannot be}} hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a {{structure}} {{closely related to}} the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.|$|E

40|$|SummaryProtein {{engineering}} {{has created}} a palette of monomeric fluorescent proteins (FPs), but there remains an ∼ 30  nm spectral gap between the <b>most</b> red-shifted <b>useful</b> Aequorea victoria green FP (GFP) variants and the <b>most</b> blue-shifted <b>useful</b> Discosoma sp. red FP (RFP) variants. To fill this gap, we have engineered a monomeric version of the yellow FP (YFP) from Zoanthus sp. coral. Our preferred variant, designated as mPapaya 1, displays excellent fluorescent brightness, good photostability, and retains its monomeric character both in vitro and in living cells {{in the context of}} protein chimeras. We demonstrate that mPapaya 1 can serve as a good Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor when paired with an mTFP 1 donor. mPapaya 1 is a valuable addition to the palette of FP variants that are useful for multicolor imaging and FRET-based biosensing...|$|R
