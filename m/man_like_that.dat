25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common {{sense of right and wrong}} that does a city good—a decent guy. I {{certainly}} won’t find fault with a <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> After all, there’s an endless supply of stupid fools. The way I see it, if there’s no great shame in it, it's all right.|$|E
25|$|Cutting a leg-break {{is always}} dangerous, and cutting Wright {{is a form}} of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there was of course the marked {{tendency}} to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many good ones, and worried and beat the batsmen so often, that he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove a <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> from the firing -line.|$|E
500|$|... "Si Una Vez" [...] {{is written}} in the key of D minor and is played in a {{moderate}} groove of 84 beats per minute. It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the piano and guitar. Lyrically, Selena reminiscences her failed relationship and wonders why she ever {{fell in love with}} an abusive partner who betrayed and left her, vowing to never allow a <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> back into her life. The lyrics suggest unrequited love and female empowerment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, yes," [...] said Lingard, testily, [...] "we know that, and you {{did your}} best to cram your boot down his throat. No <b>man</b> <b>likes</b> <b>that,</b> my boy." ...|$|R

60|$|In any case, all the Conservatives {{had been}} {{wondering}} for years how {{the king and}} the governor-general and <b>men</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> had tolerated such a man as Bagshaw so long.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of a <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops {{a little more of}} the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit... The one thing I do not want him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play." ...|$|E
500|$|The 59th Division {{was rushed}} to Ireland in {{response}} to the Easter Rising of April 1916, where Blackader's new brigade saw its first active service. Following the Rising, many of those believed by the British authorities to be responsible were tried by military courts; ninety were sentenced to death, of whom fifteen were eventually executed. Blackader, as a senior officer, chaired a number of courts-martial, including those of Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, and Joseph Plunkett, five of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. It appears that Blackader found this task difficult; after Pearse's trial, he is reported to have commented that [...] "I have just done one of the hardest tasks I have ever had to do. I have had to condemn to death one of the finest characters I have ever come across. There must be something very wrong in the state of things that makes a <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> a rebel. I don't wonder that his pupils adored him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Best Line or Quote – [...] "You know, Sunshine, {{you need}} to find a <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to marry. Someone so well-hung that even after three or four kids, he'd still be wall to wall." [...] (Night Embrace by Sherrilyn Kenyon) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{always had}} that. When {{there was any}} game to be played, he always liked to have his own way. But then <b>men</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> are {{just as likely to}} change as others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure he did. I wish I'd known him. We {{need to know}} <b>men</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in this pink-frosting {{playing at}} living we have in cities," [...] Claire said sweetly--not to Milt but to Jeff.|$|R
60|$|ANN. Yes, I know. All the same, Jack, <b>men</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> always live in {{comfortable}} bachelor lodgings {{with broken}} hearts, and are adored by their landladies, and never get married. Men like you always get married.|$|R
2500|$|The noted American author John Dos Passos {{joined the}} {{committee}} and wrote its 127-page official review of the case: Facing the Chair: Story of Americanization of Two Foreignborn Workmen. Dos Passos concluded it [...] "barely possible" [...] that Sacco might have committed murder {{as part of a}} class war, but that the soft-hearted Vanzetti was clearly innocent. [...] "Nobody in his right mind who was planning such a crime would take a <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> along," [...] Dos Passos wrote of Vanzetti. After the executions, the Committee continued its work, helping to gather material that eventually appeared as The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti.|$|E
2500|$|Both wrote {{dozens of}} letters asserting their innocence, insisting {{they had been}} framed because they were anarchists. Their conduct in prison {{consistently}} impressed guards and wardens. In 1927, the Dedham jail chaplain wrote {{to the head of}} an investigatory commission that he had seen no evidence of guilt or remorse on Sacco's part. Vanzetti impressed fellow prisoners at Charlestown State Prison as a bookish intellectual, incapable of committing any violent crime. Novelist John Dos Passos, who visited both men in jail, observed of Vanzetti, [...] "nobody in his right mind who was planning such a crime would take a <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> along." [...] Vanzetti developed his command of English {{to such a degree that}} journalist Murray Kempton later described him as [...] "the greatest writer of English in our century to learn his craft, do his work, and die all in the space of seven years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruby {{was arrested}} {{immediately}} after the shooting, and he told several witnesses {{that he had been}} distraught over President Kennedy's death and had helped the city of Dallas [...] "redeem" [...] itself {{in the eyes of the}} public, and that Oswald's death would spare [...] "…Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial." [...] At the time of the shooting, Ruby said he was taking phenmetrazine, a central nervous system stimulant. Two months after Oswald's death, Ruby broke into tears at his bond hearing, as he talked to reporters regarding the assassination of President Kennedy. His voice breaking, Ruby said that he could not understand [...] "how a great <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> could be lost." [...] According to an unnamed Associated Press source, Ruby made a final statement from his hospital bed on December 19, 1966 that he alone had been responsible for the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald. [...] "There is nothing to hide… There was no one else," [...] Ruby said.|$|E
5000|$|In 1931, the Duke, a Conservative, exposed his brother-in-law, William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp (1872-1938), as a {{homosexual}} to the King and Queen. He reportedly hoped {{to ruin the}} Liberal Party through Beauchamp. The king was horrified, supposedly saying, [...] "I thought <b>men</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> shot themselves." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had lived}} with them, fought beside them; they were his people. He would stand by them to the end--of eternity. Most assuredly, a very {{shocking}} old Viking!

6000|$|... "I {{know how}} you feel, I think," [...] the Major went on, [...] "but {{the best thing to}} do is to forget it. I'm sorry Ramsey fought. To walk into a gang of rough <b>men</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> is foolish and {{dangerous}} too, for the ruffian is generally the best man physically, I'm sorry to say." ...|$|R
60|$|RUTH. Only that I never bowed down to him. I don't see why I should, sir, {{not to a}} <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{even if you}} did I {{imagine that}} wouldn't stop Bosomer. He's an ugly fellow. He's one of the few gunmen I've met who wants to kill {{somebody}} all the time. Most <b>men</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> are fourflushes. But Bosomer is all one color, and that's red. Merely for your own sake I advise you to hit the trail." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{reported}} to King George V and Queen Mary by his Tory brother-in-law, the Duke of Westminster, who hoped to ruin the Liberal Party through Beauchamp, as well as Beauchamp personally due his private dislike of Beauchamp. Homosexuality was a criminal offence at the time, and the King was horrified, rumoured to have said, [...] "I thought <b>men</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> shot themselves".|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what good}} will {{thinking}} do? You must do something. Oh! Margaret, {{after all that}} you said {{to him when he}} lay there dying!"

60|$|BARTHWICK. Tcha! Of {{course he}} took it too! A <b>man</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> Jones will {{make the most of}} it. It'll get into the papers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Troth, I'm {{not so sure}} o' that, sor. The rap was a stiff wan, no doubt, but <b>men</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> are not aisy to kill.
