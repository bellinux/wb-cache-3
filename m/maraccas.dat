'A {{body of the}} mutineers {{now made}} towards the road to <b>Maraccas,</b> when the colonel and his three assistants {{contrived}} to get behind a silk- cotton tree, and recommenced firing on them. The Africans hesitated and set forward, when the little party continued to fire on them; {{they set up a}} yell, and retreated down the hill.|$|E
6000|$|My {{first point}} was, of course, the little city of San Josef. To an Englishman, the place will be always {{interesting}} as {{the scene of}} Raleigh's exploit, and the capture of Berreos; and, to one who has received the kindness which I have received from the Spanish gentlemen of the neighbourhood, a spot full of most grateful memories. It lies pleasantly enough, on a rise at the southern foot of the mountains, and {{at the mouth of}} a torrent which comes down from the famous 'Chorro,' or waterfall, of <b>Maraccas.</b> In going up to that waterfall, just {{at the back of the}} town, I found buried, in several feet of earth, a great number of seemingly recent but very ancient shells. Whether they be remnants of an elevated sea-beach, or of some Indian 'kitchen-midden,' I dare not decide. But the question is well worth the attention of any geologist who may go that way. The waterfall, and the road up to it, are best described by one who, after fourteen years of hard scientific work in the island, now lies lonely in San Fernando churchyard, far from his beloved Fatherland--he, or at least all of him that could die. I wonder whether that of him which can never die, knows what his Fatherland is doing now? But to the waterfall of <b>Maraccas,</b> or rather to poor Dr. Krueger's description of it:-- ...|$|E
60|$|We descended, I remember, to the sea-shore again, at {{a certain}} <b>Maraccas</b> Bay, and had a long ride along bright sands, between surf and scrub; in which ride, by the by, the civiliser of Montserrat and I, to avoid the {{blinding}} glare of the sand, rode along the firm sand between {{the sea and the}} lagoon, through the low wood of Shore Grape and Mahaut, Pinguin and Swamp Seguine {249b}--which last is an Arum with a knotted stem, from three to twelve feet high. We brushed our way along with our cutlasses, as we sat on our saddles, enjoying the cool shade; till my companion's mule found herself jammed tight in scrub, and unable to forge either ahead or astern. Her rider was jammed too, and unable to get off; and the two had to be cut out of the bush by fair hewing, amid much laughter, while the wise old mule, as the cutlasses flashed close to her nose, never moved a muscle, perfectly well aware of what had happened, and how she was to be got out of the scrape, as she had been probably fifty times before.|$|E

He was joined by Per Gessle (known as Thomas Nyberg), Lasse Göransson (Thomas Holst), Roland Bergström (MP Persson) and Kalle Johansson (Micke Syd Andersson). The band and its songs were based on De ensamma pojkarna (Swedish for The Lonely Boys) by the Swedish author Mats Olsson about a young rhythm'n'pop band from the south of Sweden in 1965.|$|E
