The Shiv Sena party was established on 19 June 1966 by Bombay cartoonist Bal Thackeray, out of a feeling of resentment about the relative <b>marginalization</b> <b>of</b> the native Marathi people in their native state Maharashtra. In the 1960s and 1970s, Shiv Sena fought for rights of native Marathis. In the late 1960s, Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade were reclaimed and developed. During the 1970 there were Bombay-Bhiwandi riots. During the 1970s, coastal communication increased between Bombay and south western coast of India, after introduction of ships by the London-based trade firm Shepherd. These ships facilitated the entry of Goan and Mangalorean Catholics to Bombay.|$|E
5|$|The <b>marginalization</b> <b>of</b> the Iranian Bahá'ís {{by current}} governments {{is rooted in}} {{historical}} efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions. Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression aimed at individual Bahá'ís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bahá'í community and its institutions were initiated. In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Bahá'ís were killed. Bahá'í schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girls' schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 1940s, Bahá'í marriages were not recognized and Bahá'í texts were censored.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{economic}} activity, permanent {{settlement of the}} peninsula did not intensify until the 1860s and even then it remained sporadic until 1917. The population of Kola in 1880, for example, was only around 500inhabitants living in 80households, compared to 1,900inhabitants in 300households living there in 1582. Transportation facilities were virtually non-existent and the communication {{with the rest of}} Russia irregular. 1887 saw an influx of Izhma Komi and Nenets people who were migrating to the peninsula to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands and brought their large deer herds with them, resulting in increased competition for the grazing lands, a conflict between the Komi and the Sami, and in <b>marginalization</b> <b>of</b> the local Sami population. By the end of the 19th century, the Sami population had mostly been forced north, with ethnic Russians settling in the south of the peninsula.|$|E

40|$|The sigma point (SP) filter, {{also known}} as unscented Kalman filter, is an {{attractive}} alternative to the extended Kalman filter and the particle filter. Here, we extend the SP filter to nonsequential Bayesian inference corresponding to loopy factor graphs. We propose sigma point belief propagation (SPBP) as a low-complexity approximation of the belief propagation (BP) message passing scheme. SPBP achieves approximate <b>marginalizations</b> <b>of</b> posterior distributions corresponding to (generally) loopy factor graphs. It is well suited for decentralized inference because of its low communication requirements. For a decentralized, dynamic sensor localization problem, we demonstrate that SPBP can outperform nonparametric (particle-based) BP while requiring significantly less computations and communications.

40|$|Abstract: Feminism {{is a broad}} socio {{political}} movement specially advocating women’s welfare in society. Deriving upon this philosophy many women writers, thinkers and critics have formulated a school of thought that searches for such instances in literature. The main task of the feminist literary critics seems to stand guard against the curbing patriarchal norms which have been inhered perpetually. The <b>marginalizations</b> <b>of</b> women, their predicament, struggle for identity, finding their own space, celebrating the female body are the chief subjects of this trend. The protagonists of all the novels of Manju Kapur are seen as women struggling against all odds. Manju Kapur has always tried to depict {{the picture of the}} sufferings of women at deeper level in her novels...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a measure-theoretic {{version of the}} Junction Tree {{algorithm}} to compute the <b>marginalizations</b> <b>of</b> a product function. We reformulate the problem in a measure-theoretic framework, where the desired marginalizations are viewed as conditional expectations of a product function given certain #-fields. We generalize the notions of independence and junction trees {{at the level of}} these #-fields and produce algorithms to find or construct a junction tree on a given set of # [...] fields. By taking advantage of structures at the atomic level of the sample space, our marginalization algorithm is capable of producing solutions far less complex than GDL-type algorithms (see [1]). Our formalism reduces to the old GDL as a special case, and any GDL marginalization problem can be reexamined with our framework for possible savings in complexity. ...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{based on}} {{qualitative}} research on the North African second-generation in Paris and the Turkish second-generation in Berlin, we discuss ethnic minorities’ attachment to place and how living in highly diverse cities shape their perceptions and experiences <b>of</b> <b>marginalization</b> and belonging. Even though France and Germany have different state-level approaches to citizenship and belonging, the experiences <b>of</b> <b>marginalization</b> and exclusion <b>of</b> the second generation in the city are rather similar. In both societies, ethnic and religious minorities such as the North African or Turkish second-generation are excluded from mainstream society. This exclusion is experienced on the local level. Thereby the geography of Berlin and Paris impacts ethnic second-generation populations’ feeling {{of belonging to the}} communities in which they live, as well as how they understand their experiences of racism and exclusion. This research has implications for understanding the multivariate experiences of middle-class second-generation ethnic populations across Europe.|$|R

25|$|This {{significant}} {{growth in}} the Muslim population relative to the Christian population created tension over political representation, particularly when large sections of the Poso economy were controlled by Muslim migrants.
