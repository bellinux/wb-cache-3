40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that two major gene pools exist in cultivated common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), a Middle American and an Andean one. Some evidence, based on unique phaseolin morphotypes and AFLP analysis, suggests {{that at least}} one more gene pool exists in cultivated common bean. To investigate this hypothesis, 1072 accessions from a common bean core collection from the primary centres of origin, held at CIAT, were investigated. Various agronomic and morphological attributes (14 categorical and 11 quantitative) were measured. Multivariate analyses, consisting of homogeneity analysis and clustering for categorical data, clustering and ordination techniques for quantitative data and nonlinear principal component analysis for mixed data, were undertaken. The results of most analyses supported the existence of the two major gene pools. However, the analysis of categorical data of protein types showed an additional <b>minor</b> <b>gene</b> pool.

40|$|Key message Hard red wheats can donate {{genes to}} hard white wheats for {{tolerance}} to preharvest sprouting, {{the effects are}} quantitative in nature, and may be tracked with previously described DNA markers. Abstract Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can negatively impact end-use quality and seed viability at planting. Due to preferences for white over red wheat in international markets, white wheat with PHS tolerance has become increasingly desired for worldwide wheat production. In general, however, red wheat is more tolerant of sprouting than white wheat. The main objective {{of this study was}} the identification of PHS tolerance conditioned by genes donated from hard red winter wheat, using markers applicable to the Great Plains hard white wheat gene pool. Three red wheat by white wheat populations, Niobrara/NW 99 L 7068, NE 98466 /NW 99 L 7068 and Jagalene/ NW 99 L 7068 were developed, and white-seeded progenies were analyzed for PHS tolerance and used to identify markers for the trait. In the three populations, marker loci with significant allelic effects were most commonly located on chromosomes of group 2, 3, 4 and 5, though additional markers were detected across the wheat genome. Chromosome 3 A was the only chromosome with significant markers in all three populations. Markers were inconsistent across the three populations, and markers linked to tolerance-inducing loci were identified in both tolerant and susceptible parents. Additive effects of marker loci were common. In the present investigation, a wide range of PHS tolerance was observed, even though all lines were fixed for the recently reported positive TaPHS 1 allele. PHS tolerance is controlled by additive major gene effects with <b>minor</b> <b>gene</b> effects where variations of <b>minor</b> <b>gene</b> effects were still unclear...|$|E

The effects of <b>minor</b> <b>genes</b> were not large enough to change the phenotypic performance determined by its major gene qualitatively (from resistant to susceptible, or vice versa) based on the measurement scale used. However, they did substantially and significantly modify the resistance level. The major gene for foliar resistance was linked to the gene(s) for seed infection rate and/or had a positive pleiotrophic effect on seed infection rate. Similarly, the major gene for foliar resistance was linked to the gene(s) for seed yield/plant in disease free environments and/or had negative pleiotrophic effects on yield/plant.

40|$|The {{parasitic}} angiosperms Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. and S. asiatica (L.) Kuntze severely constrain {{cereal production}} in sub-Saharan Africa. A resistance mechanism to these root parasites in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is low exudation of striga seed germination stimulants. The trait {{is controlled by}} a single recessive gene in the sorghum x S. asiatica interaction, but information is lacking for S. hermonthica. Objectives of this investigation were to study the inheritance of stimulation of S. hermonthica seed germination in three F 2 and two F 3 : 5 recombinant inbred populations of sorghum, and {{to determine the effects}} of striga populations from Mali, Niger, and Kenya on the effectiveness of the low-stimulant character. An agar-gel assay was employed for this purpose. In this laboratory assay, the maximal distance between sorghum rootlets and germinated striga seed ("maximal germination distance") reflects the magnitude of germination stimulation. Bimodal frequency distributions supported the hypothesis of one recessive gene with a major effect for low maximal germination distance in progenies from crosses of low-stimulant lines (Framida, IS 9830) with a high-stimulant line (E 36 - 1), tested with striga from Mali or Niger. However, low- versus high-stimulant classes were not always clearly distinct, indicating that additional <b>minor</b> <b>genes</b> modified maximal germination distance in the progenies. The Kenyan striga population led to higher maximal germination distances and larger overlap of low- and high-stimulant classes than striga from Mali or Niger. <b>Minor</b> <b>genes</b> seemed therefore more important with Kenyan striga seed. The general involvement of <b>minor</b> <b>genes</b> in stimulating S. hermonthica seed germination was also evident from the heritable, quantitative variation observed in F 3 : 5 lines derived from a cross of the high-stimulant lines N 13 and E 36 - 1.

40|$|Background: The {{evolutionary}} {{events that}} have shaped biodiversity patterns in the African rainforests are still poorly documented. Past forest fragmentation and ecological gradients have been advocated as important drivers of genetic differentiation but their respective roles remain unclear. Using nuclear microsatellites (nSSRs) and chloroplast non-coding sequences (pDNA), we characterised the spatial genetic structure of Erythrophleum (Fabaceae) forest trees in West and Central Africa (Guinea Region, GR). This widespread genus displays a wide ecological amplitude and taxonomists recognize two forest tree species, E. ivorense and E. suaveolens, which are difficult to distinguish {{in the field and}} often confused. Results: Bayesian-clustering applied on nSSRs of a blind sample of 648 specimens identified three major gene pools showing no or very limited introgression. They present parapatric distributions correlated to rainfall gradients and forest types. One gene pool is restricted to coastal evergreen forests and corresponds to E. ivorense; a second one is found in gallery forests from the dry forest zone of West Africa and North-West Cameroon and corresponds to West-African E. suaveolens; the third gene pool occurs in semi-evergreen forests and corresponds to Central African E. suaveolens. These gene pools have mostly unique pDNA haplotypes but they do not form reciprocally monophyletic clades. Nevertheless, pDNA molecular dating indicates that the divergence between E. ivorense and Central African E. suaveolens predates the Pleistocene. Further Bayesian-clustering applied within each major gene pool identified diffuse genetic discontinuities (<b>minor</b> <b>gene</b> pools displaying substantial introgression) at a latitude between 0 and 2 °N in Central Africa for both species, and at a longitude between 5 ° and 8 °E for E. ivorense. Moreover, we detected evidence of past population declines which are consistent with historical habitat fragmentation induced by Pleistocene climate changes. Conclusions: Overall, deep genetic differentiation (major gene pools) follows ecological gradients that may be at the origin of speciation, while diffuse differentiation (<b>minor</b> <b>gene</b> pools) are tentatively interpreted as the signature of past forest fragmentation induced by past climate changes. © 2013 Duminil et al. licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The results are relevant for novel introductions and for an established population whose existence is threatened by a sudden change in the environment.

We find as a general (though not universal) pattern that prospects for persistence narrow as more loci contribute to fitness, in effect because selection per locus is increasingly weakened with more loci, which can even overwhelm any initial enhancement of fitness that adding loci might provide. When loci contribute unequally to fitness, genes of small effect can significantly reduce extinction risk.
