5|$|Before its release, many journalists {{expected}} Pirates of the Caribbean to be a flop. The pirate genre had {{not been}} successful for years, with Cutthroat Island (1995) being a notable flop. The film was also based on a theme park ride, and Depp, known <b>mostly</b> <b>for</b> starring in cult films at the time, had little track record as a box office leading man.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{diamonds}} {{are valued}} <b>mostly</b> <b>for</b> their hardness and heat conductivity, with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly irrelevant. About 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20tonnes annually) are unsuitable {{for use as}} gemstones are relegated for industrial use (known as bort). synthetic diamonds, invented in the 1950s, found almost immediate industrial applications; 3billion carats (600tonnes) of synthetic diamond is produced annually.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive {{methods such as}} the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, <b>mostly</b> <b>for</b> the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the first}} Broken Sword game, which {{garnered}} critical acclaim, The Smoking Mirror received mixed to positive reviews, <b>mostly</b> <b>for</b> not {{living up to}} its predecessor. Nevertheless, it was a commercial success, selling about one million copies in the mid-1990s. Revolution released a remastered version of the game in 2010, which unlike the original version, received highly favorable reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and <b>mostly</b> <b>for</b> promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. <b>Mostly</b> <b>for</b> the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E
5|$|As {{far as we}} know, the {{earliest}} cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, <b>mostly</b> <b>for</b> special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Muhammad {{married the}} wealthy Khadijah bint Khuwaylid who was 40 years old. The {{marriage}} lasted for 25years and was a happy one. Muhammad did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage. After Khadija's death, Khawla bint Hakim suggested to Muhammad that he should marry Sawda bint Zama, a Muslim widow, or Aisha, daughter of Um Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Muhammad {{is said to have}} asked for arrangements to marry both. Muhammad's marriages after the death of Khajida were contracted <b>mostly</b> <b>for</b> political or humanitarian reasons. The women were either widows of Muslims killed in battle and had been left without a protector, or belonged to important families or clans whom it was necessary to honor and strengthen alliances with.|$|E

Following three more seasons in the minor leagues, he stayed in the major leagues after signing with the Indians in 1916. During his nine seasons with the Indians, his accomplishments included winning three games during the 1920 World Series.|$|E
5|$|Boult's {{recordings}} {{fall into}} three main periods. In the first, from 1920 {{to the end}} of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major labels, and although he made a substantial number of discs for Decca, he recorded <b>mostly</b> <b>for</b> smaller labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of his key repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.|$|E
5|$|By 1829, Randolph {{had three}} {{commission}} warehouses, six dry goods stores, ten physicians and one tavern. In 1834, Randolph had {{a population of}} approximately 1,000. By that time, the town had four hotels, almost fifty businesses, private schools, and more than ten saloons. In the 1830s, two newspapers were published in Randolph, the Randolph Recorder and the Randolph Whig. In the 1830s, the first bank was founded and a stagecoach line provided a connection between Randolph and Jackson twice a week. The commercial success of Randolph can be attributed {{in part to the}} use of slave labor, <b>mostly</b> <b>for</b> the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated. In the Randolph Recorder during the early 1830s, landowners announced public auctions of slaves or offered rewards for runaway or stolen slaves.|$|E
