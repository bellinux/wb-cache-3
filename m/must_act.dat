5|$|As an {{independent}} company, Obsidian believes that they <b>must</b> <b>act</b> and react quickly to market changes and not stagnate on any certain point. While the core focus of Obsidian was still developing character-driven role-playing games, the team {{were willing to}} try out projects that are smaller and are in different genres. The decision to develop Armored Warfare is one result of this strategy.|$|E
5|$|Once a colossus is found, {{the player}} must {{discover}} its weaknesses to defeat it. Each colossus dwells {{in a unique}} lair, and many colossi cannot be defeated without making use of the surrounding environment. Every colossus {{has at least one}} weak point, indicated by a glowing sigil that can be illuminated and identified by the sword's reflected light. Each colossus has areas covered with fur or protruding ledges, which Wander may use to grip and scale the colossus while it thrashes about in an attempt to dislodge him. While scaling a colossus, the player <b>must</b> <b>act</b> quickly, as Wander has a limited stamina gauge that decreases while he hangs onto the creature.|$|E
5|$|There {{are limits}} on the power a device may draw, {{stated in terms of}} a unit load, which is 100mA or 150mA for SuperSpeed devices. There are {{low-power}} and high-power devices. Low-power devices may draw at most 1 unit load, and all devices <b>must</b> <b>act</b> as low-power devices when starting out as unconfigured. High-power devices draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (500mA) or 6 unit loads (900mA) for SuperSpeed devices. A high-powered device must be configured, and may only draw as much power as specified in its configuration. I.e., the maximum power may not be available.|$|E

5|$|Whenever the Prime Minister is ill, {{absent from}} Singapore, or has been granted {{leave of absence}} from his duties, the {{functions}} conferred on him by the Constitution are exercisable by any other Minister authorized by the President. In general, the President <b>must</b> <b>act</b> in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice in appointing a Minister for this purpose. However, the President may act in his own discretion if in his opinion it is impracticable to obtain the advice of the Prime Minister due to his illness or absence.|$|E
5|$|In the Republic of India, a {{governor}} is the constitutional head {{of each of}} the twenty-nine states. The governor is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, and holds office at the President's pleasure. The governor is de jure head of the state government; all its executive actions are taken in the governor's name. However, the governor <b>must</b> <b>act</b> on the advice of the popularly elected council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, who thus hold de facto executive authority at the state-level. The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon his or her own discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. Over the years, the exercise of these discretionary powers have given rise to conflict between the elected chief minister and the central government–appointed governor.|$|E

25|$|In {{this way}} the {{classification}} of Euclidean Jordan algebras is reduced to that of simple ones. For a simple algebra E all inner products for which the operators L(a) are self adjoint are proportional. Indeed, any other product has the form (Ta, b) for some positive self-adjoint operator commuting with the L(a)'s. Any non-zero eigenspace of T is an ideal in A and therefore by simplicity T <b>must</b> <b>act</b> on the whole of E as a positive scalar.|$|E
25|$|Hungry Jack's {{also argued}} that the Development Agreement {{included}} an implied term of good faith (that is, that the parties <b>must</b> <b>act</b> in good faith when exercising their rights under the contract), and that Burger King had breached this term by denying the financial and operating approval to new restaurants, leading to Hungry Jack's failing to meet the minimum stores requirement.

25|$|People with OCD {{understand}} that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, {{they feel that they}} <b>must</b> <b>act</b> as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in compulsive hoarding might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level.

25|$|When {{there is}} an {{increased}} demand for base money, the central bank <b>must</b> <b>act</b> if it wishes to maintain the short-term interest rate. It does this by increasing the supply of base money: {{it goes to the}} open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds. To pay for these assets, new central bank money is generated in the seller's loro account, increasing the total amount of base money in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the base money is reduced.|$|E
25|$|In the {{rejected}} Treaty {{establishing a}} Constitution for Europe the charter was integrated {{as a part}} of the treaty itself. In the Lisbon Treaty, however, the charter is incorporated by reference and given legal status without forming part of the treaties. The EU <b>must</b> <b>act</b> and legislate consistently with the Charter and the EU's courts will strike down EU legislation which contravenes it. The Charter only applies to EU member states as regards their implementation of EU law and does not extend the competences of the EU beyond its competences as defined in the treaties.|$|E
25|$|All {{sound is}} {{inherently}} powerful. If a hunter kills a lion {{he can see}} it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he <b>must</b> <b>act,</b> fast, because {{the sound of the}} lion signals its presence and its power. Speech is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.|$|E
