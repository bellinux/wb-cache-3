5|$|An {{analysis}} of Pluto's orbit by Matthew J. Holman and Matthew J. Payne found perturbations {{much larger than}} predicted by Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit for Planet Nine. Holman and Payne suggested three possible explanations: systematic errors in the measurements of Pluto's orbit; an unmodeled <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, such as a small planet {{in the range of}} 60– (potentially explaining the Kuiper cliff); or a planet more massive or closer to the Sun instead of the planet predicted by Batygin and Brown.|$|E

5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Catholic priests {{had come}} to Rosendale as early as 1840, and the first <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village was held in a cooper's shop. The {{original}} Church of St. Peter was completed {{in the summer of}} 1850, and the first mass in that building was held on August15. The church was not officially incorporated until April29, 1865. A newer, larger building was constructed in 1876, on the same road as the village's rail depot. The new building followed an English Gothic architecture style. It was made of bricks, created near the North River, and was ornamented with yellow bricks from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and sandstone from Amherst, New York. The first <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new church occurred on December25, 1876; the building's total construction cost was $31,000. The Church of St. Peter {{is the only one of}} the village's churches that still functions as a church.|$|E

5|$|Every {{galaxy of}} {{sufficient}} <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Local Group has an associated group of globular clusters, {{and almost every}} large galaxy surveyed {{has been found to}} possess a system of globular clusters. The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legs, particularly at the ankles. To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He found a few similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less muscle <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ankles but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E

The use of La Silla's TRAPPIST telescope helped the science team working on the planet to create a light curve of the planet's transit in December 2010.|$|E

There were twelve Masses each Sunday: six <b>Masses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper church and another six <b>Masses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower church.

5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower {{digestible}} energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains.

5|$|The Kibble balance {{requires}} extremely {{precise measurement}} of the local gravitational acceleration g in the laboratory, using a gravimeter. For instance, the NIST compensates for Earth's gravity gradient of 309µGal per metre when the elevation {{of the center of}} the gravimeter differs from that of the nearby test <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kibble balance; a change in the weight of a one-kilogram test mass that equates to about 316µg/m.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Rite is {{the most}} common rite of worship used by the Catholic Church. Its use is found worldwide, {{originating}} in Rome and spreading throughout Europe, influencing and eventually supplanting local rites. The present ordinary form of <b>Mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman Rite, found in the post-1969 editions of the Roman Missal, is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language, using an officially approved translation from the original text in Latin.

5|$|Allen again {{weakened}} to a Category4 storm due to friction with Mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle, but restrengthened into a Category5 hurricane for a {{third time}} as it moved over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop to , the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western Gulf of Mexico. Shortly before landfall, a dry air <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western Gulf of Mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially. Allen made landfall north of Brownsville, Texas as a Category3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). It became extratropical on August 11.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E

5|$|Banff National Park has a subarctic climate {{with three}} ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests {{are dominated by}} Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but {{only a limited number}} of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although {{in some cases}} cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E
