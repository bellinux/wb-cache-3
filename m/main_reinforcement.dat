40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 19 th century, confined concrete is a popular topic among researchers. This is because, the ductile behaviour and strength of the concrete increases, when it is confined. Hence confinement effect is considered in seismic design of concrete structures.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that transverse reinforcement not only provides the strength and stiffness for reinforced concrete (RC) members through direct resistance to external force demands, but also helps confine the inner core concrete. The confinement effect can lead to improved overall structural performance by delaying the onset of concrete fracture and allowing more inelastic energy dissipation through an increase in both strength and deformability of RC members. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of confinement due to the transverse reinforcement on enhancing the shear performance of RC members. A new constitutive model of RC members was proposed by extending the Modified Compression Field Theory (MCFT) to incorporate the effect of confinement due to transverse reinforcement by adjusting the peak stress and peak strain of confined concrete in compression. The peak stress of confined concrete was determined from the five-parameter failure surface for concrete developed by Willam and Warnke (1974). The peak strain adjustment was carried out using a relationship proposed by Mander et al. (1988). The proposed analytical model was compared with results from an experimental program on sixteen RC bent caps with varied longitudinal and transverse reinforcement details. Two-dimensional Finite Element Modeling (FEM) using the proposed constitutive model was conducted to numerically simulate the RC bent cap response. Results showed that the proposed analytical model yielded good results on the prediction of the strength but significantly overestimated the post-cracking stiffness of the RC bent cap specimens. The results also indicated that the confinement effect led to enhanced overall performance by increasing both the strength and deformability of the RC bent caps. Two potential causes of the discrepancy in the underestimation of the RC bent cap deformations, namely the effects of concrete shrinkage and interfacial bond-slip between the concrete and <b>main</b> flexural <b>reinforcement</b> in the bent caps, were discussed. Parametric studies showed that the tension-stiffening in the proposed constitutive models to implicitly take into account the bond-slip between the concrete and <b>main</b> flexural <b>reinforcement</b> was the major cause of the overestimation of the post-cracking stiffness of RC bent caps.

40|$|The current American Concrete Institute code {{states that}} the nominal shear {{strength}} V n of a reinforced concrete deep beam consists of the concrete contribution V c and shear reinforcement contribution V s, i. e., V n=V c+V s. In this paper, however, a very different yet original approach is presented. The method is based on strut-and-tie approach, with the effect of transverse tensile stresses on concrete compressive strength of the diagonal strut properly accounted for. Two common failure modes, namely, diagonal splitting and concrete crushing, are examined in the paper. Premature failures such as shear tension failure (due to insufficient anchorage of <b>main</b> longitudinal <b>reinforcement)</b> and bearing failures are not considered. The resistance to diagonal splitting is mainly provided by the <b>main</b> and shear <b>reinforcement.</b> Additional resistance from concrete tensile strength {{is included in the}} analysis. The resistance to crushing of concrete is contributed by the concrete compressive strength. Ultimate shear strengths of deep beams are governed by both the transverse tensile stresses perpendicular to the diagonal strut, and the compressive stresses in the diagonal strut, resulting in an interaction between the two failure modes. Predictions by the proposed modal are compared with experimental results and other established calculation methods. Generally, the predictions are not only accurate and consistent in each case study, but also conservative. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
