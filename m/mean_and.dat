5|$|Climate in {{a narrow}} sense is usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the {{statistical}} description {{in terms of the}} <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> variability of relevant quantities {{over a period of time}} ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
5|$|The Marriott School {{student body}} {{comprises}} approximately 1,900 undergraduate and 1,100 graduate students. Nearly 75 {{percent of the}} students are bilingual and about 30 percent speak a third language, most having lived abroad while serving a mission for the LDS Church. Approximately 16 percent of students are international students, 66 percent are married, and whites (non-Hispanic) comprise 91 percent of the student body as of 2009. Eighty-seven percent of domestic students hail from the West. The <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> median ages of undergraduate students is 23, 21 percent of whom are female. Female MBA students only account for 13 percent of the graduating class.|$|E

30|$|We {{calculated}} <b>means</b> <b>and</b> variances {{of final}} bacterial density across the replicate populations of each combination of bacterial mutation rate, experimental treatment, and assay plate environment. The table in Additional file 1 gives the resulting 40 pairs of <b>means</b> <b>and</b> variances. As <b>means</b> <b>and</b> variances were calculated over distinct replicate populations {{at a given}} time, and not for individual replicates observed over time, we examined whether these final <b>means</b> <b>and</b> variances {{and those of the}} ancestral lines obeyed the ensemble (or equivalently, spatial) form of Taylor's law, and if so, whether b of Taylor's law depended on the ancestral lines, experimental treatments, or assay plate environment (SAS 2009; Mathworks 2011).|$|R

5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adams’ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> greedy.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{distribution}} {{is the only}} absolutely continuous distribution whose cumulants beyond the first two (i.e., other than the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> variance) are zero. It is also the continuous distribution with the maximum entropy for a specified <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> variance. Geary has shown, assuming that the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> variance were finite, that the {{normal distribution}} is the only distribution where the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> variance are independent. This theorem was later reproved by Lukas who only assumed that the variance was finite.|$|E
25|$|Better approximations to the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> {{variance}} {{are given}} by Levin (1984, 1990), McCullagh and Nelder (1989), Liao (1992), and Eisinga and Pelzer (2011).

This analysis of <b>means</b> <b>and</b> ends yields a host of valuable insights and significant research questions. It also provides an important foundation for evaluating proposed regulatory reforms. A reasonably complete theory, at a minimum, should also explain key features of the enforcement regime and the allocation of authority among governments.

25|$|The {{rule that}} for some {{distributions}} {{the difference between the}} <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> the mode is three times that between the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> the median is due to Pearson who discovered it while investigating his Type 3 distributions.

25|$|An {{alternative}} method {{of establishing a}} reference range with the assumption of log-normal distribution {{is to use the}} arithmetic <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> arithmetic value of standard deviation. This is somewhat more tedious to perform, but may be useful for example in cases where a study that establishes a reference range presents only the arithmetic <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> standard deviation, leaving out the source data. If the original assumption of arithmetically normal distribution is shown to be less appropriate than the log-normal one, then, using the arithmetic <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> standard deviation may be the only available parameters to correct the reference range.|$|E
30|$|In {{the theory}} of {{operator}}s, the operator <b>means</b> <b>and</b> operator inequalities are two key concepts. An effective method to study operators is to find some refinements among some operator <b>means,</b> <b>and</b> these inequalities are usually based on scalars or matrices.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that we need to {{distinguish}} between <b>means</b> <b>and</b> end information about actions.

Action meaningfulness or familiarity differs between cultures. In a cross-cultural setting, we investigated how action familiarity influences recognition memory for <b>means</b> <b>and</b> end information. Object directed actions of differential familiarity were presented to Chinese and German participants. Action familiarity modulated the representation of <b>means</b> <b>and</b> end information in both cultures in the same way, although the effects were based on different stimulus sets.
