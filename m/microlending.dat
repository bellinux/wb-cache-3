25|$|Microloans, {{made famous}} by the Grameen Bank, is where small amounts of money are loaned to farmers or villages, mostly women, who can then obtain {{physical}} capital to increase their economic rewards. However, <b>microlending</b> {{has been criticized for}} making hyperprofits off the poor even from its founder, Muhammad Yunus, and in India, Arundhati Roy asserts that some 250,000 debt-ridden farmers have been driven to suicide.|$|E

40|$|We propose an {{in-depth}} study of lending behaviors in Kiva using {{a mix of}} quantitative and large-scale data mining techniques. Kiva is a non-profit organization that offers an online platform to connect lenders with borrowers. Their site, kiva. org, allows citizens to <b>microlend</b> small amounts of money to entrepreneurs (borrowers) from different countries. The borrowers are always affiliated with a Field Partner (FP) {{which can be a}} microfinance institution (MFI) or other type of local organization that has partnered with Kiva. Field partners give loans to selected businesses based on their local knowledge regarding the country, the business sector including agriculture, health or manufacture among others, and the borrower. Our objective is to understand the relationship between lending activity and various features offered by the online platform. Specifically, we focus on two research questions: (i) the role that MFI ratings play in driving lending activity and (ii) the role that various loan features have in the lending behavior. The first question analyzes whether there exists a relationship between the MFI ratings - that lenders can explore online - and their lending volumes. The second research question attempts to understand if certain loan features - available online at Kiva - such as the type of small business, the gender of the borrower, or the loan's country information might affect the way lenders lend.

5000|$|Zidisha defines its {{repayment}} and writeoff statistics more conservatively {{than other}} <b>microlending</b> websites. For example, Kiva, the world's largest <b>microlending</b> website, reports any loans not yet {{written off as}} repaid, {{even if they are}} still outstanding with the borrower. [...] Kiva also counts repayments made by field partners to cover borrower defaults as part of its on-time repayment rate.|$|E
50|$|These factors incentivized {{the public}} and private {{supports}} to have <b>microlending</b> activity in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|Starting in 2009, {{after doing}} an episode on how <b>microlending</b> works, the show began {{encouraging}} listeners to make loans on the online <b>microlending</b> site Kiva. [...] A Stuff You Should Know team had raised $150,000 {{by the middle}} of 2010, and more than $2.75 million by November 2014. [...] In 2009 they challenged Stephen Colbert to see whose team could raise $100,000 first and they [...] "beat the pants off of" [...] him, reaching that goal in three months.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Jessica Jackley co-founded Kiva, the world's first {{peer-to-peer}} online <b>microlending</b> platform, {{after working}} as an intern with Village Enterprise in East Africa.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea for}} the service is derived from group banking concepts, such as {{rotating}} savings and credit associations. Other motivating ideas derive from the concepts of <b>microlending</b> and microfinance.|$|E
50|$|Prior to ProFounder, Jackley was {{co-founder and}} Chief Marketing Officer of Kiva, the world's first p2p <b>microlending</b> website. Jackley and Matt Flannery (now her ex-husband) founded Kiva Microfunds in October 2005.|$|E
50|$|Organizations such as Opportunity International and Kiva (<b>microlending),</b> Raise5 (micro-volunteering), or Charity kicks (micro-donating) {{leverage}} crowdfunding philanthropy {{to raise}} money for charity. GlobalGiving helps local nonprofits in more than 166 countries access the funding, tools, training, and support they need to become more effective. GiveDirectly facilitates direct cash transfers to individual low-income households in East Africa. Zidisha is a nonprofit person-to-person <b>microlending</b> website which uses an eBay-style marketplace to allow individuals in developing countries to crowd-fund loans from individual web users worldwide. Vittana is an online platform that allows low-income youth in developing countries to crowd-fund tuition for higher education.|$|E

50|$|Examples of {{platforms}} {{that connect}} lenders to micro-entrepreneurs via Internet are Kiva, Zidisha, and the Microloan Foundation. Another WWW-based microlender, United Prosperity, uses {{a variation on}} the usual <b>microlending</b> model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. United Prosperity claims this provides both greater leverage and allows the micro-entrepreneur to develop a credit history with their local bank for future loans. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit Zidisha became the first peer-to-peer <b>microlending</b> platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries. Vittana allows peer-to-peer lending for student loans in developing countries.|$|E
50|$|Even so, {{the numbers}} {{indicate}} that ethical <b>microlending</b> and investor profit can go hand-in-hand. In the 1990s a rural finance minister in Indonesia showed how Unit Desa could lower its rates by about 8% while still bringing attractive returns to investors.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{unbalanced}} {{emphasis on}} credit {{at the expense}} of microsavings, as well as a desire to link Western investors to the sector, peer-to-peer platforms have developed to expand the availability of microcredit through individual lenders in the developed world. New platforms that connect lenders to micro-entrepreneurs are emerging on the Web, for example MYC4, Kiva, Zidisha, myELEN, Opportunity International and the Microloan Foundation. Another Web-based microlender United Prosperity uses a variation on the usual <b>microlending</b> model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit Zidisha became the first peer-to-peer <b>microlending</b> platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.|$|E

She also supported legislation to establish voluntary pre-kindergarten enrollment for all New Mexico four-year-olds and legislation to combat methamphetamine manufacturers and dealers who target children.|$|E
50|$|Kurnia's {{experience}} at SEM gave her visibility {{into the high}} operational costs of traditional microlenders. By 2008, Internet access in developing nations had become widely available enough to make direct peer-to-peer <b>microlending</b> feasible. Kurnia founded Zidisha to connect lenders and borrowers directly, thereby reducing borrower costs.|$|E

50|$|Self-Help's early lending {{focused on}} small businesses. The {{organization}} adapted international <b>microlending</b> models to the U.S. market, and then expanded into larger loans well-suited to bigger firms {{that were a}} main source of employment in rural communities.

It is the first peer-to-peer <b>microlending</b> service to link borrowers and lenders across international borders without a local microfinance institution intermediary. [...] The organization is named after the Swahili word zidisha (...) , which means [...] "grow" [...] or [...] "expand".|$|E
50|$|In 1973, Accion began {{experimenting with}} <b>microlending</b> - the {{provision}} of credit to small-scale, informal economy entrepreneurs - in Recife, Brazil. Following this pilot, the organization increasingly focused its efforts on developing microfinance institutions, and the microfinance industry. In 1983, Accion founded Red Accion - the first international network of microfinance institutions - in order to strengthen and develop the microfinance community in Latin America.|$|E

5000|$|After visiting Niger as Portfolio Analyst for the US African Development Foundation, Kurnia became {{disillusioned with}} foreign aid. [...] In 2006, she co-founded the Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) Fund with John Fay and Nan Guslander. To keep {{financing}} and salary costs low, SEM raised {{money from the}} online <b>microlending</b> portal Kiva at 0% interest, and its three co-founders all went without salaries and volunteered their time.|$|E
5000|$|The high {{interest}} rates inherent in the Kiva model has inspired several other online <b>microlending</b> services, which aim {{to reduce the cost}} to borrowers. One example, United Prosperity, uses lender funds as security to leverage matching loan amounts from local banks, at lower interest rates than would otherwise be available to the borrowers. [...] United Prosperity works with field partners in India and Sri Lanka.|$|E
5000|$|Since its inception, Accion has won {{numerous}} {{regional and}} national awards and acknowledgements for its success in <b>microlending.</b> Collectively, the member offices received the 1997 Presidential Award for Excellence in Microenterprise Development {{as part of the}} Accion U.S. Network.

50|$|In 2008, Shriver {{launched}} her WE Invest Program, {{which provides}} training, mentoring, support networks, microloans {{and other resources}} to help women launch or grow their businesses. In June 2009, she expanded WE Invest nationally through a partnership with Kiva, creating the first-ever online peer-to-peer <b>microlending</b> program in the U.S. Shriver is credited with {{coming up with the}} idea to bring Kiva's international micro-lending model to the United States.|$|E
50|$|A popular {{twist on}} Internet-based philanthropy {{is the use}} of {{peer-to-peer}} lending for charitable purposes. Kiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves. However, the recent spread of cheap Internet access in developing countries has made genuine peer-to-peer connections increasingly feasible. In 2009 the US-based nonprofit Zidisha tapped into this trend to offer the first peer-to-peer <b>microlending</b> platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without local intermediaries. Inspired by interactive websites such as Facebook and eBay, Zidisha's <b>microlending</b> platform facilitates direct dialogue between lenders and borrowers and a performance rating system for borrowers. Web users worldwide can fund loans for as little as a dollar.|$|E
50|$|Bank Forum {{has been}} {{cooperating}} with international financial organizations {{and has had}} correspondent relations with many leading banks worldwide. Since 2001 Bank Forum has been closely cooperating with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), implementing in Ukraine a number of joint programs: Lending Program for Small and Medium-Size Business, <b>Microlending</b> Program, Trade Facilitation Program, Mortgage Lending Program. In December 2007 Bank Forum became a participant of the all-Ukrainian EBRD program on energy efficiency increase.|$|E
50|$|Count Me In is {{a leading}} {{national}} not-for-profit provider of resources, business education and community support for women entrepreneurs seeking to grow micro businesses to million dollar enterprises. Founded in 1999 by Iris Burnett and Nell Merlino, Count Me In began as the first online microlender, and in the following years discontinued the <b>microlending</b> program in order to focus on providing the education and resources women need to grow their businesses and find funding from other sources.|$|E
50|$|Critics of {{charitable}} giving contend that simply transferring gifts or money to disadvantaged people has negative long-term effects. The online <b>microlending</b> organization Zidisha published a blog post which contended that providing handouts can actually cause harm by incentivizing {{lack of progress}} out of poverty, and by creating a dependence mentality among recipients. According to Zidisha, microfinance lending is a better alternative than donations, because it incentivizes successful investment of the funds and creates a can-do mentality {{on the part of}} recipients.|$|E
50|$|The Dermalogica Foundation {{was founded}} in 1999 to invest in {{community}} organizations working {{to improve the lives}} of women and children. On January 6, 2011, the Dermalogica Foundation’s Financial Independence Through Entrepreneurship (FITE) initiative was created in partnership with Kiva.org to fund small loans for women entrepreneurs in developing countries. FITE became the first <b>microlending</b> platform campaign accessible to consumers online, offline, and through retail channels. FITE also works to engage the private sector, its marketing prowess, its employee networks and funding support, to empower women entrepreneurs globally.|$|E
