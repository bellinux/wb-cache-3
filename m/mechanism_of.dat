Following the outline of an existing model of top-down visual attention, namely the Closed-Loop Attention Model (CLAM), simulations in this thesis explore <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> visual working memory in the prefrontal cortex and of object recognition in the ventral pathway, and specify <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> spatial selection in the dorsal pathway. Behavioral experiments additionally address several questions regarding stimulus-driven and top-down visual attention in visual search, and their interaction. The findings of the simulations and behavioral experiments have implications for CLAM in particular, and for the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> global saliency and top-down visual attention in general.

40|$|Exposure to cotton or grain dust causes an obstructive {{bronchitis}} in certain subjects, <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> which are poorly understood. A difficulty encountered in discerning <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> this airway disease {{is the lack}} of knowledge of the active components of these dusts. Clinical features suggest common but not exact <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> the airway disease associated with these vegetable dusts. Human and animal studies show evidence of acellular and cellular inflammatory <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> the bronchoconstriction and inflammation associated with these disorders. Potential cellular sources include alveolar macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mast cells, basophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes. Acellular origins include the complement and humoral antibody systems, both of which have been implicated, although their pathogenic role in grain or cotton dust disorders is uncertain. In this review we critically address potential inflammatory <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> airway alterations resulting from cotton or grain dust exposure. General <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> bronchoconstriction are first presented, then specific studies dealing with either of the two dusts are discussed. We believe this area of research may be fruitful in dissecting <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation, especially as more human studies are undertaken. The primary focus of this conference is on cotton dust and related disorder(s). It is, however, appropriate t...|$|R

40|$|Background: Adequate {{knowledge}} {{is essential for}} making informed decisions. We attempted to determine the level <b>of</b> knowledge about <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> action of birth control methods in five representative samples of European women. Study design: Randomly selected women, aged 18 - 49 years, completed an anonymous survey in Germany, France, the UK, Sweden and Romania (N= 1137). Participants were asked about how contraceptive methods work and if providers should inform them about this issue. Multiple linear regression {{was used to evaluate}} women’s characteristics associated with their knowledge <b>of</b> <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> action. Results: The majority of women identified the unequivocal mode of action of condoms, sterilization and abortion. Less than 2 % identified all possible <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> action of hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine devices. Highly-educated women correctly identified the <b>mechanism</b> or <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> action of more methods than less educated women (β coef. = 0. 22, 95 %CI= 0. 01 - 0. 43). Regardless of their sociodemographic characteristics and their belief about when human life begins, most women (75 %) stated that the provider should inform them about possible postfertilization effects. Conclusions: 	European women have low knowledge about <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> action of several contraceptive methods. The majority want to be informed about possible postfertilization effects. Since adequate {{knowledge is}} essential for making informed decisions, providers are encouraged to inform women about all possible <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> action of contraceptives...|$|R
