40|$|The tilapia fileting {{industry}} generates {{large amounts}} of nutritionally significant waste material, and the recovery of this material is important. The manufacture of restructured products from <b>mechanically</b> <b>recovered</b> <b>fish</b> meat (MRFM) obtained from tilapia fileting allows the use of proteins of high biological value {{that would otherwise be}} discharged into the environment. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of washing cycles (either one cycle or five cycles) and of the addition of tapioca starch (20 % vs. a no-starch control) on the characteristics of surimi obtained from MRFM produced by the tilapia industry and destined for use in restructured products. To evaluate the quality attributes of the product, the structure of a surimi protein matrix and its relationship to selected physicochemical parameters and morphological characteristics was assessed. Both the number of washing cycles and the starch addition were found to influence the moisture, protein and lipid content of the MRFM surimi. Higher whiteness was found after five washing cycles. Because the tapioca starch acted as a stabilizer, the fat globules were more stable and well distributed, and an emulsion with better properties resulted. A homogeneous network of fat globules linked to the protein matrix by a layer of tapioca starch was formed. Another advantage of this approach is that tapioca starch is gluten free. This property is important for specific groups in the population, e. g., celiac-intolerant consumers. 2015 Autoria: FABÍOLA HELENA [i. e. DOS SANTOS] FOGAÇA...|$|R

40|$|The Amazonian cichlid peacock bass (Cichla sp.) is {{a highly}} {{marketable}} food and sport fish, therefore a suitable species for aquaculture. However, because of its piscivorous feeding preferences, the species does not accept dry feeds voluntarily, turning its intensive culture difficult and costly. This study aimed to wean fingerling peacock bass from inert moist food to dry diets. In a first experiment, 1, 134 fingerlings weighting 0. 27 g were divided in two 0. 37 m³ hapas and fed ground <b>fish</b> <b>flesh</b> with 35 % success. Then, 1. 3 g fish were pooled, stocked in six 25 L cages and fed two pellet sequences with 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, 20 % and 0 % ground <b>fish</b> <b>flesh</b> (GFF). One sequence was flavored with 10 % krill meal (Euphausia sp.). Training success of fish fed the GFF- 00 diet flavored with krill reached 12 %ª compared to 11. 6 %ª (p < 0. 05) for diets without krill meal. A second experiment was set up with 969, 1. 5 g fish, trained with GFF with 39. 8 % success. After the feed training period, 2. 2 g fish were then fed a sequence of moist pellets containing 80 %, 60 % and 45 % GFF. Fish trained to feed on moist pellets with 45 % ground fish were pooled and stocked into nine 25 L cages. Fish were weaned to dry pellets without ground <b>fish</b> <b>flesh</b> (GFF- 00) using three diet sequences: 1) dry pellets; 2) moist pellets; and 3) dry pellets flavored with 4 % cod liver oil; all three diets contained 30, 10 and 0 % GFF.

The linoleic acid, <b>fish</b> <b>flesh</b> and <b>fish</b> feed were incubated with BHT, EQ and EGbs at 45 °C for 8  d, respectively, except for the control group. The lipid oxidation in the linoleic acid emulsion, <b>fish</b> <b>flesh</b> and <b>fish</b> feed was then measured by the ferric thiocyanate method or thiobarbituric acid method. The carp erythrocytes were treated with BHT, EQ or EGbs {{in the presence of}} 40  μmol/L FeSO 4 and 20  μmol/L H 2 O 2 at 37 °C for 6  h, except for the control group. Oxidative stress and apoptosis parameters in carp erythrocytes were then evaluated by the commercial kit. The results showed that BHT, EQ and EGbs inhibited lipid oxidation in the linoleic acid emulsion, <b>fish</b> <b>flesh</b> and <b>fish</b> feed and ·OH-induced phosphatidylserine exposure and DNA fragmentation (the biomarkers of apoptosis) in carp erythrocytes. Furthermore, BHT, EQ and EGbs decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibited the oxidation of cellular components and restored the activities of enzymatic antioxidants in ·OH-treated carp erythrocytes. Of all examined EGbs, EAE showed the strongest effects. The effects of EAE on lipid oxidation in the linoleic acid emulsion and on superoxide anion and malonaldehyde levels, catalase activity and apoptosis in ·OH-treated carp erythrocytes were equivalent to or stronger than those of BHT. Moreover, these results indicated that the inhibition order of EGbs on the generation of ROS and oxidation of cellular components in fish erythrocytes approximately agreed with that for the food and feed materials tested above. And, the antioxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of EGbs were positively correlated with their flavonoid content. Taken together, these results revealed that the fish erythrocyte system {{can be used as a}}n experimental model to evaluate lipid oxidation in food and feed ingredients. The EAE can be used as a potential natural antioxidant or apoptosis inhibitor. The inhibition effects of EGbs on lipid oxidation and apoptosis may be due to the presence of flavonoid compounds...|$|R
