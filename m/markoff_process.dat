Here, the p and S are the two conjugate scalar fields (functions of state variables x {{as well as of}} time t) in the variational formulation for the pair of diffusion equations analogous to those for the Schrodinger equations, whose explicit forms are given in terms of a solution of the diffusion equations under a specified boundary condition.

40|$|Many random {{problems}} of engineering interest can be {{looked upon as}} examples of continuous <b>Markoff</b> <b>processes.</b> Such processes are completely determined if a certain function, the transition probability, is prescribed. It is shown {{that all of the}} functions of interest in random problems can be derived from the transition probability. Some of the concepts of probability theory and of spectral analysis are reviewed and using these results, the Gaussian white noise function is defined. A new derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation is given which emphasizes the role of the Gaussian white input in the analysis of <b>Markoff</b> <b>processes.</b> The transition probability is the fundamental solution of this equation. It is then shown that the autocorrelation is closely related to the mean motion of a system and can be calculated from the transition probability. This relation can be used, in principle at least, to determine the autocorrelation of nonlinear systems. The Method of Equivalent Linearization for random problems and the First Passage Problem are discussed briefly. These methods are used to solve a number of problems. A discussion of linear systems is presented, and by a similar treatment the solution to a problem in random parametric excitation is given. Next, the first probability density of a class of nonlinear problems is discussed. Finally, the power spectra for two nonlinear systems are calculated. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{group is}} {{interested}} {{in a variety of}} problems in statistical communication theory. Current research work is primarily concerned with: a theory of nonlinear systems, a unified theory of information, preparing an outline of Lebesgue theory for engineers, <b>Markoff</b> <b>processes</b> and flow graphs, second-order correlation functions, probability distribution analyzers, and experimental work on no-memory nonlinear systems. 1. The Wiener method of characterizing nonlinear systems is an effective tool for attacking the problem of optimum nonlinear filtering and prediction. A theory of the experimental determination of optimum nonlinear filters and predictors is being devel-oped. Preliminary work on the extension of the theory to multiple nonlinear filtering and prediction is reported in Section XI-A. 2. The probabilistic theory of information has been generalized in such a direction that the discrete and continuous theories form special cases of a unified theory in which the fundamental information process is regarded as a change of probability measure on an abstract space. In this formulation it is found that the theory of optimum mean-square prediction plays a central r 6 le in the evaluation of information rates. A study i...|$|R

In this paper, the combination of a modem combating intersymbol interference by means of decision feedback equalization and reducing bit error probability by a combination of convolutional and reed–solomon decoding and a finite– buffer ARQ protocol is discussed. It is shown that the effect of the modem on the performance of the ARQ protocol can be determined quantitatively by identifying the packet error sequence as a <b>markoff</b> <b>process.</b> Furthermore, the burstiness of the resulting error sequence is shown to have a limited impact on the protocol performance in terms of throughput and delay jitter.

The average spin q(t) = p_↑(t) - p_↓(t) exhibits a characteristic time for this evolution. With the proper choice of spin flip rates, a dynamical Ising model (Glauber) can be constructed with the same characteristic time for transition of the average spin to equilibrium. The Glauber dynamics are expressed as a <b>Markoff</b> <b>process</b> that possesses {{many of the same}} physical characteristics as its quantum mechanical counterpart. In addition, since the classical trajectories are those of an ergodic process (the time averages {{of a single}} trajectory are equivalent to the ensemble averages), the surfaces of constant temperature, in terms of the model parameters, may be derived for the single spin system.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to data compression based on digram encoding is presented. Statistical analysis of the linguistic property of digram co-occurrence in textual material leads to a new, more effective simultaneous digram and trigram encoding technique. A combined list of digrams and trigrams eligible for encoding is constructed by an original scheme that replaces some of the frequently co-occurring encodable digrams with so-called master trigrams. Using Shannon’s second order <b>Markoff</b> <b>process</b> approximation to English, conditions which the master trigrams should satisfy are formulated and then tested on four representative textual files. The performance of the proposed technique is experimentally examined and com-pared {{with the performance of}} the conventional digram encod-ing.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the effects of stochastic geometry and random environmental torques on the pointing accuracy of spinning and three-axis stabilized satellites. The study of pointing accuracies requires a knowledge of the rates of error growth over and above any criteria for the asymptotic stability of the satellites. For this reason the investigation is oriented toward the determination of the statistical properties of the responses of the satellites. The geometries of the satellites are considered stochastic so as to have a phenomenological model of the motions of the flexible structural elements of the satellites. A widely used method of solving stochastic equations is the Fokker-Planck approach where the equations are assumed to define a <b>Markoff</b> <b>process</b> and the transition probability densities of the responses are computed directly as a function of time. The Fokker-Planck formulation is used to analyze the response vector of a rigid satellite...|$|E
40|$|For a given <b>Markoff</b> <b>process</b> {{characterized}} {{by a set of}} transition probability densities there exists another process with time reversed (the retrodictive vs predictive process in the theory of measurements) such that any one of them multiplied by a single-event density may be symmetric with respect to an interchange of the events expressed as space-time variables, yielding a joint probability density. It is shown how this time-reversed process can be constructed by means of the generating operator of the associated evolution equation, and the basic properties with explicit applications to master equations and Fokker-Planck equations. Onsager's microscopic reversibility is reformulated on this basis. Possible sym. metries concerning time-correlation functions under the Markoffian law is summarized in comparion with the Kubo formula. In the application to Fokker-Planck equations, the Onsager-Machlup most probable paths are extended to general type of diffusion processes, and it is shown that the present method corresponds to a gauge transformation in dynamics of a charged particle which leaves its paths invariant...|$|E

40|$|A general {{review of}} {{stochastic}} processes {{is given in}} the introduction; definitions, properties and a rough classification are presented together with the position {{and scope of the}} author's work as it fits into the general scheme. The first section presents a brief summary of the pertinent analytical properties of continuous stochastic processes and their probability-theoretic foundations which are used in the sequel. The remaining two sections (II and III), comprising the body of the work, are the author's contribution to the theory. It turns out that a very inclusive class of continuous stochastic processes are characterized by a fundamental partial differential equation and its adjoint (the Fokker-Planck equations). The coefficients appearing in those equations assimilate, in a most concise way, all the salient properties of the process, freed from boundary value considerations. The writer’s work consists in characterizing the processes through these coefficients without recourse to solving the partial differential equations. First, a class of coefficients leading to a unique, continuous process is presented, and several facts are proven to show why this class is restricted. Then, in terms of the coefficients, the unconditional statistics are deduced, these being the mean, variance and covariance. The most general class of coefficients leading to the Gaussian distribution is deduced, and a complete characterization of these processes is presented. By specializing the coefficients, all the known stochastic processes may be readily studied, and some examples of these are presented; viz. the Einstein process, Bachelier process, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, etc. The calculations are effectively reduced down to ordinary first order differential equations, and in addition to giving a comprehensive characterization, the derivations are materially simplified over the solution to the original partial differential equations. In the last section the properties of the integral process are presented. After an expository section on the definition, meaning, and importance of the integral process, a particular example is carried through starting from basic definition. This illustrates the fundamental properties, and an inherent paradox. Next the basic coefficients of the integral process are studied in terms of the original coefficients, and the integral process is uniquely characterized. It is shown that the integral process, with a slight modification, is a continuous <b>Markoff</b> <b>process.</b> The elementary statistics of the integral process are deduced: means, variances, and covariances, in terms of the original coefficients. It is shown that an integral process is never temporally homogeneous in a non-degenerate process. Finally, in terms of the original class of admissible coefficients, the statistics of the integral process are explicitly presented, and the integral process of all known continuous processes are specified. ...|$|E
