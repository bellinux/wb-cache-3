5|$|The {{hardest hit}} city by Henriette was Acapulco, where heavy rains led to rockslides and mudslides that killed six. In Sonora, the {{hurricane}} damaged thousands of structures and killed four, {{two of whom}} off the coast. Farther northwest, a woman died while attempting to surf waves {{off the coast of}} Baja California Sur. Heavy rains stranded <b>many</b> <b>cars</b> while causing rivers to overflow, flooding communities. Damage totaled to $275 million (2007 MXN; $25 million).|$|E
5|$|The {{main road}} leading to Ventnor has {{recently}} been widened and resurfaced {{to cope with the}} larger number of cars using it, however this has caused controversy with nearby residents with reports of <b>many</b> <b>cars</b> speeding through the village. A sign was later put up, warning motorists if their speed exceeded the 30-mile per hour speed limit. More were later put up across other parts of the village.|$|E
5|$|On 11 December 1971, {{the bridge}} opened for traffic, {{and on the}} same day, the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry was terminated. In February 1972, there were twice as <b>many</b> <b>cars</b> as there {{had been on the}} ferry in February 1971. The {{official}} opening by King Olav V took place on 25 May 1972. The bridge cost NOK39.8 million to construct. This included NOK650,000 for the county road between Knarrevik and Brattholmen, which had been paid for by the state. The cost the company had to pay was NOK23.45 million. The final estimates for the project were for NOK34 million, and the whole cost above this was covered by the state. When it opened, the bridge was the longest in Norway.|$|E

5|$|At Ballast Point, the {{pavilion}} and bathhouse {{were destroyed by}} the storm. Nearby, the Tampa Yacht and Country Club suffered severe damage. <b>Many</b> <b>cars</b> along the waterfront were severely damaged and nearly all flat railroad cars were submerged. The Malloy Line dock was also left under several feet of water. A number of waterfront warehouses were also damaged by floodwaters. After the Tampa Electrical Company power house experienced water damage, the electricity was shutoff. Additionally, the company's cable station was flooded under several feet of water. Winds downed hundreds of trees and sign across roadways and tore-up awnings. At least 50 awnings were ripped from a bank building on Franklin Street alone. Falling trees also damaged {{the post office and}} the YMCA. Almost 500 dwellings in the neighborhood of Ybor City were demolished. Five people were killed in the city, three from people coming into contact with a live wire and the other two from drowning. Only minor damage occurred in Plant City. Throughout Hillsborough County, many county roads were impassible due to downed telegraph poles and other debris, especially between Tampa and Plant City.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Super Typhoon Bess was {{responsible}} for ¥591.6billion (US$2.32billion) in damage and 95fatalities. According to police reports, 26people were initially missing. A total of 119were hurt. Four {{people were killed in}} Osaka due to landslides, while two people were buried alive in Yokohama via mudslides. At the foot of Mt. Fuji, a series of mudslides buried 36vehicles, killed one person and injured five policemen. The landslides stranded approximately 2,000persons, including 1,500primary school children on a camping trip. In Mie, Bess was considered the worst storm to affect the city in 23years, where 17fatalities occurred and seven were initially listed missing. Elsewhere, in Nara, a couple was killed and a boy was hurt. Throughout western Japan, five people were rendered missing in heavy rains that caused at least five landslides and damaged 15automobiles. Along Tokyo Bay, high waves from Typhoon Bess left windows 11stories high coated with salt. Although Tokyo was on {{the eastern edge of the}} storm, large trees were uprooted nevertheless due to high winds. Five people were wounded in the city. <b>Many</b> <b>cars</b> and trucks were stranded due to mudslides; air traffic was also paralyzed.|$|E
5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are <b>many</b> <b>cars</b> on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

5|$|As in Forza Motorsport 3, {{there is}} a career mode for players to complete, which sees players racing at {{multiple}} locations around the world. This is known as World Tour Mode in Forza Motorsport 4, previously known as Season Play in Forza Motorsport 3. However, one new feature that appears in Forza Motorsport 4 is the game's ability to adapt the difficulty as the player progresses through the career, and collect a trend of data {{to see how well}} they perform. This allows AI drivers to change and upgrade their cars automatically to suit the player's driving abilities. There are several types of races besides the standard format. Forza Motorsport 4 includes the original bumper-to-bumper races, but also has drift, autocross, and multiple-heat races. Unlike in Forza Motorsport 3 where players had no choice over which car they received after leveling up, in Forza Motorsport 4 players are now able to choose one out of several cars as a prize, which are automatically upgraded to the high end of their class. Players are able to import their Forza Motorsport 3 profiles into Forza Motorsport 4. This gives them the ability to transfer a certain number of in-game credits and gifted cars into their new garage. The allowed number transferred is based on how long they have played the game and how <b>many</b> <b>cars</b> and credits they have. Players have the option to create car clubs and share cars in their garages within that club. Previous games in the series were limited to eight cars on the track, however Forza Motorsport 4 supports 16 player racing online, and two players offline.|$|E
5|$|Frank Williams led an {{abortive}} {{protest against}} the car at the Argentine Grand Prix, objecting to {{the flexibility of the}} fixed skirts used to seal the underside of the car, which allowed them to replicate the effect of a sliding skirt. At the following race, the scrutineers rejected the flexible skirts. Brabham replaced them with stiffer material from one of the other teams for the race, which Piquet won. As the season progressed, other teams developed their own lowering systems—a front spring and cylinder were stolen from the Brabham garage in Argentina— but after a rule clarification from FISA <b>many</b> <b>cars</b> were lowered by the driver pressing a switch, a development that Murray found frustrating in light of Brabham's efforts to develop a system that he considered legal. The cars ran on Goodyear tyres again from the sixth round of the championship; motorsport author Doug Nye believes this cost the BT49s good results at several races while the American company adapted to the latest Formula One developments. Despite the virtually solid suspension now required to maintain a consistent ride height, which put components under greater strain, Piquet built a championship challenge on the back of consistent reliability: {{by the end of the}} season, his BT49Cs had finished 10 of 15 races, with only one mechanical failure. Piquet finished fifth at the final race of the season—the Caesars Palace Grand Prix—to take the title from Carlos Reutemann in a Williams FW07 by one point.|$|E
