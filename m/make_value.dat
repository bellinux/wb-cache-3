He criticized RCA Victor for issuing badly engineered or mastered recordings of Toscanini and [...] "enhancing" [...] them with echo-chamber effects, treble-peaking and/or pseudo-stereo sound.

Nor was he loath to <b>make</b> <b>value</b> judgments about composers and works that offended some readers and endeared him to others. When Toscanini gave the American premiere of Shostakovich's Seventh ("Leningrad") Symphony in 1942 in which the maestro heard the [...] "suffering of the Russian people" [...] {{at the hands of the}} German invaders, Haggin dissented, declaring it [...] "an inflated monstrosity of straining, portentous banality."

5000|$|The {{perception}} of a space like a non-place, however, is strictly subjective: each of us {{in his or her}} own way can see the same place as a non-place, or as a crossroads of human relations. For instance, a shopping mall is not a non-place for a person who works there every day. The concept of non-place is opposed, according to Augé, to the notion of [...] "anthropological place". The place offers people a space that empowers their identity, where they can meet other people with whom they share social references. The non-places, on the contrary, are not meeting spaces and do not build common references to a group. Finally, a non-place is a place we do not live in, in which the individual remains anonymous and lonely. Marc Augé however avoids, in his book, to <b>make</b> <b>value</b> judgments on non-places and looks at them from the perspective of an ethnologist who has a new field of studies to break.With regard to the classification of shopping malls as non places, more recently an Italian researcher from the University of Bergamo, Marco Lazzari, developed a survey on a large sample of adolescents, and showed that the mall is a place where teens do not meet by chance, nor with the sole purpose to buy something, but to socialize, meet friends and have fun. Whereas shopping malls are (at least in Italy) yet prejudicially regarded by adults as non-places, they seem to be natively concerned with the identity of the so-called digital natives.|$|E
