5|$|Many {{buildings}} did {{not hold}} up to the shaking of the earthquake and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective medical care and poor planning {{also contributed to the}} substantial scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately in a way that allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most bridges and tunnels and other public infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of the doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, and reducing the capacity to handle the critical <b>medical</b> <b>needs</b> in the region.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} medical care {{utilization}} have controlled for <b>medical</b> <b>need</b> by signs or symptoms or broad disease classifications. The present study uses both symptoms and discrete diagnoses to control for <b>medical</b> <b>need</b> {{in order to determine}} if the use of ambulatory and hospital care differs by race, income, education, insurance coverage, or region. Using data from the 1976 National Health Interview Survey, we found that there were no consistent differences in the number of physician visits made in a year by these characteristics, <b>medical</b> <b>need</b> held constant. Lack of insurance coverage was associated with fewer hospitalizations in a year for five of nine chronic diseases under review. Race was associated with fewer hospitalizations for two conditions prevalent among minorities. These effects were not evident when <b>medical</b> <b>need</b> was controlled solely by signs or symptoms...|$|R

25|$|Richardson (1998) {{examines}} the social, political, economic, class, and professional factors {{that contributed to}} ideological and practical differences between leaders of the Alberta Association of Graduate Nurses (AAGN), established in 1916, and the United Farm Women of Alberta (UFWA), founded in 1915, regarding the promotion and acceptance of midwifery as a recognized subspecialty of registered nurses. Accusing the AAGN of ignoring the <b>medical</b> <b>needs</b> of rural Alberta women, {{the leaders of the}} UFWA worked to improve economic and living conditions of women farmers. Irene Parlby, the UFWA's first president, lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} provincial Department of Public Health, government-provided hospitals and doctors, and passage of a law to permit nurses to qualify as registered midwives. The AAGN leadership opposed midwife certification, arguing that nursing curricula left no room for midwife study, and thus nurses were not qualified to participate in home births. In 1919 the AAGN compromised with the UFWA, and they worked together for the passage of the Public Health Nurses Act that allowed nurses to serve as midwives in regions without doctors. Thus, Alberta's District Nursing Service, created in 1919 to coordinate the province's women's health resources, resulted chiefly from the organized, persistent political activism of UFWA members and only minimally from the actions of professional nursing groups clearly uninterested in rural Canadians' <b>medical</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{hospital}} is {{a health care}} institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of {{hospital is}} the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, {{with large numbers of}} beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific <b>medical</b> <b>needs</b> such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.|$|E
25|$|The Alberta District Nursing Service {{administered}} {{health care}} in the predominantly rural and impoverished areas of Alberta {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Founded in 1919 to meet maternal and emergency <b>medical</b> <b>needs</b> by the United Farm Women of Alberta (UFWA), the Nursing Service treated prairie settlers living in primitive areas lacking doctors and hospitals. Nurses provided prenatal care, worked as midwives, performed minor surgery, conducted medical inspections of schoolchildren, and sponsored immunization programs. The post-World War II discovery of large oil and gas reserves resulted in economic prosperity and the expansion of local medical services. The passage of provincial health and universal hospital insurance in 1957 precipitated the eventual phasing out of the obsolete District Nursing Service in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services.

40|$|Background Since {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in Europe, unmet <b>need</b> for <b>medical</b> care has been increasing, {{especially}} in persons aged 65 or older. It is possible that public pensions buffer access to healthcare in older persons during times of economic crisis, but to our knowledge, this has not been tested empirically in Europe. Methods We integrated panel data on 16 European countries for years 2004 – 2010 with indicators of public pension, unemployment insurance and sickness insurance entitlement from the Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset and unmet need (due to cost) prevalence rates from EuroStat 2014 edition. Using country-level fixed-effects regression models, we evaluate whether greater public pension entitlement, which helps reduce old-age poverty, reduces the prevalence of unmet <b>medical</b> <b>need</b> in older persons and whether it reduces inequalities in unmet <b>medical</b> <b>need</b> across the income distribution. Results We found that each 1 -unit increase in public pension entitlement is associated with a 1. 11 percentage-point decline in unmet <b>medical</b> <b>need</b> due to cost among over 65 s (95...|$|R
