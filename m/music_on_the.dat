After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of <b>Music</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public.

The bandmembers started writing instrumental and demo tracks in 2007, and got together in 2008 {{to work on}} an album. It was recorded from February through April 2009 with producer Brendan O'Brien, who had worked on every Pearl Jam album except their 1991 debut Ten and 2006's self-titled record—although this was his first production credit since 1998's Yield. Material was recorded in Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California and O'Brien's own Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Georgia. The <b>music</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album—the shortest of the band's career—features a sound influenced by pop and new wave. The lyrics have a more optimistic look than {{the ones in the}} politic-infused predecessors Riot Act and Pearl Jam, something frontman Eddie Vedder attributed to the election of Barack Obama.|$|E

5|$|It {{was on the}} set of {{his first}} major film, The Man Who Fell to Earth, that Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called The Return of the Thin White Duke. He was also {{composing}} <b>music</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> understanding that he was to provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition. (At Bowie's recommendation, John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas would write and produce all the original music for the film instead.) Director Nicolas Roeg warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness.|$|E
