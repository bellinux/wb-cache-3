40|$|A radioactivity-based assay was {{developed}} to define the participation of radioactively labeled cell types within the milieu of unlabeled partners in <b>multigeneric</b> aggregates. The cell types in these <b>multigeneric</b> aggregations consisted of various combinations of 21 strains representing five genera of human oral bacteria. The coaggregation properties of each cell type, when paired individually with various strains, were delineated and were unchanged when the microbes {{took part in the}} more complex <b>multigeneric</b> aggregations. Competition between homologous labeled and unlabeled cells for binding to a partner cell type was achieved only when the homologous cells were mixed together before the addition of their partner cells. Attempts to displace a labeled cell type from an aggregate by subsequent addition of a large excess of the same unlabeled cell type were unsuccessful, which suggested that the forces that bound different cell types together were very strong and the cell-to-cell interactions were stable. However, a cell type that exhibited only lactose-reversible coaggregations with partners was easily and selectively released by the addition of lactose to <b>multigeneric</b> aggregates otherwise consisting solely of lactose-nonreversible cell-to-cell interactions. This not only indicates the independent nature of individual coaggregations but also suggests the involvement of lectinlike adhesins in these sugar-inhibitable coaggregations. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for <b>multigeneric</b> aggregations are unknown, the principle of a common partner cell type serving as a bridge between two otherwise noncoaggregating cell types was firmly established by the observation of sequential addition of one cell type to another. Thus, competition, bridging, coaggregate stability, independent nature of interactions, and partner specificity are the key principles of adherence that form the framework for continued studies of <b>multigeneric</b> aggregates. While the human oral cavity {{is a prime example of}} a complex microbial community, collectively the community appears to consist of simple and testable individual interactions...|$|E

These references allow recipients' mental space processing of the advertisement, thus enabling the recipients to become co-authors of the message. <b>Multigeneric</b> intertextuality, i. e., exhibiting the switch of genres, is a major type of mass culture intertextual reference. This paper deals with its employment in ads and its twofold function of building a desired emotional attitude towards the advertised item through exploring the mental space; and enhancing memorability by contextualizing the product in a novel way. This capacity makes intertextuality an effective advertising discourse strategy...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-two {{strains of}} nonflocculating {{bacteria}} isolated from sewage-activated sludge were tested by a spectrophotometric assay {{for their ability}} to coaggregate with one other in two-membered systems. Among these strains, eight showed significant (74 to 99 %) coaggregation with Acinetobacter johnsonii S 35 while only four strains coaggregated, to a lesser extent (43 to 65 %), with Acinetobacter junii S 33. The extent and pattern of coaggregation as well as the aggregate size showed good correlation with cellular characteristics of the coaggregating partners. These strains were identified by sequencing of full-length 16 S rRNA genes. A. johnsonii S 35 could coaggregate with strains of several genera, such as Oligotropha carboxidovorans, Microbacterium esteraromaticum, and Xanthomonas spp. The role of Acinetobacter isolates as bridging organisms in <b>multigeneric</b> coaggregates is indicated. This investigation revealed the role of much-neglected nonflocculating bacteria in floc formation in activated sludge...|$|E
40|$|The human oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis and Bacteroides loescheii, when {{mixed in}} equal numbers in vitro, formed large {{settling}} coaggregates. As the relative number of each cell type was changed, coaggregates became smaller until at cell-type ratios of 10 to 1, rosettes formed. Rosettes {{consisting of a}} streptococcal cell in the center surrounded by bacteroides cells exhibited surface recognition properties of only the bacteroides, which coaggregated with many other cell types such as Actinomyces naeslundii, and formed large settling <b>multigeneric</b> aggregates. The ecological significance of these results derives from the following: (i) the direct demonstration that intergeneric coaggregates can protect the central cell from or prevent its access to other cells in the environment, and (ii) the potential for these effects to occur during bacterial succession of various cell types observed in progressively more severe stages of human periodontal disease...|$|E
40|$|Advert {{recipients}} have wide-ranging {{experiences of}} perceiving other texts. When these experiences {{become the basis}} of perceiving advert messages, we speak of intertextuality operating as a discourse strategy. This paper studies <b>multigeneric</b> intertextuality in printed advertising, i. e. delivering an advert message through a register or text-form typical of other genres, for which discourse analysis and the genre studies perspective are adapted. From the cognitive linguistics perspective, it focuses on how the experience becomes the basis of building an emotive and attitudinal layer of meaning via exploring the recipient's mental space. The article studies cues signalling intertextual processing, specifically cues of socially determined discourses such as cooking recipes, warning signs, computer-mediated communication, scientific discussions or travel brochures, which may function as mental space inducing cues in the collected adverts. It also deals with how intertextuality in adverts can be scaled and how the level of explicitness relates to promoting various categories of products...|$|E
30|$|Process type was {{analysed}} for 5239 instances (clauses). The relative frequencies of the systemic options (material, behavioural, mental, relational, existential, and verbal) were calculated and {{compared with the}} relative frequencies of the systemic options reported by Matthiessen (Matthiessen 1999, 2006, 2015; Halliday and Mathiessen 2014). Matthiessen reports a ‘probability profile’ (Matthiessen 1999, 2006, 2015) for the systemic options in the system of process type in the English transitivity system based on the analysis of a corpus of texts from a varied range of registers (n[*]≈[*] 8700 clauses in Matthiessen (2015)). This comparison is not unproblematic, though, as Matthiessen reports the frequency of instantiation of process types associated with all the clauses in a <b>multigeneric</b> corpus, whereas this study only selects those processes that involve the patient in a generically homogenous corpus. What arguably justifies such a comparison, though, {{is the absence of}} a transitivity corpus study of the experience of a social actor other than the terminal patient that {{could be used as a}} criterion based on which the results of this study could be judged.|$|E

A theoretical consideration of the classification of peptides further expounds the <b>multigeneric</b> nature of peptide chimeras. Strategies for chimeric peptide syntheses include the chemical cross-linking of monomers and tandem combination by conventional SPPS. Additional details of chimeric peptide synthesis are also provided elsewhere in this volume. This chapter also explores {{some of the more}} common applications of chimeric peptides with particular emphasis on the molecular pharmacology of sequences that include address motifs for G protein-coupled receptors. Specific details of the biological properties of chimeras containing mastoparan, an amphiphilic tetradecapeptide component of wasp venom, further illustrate the novel and often unpredictable biological actions of chimeric constructs. These and numerous additional studies confirm that chimerism is an established strategy for the synthesis of molecular probes and bioactive agents...|$|E
40|$|In the {{predecessor}} to this book, The Universal Vampire: Origins and Evolution of a Legend, Brodman and Doan presented {{discussions of the}} development of the vampire in the West from the early Norse draugr figure to the medieval European revenant and ultimately to Dracula, who first appears as a vampire in Anglo-Irish Bram Stoker’s novel, Dracula, published in 1897. The essays in that collection also looked at the non-Western vampire in Native American and Mesoamerican traditions, Asian and Russian vampires in popular culture, and the vampire in contemporary novels, film and television. The essays in this collection continue that multi-cultural and <b>multigeneric</b> discussion by tracing the development of the post-modern vampire, in films ranging from Shadow of a Doubt to Blade, The Wisdom of Crocodiles and Interview with the Vampire; the male and female vampires in the Twilight films, Sookie Stackhouse novels and TrueBlood television series; the vampire in African American women’s fiction, Anne Rice’s novels and in the post-apocalyptic I Am Legend; vampires in Japanese anime; and finally, to bring the volumes full circle, the presentation of a new Irish Dracula play, adapted from the novel and set in 1888.

40|$|The initial {{microbial}} {{colonization of}} tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. Characterization {{of the initial}} microflora {{is the first step}} in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. Using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. A total of 531 16 S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes were identified. Microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. In all subjects, however, 4 -h and 8 -h communities were dominated by Streptococcus spp. belonging to the Streptococcus oralis/Streptococcus mitis group. Other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5 % of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were Actinomyces, Gemella, Granulicatella, Neisseria, Prevotella, Rothia, and Veillonella. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed that the proportion of Streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. FISH also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only Streptococcus spp. but also the rarer Prevotella spp. were usually seen in small <b>multigeneric</b> clusters of cells. This study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject is unique in terms of diversity and composition. Repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{samples of}} oculate Asellus from eastern Siberia and the Japanese Islands, one from {{southern}} China, {{and one from}} Alaska, have been studied. The epigean fresh waters of this large Asiatic region generally harbour populations identified as Asellus (Asellus) hilgendorfii Bovallius, 1886, or some of its geographical forms previously considered as species, subspecies, or not yet named. The “hilgendorfii” complex seems to possess the dimension of a superspecies. A new pigmented-oculate species, Asellus (Asellus) levanidovorum is sympatric with A. (A.) hilgendorfii in the lake Bolon region (lower part of the Amur River basin) and is present also in the Sakhalin and Kunashir Islands. Its copulatory organ (endopodite of male 2 nd pleopod) shows a large cannula and study with SEM allows us to understand the organizational pattern of this organ in all species belonging to the true genus Asellus, including the type-species Asellus (A.) aquaticus (Linnaeus, 1758) where the cannula is small and deeply hidden. Strong relationship between these species points {{to the existence of}} a subgenus Asellus inside the genus Asellus auct. The three Arctic species, A. latifrons Birstein, 1947, A. alaskensis Bowman & Holmquist, 1975 and A. birsteini Levanidov, 1976, represent a second subgenus, Arctasellus nov., inside the genus Asellus car. emend., characterized by their onisciform aspect, the reduction of the coxopodites of all pereiopods, and the structure of the different parts of the copulatory appendages, homologous with those of the subgenus Asellus, but simpler and exposed. The Asellidae appear to be a heterogeneous family, having taken origin from several marine ancestors, and having colonized independently the fresh waters of several remote continental sites. These separate elements evolved independently in the North Pacific (Japan Sea region), Baikal, the Mediterranean and Paratethys, southwestern Atlantic Europe, and Atlantic North America. All species of the far-eastern group (genera Asellus, Calasellus, Mesoasellus, Nipponasellus, Phreatoasellus, Sibirasellus, and Uenasellus) show a common general architecture of the copulatory appendages, with homologous elements (“Asellus pattern”) in each of them. This <b>multigeneric</b> group represents a distinct unit inside the family Asellidae. The presence of its main member, Asellus (A.) aquaticus, in Europe {{is the result of a}} recent and long-range migration westward inside the natural area of the autochthonous Mediterranean forms...|$|E
40|$|SOME OF THE PARTS: FRAGMENTARY LITERATURE AND QUEER POLITICS Jacob Benjamin Brogan Cornell University January 2015 Investigating {{the interplay}} of textual form and {{conceptual}} problems, "Some of the Parts" studies the strategic use of fragmentary literary styles by queer novelists {{over much of the}} past century, focusing especially on the connection between formal deviance and sexual difference. These works are "fragmentary" in that they deliberately foreground their own incompleteness, calling constant attention to their refusal to tell full and final stories. To the extent that they dramatize the fundamental lack of a text, fragments become a powerful means of imagining the mechanisms of desire and the denial thereof. In the process, fragmentation offers a paradoxical resource to queer authors, one that allows them to explore political, social, and even biomedical problems that would otherwise be overwhelming in scope. On the one hand, the shattered worlds that these authors summon up mirror the fraught contours of queer life and experience. Simultaneously, fragmentation serves as a tool that enables richer encounters with the very ills it diagnoses. The first chapter provides a broad overview of the ways fragmentation has been understood and put to work in the past. The second chapter, which attends to the memoiristic writings of Gertrude Stein, tackles a long running critical tradition that castigates Stein for her failure to identify herself as a lesbian, an absence that is ultimately but one point of fragmentation among many in her work. The third chapter looks at the ways William S. Burroughs repurposed bits and pieces of his early pulp accounts of gay life in his later work. This method allows him to undermine the otherwise intractable stability of the categories he had reluctantly embraced earlier in his career. The fourth chapter explores the long-term usefulness of this approach by turning to the queer, African- American science fiction novelist Samuel R. Delany, who, in The Tale of Plagues and Carnivals, his 1984 novel of the AIDS crisis, embraces a <b>multigeneric</b> style in order to confront an otherwise incomprehensible challenge to queer existence. The final chapter of this project turns to the early 21 st century novels of David Markson, in which fragmentation provides a means of negotiating the persistent pressures of the closet. Ultimately, the conclusions shows how fragmentary logics offer new means of thinking about problems of causality, arguing that such an approach is necessary as queer studies moves forward. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the {{different}} ways in which naturalist fiction was parodied in France {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. It demonstrates first of all the validity of approaching naturalist literature through the medium of parody by defining and explaining the interrelation between parody and naturalism. If parody, which inscribes texts within texts, seeks by its very nature to reveal the illusory status of literature and makes the reader aware of the literary medium, naturalist fiction obeys the opposite impulse: its mimetic pretences lead it to hide its literariness. The principal aim of the thesis is thus to determine whether and to what extent parody can undermine the mimetic strategies of naturalist literature; and whether parody led to a renewal of naturalist fiction as it has done with other kinds of fiction. The thesis is divided into three parts. Part 1 concentrates on the theory of parody and provides a survey of the different conceptions of parody through the centuries. Chapter 1 of Part 1 deals with definitions of parody as a relatively minor practice. Chapter 2 is devoted to parody as a key factor in the renewal of literary genres as well as being a constituent of modern and post-modern aesthetics. In Chapter 3, I outline a twofold approach to parody: I argue that some texts are parodic by nature and that other texts are potentially parodic. In the former case the text is intentionally parodic, whether the reader is capable of identifying parody or not. In the latter case the very intentionality of parody is put into question. For a comprehensive poetics of parody both modes must be taken into account. Part 2 examines the numerous parodies that arise in the context of the reception of naturalist literature. I have uncovered over a hundred of these <b>multigeneric</b> parodies, which have allowed me to establish an extensive bibliography of the parodies of naturalist literature. Even though some of these parodies can be thought of as slight from a literary point of view, they provide us with invaluable information on naturalism and its literary context. Besides their general sociological and documentary value, these parodies unveil completely unexplored aspects of the literary battle provoked by naturalist writings. In this way new light is shed on the process of reception of naturalist fiction. The parodic dimension that can be found in the works of the so-called second generation of naturalist writers - Paul Bonnetain, Leon Hennique, Henri Ceard and others - is discussed in Part 3 of the thesis. In their works naturalist themes and procedures often become mechanised and overcoded: the strategies used to explore the very limits of the naturalist genre range from the comic grotesque, to the 'shocking', to the absurd. I f in the parodies studied in Part 2 naturalism was parodied from outside, in this phase it is undermined from within by a ' fifty. Interestingly, such practices are also to be found in the works of major writers associated with the naturalist movement (Joris-Karl Huysmans and Octave Mirbeau). Thus I use parody or self-parody as an interpretative grid to cast a different light on certain naturalist writings. Even though parody does not really lead to the renewal of naturalist fiction, it sometimes gives rise to reflection on literariness and the writing process. Such a meta-fictional use of parody is fundamentally innovative and represents a modern trend already evident in the fiction of the last decades of nineteenth-century...|$|E
