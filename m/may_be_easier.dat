5|$|Several {{nightjar}} {{species are}} known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{algebraic topology}} and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology groups of the space to the (co)homology groups of the subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology groups of the whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology groups of the subspaces, and the (co)homology groups of {{the intersection of the}} subspaces.|$|E

5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E

When one thinks about whether the barber should shave himself or not, the paradox begins to emerge.|$|E

The simplest possible radiating source is a point source, sometimes called a simple source. An ideal point source is an infinitesimally small point radiating sound.

25|$|As the rhabdoid {{phenotype}} may exclusively {{be associated}} with certain missense mutations in the CK-8 gene (or, possibly, the vimentin gene — see above), it may prove possible to develop specific monoclonal antibodies against certain peptides in these aberrant gene products that may target only rhabdoid cells with these specific mutations.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{cases in which}} the use of a single {{computer}} would be possible in principle, but the use of a distributed system is beneficial for practical reasons. For example, it may be more cost-efficient to obtain the desired level of performance by using a cluster of several low-end computers, in comparison with a single high-end computer. A distributed system can provide more reliability than a non-distributed system, as there is no single point of failure. Moreover, a distributed system <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to expand and manage than a monolithic uniprocessor system.|$|E

The edge AB would become the same edge as GH, and the face ABEF would become the same face as CDGH. The new shape has only three faces, 6 edges and 4 corners.|$|E

Caregivers may need to provide foods or liquids so that self-feeding is possible, or they may need to feed the person with A-T. In general, meals should be completed within approximately 30 minutes. Longer meals may be stressful, interfere with other daily activities, and limit the intake of necessary liquids and nutrients.|$|E
25|$|The {{supremum}} axiom of the reals {{refers to}} subsets of the reals {{and is therefore}} a second-order logical statement. It {{is not possible to}} characterize the reals with first-order logic alone: the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that there exists a countable dense subset of the real numbers satisfying exactly the same sentences in first-order logic as the real numbers themselves. The set of hyperreal numbers satisfies the same first order sentences as R. Ordered fields that satisfy the same first-order sentences as R are called nonstandard models of R. This is what makes nonstandard analysis work; by proving a first-order statement in some nonstandard model (which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> than proving it in R), we know that the same statement must also be true of R.|$|E

25|$|Relief carving became {{common in}} 5th century BC Greece, and {{gradually}} {{most of the}} spectacular carved gems in the Western tradition were in relief, although the Sassanian and other traditions remained faithful to the intaglio form. Generally a relief image is more impressive than an intaglio one; in the earlier form the recipient of a document saw this in the impressed sealing wax, while in the later reliefs it {{was the owner of}} the seal who kept it for himself, probably marking the emergence of gems meant to be collected or worn as jewellery pendants in necklaces and the like, rather than used as seals – later ones are sometimes rather large to use to seal letters. However inscriptions are usually still in reverse ("mirror-writing") so they only read correctly on impressions (or by viewing from behind with transparent stones). This aspect also partly explains the collecting of impressions in plaster or wax from gems, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to appreciate than the original.|$|E

500|$|A UNPA {{might begin}} as an inter-parliamentary institution–an {{assembly}} of parliamentarians from their respective countries' legislatures–and then {{change to a}} directly elected body.
