40|$|Dislocation pile-ups at grain {{boundaries}} determine the back-stress opposing plastic deformation while promoting yielding in neighbouring grains. A regular array of parallel pile-ups of edge dislocations was analysed numerically {{to determine the}} equilibrium positions of all dislocations and compared with the result of various simplifications. A model based on infinite low angle boundaries could not reproduce the long-range stress field of the numerical calculations; an analytical correction for this simplification is presented. Infinite parallel dislocations overestimated the long-range stresses compared with finite segments. The effect of randomness in dislocation distributions was studied and average stress fields calculated, which were used to estimate the stress fields of more complex pile-up arrangements. Results for <b>multiple</b> <b>pile-ups</b> do not support classical arguments for the Hall–Petch relationship. Distributions of excess dislocations produce considerable long-range stresses which are not effectively screened by pile-ups of the opposite sign. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{neutron flux}} {{monitors}} were fabricated using chemical vapor deposited single crystal diamond in a p-type/intrinsic/metal/ 6 LiF layered structure. They were placed 80 cm above the core midplane of a 1 MW research fission reactor, where the maximum neutron flux is 2. 2 × 10 9 neutrons/cm 2 s. Good stability and reproducibility {{of the device}} response were observed over the whole reactor power range. A 150 000 counts/s count rate was measured at the maximum reactor power with no degradation of the detector signal.

50|$|The final {{leg of the}} 1980 Formula One {{season was}} a 2-part tour in North America, {{starting}} in Canada, at the Ile-Notre Dame circuit in Montreal. This race had to be restarted after a <b>multiple</b> <b>pile-up</b> involving Piquet and Jones at the start, when Jones shut {{the door at the}} very first corner after the start. Piquet jumped into the spare car, which had a short-lasting qualifying Ford/Cosworth engine in it - and although Piquet was clearly faster than anyone else, the engine in his Brabham blew up early on, and Jones won the race, which effectively gave the gritty Australian his only ever Formula One Drivers' championship, and Williams's first ever Constructors' Championship. Unfortunately, Jabouille's weekend was much worse: he crashed head on into a tire-wall and broke both his legs.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, Farina {{returned}} to Alfa Romeo for the inaugural FIA World Championship of Drivers. The opening {{race of the}} season was held at Silverstone Circuit, in front of 150,000 spectators. Farina won, from teammates Luigi Fagioli and Reg Parnell, completing an Alfa Romeo 1-2-3. There was plenty of drama to be had during the season. At Monaco, just eight days later, a <b>multiple</b> <b>pile-up</b> on the first lap, at the Tabac Corner, saw Farina spin out of a race that Juan Manuel Fangio went on to win. In the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix, Farina beat his teammate Fagioli into second. The next race, at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, saw Fangio beat Fagioli, with Farina finishing in fourth with transmission problems. At this stage, Farina still led the championship on points: Farina 22; Fagioli 18; Fangio 17.|$|R

It lies off a narrow lane winding between steepling, canopied hills in an odd corner between Monmouth and Chepstow.

50|$|In November 2014 Blomqvist {{entered the}} Macau Grand Prix driving his Jagonya Ayam with Carlin car. Despite {{being one of}} the quickest drivers on the track in {{practice}} and qualifying, Blomqvist's luck ran out within the first lap of the Grand Prix. After making a great start from 3rd, Blomqvist was challenging for the lead which he took after Lucas Auer made a mistake a few corners in. As Blomqvist took the corner Esteban Ocon made an over optimistic move from behind and as he stuck his nose in the two collided but carried on, running side by side to the next corner. Ocon had damaged his suspension and at San Francisco Bend he went straight on, taking a powerless Blomqvist into the barriers and ending his race. After which there was a <b>multiple</b> <b>pile-up</b> behind, with Yu Kanamaru getting launched over Jordan King and then Blomqvist before landing on a wall {{at the side of the}} track.

50|$|Ronnie Peterson {{had been}} killed {{following}} a <b>multiple</b> car <b>pile-up</b> at the Italian Grand Prix. Following the race, the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) had a meeting centering on Riccardo Patrese, who the GPDA blamed for the crash. The GPDA filed an injunction to bar Patrese from participating in the 1978 United States Grand Prix weekend, which was allowed. Patrese, who believed {{that he was not}} to blame for the fatal accident at Monza, was furious at this action taken, and he tried unsuccessfully to stop the race from taking place.|$|R
40|$|Diamond based {{thermal neutron}} flux {{monitors}} have been fabricated using single crystal diamond films, grown by chemical vapour deposition. A 3 μm thick 6 LiF layer was thermally evaporated on the detector surface as a converting material for thermal neutron monitoring via the 6 Li(n, α) T nuclear reaction. The detectors {{were tested in}} a fission nuclear reactor. One of them was positioned 80 cm above the core mid- plane, where the neutron flux is 2. 2 × 10 9 neutrons/cm 2 s at 1 MW resulting in a device count rate of about 150000 cps. Good stability and reproducibility of the device output were proved over the whole reactor power range (up to 1 MW). During the irradiation, several pulse height spectra were recorded, in which both products of the 6 Li(n, α) T reaction, e. g. 2. 73 MeV tritium and the 2. 06 MeV α, were clearly identified, thus excluding a degradation of the detector response. A comparison with a reference fission chamber monitor pointed out a limitation of the adopted readout electronics at high count rates, due to <b>multiple</b> <b>pile-up</b> processes. However, once this effect is properly accounted for, a good linearity of the diamond flux monitor response is observed {{as a function of}} the fission chamber one, as well as an excellent agreement between the temporal behaviour of the two detector response...|$|R
50|$|From the Mexican Grand Prix onwards, Larrousse {{entered a}} second car for Yannick Dalmas who {{qualified}} 23rd, outpacing his more experienced team-mate Alliot, {{who started the}} race 24th. The team enjoyed their best race of the season so far as Alliot claimed another class win and World Championship point with a sixth-place finish. Dalmas finished ninth, taking Lola to second in the Colin Chapman Trophy. In the Jim Clark Cup, Alliot moved up to third with Dalmas sixth. They did not fare as well in Japan however, as although Alliot and Dalmas started 18th and 22nd, Alliot was pushed into the wall during a <b>multiple</b> startline <b>pile-up</b> involving Arnoux and Michele Alboreto, and Dalmas suffered engine troubles {{on the way to}} finishing 14th, four laps adrift of the winner.|$|R

Due to the high resolution of the Hiperwall visualization display wall, {{we are able to}} zoom into this pile-up region of the HEP Event Displays and identify the right interaction point of these particle tracks. To obtain best possible results it is important to make use of maximum possible information in the data and hence employ optimal multivariate MVA methods for data analysis.|$|R
40|$|On {{behalf of}} the ZEUS Collaboration) The HERA {{luminosity}} upgrade is expected to generate two major problems in the current method of luminosity determination {{which is based on}} counting brehmsstrahlung photons: damage of the calorimeter monitor due to high primary synchrotron radiation and large <b>multiple</b> event (<b>pile-up)</b> corrections. The luminosity spectrometer presented in this talk, is a novel method that reduces the impact of these problems in the luminosity measurement and is expected to yield a total systematic uncertainty of 1. 4 %. The spectrometer counts brehmsstrahlung photon conversions in the beam pipe exit window using two small calorimeters (former ZEUS beam pipe calorimeters) symmetrically placed away from the synchrotron radiation plane. The photon conversion rate is measured by counting electron-positron (ep) coincidences in the calorimeters. The ep acceptance is measured using a third calorimeter (6 meter tagger) which tags the brehmsstrahlung electrons. The electron-positron pair is separated b...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for {{measurements of the}} scintillation characteristics of crystals. The multiple photon counting coincidence (MPCC) technique involves recording the sequence of individual photon pulses resulting from a scintillation event. The timing of the individual photons allows determination of the scintillation decay time constants. The number of photons recorded per scintillation event {{is proportional to the}} scintillation light yield. The decay time constants and the relative light yield of CaWO 4 and ZnWO 4 scintillators have been investigated in the temperature range 9 - 350 K. An important advantage of the MPCC method is the possibility to reject spurious events through off-line analysis, taking into account the entire data set of scintillation events. This procedure allows cleaning of the data set from <b>multiple</b> scintillation events (<b>pile-up).</b> The MPCC technique is an excellent complement to conventional characterisation techniques and is particularly suited for investigation of slow scintillation processes. © 2005 Elsevier B.

Jana Nováková Department: Institute of Particle and Nuclear Physics (IPNP) Supervisor: RNDr. Tomáš Davídek, PhD., IPNP Supervisor's e-mail address: davidek@ipnp. troja. mff. cuni. cz Abstract: The Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of the Tile calorimeter in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, especially the electronic noise and <b>multiple</b> interactions (co-called <b>pile-up),</b> {{are discussed in}} the thesis. A good agreement in the cell energy distribution between data and Monte Carlo simulations is found. The cross section measurement of Z → ττ events with the ττ invariant mass between 66 and 116 GeV with the ATLAS experiment is described in the next part of the thesis. Data samples collected during 2011 corresponding to the integrated luminosity of 1. 34 - 1. 55 fb− 1 are used for the analysis. The measurements are performed in three different final states depending on the decay mode of the τ leptons. The measurement in the channel with one τ lepton decaying leptonically into the electron + neutrinos (schematically τ → e + νe + ντ) and the other one hadronically (schematically τ → hadrons + ντ), especially the calculation of the nominal cross section and the evaluation of the systematic [...] ...|$|R
