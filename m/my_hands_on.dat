[...] Following his graduation in 1989, he entered a drug rehabilitation program at age 22, and remained sober for 23 years. However, he relapsed in 2013, and admitted himself to drug rehabilitation for about 10 days in May of that year.|$|E

Gomez then signed up to fight fellow English-based Irishman, Peter McDonagh, for the Irish lightweight title on the undercard of a Bernard Dunne fight on 28 January 2006 at the National Stadium, Dublin. After the fight was signed Gomez stated [...] "I just can't wait to get <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> that Irish title because I've been desperate to fight in Ireland for years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{my parents}} made a partial living weaving baskets, the two {{concepts}} of 'profession' and 'art' never {{came together in}} my mind until... college... I read everything I could get <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> about Michelangelo....He was the first artist I'd met through my studies who went to work everyday and was paid by his patrons [...] employers for making art. Obviously, I learned encyclopedias from the work, but the practical lesson was that art could be a profession {{as well as a}} passion.|$|E
2500|$|Following a pitch {{invasion}} by fans after the 2009 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final, the GAA {{confirmed that the}} presentation of the Sam Maguire Cup would take place in Croke Park's Hogan Stand. The GAA insisted that it still remained worried about {{the health and safety of}} fans and expects an accident to happen [...] "one of these days". Kerry captain Darren O'Sullivan expressed his indifference about the location: [...] "If they give [...] out in the car park around the back, I just want to get <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> it". During the presentation, Tadhg Kennelly did his dance which he previously did when he won the AFL Grand Final with the Sydney Swans in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pirozhkova, [...] "Before I met Babel, I {{used to read}} a great deal, though {{without any}} {{particular}} direction. I read whatever I could get <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on.</b> Babel noticed this and told me, 'Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won't have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I'll try {{to make you a}} list of them.' And a few days later he brought me a list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman — Homer, Herodotus, Lucretius, Suetonius — and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with Erasmus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, and Coster, and going on to 19th century writers such as Stendhal, Mérimée, and Flaubert." ...|$|E

Gilgamesh and Enkidu kill the Bull and offer its heart to the Assyro-Babylonian sun-god Shamash.

Enkidu tears off the Bull's right thigh and throws it in Ishtar's face, saying, [...] "If I could lay <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> you, it is this I should do to you, and lash your {{entrails}} to your side."

2500|$|In 1928, Panzram {{was arrested}} for {{burglary}} in Washington. During his interrogation, he voluntarily confessed to killing two boys. In light of his extensive criminal record, he received a 25-years-to-life sentence. Upon arriving at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, he warned the warden, [...] "I'll kill the first man that bothers me", and was given a solitary job in the prison laundry room. On June 20, 1929, he beat the laundry foreman to death with an iron bar, {{and was sentenced to}} death. He refused to allow any appeals of his sentence. In response to offers from death penalty opponents and human rights activists to intervene, he wrote, [...] "The only thanks you and your kind will ever get from me for your efforts on my behalf is that I wish you all had one neck and that I had <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flying the Bell Airacuda {{was a new}} {{experience}} for me, since {{it was the first}} pusher aircraft I'd ever flown. Its handling characteristics were foreign to anything I had ever had <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on.</b> Under power it was unstable in pitch, but stable with power off. While flying straight and level, if a correction in pitch was required, a forward push on the control resulted in the airplane wanting to pitch over even more. Pitch control became a matter of continually jockeying the controls, however slightly, even when the aircraft was in proper trim. The same applied if pulling back on the control. It would tend to continue pitching up, requiring an immediate corrective response. The same happened in a turn with power off, the Bell became stable in pitch. This was fortunate because during approach and landing, it was very stable, and a nice flying airplane." ...|$|E

2500|$|Armstrong's first guitar was a Cherry Red Hohner acoustic, {{which his}} father bought for him. He {{received}} his first electric guitar, a Fernandes Stratocaster that he named [...] "Blue," [...] {{when he was}} ten year old. His mother got [...] "Blue" [...] from George Cole who taught Armstrong electric guitar for 10 years. Armstrong says in a 1995 MTV interview, [...] "Basically, it wasn't like guitar lessons because I never really learned how to read music. So he just {{taught me how to}} put <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the thing." [...] Cole bought the guitar new from David Margen of the band Santana. Cole gave Armstrong a Bill Lawrence L500XL Humbucker pickup and told him to install the pickup in the bridge position. Armstrong switched the L500XL with a white Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB Humbucker at Woodstock '94. After the Seymour Duncan was filled with mud and ruined in November 1994, Armstrong reinstalled the original Bill Lawrence pickup before recording Insomniac in 1995, and used {{it for a long time}} after that, although he has since switched to a black Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB. [...] "Armstrong fetishized his teacher's guitar, partly because the blue instrument had a sound quality and Van Halen-worthy fluidity he couldn't get from his little red Hohner. He prized it mostly, however, because of his relationship with Cole, another father figure after the death of Andy." [...] He toured with this guitar from the band's early days and still uses it to this day, Both middle and neck pickups are disconnected and the pickup selector locked in the bridge position. [...] "Blue" [...] also appears in a number of Green Day music videos such as [...] "Longview", [...] "Basket Case", [...] "Geek Stink Breath", [...] "Stuck with Me", [...] "Brain Stew/Jaded", [...] "Hitchin' a Ride", and most recently in [...] "Minority".|$|E
2500|$|I {{think it}} was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I {{discovered}} a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> very much until then – and they had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course , which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up {{there is no way of}} examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... fraudulent poem.|$|E
