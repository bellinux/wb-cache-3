25|$|In 1959, Day {{entered her}} most {{successful}} phase {{as a film}} actress {{with a series of}} romantic comedies. This success began with Pillow Talk (1959), co-starring Rock Hudson, who became a lifelong friend, and Tony Randall. Day received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Day, Hudson, and Randall made two more films together, Lover Come Back (1961) and Send <b>Me</b> <b>No</b> Flowers (1964).|$|E
25|$|Viewed as a {{prominent}} 'heartthrob' of the Hollywood Golden Age, he achieved stardom with roles in {{films such as}} Magnificent Obsession (1954), All That Heaven Allows (1955) and Giant (1956), and found continued success {{with a string of}} romantic comedies co-starring Doris Day in Pillow Talk (1959), Lover Come Back (1961) and Send <b>Me</b> <b>No</b> Flowers (1964). After appearing in films including Seconds (1966), Tobruk (1967) and Ice Station Zebra (1968) during the late 1960s, Hudson began a second career in television through the 1970s and 1980s, starring in the popular mystery series McMillan & Wife and the soap opera Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|He {{made two}} dramas: The Spiral Road (1962) was a medical {{adventure}} story, directed by Mulligan, and A Gathering of Eagles (1963), a military story, directed by Delbert Mann. Nonetheless, Hudson was still voted {{the third most}} popular star in 1963. Hudson went back to comedy for Man's Favorite Sport? (1964), directed by Howard Hawks and, more popularly, Send <b>Me</b> <b>No</b> Flowers (1964), this third and final film with Day. Along with Cary Grant, Hudson was {{regarded as one of}} the best-dressed male stars in Hollywood, and received Top 10 Stars of the Year a record-setting eight times from 1957-64.|$|E

25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did <b>me</b> <b>no</b> harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

Penn recorded a song in 1967 called [...] "You Don't Love Me", which incorporates elements {{of the music and}} lyrics of Cobbs' 1960 song [...] "You Don't Love Me".
