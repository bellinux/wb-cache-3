5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali <b>more</b> <b>patient</b> and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E
5|$|Cissé {{made his}} return to {{training}} on 20 October 2006, and scored his first goal for Olympique de Marseille on 22 December 2006 when they beat AS Saint-Étienne 2–1. With only four goals in 14 appearances by April, Cissé's performances were drawing such criticism that former player Jean-Pierre Papin urged Cissé's critics to be <b>more</b> <b>patient</b> while the striker recovered from his career-threatening injury. Despite the slow start, Cissé managed to score 4 goals in his final 7 league appearances to finish with 8 goals in 21 league appearances, helping Marseille to finish 2nd in the 2006–07 season and guarantee a Champions League place for the 2007–08 season. On 12 May 2007, he scored 2 goals in the French Cup Final against Sochaux, although Marseille still lost the match 5–4 on penalties, after a 2–2 stalemate after extra time following a late equaliser by another Liverpool player on loan Anthony Le Tallec.|$|E

When Orson refuses to say please while Bree brings him breakfast, she places the waffles on a shelf he cannot reach. When the physical therapist arrives, he pretends to be starving and abused. The therapist tells Bree she must be <b>more</b> <b>patient,</b> or she will be reported. Later, when Orson still refuses to be bathed, Bree takes him outside and sprays him with the garden hose until he begs her to stop. He breaks down and admits he is miserable at the prospective of a life in which he needs {{to ask for help}} in everything. Bree finally understands, and asks Orson for forgiveness.|$|E

25|$|The season saw a {{significant}} change in playing regulations where instead of a mandatory coin toss to determine choice of batting or bowling first, the visiting team was allowed to choose to bowl first if they desired. This change was introduced by the ECB cricket committee in November 2015 as a response to concerns raised about the standard of pitches, particularly in Division Two of the Championship. The initiative attempted to reduce the preparation of seamer friendly wickets which had seen matches completed quickly, made batting harder early in matches and generally gave an advantage to the side bowling first. By encouraging Counties to produce more balanced wickets the initiative aimed to promote the skills required in Test cricket, in particular aiding the development of spin bowling and promoting <b>more</b> <b>patient</b> batting.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{was born}} on 11 June 1991 in Spanish Town, Jamaica. She first {{appeared}} for the West Indies during their 2008 tour of Europe, during which she granted her side their maiden Twenty20 victory on her debut. Batting first against Ireland, Taylor opened the innings for the West Indies, and scored 90 runs from 49 balls. Her total is the second highest score by a West Indian in a Twenty20 International. She subsequently scored her first half-century in One Day International cricket in her next match. In a much <b>more</b> <b>patient</b> innings than she demonstrated in the Twenty20, she scored 66 runs from 97 balls to help her side overcome Ireland. She scored another half-century in her next appearance, scoring 70 runs against the Netherlands. During the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup, she was the West Indies best performer, leading the team in both runs scored and wickets taken. She repeated the feat at the 2009 ICC Women's World Twenty20, in which she scored half-centuries in her side's opening two matches to become the only woman to score fifties in three consecutive Twenty20 Internationals, a feat she repeated in 2010 in a three match series against Sri Lanka.|$|E

He becomes <b>more</b> <b>patient</b> and caring, and less rigidly rationalist. Ai struggles to form a bond with Estraven through much of the novel, and finally breaks down the barrier between them during their journey on the ice, when he recognizes and accepts Estraven's dual sexuality. Their understanding of each other's sexuality helps them achieve a more trusting relationship. The new intimacy they share is shown when Ai teaches Estraven to mindspeak, and Estraven hears Ai speaking with the voice of Estraven's dead sibling Arek.|$|E
500|$|Reception to Nebulous was {{generally}} positive: a reviewer from The Times described the first series as [...] "a winning blend of Doomwatch, Quatermass and British silliness that has cult {{written all over}} it", while the second series was described as [...] "cool and cultish". However, The Daily Telegraph was more guarded, comparing the show to [...] "Hitchhiker's without the philosophy or Red Dwarf without the energy", going {{on to say that}} show is [...] "funny, but not seriously so". A reviewer for Doctor Who website UnitNews also initially expressed concerns about the level of jokes in the show, but later claimed [...] "I should have been <b>more</b> <b>patient</b> because when they did arrive, coinciding with the introduction of the character Harry, they were relentlessly funny".|$|E
500|$|In their response, England began confidently: opening batsmen Atkins and Sarah Taylor built a {{partnership}} larger than any managed by New Zealand, scoring 74 runs before {{the dismissal of}} Taylor for 39. Atkins played a <b>more</b> <b>patient</b> innings than Taylor, and scored the most runs for her side, accruing 40 from 85 balls. Claire Taylor came to the crease upon Sarah Taylor's dismissal and played with a similar attacking intent, striking four boundaries during her 21 runs before she was bowled by Mason. England's middle order suffered their own collapse against the opposition spin bowlers Doolan and Mason, their scoring rate slowing significantly from 4.78 runs per over {{at the end of}} the fourteenth over to 3.58 twenty overs later. Edwards was given out after being caught by wicket-keeper Rachel Priest for 10 runs, though she did not actually hit the ball. Despite their struggles through the middle overs, Richards opined that [...] "England never looked like losing." [...] It was Shaw who once again galvanised England, batting with a more attacking style than those that had struggled before her. Her score of 17 not out pushed England towards the winning target, and a single from Colvin secured victory for England with 23 balls remaining in the innings. Shaw's contribution earnt her the player of the match accolade.|$|E

500|$|Helmut Kohl, {{who served}} as Chancellor of Germany from 1982 to 1998, was an early patron of Weizsäcker's, {{effectively}} helping him into parliament. However, their relationship took a first strain in 1971, when Weizsäcker supported Rainer Barzel over Kohl for the CDU-chairmanship. Subsequently, Kohl unsuccessfully tried to deny Weizsäcker the chance to become president in 1983. After he had taken office, Weizsäcker criticized Kohl's government on numerous occasions, taking liberties not previously heard of from someone in a ceremonial role such as his. For instance, he urged the chancellor to recognize the Oder–Neisse line and spoke out for a <b>more</b> <b>patient</b> approach to the journey towards German reunification. Other examples include the aforementioned speech in 1985 and his critique of party politics in 1992. Following a critical interview Weizsäcker gave to Der Spiegel magazine in September 1997, Kohl reacted during a meeting of his parliamentary group by saying that Weizsäcker (whom he called [...] "that gentleman") was no longer [...] "one of us". This was followed by CDU spokesman Rolf Kiefer stating that the CDU had removed Weizsäcker from its membership database, since the former president had not paid his membership fees in a long time. Weizsäcker then took the matter to the party's arbitrating body and won. The tribunal ruled that {{he was allowed to}} let his membership rest indefinitely. After his death, Spiegel editor Gerhard Spörl called Weizsäcker the [...] "intellectual alternative medicine to Kohl".|$|E
500|$|According to a March 18 {{report that}} was leaked to {{television}} journalist Nikki Finke, focus groups responded poorly to {{a screening of}} the rough-cut version of the pilot. Several viewers felt the show was a [...] "carbon copy" [...] of The Office, {{and needed to be}} differentiated from that series to avoid coming across as forced and unoriginal. Some viewers found it predictable, slow-paced and lacking character development, and felt the beginning of the episode needed to better explain the situation and setting. Several viewers said the show lacked quality male characters, particularly a [...] "datable" [...] lead male. Other viewers, however, said The Office needed time to develop into a quality show, and they felt audiences would be <b>more</b> <b>patient</b> with Parks and Recreation than other shows due to its connection to The Office. Viewers also said the show's portrayal of bureaucracy of local government was [...] "very believable" [...] and could provide quirky and silly situations for the show, and they liked Poehler's character and performance. The release of the report led to speculation in the media that Parks and Recreations was not ready for prime-time television. In response to the leaked negative feedback, Ben Silverman said rough cuts of shows are usually received negatively, even for ultimately successful shows. Schur also said there had been at least four complete edits to the pilot since the focus-group results came in.|$|E
