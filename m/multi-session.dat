25|$|The {{relatively}} unsophisticated and ad-hoc {{nature of}} sessions {{is due to}} the fact they weren't part of the initial design, and had to be developed, with minimal disruption to the main line, by a third party (Citrix Systems) as a prerequisite for their terminal server product for Windows NT, called WinFrame. Starting with Windows Vista, though, sessions finally became a proper aspect of the Windows architecture. No longer a memory manager construct that creeps into user mode indirectly through Win32, they were expanded into a pervasive abstraction affecting most Executive subsystems. As a matter of fact, regular use of Windows Vista always results in a <b>multi-session</b> environment.|$|E

In order to tackle large-scale problem instances, we curtail the search process for providing approximate solutions. We then apply the Cplex solver using both original and equivalent models. In this case, the Cplex solver becomes more efficient when the new model is used. Also, when the proposed method is considered as a heuristic, then it outperforms the Cplex solver using the original model: new solution values are obtained...|$|R

Methods A sample of 76 volunteers with social anxiety attended a research site. At both pre- and post-test, participants completed two computer-administered tests of interpretative and attentional biases and a self-report measure of social anxiety. Participants in the training conditions completed a single session of either standard or explicit CBM-I positive training and a c-CBT program. Participants in the Control (no training) condition completed a CBM-I neutral task matched the active CBM-I intervention in format and duration but did not encourage positive disambiguation of socially ambiguous or threatening scenarios. Results Participants in both CBM-I programs (either standard or explicit instructions) and the c-CBT condition exhibited more positive interpretations of ambiguous social scenarios at post-test and one-week follow-up as compared to the Control condition. Moreover, the results showed that CBM-I and c-CBT, to some extent, changed negative attention biases in a positive direction. Furthermore, the results showed that both CBM-I training conditions and c-CBT reduced social anxiety symptoms at one-week follow-up. Limitations This study used a single session of CBM-I training, however <b>multi-sessions</b> intervention might result in more endurable positive CBM-I changes.

50|$|HOB GmbH & Co. KG {{is part of}} the Brandstätter Group, {{which also}} owns Playmobil and other companies. HOB GmbH & Co.

HOB began developing software and terminals for IBM Mainframe computers in 1981. In 1983, HOB brought the world's first <b>multi-session</b> terminal for Mainframes onto the market, the HOB 78E terminal. Among the company’s major customers were MAN, Munich, the OFD Koblenz (Oberfinanzdirektion = Superior Finance Directorate: the central instance for all financial matters of the German state Rhineland-Westphalia), the automakers BMW and Audi, and the German mail-order giant Quelle. Up until 2001, the company produced hard- and software mainly for IBM Mainframes. With the advent of PC’s, terminal hardware sales dropped and, in 2001, HOB discontinued production of the <b>multi-session</b> terminals. Since then, HOB produces pure software solutions providing secure remote connectivity for a range of computer operating systems. HOB also provides network infrastructure consultation services.|$|E
