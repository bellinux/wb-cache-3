5|$|As the Celtic {{domination}} in {{this part}} of Europe {{was coming to an end}} and the borders of the Roman Empire had gotten <b>much</b> <b>closer,</b> the Przeworsk culture people were being subjected to the Greco-Roman world's influence with a rapidly growing intensity.|$|E
5|$|The opener against Missouri was a <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> contest {{than the}} {{previous}} year's record-setting game. Ed Vereb rushed for a 14-yard touchdown and Tamburello passed for another, but only failed extra-point attempts by Missouri {{in the second half}} preserved victory, 13–12.|$|E
5|$|Early genetic {{studies were}} focused on lions from eastern and {{southern}} parts of Africa, and already showed that lions can possibly be divided in two main clades: one {{to the west of}} the Great Rift Valley and the other to the east. Lions in eastern Kenya are genetically <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to lions in South Africa than to lions in the Aberdare Range in western Kenya or in Uganda.|$|E

50|$|Burns, {{known for}} his past {{annoying}} and obnoxious characters, was cast for his sympathetic acting ability. His character, Casey's father, is too caught up with law practice to pay <b>much</b> <b>close</b> attention to Casey since his wife died of cancer.|$|R
5|$|In 1946, former Chicago White Sox {{teammate}} Ted Lyons was the {{new manager}} of the White Sox, and offered Berg a coaching position. Berg declined. Boston Red Sox owner Thomas Yawkey, who was <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to Berg when he played for the Red Sox, matched Lyons' offer, but Berg still turned them down. Berg did not apply for a teaching position, or join a law firm.|$|E
5|$|Mark Lemon, the {{founding}} {{editor of the}} satirical magazine Punch, lived in the parish in the mid-19th century. He owned Vine Cottage on Crawley High Street, which formed the boundary between Ifield parish and the Crawley parish of St John the Baptist. He often worshipped at St John the Baptist's, which was <b>much</b> <b>closer,</b> but was buried at St Margaret's in 1870.|$|E
5|$|Once {{considered}} {{as having the}} largest angular diameter of any star in the sky after the Sun, Betelgeuse lost that distinction in 1997 {{when a group of}} astronomers measured R Doradus with a diameter of 57.0 ± 0.5mas, although R Doradus, being <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to Earth at about 200ly, has a linear diameter roughly one-third that of Betelgeuse.|$|E
5000|$|Abduction! by Peg Kehret, is a {{novel about}} a 13-year-old girl named Bonnie who {{searches}} for her brother Matt and their dog Pookie who were both abducted. Her abductor, a mystery at first, ends up being someone <b>much</b> <b>close</b> to home.|$|R

30|$|From Table  3, we can {{see that}} PSNR and UIQI are {{improved}} compared with the other algorithms. SSIM of the proposed algorithm is <b>much</b> <b>close</b> to 1. That means the method proposed can get an image that is highly similar to the ideal phantom image.|$|R
5|$|The Congress was {{especially}} notable {{for bringing the}} International into <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> contact with Trotskyist groups from across the globe. These included such significant groups as the Revolutionary Workers' Party of Bolivia and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party {{in what was then}} Ceylon, but the previously large Vietnamese Trotskyist groups had mostly been eliminated or absorbed by the supporters of Ho Chi Minh.|$|E
5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery {{before he left}} India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. Amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} run-scoring, Barnes, who {{was well known}} for being eccentric, gained fame {{throughout}} the season for his fielding at short leg—just a few metres from the batsman—where he took 19 catches for the season. Barnes stood <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> than others who fielded in the position, placing {{one foot on the}} edge of the pitch. His extreme proximity prompted questions about the legitimacy of his action and English captain Norman Yardley later admitted that Barnes had intimidated his batsmen.|$|E
30|$|It {{could be}} seen that the {{calculated}} (65.9  mg/g) and experimental values (62.3  mg/g) showed nice agreement in pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Figure  6 b shows the correlation coefficient is very <b>much</b> <b>close</b> to unity. These results concluded that the pseudo-second order kinetic model best describes the adsorption kinetics of the present study.|$|R

[...] Then the {{circumstances}} were explained, and the papa declared magisterially that Flo must not play any more with her ball near the river,--an order to which it was not probable that <b>much</b> <b>close</b> attention would ever be paid.|$|R
40|$|Humans {{used the}} horse {{from a very}} long time. Since the horse run in battles to {{nowadays}} almost all aspects of riding change. Twelve trainers and 20 experimented riders were questioned on their methods of training.

5|$|Assuming this {{warning shot}} {{had been fired}} {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign and the pennant of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly {{identified}} as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers to drift closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour flags and red pennants, a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to two batteries Childers suddenly came under heavy fire, the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work has {{suggested}} that the regular army of the 2nd century was considerably larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. This is because the 2nd-century auxilia were not just equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st century, but some 50% larger. The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd century. Furthermore, the evidence is that the actual strength of 2nd-century units was typically <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to official (c. 85%) than 4th century units.|$|E
5|$|Near its {{junction}} {{with the}} River Arun, the river loops {{to the south}} in a large meander. A cut ran {{from the start of}} the meander to join the Arun above the original junction, with a lock towards the downstream end. The meander fed Hardham Corn Mill. A lock bypassed the mill and the millstream, to enable boats to reach the Hardham Tunnel cut, which headed south from a junction above the mill. The Tunnel Branch was destroyed by the construction of a water treatment works, and the modern weir near the mouth is <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to the junction than the lock was.|$|E
5000|$|Dorian Hawkmoon {{is one of}} {{the less}} [...] "problematic" [...] {{characters}} Moorcock ever created a series around. Unlike the anti-hero Elric of Melniboné, or the alienated and tragic Corum, or the sometimes savage Erekosë, Hawkmoon is described as being very <b>much</b> <b>close</b> to an all-around [...] "good guy", despite lacking some subtlety (or perhaps, for this very reason).|$|R

30|$|The partial {{elongation}} in {{the middle}} of the SLT 3 specimen was obtained using the difference between the displacements of LVDT 05 and LVDT 06. The measured portion was <b>much</b> <b>close</b> to the fixed end location. The partial elongation {{in the middle}} was very small because the measured original length was only a portion (26 %) of the total free length.|$|R
5|$|The Germans {{generally}} saw the Knights as heroic {{and noble}} men who brought Christianity and civilization to the east. In August 1914, during World War I, Germany won a battle against Russia near the site. When the Germans realized its propaganda potential, they named the battle the Battle of Tannenberg, despite it having actually taken place <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to Allenstein (Olsztyn), and framed it as revenge for the Polish–Lithuanian victory 504 years earlier. Nazi Germany later exploited the sentiment by portraying their Lebensraum policies as {{a continuation of}} the Knights' historical mission.|$|E
5|$|The Mangalorean Catholic dialect {{is largely}} {{derived from the}} Bardeskaar (North Goan) dialect and bears a good degree of {{intelligibility}} with the modern Bardeskaar dialect (spoken by North Goan Christians, North Goan Hindus, and South Goan Hindus) and to a slightly lesser extent with the standard Konkani dialect. It consequently differs from the dialect spoken by the Goud Saraswat Brahmins in South Canara, which is copiously derived and bears a good degree of intelligibility with the modern Sashtikaar (South Goan) dialect spoken by South Goan Christians and North Canara Konkani Hindus. It is <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to the dialects of the Goan Hindus than {{to that of the}} Goan Catholics.|$|E
5|$|The nearest star to the Earth, {{apart from}} the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, which is 39.9 {{trillion}} kilometres, or 4.2 light-years. Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle (8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to arrive. km / (3 × 104 km/h × 24 × 365.25) = 1.5 × 105 years. This is typical of stellar separations in galactic discs. Stars can be <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> {{to each other in}} the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or much farther apart in galactic halos.|$|E
50|$|After {{its world}} premiere, most Top Hat critics {{appreciated}} the spectacle but {{agreed that the}} plot was weak; “the plot, {{for want of a}} better word, doesn't bear too <b>much</b> <b>close</b> inspection”, said Christopher Hart in the Sunday Times. The musical was also criticised for its length. “The second half could be cut down by a good 15 minutes“, according to Exeunt magazine.|$|R
50|$|During {{the times}} of British Emperor so many embrandiri tulu Brahmin {{families}} moved from udupi to several places of India. Most of the families moved to kerala because of culture and tradition of kerala Brahmins (Namboothiri) is very <b>much</b> <b>close</b> enough to their culture.

5|$|The {{officer corps}} formed {{part of the}} social elite in Canada, and {{considered}} themselves to be <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to the prestigious, regular military than to their equivalents in the local police forces. Commissioned officers were expected to join and participate in an officers' mess, which the police based on the corresponding military tradition. Many were members of the Freemasons, a popular movement among Protestant Canadians. The officers were made Justices of Peace, giving them powers to try civilian cases, and they also had authority to summarily try members of the force itself, potentially imprisoning constables for up a year for even minor offences.|$|E
5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to pn, {{than it is to}} 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals.|$|E
5|$|The planets were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} formed in or near their current orbits. However, this view underwent radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Currently, {{it is thought that}} the Solar System looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt was <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> to the Sun.|$|E
5000|$|It has {{previously}} been noted by Robinson, the first Pirate Party UK leader, that the Pirate Party UK's chances of getting a candidate elected to the UK parliament are [...] "pretty <b>much</b> <b>close</b> to zero", because of the first past the post system for electing MPs to Parliament. Instead, its immediate aim is to raise awareness among voters and politicians in the other political parties.|$|R
