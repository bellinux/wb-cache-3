In order to perform helical scan, {{it is necessary to}} set <b>moving</b> speed of <b>table</b> in addition to normal scan parameters. This study was carried out to evaluate the influence of <b>table</b> <b>moving</b> speed on helical scan images and to demonstrate any deifferences between conventional and helical scan images using correlation coefficients of Pearson. CT images were put in a personal computer and correlation coefficients were calculated from CT values of helical and conventional images. The results show that correlation coefficients decrease depending on the increase of <b>table</b> <b>moving</b> speed and are useful to evaluate differences between helical and conventional scan images. Although helical CT scanning is an excellent method which can enforce a wide range scanning all over the short time, {{it is important to understand}} characteristics of helical scanning images different deifferent from conventional ones...|$|R

Mary and thirty guests sat at a round table like King Arthur's {{at the head of}} the hall. The courses of the dinner were brought up the hall on a <b>moving</b> <b>table,</b> with twelve men dressed as satyrs, with long tails, carrying lighted torches.

Meanwhile, the nymphs and satyrs sang Latin verses specially written by George Buchanan in honour of the food and hosts as the gift of the offering of rustic gods to James and his mother. Parts of the song were given to the satyrs, nereids, fauns, and naiads who alternately addressed the Queen and Prince, and it was concluded by characters representing the Orkney Islands.

40|$|Purpose: Accurate {{geometry}} {{is required}} for radiotherapy treatment planning (RTP). When considering the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for RTP, geometric distortions observed in the acquired images should be considered. While scanner technology and vendor supplied correction algorithms provide some correction, large distortions are still present in images, even when considering considerably smaller scan lengths than those typically acquired with CT in conventional RTP. This study investigates MRI acquisition with a <b>moving</b> <b>table</b> compared with static scans for potential geometric benefits for RTP. Methods: A full field of view (FOV) phantom (diameter 500 mm; length 513 mm) was developed for measuring geometric distortions in MR images over volumes pertinent to RTP. The phantom consisted of layers of refined plastic within which vitamin E capsules were inserted. The phantom was scanned on CT to provide the geometric gold standard and on MRI, with differences in capsule location determining the distortion. MRI images were acquired with two techniques. For the first method, standard static table acquisitions were considered. Both 2 D and 3 D acquisition techniques were investigated. With the second technique, images were acquired with a <b>moving</b> <b>table.</b> The same sequence was acquired with a static table and then with table speeds of 1. 1 mm/s and 2 mm/s. All of the MR images acquired were registered to the CT dataset using a deformable B-spline registration with the resulting deformation fields providing the distortion information for each acquisition. Results: MR images acquired with the <b>moving</b> <b>table</b> enabled imaging of the whole phantom length while images acquired with a static table were only able to image 50 %– 70 % of the phantom length of 513 mm. Maximum distortion values were reduced across a larger volume when imaging with a <b>moving</b> <b>table.</b> Increased table speed resulted in a larger contribution of distortion from gradient nonlinearities in the through-plane direction and an increased blurring of capsule images, resulting in an apparent capsule volume increase by up to 170 % in extreme axial FOV regions. Blurring increased with table speed and in the central regions of the phantom, geometric distortion was less for static table acquisitions compared to a table speed of 2 mm/s over the same volume. Overall, the best geometric accuracy was achieved with a table speed of 1. 1 mm/s. Conclusions: The phantom designed enables full FOV imaging for distortion assessment {{for the purposes of}} RTP. MRI acquisition with a <b>moving</b> <b>table</b> extends the imaging volume in the z direction with reduced distortions which could be useful particularly if considering MR-only planning. If utilizing MR images to provide additional soft tissue information to the planning CT, standard acquisition sequences over a smaller volume would avoid introducing additional blurring or distortions from the through-plane table movement...|$|E
40|$|The jacket {{offshore}} oil platforms in ice infested area {{are vulnerable to}} the dynamic action of ice excitations. Ice-induced vibration of platform structures may cause structural failure, discomfort to workers or malfunction of equipments; hence, it is of practical interest to reduce the ice-induced structural responses. To improve ice resistant capacities of platform structures, vibration control techniques may be used. For instance, some passive and semi-active dissipation devices may be installed at platform structures to enhance vibration energy absorbing capacity. Ice excitations have some differences with wind and earthquake excitations. The control strategies are needed to investigate for platform structures under ice excitations.

50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of Individual {{movements}}—Shomate and Rainbow. Shomate movements are similar in concept to Howell movements for pairs—for smaller numbers of tables, a single individual is stationary and all other players move from place to place, sitting at different tables/positions each round. Rainbow movements are similar in concept to Mitchell movements. A key difference for Rainbow movements is that they require the number of tables to be a prime number, and there {{must be at least}} 5 tables. In a Rainbow movement, North players remain stationary throughout the game. All other players move after each round. Typically, boards move to the next lower table; East players move to the next higher table; West players move to the 2nd next higher <b>tables</b> (for example, <b>moving</b> from <b>table</b> 1 to table 3); and South players move to the 2nd lower <b>table</b> (for example, <b>moving</b> from <b>table</b> 3 to 1). It is common for the player <b>moving</b> two <b>tables</b> lower to carry boards to the next lower table on the way to their next seat. In a rainbow movement, if it is desired {{to increase the number of}} players a person has played with and against, this can be accomplished by having players at each table change positions at the same table within a round. For example, if the movement calls for two boards per round, after playing one board, the South and West players at each table could exchange seats for the 2nd board. If this is done, the players must remember to move back to their original position when moving at the end of the round. In a movement with 3 boards per round, East, South, and West can move clockwise after each board (skipping the North seat).|$|R
