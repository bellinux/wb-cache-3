500|$|According to musicologist Leonid Sabaneyev, Tchaikovsky was not {{comfortable}} with being recorded for posterity and tried {{to shy away from}} it. On an apparently separate visit from the one related above, Block asked the composer to play something on a piano or at least say something. Tchaikovsky refused. He told Block, [...] "I am a bad pianist and <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> raspy. Why should one eternalize it?" ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: [...] "I write songs, and <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> {{just a way to}} get those lyrics across." [...] A writer for The Tennessean conceded in 2010 that Swift is [...] "not the best technical singer", but described her as the [...] "best communicator that we've got". Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has [...] "put a lot of work" [...] into improving it. It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons. She has said that she only feels nervous performing [...] "if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] in January 2010, Keys stated that she was {{planning}} to release a second version of the song as a single the following month, featuring only her vocals. The track, entitled [...] "Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down", appeared on Keys' fourth studio album The Element of Freedom which was released in December 2009. The original version, entitled [...] "Empire State of Mind Part 2", included both Keys' vocals and a new rap verse from Jay-Z, but the final product did not include Jay-Z. Discussing the record, Keys claimed that it acts as a dichotomy of strength and vulnerability, commenting that [...] "The music is really strong, and the drums are really aggressive, but <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> vulnerable and delicate".|$|E

50|$|As part of Elim’s {{on-going}} community campaigns, {{she launched}} <b>My</b> <b>Voice</b> in 2004 {{which was a}} book featuring 77 earnest real life experiences written by youths {{from all walks of}} life. <b>My</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>was</b> supported by MCYS, South East Community Development Centre (CDC), UFM 100.3FM and Drama Box. The 2nd edition of <b>My</b> <b>Voice</b> - Breaking Free was launched subsequently on 9 December 2006.

2500|$|... "Now they're {{having me}} sing. I sort of half-sing, half-talk, with hips-and-eye stuff. You know what I mean—like Maurice Chevalier. I {{used to sing}} at home and people would say, 'Pipe down! You're terrible!' But the studio thinks <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> great." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Yorke said: [...] "It annoys me {{how pretty}} <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is.</b> That sounds {{incredibly}} immodest, but it annoys me how polite it can sound when perhaps what I'm singing is deeply acidic." [...] In 2013, he said: [...] "Whenever I'm building anything, whether it's on a laptop or drum machine or whatever... there's always a vocal {{going in the}} back of my head. It's almost impossible for me to listen to a dance tune from beginning to end without picturing a voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{a lengthy}} musical break, Norwood {{established}} a flourishing acting career with her sitcom Moesha. She eventually entered recording studios on October 1997, {{to begin work}} on her second studio album, barely satisfied with the material that was presented to her. However, the recording of the album was postponed several times as Norwood felt that many songs wouldn't express {{what she wanted to}} tell at this point of her career. [...] "Many of the songs I heard were not 'me'," [...] the singer stated during a promotional interview with Jet in 1999, [...] "And If I can't feel it, then I won't sing it. I'm not the little girl I was when I made my first record. <b>My</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> a strong instrument now; my vocals come from both my heart and my diaphragm. My heart because I matured in the four years since the last album; I'm more emotionally there." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{swept the}} glasses around the {{circumference}} of the prairie, and <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> thick with disappointment as I answered: [...] "No." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{promised not}} to--not to--" [...] I began, choking. <b>My</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> hoarse and it broke, matters surely {{far removed from}} pretense.|$|R
60|$|But now <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> fainter. It was all I {{could do}} to get my breath. The room swam round and round before my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do they mean?" [...] muttered Pharaoh, [...] "I do not understand. Thank them, my daughter, <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> weak, {{and let us}} begone." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> much better, I {{am glad to}} report, and I mean to try Beard's remedy {{after dinner}} to-day. This is all my present news.|$|E
6000|$|They tell me (while {{they speak}} [...] Of her [...] "costly broider'd pall") [...] That <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> growing weak-- [...] That I should not sing at all-- ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{were both}} looking at me; but though my face may have turned a trifle paler, <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> as steady as ever as I answered-- ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{went up to}} a wicket marked [...] "Accountant." [...] The {{accountant}} was a tall, cool devil. The very {{sight of}} him rattled me. <b>My</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> sepulchral.|$|R
6000|$|Clarke {{smiled with}} wistful sadness. [...] "I sing very few ballads. <b>My</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> given {{me to use}} in Christ's service, not for the {{gratification}} of my pride." ...|$|R
6000|$|To die! To die? And yet, methinks, [...] I {{drink of}} life, to-day, [...] Deep as the thirsty {{traveler}} drinks [...] Of fountain by the way: [...] <b>My</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> sad, {{my heart is}} gay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bill," [...] he said, {{turning to}} a man who acted as his valet and cook, [...] "rouse the camp. Quietly--as you hear. Let no man act however, till <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> heard. You'll know it when ye hear it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{you were}} good. You {{need not have}} come unless you had wished it. I had so spoken to you as to justify you in staying away. <b>My</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> gone, and I can only squeak at you in this broken treble." ...|$|E
60|$|It gave me {{a sudden}} wrench of the heart-strings. I could have killed Strickland then, and I knew that <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> {{trembling}} when I bade the nurse good-bye.|$|R
6000|$|... "The time <b>is</b> come. <b>My</b> <b>Voices</b> <b>are</b> not vague now, but clear, {{and they}} have told me what to do. In two months I shall be with the Dauphin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that {{we have a right to}} do so," [...] I said. I know <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> trembling, for I was very much agitated. [...] "That belongs to--to her!" ...|$|R
60|$|Well, {{and how are}} {{you both}} going on? <b>My</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> quite returned; and papa continues, I am sorry to say, to have a bad cold and cough. He means to stay in the house to-day and try what {{prudence}} will do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Like {{all of a}} sinful {{and fallen}} race," [...] {{returned}} the stranger with the severe air of the age, [...] "I have much need of my askings. But why dost thou think that <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> so often heard in this secret place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said Little John, [...] "I {{have none}} as fair as that merry Arthur has trolled. They are all poor things that I know. Moreover, <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> not in tune today, and I would not spoil even a {{tolerable}} song by ill singing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, O Queen," [...] I answered, {{speaking}} very low, for <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> choked; [...] "but thy {{songs are}} {{not good for the}} sons of men to hear--of a truth they overwhelm me!" ...|$|R
60|$|I think I said I {{felt all}} right. I could not {{recollect}} how I had got there. He {{must have seen}} the question in my face, for <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> inaccessible to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still {{strove to}} speak: <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> thick with sighs [...] As in a dream. Dimly I could descry [...] The stern black-bearded kings with wolfish eyes, [...] Waiting {{to see me}} die.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I did; and so I must, unless {{something}} be done. It {{could not be}} right that I should remain here, seeing such things, if <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> {{not allowed to be}} heard. But though I did go, she would still be my sister. I should still share the sorrow,--and the shame." ...|$|E
60|$|True, one rose will outblossom the rest, one rose in a bower. I speak {{after my}} fancies, for I am a Troubadour, you know, {{and won the}} violet at Toulouse; but <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> harsh here, not in tune, a {{nightingale}} out of season; for marriage, rose or no rose, has killed the golden violet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Raybold. [...] "I {{hold that}} hunting is a manly art, {{and that a}} forester's life is as bold and free to him {{as it is to}} the birds in the air. I believe I have the blood of a hunter in me. <b>My</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> for the woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, take we {{pleasure}} {{while we}} may," [...] I heard myself replying. [...] In the red sunset, far away, [...] My happier life was dying: [...] My heart <b>was</b> sad, <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> gay.|$|R
