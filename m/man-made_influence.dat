40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} spatial {{clustering}} model based on self-organizing feature map and a composite distance measure, and studies the knowledge discovery from spatial database of spatial objects with non-spatial attributes. This paper gives the structure, algorithm of the spatial clustering model based on SOFM. We {{put forward a}} composite clustering statistic, which is calculated by both geographical coordinates and non-spatial attributes of spatial objects, and revising the learning algorithm of self-organizing clustering model. The clustering model is unsupervised learning and self-organizing, no need to pre-determine all clustering centers, having little <b>man-made</b> <b>influence,</b> and shows more intelligent. The composite distance based spatial clustering can lead to more objective results, indicating inherent domain knowledge and rules. Taking urban land price samples as a case, we perform domain knowledge discovery by the spatial clustering model. First, we implement several spatial clustering for multi-purpose, and find series spatial classifications of points with non-spatial attributes from multi-angle of view. Then we detect spatial outliers by the self-organizing clustering result based on composite distance statistic along with some spatial analysis technologies. We also get a meaningful and useful spatial homogeneous area partition of the study area. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to characterize cracking progression of concrete samples subjected to sulfate attack cycles by employment of a nonlinear wave modulation technique. The sidebands in frequency domain (f 1 ±f 2) are produced due to the modulation of two ultrasonic waves (high frequency f 1 and low frequency f 2) and the relative amplitude of sidebands is defined as the nonlinear parameter considered as a caliber for structural damage. Different from previous work where the low frequency signal was generated by the instrumented hammer, the low frequency signal in this research is a harmonic wave produced by an electromagnetic exciter to avoid the uncertainty of <b>man-made</b> <b>influence.</b> Experimental results show that the nonlinear parameter presents an excellent correlation with the progress of material deterioration, indicating that the wave modulation method is capable of discriminating different states of damage. Supplementary microscopic analysis and bending tests are conducted to confirm the microcraking development and strength loss during the sulfate attack process. The work validates the feasibility of nonlinear wave modulation technique based on harmonic signals for the damage detection of concrete materials suffered from typical durability problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{beach is}} vital to Australia’s economy and {{cultural}} life. As a natural system, the beach can vary in width due {{to a range of}} natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>influences.</b> An understanding of the causes of beach erosion is essential. In particular, an assessment of the likely future in terms of coastline stability will require an understanding of what constitutes a major storm or a healthy beach, and what level of variability can we expect in coastal processes. Without this understanding it is difficult to put the postulated long-term changes due to climate change and sea level into perspective. On the world scene beach erosion has become a major issue for community debate and concern. However, many in the community have a perception that the beach should or does remain constant. Others, are aware of variability, but have not been exposed to the extremes of variability. The management of our beaches is clearly an issue in which the community at large has a vested interest. The perception of what beach erosion is within the community {{is an important factor in}} the development of effective management strategies. This lecture deals with the current state of the beach worldwide, with particular reference to historical and current beach erosion problems in the South East Queensland – Northern New South Wales region. The various causes of natural variability and <b>man-made</b> <b>influences</b> on beaches are discussed using case studies as examples of how the cause of an erosion problem can be clarified by placing the current condition into a spatial and temporal context over short and medium terms...|$|R

We {{take advantage of a}} unique set of 148 PLHR events identified in the Burst mode data, where a waveform of one electric and one magnetic field component is measured. It is shown that the occurrence rate of PLHR events over the industrialized areas is quite large (more than about 8 %). However, among all the identified events, we have found only two cases of possibly PLHR‐triggered emissions. There {{is no evidence that the}} total power spectral density of electromagnetic waves over industrialized regions and geomagnetically conjugate regions is larger than what would be expected without <b>man‐made</b> <b>influence.</b> Finally, we have analyzed the presence of the weekend effect (i. e., a different behavior during the weekends as compared to the weekdays due to the lower power consumption), demonstrating that no such phenomenon seems to be present in the analyzed data set.

40|$|In the European Alps, ice core {{studies have}} been mainly {{performed}} {{in view of the}} recent <b>man-made</b> <b>influence</b> on the atmospheric load of aerosol-related species, while respective investigations on the pre-industrial aerosol or on stable water isotope-based climate records remained sparse. We address from a glaciological perspective the specific conditions of Alpine drilling sites and, in particular, the role of depositional noise. Thereby, we refer to two major drilling areas (located in the summit range of Monte Rosa and Mt Blanc massif, respectively) which largely differ in their snow accumulation rate and, hence, in their accessible time scale. A simple scheme considering the seasonality of both, the precipitation-borne signal and the snow erosion-controlled net accumulation rate is presented. It shows that water isotope trends are generally more sensitive to distortion by a seasonality effect than recent snow impurities trends, although the influence of a given seasonal accumulation rate cycle on the mean levels of water isotopes and impurities is similar. These findings are illustrated on the decadal and centennial time scale by the inter- and intra-site variability of major ion and water isotope records. The intra-site comparison includes the discussion of strong water isotope depletions seen some meters above bedrock at low accumulation drilling sites...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the environmental vulnerability index (EVI) for the island of Tobago. Based on the EVI study developed by the South Pacific Applied Geosciences Commission (SOPAC), the vulnerability index was determined for anthropogenic, meteorological, biological, and geological events and for general country characteristics. Written requests for information were made through appropriate government ministries, state agencies, private companies, and other environmental organizations, and the relevant data were obtained from available documents or interviews with appropriate professionals. These data were then {{used to calculate the}} values of the environmental indicators as directed by SOPAC, and the overall EVI for Tobago was determined by the average score of all these indicators. The results of the research revealed that, on a holistic level, the island of Tobago scored relatively low on the EVI scale. Although most indicators received a score of 4 or less, selected indicators received scores of 6 and 7, which indicated a high vulnerability for these indicators. It was found that the indicators with the highest scores were mostly anthropogenic in origin or could be traced to some <b>man-made</b> <b>influence.</b> It was concluded that Tobago&# 039;s vulnerability could to a large extent be controlled by vigilant management of the island&# 039;s resources, coupled with information sharing between the agencies governing these resources...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA systems {{approach}} is introduced into eutrophication modelling and {{is illustrated by}} the example of Lake Balaton, Hungary, one of the world's largest shallow lakes. One of the major features of the problem is its complexity. Many interrelated processes should be considered in the lake and in the corresponding watershed, both on the level of scientific understanding and policy making. The other essential feature is the presence of various kinds of uncertainties. The approach developed is off-line in character, which avoids the direct coupling of the detailed descriptions of all the subprocesses. The procedure starts with the decomposition of the entire model into smaller, tractable units, forming a hierarchial system. This step is followed by aggregation, the aim of which is to preserve and integrate only essentials in the higher stratum. The various levels involve the modelling of biological phenomena, the sediment-water interaction, hydrodynamic and transport processes and the nutrient loads, with the corresponding calibration and validation steps. The approach accounts also for the influence of natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>influences,</b> {{as well as for the}} propagation of uncertainties. The procedure can lead to a realistic but yet simple model on the higher level of the hierarchy, where an optimization problem should be solved (e. g., how the maximum water quality improvement can be achieved under given budget constraints). The various steps of the study are illustrated by examples...|$|R
40|$|The {{plight of}} the Pacific Salmon has been fervidly {{researched}} over {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century by scientists and environmentalists searching for an explanation behind the declining populations of these once vibrant species. While this sustained research has yet to reveal one specific causative factor, advancing technologies and intensive studies have supported the emergence of a new consensus, one that accepts the proposition that an aggregation of man made factors has inflicted the most damage upon Pacific Salmon and their habitats. While some biological and environmental factors have no doubt helped perpetuate the decline of Pacific Salmon populations, a growing body of science now pinpoints manmade pressures as the major source of salmon habitat degradation. The Pacific Northwest historically supported one of the densest populations in pre-industrial North America, due in large part to once plentiful Pacific Salmon populations. As recently as the early twentieth century, salmon populations remained plenteous, serving as a critical food staple for struggling families during the Great Depression. However, a multitude of factors-including overfishing, dam building, extensive logging, urbanization, and increases in hatchery-born salmon populations-have contributed to the recent declines in Pacific Salmon populations. Scientists and environmentalists have now uncovered another deadly <b>man-made</b> <b>influence</b> contributing to this population decline-pesticides. While the political quagmire surrounding Pacific Salmon has dominated local and state politics for years, pesticide use issues and the related dangers of pesticide contamination have only recently taken center stage-both locally and nationally. Salmon and politics are intertwined, especially in the Pacific Northwest, where the maintenance of healthy, functional salmon habitats has sparked ardent political debate at every level of government. The emerging national debate mirrors the competing factions on the local level-pitting pro-private land use and agriculture interest groups touting economic land use benefits over environmental protection, while environmentalist and conservationist groups voice growing concerns over the current administration 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to environmental protection. President George W. Bush has been assailed with accusations of attempting to further undermine the already tenuous safeguards intended to protect endangered species, like the Pacific Salmon, by justifying policy decisions based on 2 ̆ 2 rigged science, 2 ̆ 2 and by defying court orders to sidestep the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and its pro-environment protective measures. Furthermore, the Bush Administration has been accused of acquiescing to the pesticide industry by proposing and supporting pro-pesticide administrative rules. At the state level, Washington has enacted proactive executive and legislative measures to ameliorate the problem of salmon habitat degradation, including the establishment of the Governor 2 ̆ 7 s Statewide Strategy to Recover Salmon, and the enactment of the Watershed Management Act. The salmon debate has also spurred local grass roots support, such as a 2001 referendum-driven Seattle ordinance that sought to protect salmon watersheds. The ordinance required implementation of more effective water conservation techniques, such as retrofitting low income housing with efficient water conservation devices, and required the city to increase water conservation by twelve million gallons per day by 2010. Most of the aforementioned political debate and resulting legislation emanates from the deep cultural significance and iconic status of the Pacific Salmon, and thus the value of the sustained existence of these species cannot be easily quantified, either economically or culturally. This 2 ̆ 2 concurrent 2 ̆ 2 value is a main instigator for the diligent conservation efforts that have been waged by both local and federal environmental groups, as well as fishing industry lobbyists. Conversely, the Northwest relies heavily on the manipulation of water, an obvious and critical component of salmon habitats, to support the region 2 ̆ 7 s rapidly expanding population. For example, hydroelectric power dams provide nearly ninety percent of the region 2 ̆ 7 s electricity. Additionally, the logging industry, agriculture, and private land-users all rely on water to varying degrees for economic sustenance and have contributed excessive resources to fight state and federal regulations aimed at protecting salmon and their habitats. The competing interests at stake in the salmon conservation movement depict the all too familiar dilemma of the economic interests of the private landowner/business owner versus environmental and conservation interests. Part II of this Comment will briefly outline the historical, cultural and economic significance of Pacific Salmon and the multitude of values inherent in a healthy maintenance of the species. Part III will focus on the current federal pesticide regulatory framework, as well as federal efforts to protect salmon and their habitats under the ESA. More precisely, attention will be given to the ESA procedural guidelines for safeguarding salmon and their habitats and the problematic position of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in balancing ESA responsibilities with the duty to regulate domestic pesticide use under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). After analyzing the procedural mechanisms available to guide interagency cooperation to protect endangered species and their habitats, Part IV will explore the Pacific Salmon as an endangered species, the protections that the ESA should afford to salmon with an ESA listing, and the level and effects of pesticides in vital salmon habitats across the Northwest. Furthermore, the discussion in Part V will examine potential remedies to the procedural deficiencies and ineffective regime as implemented to regulate domestic pesticide use. A center point of this discussion will include analysis of recent federal court orders imposing restrictions on certain pesticide use in close proximity to salmon harboring watersheds. In the matter of Washington Toxics Coalition v. EPA, environmental groups and fishing industry activists challenged EPA 2 ̆ 7 s ineffectiveness and failure to implement ESA mandated safety measures to prevent harmful pesticides from polluting critical salmon habitats. Pesticide industry intervenors joined EPA in an attempt to impede the implementation of more rigid pesticide regulations, but round one of the litigation was a victory for environmentalists. Lastly, Part VI of this Comment will examine the possible future of domestic pesticide regulation and the likely effects of such regulation on business, private landowners, and the environment...|$|E

In 1984, TOMS took center stage as the primary provider of Antarctic ozone hole maps to the world community; it continues to play that role until today. An unexpected benefit of the close attention paid to improving the TOMS data quality was that several atmospheric constituents that interfere with ozone measurement were also identified and meticulously converted into long-term datasets of their own. These constituents include clouds, volcanic S 02, aerosols, and ocean phytoplankton. In addition, the high quality of the basic datasets made it possible to produce global maps of surface UV and tropospheric ozone. In most cases there are no other sources of these data sets. Advanced UV instruments currently under development in the US and Europe will continue to exploit the TOMS-developed techniques for several decades...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades of coral reefs studies, the large areal {{coverage}} of data derived from satellite images has increasingly been used to complement the more detailed but spatially limited data produced by conventional fieldwork. Continuous improvement in sensor capabilities, along with the development of increasingly refined methods for image processing, has lead to ever more accurate maps of physical and biological variables of importance to reef ecology. During the same period, an abundance of field studies have documented statistical relationships between aspects of the reef habitat and its fish community. Despite numerous stochastic influences, such as spatially concentrated and temporally variable fish recruitment pulses or the selective and patchy mortality caused by fishing, several aspects of habitat have been shown to significantly influence the fish community. Fortunately the most important of these, water depth, the structural complexity of the reef, and the cover of live coral, are possible to estimate from currently available satellite imagery. The research presented in the following pages has combined the statistical relationships between the fish community and its habitat with the capability of satellite imagery to map that habitat, thereby answering the research question: How can remote sensing be used to map coral reef fish communities? In the process, a set of new techniques for predictive modeling of complex relationships have been compared, the influence of a range of habitat variables on the fish community quantified, the spatial scales at which the fish-habitat relationships are strongest have been explored, and new methods for deriving estimates of some aspects of the coral reef habitat from satellite imagery have been developed. The results presented in this thesis thus contribute to the further understanding of fish-habitat relationships, while providing a template for producing spatially explicit predictive models of fish community variables. This is not only of scientific interest, but also of substantial value to the conservation community that tries to protect the world’s remaining healthy coral reef ecosystems, and their fish communities, from an array of <b>man-made</b> <b>influences...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article reviews {{different}} views of neo-classical and ecological economics on the sustainability of economic growth and welfare. Neo-classical economics concludes that, due to substitution and technical progress, consumption can be sustained even if production depends on a natural resource that is being depleted. If production depends on an essential, renewable resource, there is a level of consumption that can be sustained forever. Pollution lowers the level of consumption that can be sustained. If production depends on an exhaustible resource, recycling of waste is insufficient for sustaining consumption unless 100 % recycling is possible. Sustainable economic development is possible if the resource growth potential exceeds {{the sum of the}} discount rate minus the rate of exogenous technical progress and if resource productivity is sufficiently high. In addition, intial levels of environmental quality (a composite of pollution and natural resources) and <b>man-made</b> capital <b>influence</b> the possibilities for sustainable economic development. If the resource stock itself affects utility, or if irreversibilities occur, optimal consumption and extraction are lowered. Ecological economics states that: substitution possibilities are restricted, full recycling of waste is impossible, and the limited influx of solar energy poses an additional constraint on the level of production that can be sustained. Since the functions of the environment (production factor, consumer good and waste sink) are intertwined, this life support function poses a restriction on economic growth as well. In ecological economics development is viewed as an evolutionary process with continuous feedbacks between a changing economy and environment. Welfare is not merely the sum of discounted individual preferences but requires environmental compatibility and the explicit (collective) formulation of policies regarding the conservation of species, ecosystems and natural resources...|$|R

Severe rainfall, natural situation, new unplanned developments, and insufficient drainage systems make the situation more remarkable. This research is an approach of flood hazard assessment at regional scale. The objectives of this study are to find out the criteria which contribute to the risk of flooding based on the characteristic of the region to develop a GIS-aided urban flood susceptibility map. Fuzzy logic and Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) methods in Geographic Information System (GIS) are used to achieve the objectives. Defined criteria are evaluated by means of complexity, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The methodology emphasizes on uncertainty criteria which contribute to the risk of flood and increase the risk. Distance from main stream, elevation, slope, land use type, distance from river and distance from discharge channel are recognized as effective criteria within the region. Each criterion is evaluated based on fuzzy membership type and generated map are combined using weighted linear combination to produce the final flood susceptibility map.

In the US–Mexico borderland, urbanization and construction of the border fence {{have the potential to}} increase genetic subdivision and vulnerability to isolation in large mammal populations by bisecting movement corridors that have enabled dispersal between adjacent Sky Island mountain ranges. We examined genetic variation in black bears (Ursus americanus) from three regions in central and southern Arizona, US, to assess genetic and landscape connectivity in the US–Mexico border Sky Islands. We found that the three regions grouped into two subpopulations: the east-central subpopulation comprised of individuals sampled in the central highland and high desert regions, and the border subpopulation comprised of individuals sampled in the southern Sky Islands. Occupancy for the border subpopulation of black bears was influenced by cover type and distance to water, and occupancy-based corridor models identified 14 potential corridors connecting border Sky Island habitat cores with the east-central subpopulation. Biological quality of corridors, defined as length:width ratio and proportions of suitable habitat within corridors, declined with Sky Island dispersion. Our results show that black bears in the border subpopulation are moderately isolated from the east-central subpopulation, the main population segment of black bears in Arizona, and that connectivity for border bears may be vulnerable to anthropogenic activities, such as those associated with urbanization and trans-border security...|$|R
40|$|English: Urbanization is {{a serious}} threat to stream ecosystems. Culverts {{fragment}} habitats, and can function as migration barriers. If migratory individuals are prevented to move between important habitats, this could potentially result in spatial variation in lifehistory traits. Brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) is an introduced salmonid species of North- American origin. It has shown to be mobile within systems, and its life history patterns to be phenotypic plastic. Despite being an unwanted species in the Norwegian fauna, it has received little attention as it has been considered to be a competition-weak species. In this study I tested the hypothesis that; a the degree of local-scale connectivity, including both natural- and <b>man-made</b> barriers, <b>influences</b> migration probability, and bowing to local-scale influence on within- stream section environmental conditions there are among-section differences in brook charr life history traits like growth, survival, and maturation. The hypothesis was tested in Oslo’s most urban stream, Hovinbekken. The study stream was divided into four spatially separated sections, where individuals of brook charr were caught using electroshocking, tagged with PIT-tags, and recaptured, during an eighteen months period (2010 - 2012). Over five sampling occasions, in total 528 brook charr individuals were caught, of which 452 were tagged. Out of 143 recaptured individuals, 8 moved between stations. 6 of them moved between the two stations without natural or man-made barriers, a pattern attributed to spawning and winter-migration. 2 individuals moved in a downstream direction through culverts, none the opposite way. Upstream migration through natural and artificial fragmented landscape seems therefore to be absent, probably impossible. Growth, survival, and length at maturation varied at a temporal and spatial scale; the southernmost and most urban stations had highest growth rate for 0 +, longer growth before stagnation, and matured at longer lengths, probably due to favorable temperature conditions. Survival probability seemed in general to be lowest over winter. Additionally, winter survival was size-dependent, i. e. larger fish having the highest survival. In contrast, and over summer, survival was negatively sizedependent. Spatial variation in size-dependent seasonal survival was found, and attributed to pool characteristics. Because of the inconsistence in size-independent spatial variation in survival, and the impossibility to determine age at sexual maturation, {{further research is needed to}} gain more knowledge of brook charrs life history traits in Hovinbekken. I also recommend continuing studying brook charr in Hovinbekken to obtain further knowledge for best management practice...|$|R
40|$|The water {{chemistry}} of Lake Las Vegas (LLV), a Southern Nevada <b>man-made</b> reservoir, is <b>influenced</b> by both anthropogenic and natural sources. These sources affect the reservoir 2 ̆ 7 s {{water chemistry}}, which may promote harmful algal blooms (HABs) leading to massive fish kill events. Fish kills, {{caused by the}} golden algaePrymnesium parvum (P. parvum), continue to pose a threat in the reservoir. However, no effective treatments to controlP. parvumin large reservoirs such as LLV have been determined. This cross-sectional study evaluated important variables that may affectP. parvumHABs in LLV, including non-P. parvumbiomass (mg/m 3), total zooplankton abundance (#/m 3), temperature, TDS (salinity), mineral concentration (Ca, Mg, K, Na), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and N:P ratios. Using secondary analysis from Water Quality Monitoring Reports, mid-month data was collected from December 2009 through December 2012 (N= 38). This time frame was selected due to an algal bloom occurrence in December 2009, {{which led to the}} first fish kill event approximately thirty days thereafter. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis were performed using a 30 day lag in order to traverse appropriate date ranges to determine variable significance for hypotheses testing. Statistical analyses found temperature, TDS (salinity), mineral concentration (Ca, Mg, K, Na), and TN to be significant predictor variables (p≤ 0. 1) forP. parvumbloom formation. Observational analysis of interactions between independent variables onP. parvumbloom formation was also assessed, which may be key to making profound research discoveries. This study supports the findings in the literature; however, becauseP. parvumblooms in LLV are unique compared to other strains, different treatments for mitigation may be needed. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of golden algae biosynthesis, its biology and ecology, as well as its associated toxicity, in order to better manage blooms leading to fish kill events in LLV...|$|R
40|$|Cities {{and towns}} are loci of {{population}} and production. In 2010, 80. 7 {{percent of the}} United States population resided in urban areas, and the U. S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that in 2011, 90. 1 percent of GDP was produced in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), emphasizing that urban areas and their immediate hinterlands are also centers of production. Academic interest in urban population change can be split into two literature branches. The first branch focuses on the growth and structure of individual cities. The second branch focuses on the urban system. Some of the literature in this branch implicitly assumes interconnectedness among cities, while other authors explicitly include the spatial proximity between cities or network flows among cities. However, in many studies the difference between contagious and hierarchical interrelations across cities comprised in the urban system are obfuscated. In this paper we clearly distinguish and quantify the effects of both. In other words, we focus on how {{the structure of the}} urban system influences population growth. We do this by using central place theory as a theoretical basis for addressing the research question: what natural and <b>man-made</b> locational characteristics <b>influence</b> population growth? We envisage three major contributions to the existing literature. First, we utilize a unique dataset of urban areas with decennial observations from 1990 to 2010. Most of the literature studying urban systems in the United States uses MSAs, which include rural hinterlands that {{are not part of the}} urban area, preventing a clear separation between cities and hinterlands and obscuring results. We built a new dataset at the more appropriate and precise geographic level of urban areas, which capture the agglomerated economic activity and built extent of urban locations. Second, departing from literature that includes either urban hierarchy or continuous urban proximity, our analysis includes both the hierarchical relationship among cities of differing sizes and the continuous nature of proximity to other cities. The novel use of a spatially-lagged hierarchical linear model allows us to include both these critical aspects of the urban system in our analysis. This econometric model captures the influence of the structure of the urban system on population change by allowing city-level explanatory variables to affect population growth differently, given the unique characteristics of each location's regional and central place market areas. Concurrently we account for contiguous effects through the inclusion of neighbors. Third, we include man-made amenities and characteristics of cities, which have been omitted from previous studies in an effort to avoid endogeneity in the analysis. The inclusion of these characteristics allows us to include both producer-based and consumer-based characteristics in the analysis, to capture the idea that cities are markets...|$|R
40|$|The Ems estuary has {{constantly}} {{changed over}} the past centuries both from <b>man-made</b> and natural <b>influences.</b> On the time scale of thousands of years, sea level rise has created the estuary and dynamically changed its boundaries. More recently, storm surges created the Dollard sub-basin in the 14 th - 15 th centuries. Beginning in the 16 th century, diking and reclamation of land has greatly altered the surface area of the Ems estuary, particularly in the Dollard. These natural and anthropogenic changes to the surface area of the Ems altered the flow patterns of water, the tidal characteristics, and the patterns of sediment deposition and erosion. Since 1945, reclamation of land has halted and {{the borders of the}} Ems estuary have changed little. Sea level rise has continued, and over the past 40 years the rate of increase in mean high water (MHW) along the German coast has accelerated to 40 cm/ century. Climate has varied on a decadal time scale due to long-term variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which controls precipitation, temperature, and the direction and magnitude of winds. Between 1960 and 1990 the most intense variation in the NAO index on record was observed. As a result the magnitude and frequency of storm surges increased, and mean wave heights increased at 1 - 2 cm/year. Currently the NAO index—and therefore storminess—is trending downwards. Over the longer term, global warming models predict an average temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius over the next century. A doubling of CO 2 is expected to increase sea level by 30 cm, while the significant wind speed and wave heights in the North Sea are predicted to increase by 50 cm/s and 50 cm, respectively. Beginning in the late 1950 ’s, dredging activity and construction measures in harbours and shipping channels greatly altered the physical processes in the Ems. Deepening and streamlining the Ems River and shipping channel between the 1960 s and 1990 s decreased the hydraulic roughness and increased the tidal range in the river above Emden by as much as 1. 5 m. At the turbidity maximum between Emden and Papenburg, concentrations of sediment are currently between 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than in the 1950 ’s, and fluid mud layers of several meters thickness occur. Other man-made changes, such as gas pipelines and the expansion of harbours, have often caused significant, but more localized, changes to the estuary. Between the mid 19 th century and the 1970 ’s, dumping of organic waste—agricultural, industrial, and human—severely stressed the ecology of the Dollard sub-basin in particular. Since then the input of organic waste has been greatly reduced and anoxic conditions eliminated. However, the increase in turbidity at the turbidity maximum has caused depleted oxygen concentrations and periodic anoxia between Pogum and Papenburg during the summer months (personal communication, H. Juergens; Talke et al, 2005). The Ems is a relatively well studied estuary. Significant research projects have included the BOEDE project in the 1970 ’s [...] 1980 ’s and the BOA and INTRAMUD projects in the 1990 ’s. These projects and other efforts have amassed a deep literature in the knowledge of tidal flats, fluid mud and flocculation, and mixing and dispersion processes. Projects currently underway are focusing on tidal dynamics and the affects of dredging in the high turbidity zone between Emden and Herbrum. Optimal management of the estuary is the goal of the HARBASINS project. Many analytical and numerical models have been applied to the Ems estuary to estimate tidal range, storm surges, wave fields, sediment transport, and mixing and dispersion processes. Analytical models to estimate mixing of scalars and sediment fluxes (Sediment Trend Analysis) have been extensively used. Numerical models such as WAQUA, unTRIM, MIKE 3, Telemac 2 D, SWAN, Delft 3 D –Sed, and others have been applied to the Ems. While reasonable results are found for short term processes (order of days), long-term morphological change cannot yet be predicted. For the Ems catchement basin, the numerical models REGFLUD and FLUMAGIS are used to estimate nutrient inputs from diffuse sources and to visualize and evaluate the effects of land-use change...|$|R
