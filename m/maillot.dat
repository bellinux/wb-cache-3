5|$|In 2004 Hamilton {{switched}} to the Swiss team, Phonak, citing lack of support from Riis. The team brought on Ivan Basso from Fassa Bortolo to join Carlos Sastre in competing for Grand Tour wins. Basso had been a former winner of the <b>maillot</b> blanc in 2002. In the 2004 Tour de France, Team CSC had a very successful Tour, with Basso winning a mountain stage and reaching the podium in Paris with his third place finish. Bjarn Riis and Team CSCs efforts in the 2004 Tour were made into the cycling movie Overcoming.|$|E
5|$|What {{happened}} next is uncertain. Legend says that Vienne and Perez promised a mass would {{be said for}} the riders in a chapel 200m from the start, in the boulevard <b>Maillot.</b> This story is repeated by Pascal Sergent, the historian of the race, and by Pierre Chany, historian of the sport in general. Sergent goes as far as saying that Victor Breyer, who he says was there, said the service, scheduled for 4am, was cancelled because it was too early. Neither Chany nor Sergent mentions if the date of the race was subsequently changed, however the first Paris–Roubaix (according to Sergent) was held on 19 April 1896, whereas Easter Sunday in 1896 occurred two weeks earlier, on the 5 April.|$|E
5|$|Fabian Cancellara {{held the}} lead of the race {{throughout}} its opening Belgian leg; having won the race-commencing prologue, Cancellara defended it on the following two stages before the race returned to France. Cancellara maintained his overall lead {{for the rest of the}} race's first week, before eventually losing time on the first true mountain stage of the race – stage seven – as he was dropped on the closing climb to La Planche des Belles Filles. As a result, Bradley Wiggins assumed the <b>maillot</b> jaune, becoming the first British rider to wear the jersey since 2000. Wiggins maintained the lead for the following three stages, including his first victory at the Tour during the ninth stage individual time trial in Besançon. Wiggins held a lead of almost two minutes in the overall standings with the more mountainous second half of the Tour still to race. Two riders won multiple stages during the first half of the race; Peter Sagan, in his first Tour de France, won three stages and also held {{the lead of}} the points classification, while André Greipel took back-to-back stage victories on the fourth and fifth stages. World champion Mark Cavendish achieved one stage victory, while French riders Thibaut Pinot and Thomas Voeckler each took breakaway victories.|$|E

25|$|Boulevard Pershing on {{the western}} edge of Paris, France runs past the Palais des Congrès near the Porte <b>Maillot.</b> Many of the major streets in the area (the 16th arrondissement) are named after notable French {{military}} figures, including Avenue Foch, named after Marshal Foch, and at either end of Boulevard Pershing, streets named after the Marshals of France Gouvion Saint-Cyr and Koenig. It reflects the immense popularity of the American troops who first arrived in the French capital in 1916.|$|E
25|$|Set {{off from}} Paris on Friday 21 June 1895 at 5.25am from the Porte <b>Maillot,</b> where Monsieur Haufert, {{timekeeper}} of the Union, {{gave us the}} starting signal, we crossed the Bois de Boulogne towards Versailles. The weather was cold, that damp coldness of some mornings in June which makes you search for a light jacket and freezes your hands; but we were full of ardour, replete with good advice and lots of energy and it was happily that Richard and I on the tandem and our trainer Lambert on a bicycle started our long journey for the record from Paris to Agen.|$|E
50|$|During {{the third}} season again three premieres were staged at the Vienna State Opera: Rudolf Nureyev’s „Der Nussknacker“ (Nutcracker), the quadruple bill evening „Tanzperspektiven“ (Dance Perspectives) with David Dawson’s „A Million Kisses to My Skin“, Helen Pickett’s „Eventide“, Patrick de Bana’s „Windspiele“ (Wind Chimes) and Jean-Christophe <b>Maillot’s</b> „Vers un Pays Sage“ and the „Nuryev Gala 2013“.

50|$|Born in Busan, Kim {{began to}} study ballet when she was 12, {{completing}} her training at the Bolshoi Ballet School in 1998. The same year she joined the Korean National Ballet where she soon gained the distinction of prima ballerina. Kim has contributed significantly to Korean ballet taking leading roles in Giselle, Swan Lake, Don Quixote and Jean-Christophe <b>Maillot's</b> Romeo and Juliet. Between 1998 and 2012, Kim performed approximately 100 times a year, practicing three or four different programs at a time. Semi-nude photos of her in Vogue and a photographer's exhibition in 2007 were considered controversial.|$|R

25|$|Following stage 16, Cofidis rider, Cristian Moreni, {{was arrested}} by French police after testing {{positive}} for synthetic testosterone after stage 11. With this, the entire Cofidis team withdrew {{the rest of their}} team from the Tour. Later that evening, news broke that overall leader, Michael Rasmussen, was withdrawn from the Tour by his Rabobank team due to allegedly lying about his whereabouts during a three-week training session in Mexico in which he was unavailable for UCI doping controls. This elevated Alberto Contador to the overall lead of the race. However, as this occurred after the jersey presentations of Stage 16, there would be no <b>maillot</b> jaune wearer on Stage 17.|$|E
25|$|After {{a strong}} placing in the stage 1 time {{trial of the}} 2005 Tour de France, Voigt was only {{trailing}} race leader Armstrong by 1 minute and he tried hard to take the overall lead. He took part in many attacks, before the first rest day on the 9th stage, he finally got in a break-away that lasted to the line. He finished third, 3 minutes ahead of Armstrong. Voigt's time in the <b>maillot</b> jaune would be short-lived however, as he fell to 168th at stage 10 after a fever, and he was eliminated for failing to finish stage 11 within the time limit. Voigt ended 2005 as 29th on the UCI ProTour individual rankings.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the century, Paris {{began to}} modernise its public {{transport}} system to try to catch up with London. The first metro line was begun in 1897 between the Porte <b>Maillot</b> and the Porte de Vincennes. It was finished in time for the 1900 Universal Exposition. Two new bridges were built over the Seine. One was the Pont Alexandre III, which connected the left bank with the site of the 1900 Exposition. Its cornerstone was laid in 1896 by Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, who, in 1894, had succeeded his father, Alexander III of Russia. The new avenue between the bridge and the Champs Élysées was first named the Avenue Alexandre III, then Avenue Nicolas II, and again Avenue Alexandre III until 1966, when it was finally renamed Avenue Winston-Churchill. The same engineers who built the modern iron structure of the Pont Alexandre III also built the Pont Mirabeau, which connected Auteuil and Javel.|$|E
50|$|Lespert {{made his}} film debut in 1995, in Laurent Cantet's film Jeux de plage, {{opposite}} his father. His first major role came in 1999, in Jacques <b>Maillot's</b> film Nos vies heureuses.

He has performed in the first Bolshoi casts of many ballets, including Wayne McGregor's Chroma, George Balanchine's Jewels and Yuri Possokhov's Classical Symphony. In 2013, he was chosen {{to be the first}} dancer to perform the role of Eugene Onegin at the Bolshoi Theater in John Cranko's Onegin. In 2014, Lantratov created the role of Petruchio in John-Christophe <b>Maillot's</b> Taming of the Shrew.|$|R
60|$|Pen, being {{new to the}} town, {{would have}} liked to listen to Mrs. Leary; but the other people in the box did not care about her song or her pantaloons, and kept up an incessant chattering. Tiptoff knew where her <b>maillots</b> came from. Colchicum saw her when she came out in '14. Miss Blenkinsop said she sang out of all tune, to the pain and astonishment of Pen, who thought that she was as {{beautiful}} as an angel, and that she sang like a nightingale; and when Hoppus came on as Sir Harcourt Featherby, the young man of the piece, the gentlemen in the box declared that Hoppus was getting too stale, and Tiptoff was for flinging Miss Blenkinsop's bouquet to him.|$|R

500|$|Just {{like the}} {{previous}} day's stage, {{the second stage}} of the race also comprised six categorised climbs, packed into the [...] route through the Ardèche region, with the highest point coming at the summit of the second-category Col de Montivernoux. The finish in Saint-Félicien came {{at the end of a}} [...] climb, which would more or less rule out the sprinters more obviously than the first stage parcours. [...] rider Rémi Pauriol and 's Maxime Méderel broke clear of the peloton in the opening stages, and they were subsequently joined by a group which contained a number of overall race contenders including <b>maillot</b> jaune et bleu wearer Bradley Wiggins (...) , Vincenzo Nibali of [...] and [...] rider Sylvain Chavanel.

500|$|For {{the second}} ascent of the Col de Peyresourde during the race, the riders {{would take the}} climb in the {{opposite}} direction from what they had done on the previous day, before a slight descent and then the final climb to Peyragudes. Valverde held a lead of 1' 20" [...] {{at the top of the}} uncategorised pass, with only a handful of riders remaining with the group of the <b>maillot</b> jaune, including the top four in the general classification. Valverde was holding his own off the front, and the gap was fluctuating between 1' 20" [...] and 1' 30" [...] for several kilometres as they neared the summit, which came at the flamme rouge point. 's Jurgen Van den Broeck tried to attack, but was pulled back by the Froome and Wiggins tandem, which then accelerated away from their rivals and set off after Valverde. Ultimately, they came up short due to Froome having to wait three times for Wiggins as the race leader was several metres behind his domestique on certain parts of the climb. Valverde achieved his fourth career stage victory at the Tour, nineteen seconds ahead of Froome and Wiggins, who in turn extended their advantage over the rest of the field.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1930s BVD was purchased by the Atlas Underwear company of Piqua, Ohio. During the Great Depression they were successful in manufacturing swimsuits for men, women and children. They patented their own fabric, Sea Satin, a rayon woven satin backed with latex for stretch. They also used knits of cotton, wool and Rayon, and cellophane.Their swimsuits featured in major fashion magazines and high fashion stores. Styles included form fitting <b>maillots</b> as well as full skirted swimsuits. They offered suits for men with detachable tops. In 1929, Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller, who {{went on to become the}} most famous Tarzan in motion pictures, was hired as a model and representative. He was featured at swim shows throughout the country wearing the BVD brand of swimsuits, handing out leaflets and giving autographs.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{reminiscent}} of Takarazuka's performances are the characters' very large eyes. Some {{aspects of this}} work are also {{reminiscent of}} his previous shōjo manga, Kiseki no Mori no Monogatari, which featured a feathered hat and men in white <b>maillots</b> as well as adventure-driven storylines. Also influential on Princess Knight, as well as early Tezuka works, was early Disney films' animation technique. It influenced Tezuka's art style, especially his way of drawing eyes and childlike features. Aside from Disney, it is also influenced by Western literature, Christianity, Greek mythology, and European fairy tales—because of this it {{has been described as}} a [...] "trippy pop culture pastiche". Reviewers have perceived influences from Cinderella, Fantasias [...] "Pastoral", Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Betty Boop, Captain Blood, Dracula, [...] "Eros and Psyche", Hamlet, [...] "The Sorcerer's Apprentice", Swan Lake, The Scarlet Pimpernel, and William Tell.|$|R
50|$|As PBT {{moved into}} the millennium, the company {{continued}} to draw inspiration from its hometown while stretching the city’s conception of classical ballet. In 2000, Orr in conjunction with Libman, {{began a series of}} commissions for contemporary ballets inspired by American music, including such artists as: Ray Brown, Stanley Turrentine, Lena Horne, Billy Strayhorn, Sting, Bruce Springsteen and Paul Simon. In 2002, Orr premiered his Pittsburgh-inspired production of The Nutcracker, engaging artists with a new creative endeavor and audiences with a production set in their city. In addition to modern masters like Twyla Tharp and Paul Taylor, the company commissioned works by rising choreographer Dwight Rhoden and ballets merging mainstream American music with classically based choreography. While PBT continued to celebrate legacy classics like Giselle, it also entered new dramatic territory with Jean-Christophe <b>Maillot’s</b> unconventional Roméo et Juliette and the evocative Light / The Holocaust and Humanity Project.|$|R
