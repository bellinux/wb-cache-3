50|$|The Alcmeonis (Ἀλκμαιωνίς, Alkmaiōnis) is a lost early Greek epic {{which is}} {{considered}} to have formed part of the Theban cycle. There are only seven references to the Alcmeonis in ancient literature, and all of <b>them</b> <b>make</b> it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the authorship of the epic was unknown. It {{told the story of}} Alcmaeon's killing of his mother Eriphyle for having arranged {{the death of his father}} Amphiaraus, whose murder was narrated in the Thebaid. One of the surviving fragments is quoted by Athenaeus in the Deipnosophistae: he chose it because it describes a funeral banquet.

40|$|Damage {{and failure}} of fiber {{composites}} {{is a complex}} process the prediction of which requires adequate models. Considerable effort during the last 50 years {{has led to a}} vast number of models, and the development is still ongoing. This paper aims at providing an overview of the models developed so far for laminated continuous fiber-reinforced polymer composites under quasi-static load. The models are grouped into homogeneous ones, those with some effect of inhomogeneity between fibers and the matrix, and fully inhomogeneous ones. The development of homogeneous models is characterized by pronounced competition and rivalry between the originators. In spite of great efforts a decision upon the one and only model could not be drawn. Accounting for the inhomogeneity between fibers and the matrix allows being more close to the real behavior on the account of higher computational effort. Since this is no severe handicap any more due to outstanding development in computational power inhomogeneous models have soared recently. Reviewing <b>them</b> <b>makes</b> <b>clear,</b> however, <b>that</b> they suffer from the difficulty to gather reliable material data. In summary it must be concluded that in spite of the tremendous effort put into the model development for fiber composite damage and failure a fully satisfying solution is not yet available. Consequently, for the time being a real test remains the authentic way to secure structural strength...|$|R
60|$|The {{problem is}} much simpler {{in the case}} of {{mathematical}} teaching than {{in the case of}} English, because the educational theory and method have been more thoroughly discussed. There is no need for the ten years of experiment and trial I have suggested for the organization of English teaching. The mathematical reformer may begin now at a point the English language reformer will not reach for some years. Suppose now a suitably authenticated committee were to work out--on the basis of Professor Perry's syllabus perhaps--a syllabus of school mathematics, and then make a thorough review of all the mathematical textbooks on sale throughout the English-speaking world, admitting some perhaps as of real permanent value for teaching of the new type, provisionally recognizing others as endurable, but with clear recommendations for their revision and improvement, and condemning the others specifically by name. Let <b>them</b> <b>make</b> it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> this syllabus and report will be respected by all public examining bodies; let them spend a hundred pounds or so in the intelligent distribution of their report, and the scholastic profession will not be long before it is equipped with the recommended books.
