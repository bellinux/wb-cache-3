50|$|As of late 2014, all UAVs {{developed}} by TXC are <b>multirotors,</b> {{and a total}} of three have been successfully marketed, both are mainly for crop dusting missions. The first type of <b>multirotors</b> TXC developed is an octocopter series consisting two model, designated as TXC8-3 and TXC8-5 respectively. The third multirotor {{developed by}} TXC is a hexadecacopter designated as TXC16-10. All TXC multrotors share the same design principle of easy operation and low cost, and using a single multirotor is equivalent of using twenty to eighty manual laborers, depending on the model. Special consideration is given to water conservation with efficiency of water usage increased by thirty percent and achieving the same result with less liquid used. All <b>multirotors</b> are designed for rapid deployment, and can be airborne within a few minute after taking out of storage and assembled and loaded with payloads. TXC <b>multirotors</b> are intended for simple operation and maintenance, and operator can be qualified to perform operation and routine daily maintenance after ten to fifteen days of training, depending on the model. Unlike most Chinese <b>multirotors</b> using a pair of skids as landing gear, all TXC <b>multirotors</b> have four legs as landing gear, and as of late 2014, all TXC <b>multirotors</b> are electrically powered, and adopt the same layout: the hexadecacopter has two rotors on each of the eight arms, bringing the total number of rotors to sixteen.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} implementation of a single tilting rotor <b>multirotor</b> helicopter. A single tilting rotor <b>multirotor</b> helicopter is proposed that allows for decoupled lateral acceleration and attitude states. A dynamics model of the proposed <b>multirotor</b> helicopter is established to enable control system development. A control system architecture and daisy chaining-based control allocation scheme is developed and implemented. The control architecture facilitates the control of decoupled lateral accelerations and attitudes. Further, a computational and experimental analysis is undertaken and offers evidence that the proposed <b>multirotor</b> helicopter and control system architecture enables the <b>multirotor</b> helicopter to achieve lateral accelerations without requiring attitude actuation...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{feasibility}} of a <b>multirotor</b> controller system which can dynamically change the arm configuration of a <b>multirotor.</b> Currently most of the <b>multirotor</b> systems have to be powered down, rewired, and programmed with new firmware, to configure how many arms/motors they use to fly. The focus of our effort {{is to develop a}} Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based hardware/software controller which uses dynamic partial hardware reconfiguration to switch the arm/motor configuration of a <b>multirotor</b> during operation. We believe that this will make a <b>multirotor</b> more fault tolerant and adaptive. This thesis explains the design and development of a simple <b>multirotor</b> reconfiguration system which can start with a six arm configuration and switch to a four arm configuration or a three arm configuration and back. The design and implementation of the hardware and software on a Xilinx Zynq System on chip prototyping board (ZedBoard) is explained in this thesis. The system is used for single axis balancing of the <b>multirotor.</b> Observations from the experiments, limitations of the current design, and potential future developments are also listed in this thesis...|$|R

50|$|FYAT has {{developed}} a family of unmanned airship as alternatives to unmanned helicopters and <b>multirotors.</b> The main advantage of unmanned blimp over unmanned helicopters and <b>multirotors</b> is that while it can perform the hovering functions, unmanned blimp has much lower operating cost than unmanned helicopters and <b>multirotors.</b> Other advantages included longer endurance and lower maintenance cost. However, {{it is not clear}} if any FYAT unmanned blimp has entered service with Chinese law enforcement or military, because FYAT has not released any information in its marketing effort of unmanned blimps. One of the features of unmanned blimps developed by FYAT is that the landing gear consists of a pair of skids, a rather unusual design among Chinese unmanned blimps.|$|E

40|$|Vertical {{take-off}} {{and landing}} (VTOL) aircraft has good flight characteristics and system performance without runway. The <b>multirotor</b> {{system has been}} tried to expand into larger size for longer endurance or higher payload. But the motor power to endurance ratio has been limited.
