500|$|Salanoia durrelli {{was placed}} in the genus Salanoia, which {{previously}} included only the brown-tailed mongoose of eastern Madagascar. S.durrelli shows substantial morphological differences from the brown-tailed mongoose, but the mitochondrial DNA of the two species is very similar. The discoverers chose to recognize the Lac Alaotra population as a separate species in view of its significant morphological differentiation. The observed morphological distinctiveness <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> [...] adaptations to life in the Alaotra wetlands, similar to the Alaotra bamboo lemur species, Hapalemur alaotrensis, which is also recognized as a distinct species despite being genetically close to the more widespread Hapalemur griseus.|$|E
30|$|Lastly, {{variations}} in the marine reservoir age itself {{should be kept in}} mind. Small fluctuations in the Kilen reservoir age <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> these variations.

30|$|What is the {{molecular}} basis for such enhancement of cellulase activity? The observed enhancement <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen bond disruption between cellulose chains, rendering the substrate less recalcitrant for hydrolysis as {{has already been}} demonstrated for other CBMs (Gao et al. [2001]; Xiao et al. [2001]; Pinto et al. [2004]; Wang et al. [2008]). Our experimental evidence of the boost in enzymatic hydrolysis yields for the crystalline cellulosic substrate which underwent incubation with CBM prior to application of cellulases clearly indicate that the synergistic effect between the CBMs and the cellulases should be mediated by the decrease in recalcitrance of the substrate.|$|E

30|$|Thirty-five {{days after}} first {{watering}}, a second watering event took place. As shown in Fig.  4 a, {{a new set}} of temperature peaks was observed, but those peaks did not reach previous levels. This result might be a consequence of NH 4 + depletion because no new urine or manure was added in this experiment. That NH 4 + depletion might result in low nitrification activity in the manure, which would decrease denitrification; therefore, those small temperature peaks <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> inhibited microorganism activity. Because the N inputs as urine and manure on a pen surface can be considered inexhaustible in an open-lot beef cattle feedlot, it might be suggested that large emission peaks of GHGs are emitted after each rainfall event on dry soil/manure surfaces.|$|E
40|$|This study explores {{why some}} {{consumers}} choose {{to pay for}} hedonic consumption instead of consuming for free. Consumer decision making processes, the nature of retailing hedonic consumption and major factors influencing purchase intention literature is reviewed. Common models on the decision-making process tend to outline several broad phases or levels such as problem recognition, information search and evaluation, purchase, and post-purchase behaviour (Craig-Lees, Joy & Browne 1995; Statt 1997). However, hedonic consumption is associated with pleasure, arousal (Holbrook & Gardner 1993), and is primarily characterized by an affective and sensory experience of aesthetic or sensual pleasure, fantasy, and fun (Hirschman and Holbrook 1982). This differs to normal consumption motives because, consumers characterise some products as primarily hedonic and others as primarily utilitarian. Analysis of data from focus groups show that choosing to pay for hedonic consumption <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> utilitarian value, value adding, perceptions of quality and identity. Further testing is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{investigated}} {{an unusual}} elevated-ozone episode {{that took place}} at a high altitude measuring site Zavižan (44. 817 °N, 14. 983 °E, 1594 m a. s. l.). The episode was characterized by three consecutive peaks. The first one was the highest (over 120 ppbv), and it occurred at the late night on 17 July. Following two (both about 110 ppbv) appeared approximately 18 and 36 hours after the first peak, respectively. The night-time maximum and the departure from the usual diurnal variation of ozone concentration during investigated episode point to the non-local pollution sources, rather than to local photochemical production. Thus, recorded ozone peaks might arise due to the long-range transport of photo-oxidants; 2) stratospheric ozone intrusion; or 3) they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> both (1) and (2). In order to inspect which of above processes {{is responsible for the}} increased ozone concentrations we applied the unified EMEP model, which among others, simulates atmospheric transport and deposition of photo-oxidants, and, a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model WRF-ARW V 2. 2. Additionally, the larger scale atmospheric conditions were examined based on the ECMWF ERA- 40 reanalysis fields. Results suggest that the stratospheric ozone intrusion {{played an important role in}} the occurrence of investigated episode.

25|$|Another {{important}} factor {{to consider is}} the individual differences {{in the experience of}} pleasurable effects brought on by the substance or behaviour. It is reasoned that certain individuals may be more sensitive to the pleasurable effects and thus experience them with greater intensity, resulting in addiction. For example, over-responsiveness to substance affects has been found in cocaine addicts – an increased response to methylphenidate in the brain regions associated with emotional reactivity and mood. Thus, strong emotional responses that addicted individuals show in response to substances or behaviours <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> enhanced sensitivity to their effects.|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the initial conditions of low-mass star formation {{is a key to}} understand the process of protostellar collapse and protostar formation. This thesis focuses on the earliest stages of isolated low-mass star formation and covers spatial scales which spread over three orders of magnitude. It includes the study of a filament with a length of a few parsecs, down to the in-depth analysis of an isolated prestellar core, where structures of the order of a few hundred AU are resolved. In the first part, a NIR extinction map of the filament L 1495 reveals its small scale, highly fragmented structure, and a high star-forming potential in all its parts. In some regions, the initial filament collapse and fragmentation is still taking place and star formation is yet to occur, whereas in other parts, I identify a population of dense cores with separations of the order of the locals Jeans length, which are likely to collapse and form stars. The second part of the thesis focuses on the isolated core CB 17, which hosts two sources at very different evolutionary stages (Class I vs. prestellar core) at a projected distance of only 5500 AU. With the aid of FIR and (sub) mm observations of the dust emission, I determine its density and temperature structure and draw conclusions about the dust properties. Interferometric observations at high angular resolution reveal a complex velocity structure in the prestellar core, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> interaction with the protostar...|$|E
40|$|Sardines {{and other}} Microfilidae have very {{important}} ecological role in marine ecosystems {{because they are}} first consumers in marine food chain {{and they are the}} main food of valuable species as tuna. So decries in their population will decline fishing of these spices. There are 10 genus of Clupeidae in south of Iran and Sardinella is the one of the most abundant of them. In this study we investigated about morphological and genetically differences in population of 3 species: Sardinella sindensis, Sardinella abella, Dussomieria acuta. About 65 specimens of Sardinella sindensis, 61 specimens of Sardinella albella and 63 specimens of, Dussomieria acuta from three regions of their distribution: Jask (Oman Sea), Qeshm (Hormoz) and Lengeh (Pearsian Gulf) have been collected. Morphological research of their characters and statistical studies were done. To determine the genetically structure of specie's population we sequenced 500 bp of mitochondrial control region. Genetical studies determine meaningful difference in alleles and heterozigosity frequency of Sardinella sindensis. This must be the result of divergence in population of this species. Morphological investigation of Sardinella albella shows the meaningful difference. But detailed studies diffused it. Genetical studies show a meaningful variance in allele and heterosigosity frequency. This may be an aspect of sardine tendency to live in estuaries. Morphological research of Dussomieria acuta in Jask and Lengeh show a meaningful variance in these regions. Such a situation <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Monsoon, upwelling and better weather which occur in Oman Sea in spite of Persian Gulf...|$|E
