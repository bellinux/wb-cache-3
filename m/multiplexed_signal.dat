5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the <b>multiplexed</b> <b>signal</b> at the receiving end.|$|E

40|$|A novel compressive-sensing based <b>signal</b> <b>multiplexing</b> {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} to further improve the multiplexing gain for {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) system. At the transmitter side, a Gaussian random measurement matrix in compressive sensing is employed before the traditional spatial multiplexing in order to carry more data streams on the available spatial multiplexing streams of the underlying MIMO system. At the receiver side, it is proposed to reformulate the detection of the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>signal</b> into two steps. In the first step, the traditional MIMO equalization can be used to restore the transmitted spatial <b>multiplexing</b> <b>signal</b> of the MIMO system. While in the second step, the standard optimization based detection algorithm assumed in the compressive sensing framework is utilized to restore the CS multiplexing data streams, wherein the exhaustive over-complete dictionary is used to guarantee the sparse representation of the CS <b>multiplexing</b> <b>signal.</b> In order to avoid the excessive complexity, the sub-block based dictionary and the sub-block based CS restoration is proposed. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed CS based enhanced MIMO multiplexing scheme. And our efforts in this paper shed some lights on the great potential in further improving the spatial multiplexing gain for the MIMO system. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
