5000|$|A <b>monohybrid</b> <b>cross</b> is a mating {{between two}} {{individuals}} with different alleles at one genetic locus of interest. [...] The character(s) being studied in a <b>monohybrid</b> <b>cross</b> {{are governed by}} two or multiple alleles for a single locus.A cross between 2 parents possessing a pair of contrasting characters is known as monohybrid cross.To carry out such a cross, each parent is chosen to be homozygous or true breeding for a given trait (locus). When a cross satisfies the conditions for a <b>monohybrid</b> <b>cross,</b> it is usually detected by a characteristic distribution of second-generation (F2) offspring that is sometimes called the monohybrid ratio.|$|E
50|$|All {{the peas}} of this F1 {{generation}} have an Rr genotype. All the haploid sperm and eggs produced by meiosis received one chromosome 7. All the zygotes received one R allele (from the round seed parent) and one r allele (from the wrinkled seed parent). Because the R allele is dominant to the r allele, the phenotype {{of all the}} seeds was round. The phenotypic ratio in this case of <b>Monohybrid</b> <b>cross</b> is 1:1:1:1.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the <b>monohybrid</b> <b>cross</b> {{is used to}} {{determine}} the dominance relationship between two alleles. The cross begins with the parental (P) generation. One parent is homozygous for one allele, and the other parent is homozygous for the other allele. The offspring make up the first filial (F1) generation. Every member of the F1 generation is heterozygous and the phenotype of the F1 generation expresses the dominant trait. Crossing two members of the F1 generation produces the second filial (F2) generation. Probability theory predicts that three quarters of the F2 generation will have the dominant allele's phenotype. And the remaining quarter of the F2s will have the recessive allele's phenotype. This predicted 3:1 phenotypic ratio assumes Mendelian inheritance.|$|E
50|$|The Law of Independent Assortment {{states that}} alleles for {{separate}} traits are passed independently {{of one another}} from parents to offspring. That is, the biological selection of an allele for one trait {{has nothing to do with}} the selection of an allele for any other trait. Mendel found support for this law in his dihybrid cross experiments (Fig. 1). In his <b>monohybrid</b> <b>crosses,</b> an idealized 3:1 ratio between dominant and recessive phenotypes resulted. In dihybrid crosses, however, he found a 9:3:3:1 ratios (Fig. 2). This shows that each of the two alleles is inherited independently from the other, with a 3:1 phenotypic ratio for each.|$|R
50|$|The forked-line method (also {{known as}} the tree method and the {{branching}} system) can also solve dihybrid and multihybrid crosses. A problem is converted {{to a series of}} <b>monohybrid</b> <b>crosses,</b> and the results are combined in a tree. However, a tree produces the same result as a Punnett square in less time and with more clarity. The example below assesses another double-heterozygote cross using RrYy x RrYy. As stated above, the phenotypic ratio is expected to be 9:3:3:1 if crossing unlinked genes from two double-heterozygotes. The genotypic ratio was obtained in the diagram below, this diagram will have more branches than if only analyzing for phenotypic ratio.|$|R
40|$|Six genic {{mutations}} restricting clones to mating type VII (O) {{were isolated}} in syngen 4, Paramecium aurelia. The only three extensively tested were neither allelic nor closely linked. A {{second type of}} mutation, allelic {{to one of the}} O restricted mutants, was also found. Clones homozygous for this mutant gene were selfers, producing both O and E (VIII) mating types, but only when they were progeny of mating type E parental clones. While all seven mutant genes behaved as recessives in <b>monohybrid</b> <b>crosses,</b> clones heterozygous at two different loci often demonstrated an unanticipated phenotype: selfing. The significance of the findings is discussed in relation to mating type determination and the evolution of mating type systems...|$|R
5000|$|... "Mono" [...] means [...] "one"; this cross {{indicates}} {{that we are}} examining a single trait being crossed. This could mean (for example) that {{we are looking at}} eye color. Each genetic locus is always represented by two letters. So in the case of eye color, say [...] "B = Brown eyes" [...] and [...] "b = green eyes". In this example, both parents have the genotype Bb. For the example of eye color we stated above, this would mean they both have brown eyes. They can produce gametes that contain either the B or the b allele. (It is conventional in genetics to use capital letters to indicate dominant alleles and lower-case letters to indicate recessive alleles.) The probability of an individual offspring's having the genotype BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. The ratio of the phenotypes is 3:1, typical for a <b>monohybrid</b> <b>cross.</b> When assessing phenotype from this, [...] "3" [...] of the offspring will exhibit the [...] "Brown" [...] eyes and only one offspring will exhibit the [...] "green" [...] eyes. (3 are [...] "B_" [...] and 1 is [...] "bb") ...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the same}} {{features}} of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have made it so useful as a genetics and molecular biology research organism make it equally useful as a teaching organism. Furthermore, {{the fact that it}} is a modern research organism makes it all the more exciting to students and teachers. The unique characteristic of yeast as a unicellular, eukaryotic organism with a complete sexual life cycle is ideal for teaching. A simple <b>monohybrid</b> <b>cross</b> to explore dominance and recessiveness, a dihybrid cross to demonstrate independent assortment, pigmented adenine auxotrophs for investigating the fundamentals of gene action, and easily measured responses to ultraviolet readiation provide an array of appropriate laboratory tools that put real science in the hands of students and teachers. Direct collaborations between scientists and science teachers bring together complementing knowledge and experience, providing an effective and efficient way to adapt and simplify techniques and procedures to accommodate time and money constraints. Collaborations quickly identify technical and theoretical problems that must be solved for implementation in classrooms. They also provide a continuing stimulus to teachers and students to participate in the research process...|$|E
40|$|The {{types of}} {{goldfish}} {{used in the}} following experiments are those described in the companion paper by Goodrich and Anderson (1939). These are the common goldfish, the transparent shubunkin, and the hybrid between these two known as the calico shubunkin. Genetic analysis has shown {{that this is a}} <b>monohybrid</b> <b>cross</b> and the formulae assigned have been: ordinary goldfish TT, the transparent shubunkin T'T', and the calico fish TT'. The original purpose of the ultraviolet treatment was to destroy certain parts of the color pattern in the calico fish and to study its regeneration. It was, however, soon discovered that lighter treatment than that needed to destroy the chromatophores apparently induced the formation of new pigmented areas. Consequently a more careful program of experimentation was outlined to verify these preliminary findings. METHODS The source of illumination has been a small laboratory mercury lamp obtained from the Hanovia Company (their model E). The quartz tube is 16 mm. in diameter, has a length of arc of 50 mm., and operates on 110 -volt circuit. For purposes of destruction of melano phores, treatments frequently of 30 minutes or more were administered, but for stimulation of pigment formation most treatments were of 10 minutes duration at distances varying from 2 cm. to 6 cm. from the lamp. Only a small area was irradiated on each fish. Other parts of the body within the zone of illumination were protected. The areas treated varied from about 0. 2 to 0. 9 sq. cm. in size. These were delimited by pieces of wet filter paper over which were placed pieces of tin foil, which in turn were held in place by more filter paper. Wet cotton was put over the head and the operculum and over the rear of â€˜¿Thispaper is published as part of a research program at Wesleyan University supported by the Denison Foundation for Biological Research.

40|$|Insertion of the {{bacterial}} transposon Tn 7 {{was used}} to obtain mutants of an octopine Ti plasmid. Crown gall tumours induced on tobacco by an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain carrying a particular mutant Ti plasmid (pGV 2100) were found to give rise to shoots. These shoots were grown in vitro {{and one of them}} (rGV- 1) was found to contain the T-DNA specific enzyme lysopine dehydrogenase (LpDH) and to form roots. After transfer to soil, rGV- 1 developed into a morphologically and functionally normal tobacco plant. All cells of the regenerant and of vegetatively produced offspring were shown, by cloning of leaf protoplasts, to contain T-DNA and LpDH activity. rGV- 1 and vegetatively produced offspring flowered normally. Plantlets obtained from haploid anther cultures were tested for LpDH activity Forty-one percent of these plantlets were LpDH positive. Moreover, both self-pollination of rGV- 1 and crosses between rGV- 1 and normal tobacco plants showed that the LpDH character was transmitted both through the pollen and through the eggs of rGV- 1 as a single dominant factor with Mendelian segregation ratios typical for <b>monohybrid</b> <b>crosses.</b> By repeated selfing, homozygous plants were obtained which bred true with respect to LpDH. The importance of these findings with respect to the use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Ti plasmids for genetic engineering in plants is discussed...|$|R
50|$|If multifactorial {{inheritance}} {{is indeed}} the case, then the chance of the patient contracting the disease is reduced only if cousins and more distant relatives have the disease. It must be stated that while multifactorially-inherited diseases tend to run in families, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple <b>monohybrid</b> or dihybrid <b>cross.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thus, due to {{the nature}} of {{polygenic}} traits, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple <b>monohybrid</b> or dihybrid <b>cross.</b> Polygenic inheritance can be explained as Mendelian inheritance at many loci, resulting in a trait which is normally-distributed. If n is the number of involved loci, then the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)2n will give the frequency of distribution of all n allele combinations. For a sufficiently high values of n, this binomial distribution will begin to resemble a normal distribution. From this viewpoint, a disease state will become apparent at one of the tails of the distribution, past some threshold value. Disease states of increasing severity will be expected the further one goes past the threshold and away from the mean.|$|R
40|$|VARIATIONS in {{the color}} of corn kernels (Zeamays L.) have {{attracted}} geneticists since theearly 1900 s when studies on the inheritance patterns of kernel color helped validate classical genetics. Even now, research scientists investigate the molecular genetics of these characteristics, and students in introductory biology and genetics courses learn more about monohybrid and dihybrid crosses by studying the inheritance of kernel colors. The reasons for introducing corn genetics in the classroom are obvious—a single ear holds {{a large number of}} progeny and a variety of ears are available that represent basic inheritance patterns, such as the <b>monohybrid</b> <b>cross</b> (3 : 1), the dihybrid cross (9 : 3 : 3 : 1), and more complex genetic patterns illustrating gene interactions (12 : 3 : 1; 9 : 3 : 4, 13 : 3; 9 : 7, etc.). In addition, these ears are obtained readily from several biological supply houses and are relatively inexpensive, espe-cially since students can use them for several years. Students usually confirm different phenotypic ratios of the F 2 generation by first counting kernels, then performing chi-square analyses to test their data. However, their experience can be enriched by introducing explanations about the nature of each gene and its mutations, the related metabolic path-ways, and their locations within the kernel. I have included information in this review that would be appropriate at different levels—from high school biol-ogy to introductory genetics at the college level. The purpose is the same. By exploring these areas, stu-dents more fully understand how these simple pheno-typic ratios and variations are derived. Four Kernel Colors, Four Genes Three of the four kernel colors—yellow, red and purple—are produced by pigments synthesized from one of two metabolic pathways, the carotenoid (yel-low pigments) or the anthocyanin (red and purple pigments) pathway. White, the fourth color, results from the lack of pigments produced from either pathway. The synthesis of each pigment require...|$|E
