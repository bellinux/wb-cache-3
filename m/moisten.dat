30|$|In {{terms of}} time, the first {{interesting}} {{feature in the}} water budget was the large negative value of total tendency at 13 LST/ 06 UTC, as shown in Fig. 9 a. It was just {{before the onset of}} the convective heavy precipitation. The <b>moistening</b> was mostly dominated by <Q 2 >, as shown in Fig. 9 a. The vertical cross section of Q 2 (Fig. 9 d) indicates that the <b>moistening</b> occurred mostly in the lower troposphere (between 900 and 700  hPa). Previous studies demonstrated that environmental moisture strongly promotes the deepening of cumuliform convection (e.g., Sherwood 1999; Takemi et al. 2004). Similar preceding lower-tropospheric <b>moistening</b> in the diurnal cycle over land was also reported (e.g., Shinoda and Uyeda 2002). These findings strongly suggest that such <b>moistening</b> {{plays an important role in}} the diurnal cycle observed in the present study. The large contribution of Q 2 on the total <b>moistening</b> in the lower troposphere means that the <b>moistening</b> is associated with subarray-scale vertical transport of moisture.

But rudimentary ridges like those that support respiratory turbinates have been found in advanced Triassic cynodonts, such as Thrinaxodon and Diademodon, which suggests that they may have had fairly high metabolic rates.|$|E
25|$|Foragers first go {{in search}} of water, which they collect in {{multiple}} trips. This water is then regurgitated {{on the surface of}} the nest material (typically plant fibers). The water serves as a type of glue, adhering the fibers of the nest material, beginning the formation of a ball. The water also serves to <b>moisten</b> and soften the fibers of the pulp so it is easier to manipulate for the formation of the nest. Using their mandibles, the foraging wasps remove the plant fibers (pulp) from its surface. This forms a ball of pulp, and the wasp will move around the immediate area in order to collect enough pulp (a ball that is about the size of its head, 2–4mm). This collection process only takes a few minutes. At this point, the forager returns to the nest, carrying the pulp mass. Either the forager or the queen wasp will take the pulp and apply it to the growing nest. The forager repeats this process multiple times in a day, usually for many hours. Interestingly, there is evidence that foragers collect the same foraging material on each trip. In nests that are made out of materials with distinct colors, researchers found that each forager collected only one of the colors in the nest, creating a colorful nest.|$|E
25|$|Rice (vary) is the {{cornerstone}} of the Malagasy diet and is typically consumed at every meal. The accompaniment served with rice is called laoka in the highlands dialect, the official version of the Malagasy language. Laoka are most often served in some kind of sauce: in the highlands, this sauce is generally tomato-based, while in coastal areas coconut milk is often added during cooking. In the arid southern and western interior where herding zebu is traditional, fresh or curdled zebu milk is often incorporated into vegetable dishes. Laoka are diverse and may include such ingredients as Bambara groundnuts with pork, beef or fish; trondro gasy (freshwater fish); ravitoto (shredded cassava leaves) with peanuts, beef or pork; henan'omby (beef) or akoho (chicken) sauteed with ginger and garlic or simmered in its own juices (a preparation called ritra); various types of seafood, which are more readily available along the coasts or in large urban centers; and many more. A variety of local greens such as anamamy (Morelle greens), anamafaitra (Martin greens) and particularly anamalao (paracress)—distinguished by the mildly analgesic effect the boiled leaves and flowers produce—are commonly sold alongside anandrano (watercress) and anatsonga (bok choy). In the arid south and west, such as among the Bara or Tandroy peoples, staples include sweet potato, yams, taro root and especially cassava, millet and maize, generally boiled in water and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts. Ro (broth) may be served as the main laoka or in addition to it to flavor and <b>moisten</b> the rice.|$|E
40|$|Background. Acid etching {{prior to}} {{orthodontic}} bracket bonding {{may result in}} enamel wear or cracks following bracket removal. The manufacturer of Fuji Ortho LC glass-ionomer (GI) claims that it can bond brackets to wet unetched enamel. This study aimed to compare the bracket bond strength to etched and unetched enamel under dry and wet conditions. Methods. In this in vitro study, 60 intact premolar teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} 6 groups (etched and dried, etched and <b>moistened</b> with distilled water, etched and <b>moistened</b> with saliva, unetched and dried, unetched and <b>moistened</b> with water, unetched and <b>moistened</b> with saliva). In all the groups, Leon 4 brackets were bonded to the enamel using Fuji Ortho LC GI. The teeth were immersed in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 hours and subjected to shear loads at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min in a Zwick machine for bond strength testing. Data were analyzed with ANOVA, Tukey test and independent ttest. Results. The mean bond strength values in groups 1 (etched, dry), 2 (etched, <b>moistened</b> with water), 3 (etched, <b>moistened</b> with saliva), 4 (unetched, dry), 5 (unetched, <b>moistened</b> with water) and 6 (unetched, <b>moistened</b> with saliva) were 21. 86, 16. 46, 10. 49, 8. 12, 9. 15 and 9. 52 MPa, respectively. Significant differences in bond strength were detected between groups 1 and 2 and all the other groups (P 0. 05). Conclusion. Fuji Ortho LC GI provided adequate bond strength between brackets and enamel. To acquire higher bond strength, brackets must be bonded to etched and dried enamel...|$|R

[...] Heat from underlying warmer waters can significantly modify an air mass over distances as short as [...] to [...] [...] For example, southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake-effect snow bands. Those bands bring strong localized precipitation since large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences (larger than 13°C or 23°F) between the water surface and the air above. Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically oriented clouds (see satellite picture) which produce snow showers. The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the temperature decrease with height, the deeper the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes.|$|E

The net effect of the vertical advection and cloud process amplifies the positive moisture anomaly in the mature phase, supporting the moisture-mode theory. The horizontal advection causes the eastward propagation of the field. The variation of the moisture profile is accurately understood by using environmental vertical velocity outside cumuli. The velocity is regulated by a thermodynamic balance under a weak temperature gradient. A nondimensional parameter α {{plays an important role}} in the moisture variation, which characterizes the efficiency of <b>moistening</b> (drying) induced by external heating (cooling). In the middle and lower troposphere, the major <b>moistening</b> factor is the radiative warming anomaly, which induces the upward environmental vertical velocity anomaly. The reevaporation of the precipitation works as drying, since its cooling effect induces the downward environmental vertical velocity anomaly. Snow melting significantly cools and thereby dries the midtroposphere. The <b>moistening</b> of the midtroposphere is important for <b>moistening</b> the lower troposphere through the reduction of α.
