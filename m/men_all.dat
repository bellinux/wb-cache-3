5|$|The feint {{party was}} {{composed}} of 150 volunteers who ran into the hollow way and began to engage the British. After the British were in the hollow way, the 150 volunteers were reinforced by 900 more <b>men.</b> <b>All</b> of the troops were stationed {{too far away from}} one another to do much damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, McCreary {{was one of}} four <b>men,</b> <b>all</b> former Confederate soldiers, {{who sought}} the Democratic gubernatorial nomination—the others being John Stuart Williams, J. Stoddard Johnson, and George B. Hodge. Williams was {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination {{at the outset of the}} Democratic nominating convention, despite attacks on his character by newspapers in the western part of the state. However, McCreary defeated Williams on the fourth ballot.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{called the}} Long Range Patrol (LRP), the unit {{was founded in}} Egypt in June 1940 by Major Ralph A. Bagnold, acting under the {{direction}} of General Archibald Wavell. Bagnold was assisted by Captain Patrick Clayton and Captain William Shaw. At first the majority of the men were from New Zealand, but they were soon joined by Southern Rhodesian and British volunteers, whereupon new sub-units were formed and the name was changed to the better-known Long Range Desert Group (LRDG). The LRDG never numbered more than 350 <b>men,</b> <b>all</b> of whom were volunteers.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{requested}} from Davis {{two days}} {{to work out the}} details of the surrender with his officers. The Confederates under the command of Thompson agreed to surrender all the troops in the area on May 11. They picked Wittsburg and Jacksonport, Arkansas, as the sites where Thompson's five thousand military troops would gather to receive their paroles. Ultimately Thompson surrendered about seventy-five hundred <b>men</b> <b>all</b> total that were under his command consisting of 1,964 enlisted men with 193 officers paroled at Wittsburg in May 1865 and 4,854 enlisted men with 443 officers paroled at Jacksonport on June 6, 1865.|$|E
5|$|Hesse had {{anticipated}} {{some kind of}} attack from the rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard against such an eventuality. It was formed by an English company, and two Spanish companies: a regular company under captain Francisco de Sandoval and a Catalan company of miquelets under Jaume Burguy, numbering 300 <b>men,</b> <b>all</b> of them led by Hesse's brother Heinrich. This reserve immediately responded and engaged the Spanish Bourbons at Middle Hill. Although the Bourbons {{had the advantage of}} height, they were effectively trapped against the precipice of the Rock and only had three rounds of ammunition each, as a result of travelling light; they had not come prepared for a pitched battle.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1916, as the AIF's {{infantry}} divisions {{were transferred}} to Europe, the battalion sailed from Alexandria aboard the HMT Corsican. It arrived at Marseilles, France, on 5 April and then moved by train to Flêtre where it was billeted until the 19th when it moved to Sailly, where it commemorated Anzac Day on 25 April. In mid-May, {{after a period of}} acclimatisation and training to prepare them for the European battlefield, the 11th Battalion moved up to the front line around Petillon in the Fleurbaix sector, with a strength of 27 officers and 929 other ranks. A further draft of reinforcements, totalling 69 <b>men</b> <b>all</b> ranks, arrived on 25 May, and on 30 May the battalion had its first experience of combat on the Western Front. Late that evening, German artillery bombarded the Allied line around the Cordonnerie salient, before infantry launched a raid on the 11th Battalion's trenches. In the fighting that followed the 11th Battalion lost four men captured, 37 killed and 70 wounded.|$|E

5|$|On 6 November 1943, three brigades of the Partisans, {{supported}} by artillery and heavy machine-guns mounted {{an attack on}} the town of Koprivnica, which they took on 9 November. The paratroops of 1 PLS held out at their base for three days before withdrawing into Hungary and continuing the battle with other NDH and German defending forces until 29 November. They received direct air support from ZNDH Dornier Do 17Ks, as well as supplies from light aircraft, but were unable to prevent the loss of their base, together with 20 <b>men,</b> <b>all</b> of their parachute equipment and their transport aircraft. The ZNDH also lost a Dornier Do 17K bomber and a Bücker Bü 131 biplane shot down during this period.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five African Americans {{earned the}} Medal of Honor during the American Civil War, {{including}} seven sailors of the Union Navy, fifteen {{soldiers of the}} United States Colored Troops, and three soldiers of other Army units. Fourteen African American men earned the Medal for actions in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, where a division of U.S. Colored Troops saw heavy action. Another four <b>men,</b> <b>all</b> sailors, earned their Medals at the Battle of Mobile Bay. William Harvey Carney was the first African American to perform an action for which a Medal of Honor was awarded, but Robert Blake {{was the first to}} actually receive the Medal (Blake's was issued in 1864, Carney did not receive his until 1900). It was common for Civil War Medals of Honor to be awarded decades after the conflict ended; in one case, Andrew Jackson Smith's Medal was not awarded until 2001, 137 years after the action in which he earned it. Smith's wait, caused by a missing battle report, is the longest delay of the award for any recipient, African American or otherwise.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November, the 4th Regiment was disbanded, its 1st Battalion {{assigned}} to the 1st Regiment {{and the rest of}} its manpower {{assigned to}} the 2nd Regiment. On 1 December 1942, the Corps was incorporated into the Wehrmacht and all its members were required to swear an oath to German leader Adolf Hitler. The Corps grew in numbers throughout 1942, following an influx of volunteers from Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Greece. By late 1942, the Corps totalled about 7,500 <b>men,</b> <b>all</b> of whom were Russian. During the re-organization, an attempt was made to expand the Corps further by recruiting Soviet POWs, but the first experiment with 300 POWs proved unsuccessful and was not repeated. On 9 December 1942, the 1st Regiment started to be transformed with the arrival of Kuban Cossacks led by Major General Naumenko. By January 1943, it consisted entirely of Cossacks. On 17 March 1943, Major General Gontarev replaced Shapilov as commander of the 3rd Regiment. The 1st Regiment fought in Loznica in April and participated in a large operation in Zapolje just south of Krupanj over the border with the NDH on 11–15 May, where it engaged in heavy combat with Partisan forces. From 1–8 July, the regiment was again stationed in Loznica and Ljubovija, participating in the defence of the Drina Bridge at Zvornik against the Partisans. During this time the regiment allowed the passage of 379 wounded Croatian soldiers and civilians, 1,000 healthy soldiers and as many refugees, sustaining casualties of two killed and seventeen wounded. It clashed with the Partisans over the village of Nedelica on 19 July. Meanwhile, the 2nd Regiment clashed with the Partisans around the town of Negotin. The 4th Regiment was re-established on 15 December, and was based in Jagodina, Paraćin and Ćuprija in the centre of the occupied territory.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, the {{armoured}} division comprised 9,442 <b>men</b> <b>all</b> ranks, this increased to 14,964 <b>men</b> <b>all</b> ranks by 1944; however, of this latter figure, the division had a combat strength of around 7,000 men with only 3,400 {{of these men}} being in the division's nine rifle companies compared to a combat strength of around 5,000 men in the American {{armoured division}}, of which 3,000 were in the rifle companies. This resulted in a numerical inferiority {{to the number of}} infantry available to a Waffen-SS Panzer Divisions; the 1st and 12th SS Panzer Divisions, at the beginning of June 1944, were both around 20,000 men strong with a combat strength of around 12,000 men of which roughly 7,000 men were based within the 24 infantry companies. In 1944, the British armoured division could field more medium tanks than the 186 tanks of the paper strength German Panzer Division or the 168 medium tanks of an American armoured division (251 tanks in total).|$|E
