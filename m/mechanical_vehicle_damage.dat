40|$|This {{research}} {{measured the}} effects of Michigan's compulsory safety belt use law on traffic crashes and injuries of various severities. Using time-series methods, the authors analyzed monthly frequencies of crash-induced injuries and fatalities from January 1978 through December 1987. Exposure to risk of occupant injury was controlled statistically by including aggregate frequency of crashes as a covariate in time-series models. Effects of economic conditions on traffic crashes were controlled by including an index of unemployment as a covariate. The following statistically significant effects {{were associated with the}} safety belt law: (a) In crashes with minor <b>vehicle</b> <b>damage,</b> there was a 14. 6 % reduction in B-level injuries, an 11. 0 % reduction in C-level injuries, and a 13. 0 % reduction in aggregate (KABC) injuries; (b) in crashes with moderate <b>vehicle</b> <b>damage,</b> there was a 16. 8 % reduction in A-level injuries, an 11. 6 % reduction in B-level injuries, a 10. 7 % reduction in C-level injuries, and a 3. 6 % reduction in aggregate (KABC) injuries; (c) in crashes with severe <b>vehicle</b> <b>damage,</b> there was a 6. 3 % reduction in fatalities, an 11. 8 % reduction in B-level injuries, a 4. 7 % reduction in c-level injuries, and a 5. 8 % reduction in aggregate (KABC) injuries; (d) for all <b>vehicle</b> <b>damage</b> severities, there was a 14. 0 % reduction in B-level injuries, an 8. 3 % reduction in C-level injuries, and a 6. 4 % reduction in injuries to front-seat occupants. Based on these results, Michigan's adult safety belt law has prevented 31, 710 injuries from July 1985 through December 1988...|$|R
