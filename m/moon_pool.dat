25|$|In {{addition}} to environmental duties, Louhi {{can also be}} used as a support ship for underwater operations by the Finnish Navy. The vessel has facilities for divers, a <b>moon</b> <b>pool</b> and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs), and {{it can be used to}} lay and recover submarine communications cable which is stored in the ship's recovery tanks. During crisis time the ship, capable of carrying 1,000 tons of fuel and 100 tons of cargo, can be armed with one 40 mm main gun, two 12.7 mm machine guns and naval mines, and used to supply island forts and other naval vessels.|$|E
25|$|The bell is {{deployed}} {{over the}} side of the vessel or platform using a gantry or A-frame or through a <b>moon</b> <b>pool.</b> Deployment usually starts by lowering the clump weight, which is a large ballast weight suspended from a cable which runs down one side from the gantry, through a set of sheaves on the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. The bell hangs from a cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads guide it down the clump weight cables to the workplace.|$|E

500|$|Gernsback {{discovered}} that the audience he had attracted was less interested in scientific invention stories than in fantastical adventures. A. Merritt's The <b>Moon</b> <b>Pool,</b> which began serialization in May 1927, was an early success; there was little or no scientific basis to the story, {{but it was very}} popular with Amazings readers. The covers, all of which were painted by Paul, were garish and juvenile, leading some readers to complain. Raymond Palmer, later to become an editor of the magazine, wrote that a friend of his was forced to stop buying Amazing [...] "by reason of his parents' dislike of the cover illustrations". Gernsback experimented with a more sober cover for the September 1928 issue, but it sold poorly, and so the lurid covers continued. The combination of poor quality fiction with garish artwork has led some critics to comment that Gernsback created a [...] "ghetto" [...] for science fiction, though it has also been argued that the creation of a specialized market allowed science fiction to develop and mature as a genre.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1947 essay [...] "The Epic of Space", Smith listed (by {{last name}} only) authors he enjoyed reading: [...] John W. Campbell, L. Sprague de Camp, Robert A. Heinlein, Murray Leinster, H. P. Lovecraft, and A. Merritt (specifically The Ship of Ishtar, The <b>Moon</b> <b>Pool,</b> The Snake Mother, and Dwellers in the Mirage, {{as well as}} the {{character}} John Kenton), C. L. Moore (specifically [...] "Jirel of Joiry"), Roman Frederick Starzl, John Taine, A. E. van Vogt, Stanley G. Weinbaum (specifically [...] "Tweerl"), and Jack Williamson. In a passage on his preparation for writing the Lensman novels, he notes that Clinton Constantinescu's [...] "War of the Universe" [...] was not a masterpiece, but says that Starzl and Williamson were masters; this suggests that Starzl's Interplanetary Flying Patrol may have been an influence on Smith's Triplanetary Patrol, later the Galactic Patrol. The feeding of the Overlords of Delgon upon the life-force of their victims at the end of chapter five of Galactic Patrol seems a clear allusion to chapter 29 of The <b>Moon</b> <b>Pool,</b> Merritt's account of the Taithu and the power of love in chapters 29 and 34 also bear some resemblance to the end of Children of the Lens. Smith also mentions Edgar Rice Burroughs, complaining about loose ends {{at the end of one}} of his novels.|$|E
2500|$|For {{offshore}} {{construction projects}} Botnica was built with a 160-ton Hydralift ASA crane, {{but it was}} replaced in 2010 with a 150-ton MacGregor crane with active heave compensation. The vessel can also be equipped with an optional 120-ton A-frame. The [...] aft deck {{can be used for}} various purposes and the ship has a [...] <b>moon</b> <b>pool</b> for underwater operations. In addition the ship has a helipad and accommodation for 45â€“47 workers in addition to the ship's crew, which is increased from 19 to 23 during the summer season. Since Botnica acts as an escort icebreaker during the winter season, she is also equipped with a 210-ton Aquamaster-Rauma towing winch and stern notch for assisting merchant ships. The oblique bridge maximizes visibility from the starboard side steering position.|$|E

2500|$|S. T. Joshi and David E.

Joshi has also cited A. Merritt's novella The <b>Moon</b> <b>Pool</b> (1918), which Lovecraft 'frequently rhapsodied about'. Joshi says that, 'Merritt's mention of a [...] "moon-door" [...] that, when tilted, leads the characters into a lower region of wonder and horror seems similar to the huge door whose inadvertent opening by the sailors causes Cthulhu to emerge from R'lyeh'.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Moon</b> <b>Pool</b> is {{sometimes}} cited as {{an influence on}} [...] "The Call of Cthulhu" [...] by H.P.

In particular, The <b>Moon</b> <b>Pool</b> is partly set on Nan Madol, a location which would, some claim, later inspire Lovecraft's R'lyeh.|$|E

500|$|A <b>Moon</b> Shaped <b>Pool</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as an art rock album. It combines electronic elements such as drum machines and synthesisers with acoustic timbres such as guitar, piano, and Greenwood's string and choral arrangements. According to Pitchfork writer Jeremy Larson, [...] "while lite orchestrations are nothing new for the band, A <b>Moon</b> Shaped <b>Pool</b> brings them to the fore of the songwriting, and Greenwood's arrangements do more heavy lifting than on any other album." [...] The songs are sequenced in alphabetical order, which Greenwood stated was chosen only because the order worked well.|$|R
