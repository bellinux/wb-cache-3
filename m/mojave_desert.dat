5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in the <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in the <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E

This subspecies has been called the willow goldfinch.|$|E
5|$|State Route 247 (SR 247) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California in San Bernardino County.

5|$|Unlike {{more typical}} {{locations}} across the <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert,</b> {{many of the}} water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity {{of plant and animal}} species that are not found anywhere else in the world. The existence of these species is due largely to a unique geologic history and the process of evolution that has progressed in habitats that have been isolated from one another since the Pleistocene epoch.|$|E
5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for solar energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power plants have {{been built in the}} <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert.</b> These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) making them the largest solar power installation in the world. Large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors. The Mojave Solar Park is currently under construction and will produce 280MW when completed.|$|E

5|$|In South America, the Andes {{mountain}} range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, {{resulting in a}} desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina.

50|$|Sauromalus ater (common chuckwalla) is {{a species}} of lizard in the family Iguanidae. It inhabits the Sonoran and <b>Mojave</b> <b>Deserts</b> of the Southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Its range extends from eastern California, Utah, and Nevada south to Baja California and Sonora.|$|R
5|$|Pleistocene {{climate is}} harder to determine, though it was {{probably}} not much wetter than today, except in the mountains where precipitation increased. Drainage changes in the Colorado River Delta probably account {{for most of the}} water budget increases responsible for the formation of Lake Cahuilla. In the <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> large lakes also formed during that time. In the early Holocene the North American Monsoon strongly influenced the local climate and then progressively weakened.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil: Extinction is a 2007 {{science fiction}} action horror film {{and the third}} {{installment}} in the Resident Evil film series based on the Capcom survival horror video game series Resident Evil.

The film was directed by Russell Mulcahy and produced by Paul W. S. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|SR 177 {{begins at}} I-10 near Desert Center and briefly travels north, {{intersecting}} with CR R2. At this intersection, SR 177 turns northeast and travels across the <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert,</b> through the Chuckwalla Valley. It passes near the Desert Center Airport and comes near Palen Lake, a dry lake. The highway passes along the southeastern boundary of Joshua Tree National Park before turning due north and crossing the desert for several miles. SR 177 briefly turns northeast again before intersecting with SR 62 and defaulting onto SR 62 eastbound.|$|E
50|$|The desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common lizards of the Sonoran and <b>Mojave</b> <b>deserts</b> of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. They also occur on several Gulf of California islands. Their color is mostly grey and tan.|$|R

5|$|The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550megawatt (MWAC) {{photovoltaic}} {{power station}} approximately six miles north of Desert Center, California, in the <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert.</b> It uses approximately 8.8 million cadmium telluride modules made by the US thin-film manufacturer First Solar. As of Fall 2015, the Solar Farm has the same 550MW installed capacity as the Topaz Solar Farm in the Carrizo Plain region of Central California, making both of them tied for the second largest completed solar plants by installed capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Great Basin, <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert,</b> and Colorado Plateau {{converge}} at Zion and the Kolob canyons. This, {{along with}} the varied topography of canyon–mesa country, differing soil types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix {{of plants and animals}} that live in the area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species. These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the Park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.|$|E
5|$|The southwestern United States {{is one of}} the world's best {{areas for}} insolation, and the <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> {{receives}} up to twice the sunlight received in other regions of the country. This abundance of solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, and consume no fuel other than sunlight. Some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation, or rooftop solar.|$|E
