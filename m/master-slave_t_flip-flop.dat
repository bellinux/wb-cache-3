This new concept places elsewhere the need of using feedback path in flip flop design. Also two algorithms have been shown for explanatory purpose. The proposed structure is able to establish the validity and genuineness than earlier design.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} for the extension of sequential logic functionality of D flip-flop in order to perform an additional Boolean function simultaneously along with its usual bit-storage function. We show that a combinational function of the form (a · b), (a + b), (a + b) or (a · b) which occurs frequently in a feed-forward path with a D flip-flop could be implemented efficiently by a D flip-flop with RESET or SET provision. Similarly, (a⊕b) or ((a·b) ⊕c) in the feedback loop with a D flip-flop could be implemented by a <b>T</b> <b>flip-flop</b> by suitable modification of the clock. The use of such extended sequential logic is found {{to result in a}} significant reduction in critical-path and saving in area-complexity over the direct implementation. Moreover, {{we present a}} simple approach for the construction of CMOS <b>T</b> <b>flip-flop</b> by modification of clock signal of D flip-flop, which is found to be more efficient than the <b>T</b> <b>flip-flop</b> derived from JK flip-flop. The extended sequential logic is used for the implementation of finite field multiplication over GF (2 m) and carry-save addition of real numbers.

5000|$|The JK {{flip-flop}} augments {{the behavior}} of the SR flip-flop (J=Set, K=Reset) by interpreting the J = K = 1 condition as a [...] "flip" [...] or toggle command. Specifically, the combination J = 1, K = 0 is a command to set the flip-flop; the combination J = 0, K = 1 is a command to reset the flip-flop; and the combination J = K = 1 is a command to toggle the flip-flop, i.e., change its output to the logical complement of its current value. Setting J = K = 0 maintains the current state. To synthesize a D flip-flop, simply set K equal to the complement of J. Similarly, to synthesize a <b>T</b> <b>flip-flop,</b> set K equal to J. The JK flip-flop is therefore a universal flip-flop, because it can be configured to work as an SR flip-flop, a D <b>flip-flop,</b> or a <b>T</b> <b>flip-flop.</b>|$|R

In this paper, the design optimization of a 8 -bit dual-slope ADC from power, speed and area perspectives is proposed. The proposed ADC consists of an analog part (including an integrator and a comparator) and a digital part (including a controller, counter and 8 -bit register). Both D and <b>T</b> <b>flip-flops</b> are utilized in the ADC design to demonstrate its influence on area, performance (speed) and power by using different types of flip-flops. The layout of the ADC is designed with Mentor Graphics IC Station. The netlisted is extracted from the layout to include the parasitic capacitances for a more accurate power analysis. PSPICE power simulation is performed to read the power consumption of the ADC for the given inputs. Some efforts on reducing the power consumption of the ADC are also made. For example, the clock signal feeding to the flip-flops is revised to be data dependent so that the clock may be disabled to avoid unnecessary switches whenever it is possible. In this way, the overall power consumption of the ADC is reduced. Double-edge triggered (DET) flip-flops are also used in register circuitry.

In this paper, we present a simple but highly useful modification of the conventional hardware implementation of accumulation in finite field over GF (2 m). The critical path, as well as, the hardware-complexity are reduced in the proposed design by performing the accumulation operation using m number of <b>T</b> <b>flip-flops</b> instead of using a combination of m number of XOR gates with equal number of D flip-flops in dependent loop structures. The conventional design is found to involve nearly 39 % more area, 53 % more delay, and 40 % more maximum ac power consumption compared with the proposed accumulator. The proposed finite field accumulator is used further for implementation of serial/parallel polynomial-basis finite field multiplication and bit-serial inter-conversion between polynomial basis representation and normal basis representation over GF (2 m). The area-time complexity of the proposed bit-serial/parallel multiplier is less than half of the best of the corresponding existing structures. The structure proposed for digit-serial/parallel multiplication for trinomials is found to involve nearly 56 % less area-time complexity compared with the best of the corresponding existing multipliers; and the existing design of bit-serial basis conversion is found to involve nearly twice area-time complexity compared with the proposed design using the proposed finite field accumulator.

We have extensively studied the quality of generated patterns and we have found several interesting properties of them. The first possibility {{how to use the}} CA is to generate pseudoexhaustive test sets as the CA can generate code words of codes with higher minimal code distance of the dual code. There is no need of reseeding the CA in order to generate all the code words. This type of test set can be advantageously used for testing with low number of inputs and low size of cones in the circuits under test (CUT). The proposed CA can also generate weighted random patterns with different global weights which can be used instead of linear feedback shift register (LFSR) pseudorandom sequences, the fault coverage is higher. It can also be used as deterministic pattern compactor in mixed mode testing. The generated sequence can be also easily used for testing CUTs with input-oriented weighted random patterns.

40|$|Reversible {{computing}} {{has attracted}} the attention of researchers due to its low power consumption and less heat dissipation compared to conventional computing. A number of reversible gates have been proposed by different researchers and various combinational circuits based on reversible gates have been developed. However the realization of sequential circuit in reversible logic is still at premature stage. Sequential circuits were not available because of feedback was not allowed in reversible circuit. However allowing feedback in space (not in time), some sequential reversible gates and circuits {{have been reported in the}} literature. In this dissertation, we have addressed the problem from two sides. One side is to propose a low cost reversible gate suitable for sequential building block i. e. <b>T</b> <b>flip-flop</b> and hence designing low cost synchronous and asynchronous counters. Another side is to generate the circuit from its behavioral description described in FSM form. Our propose designs of reversible counters are significantly better in optimization parameters such as gate counts, garbage outputs and constant inputs available in literature. We have also proposed a procedure for obtaining reversible circuit from behavioral description through FSM. A very few attempts have been reported in the literature for the conversion FSM to reversible FSM. Because of non-availability of generated sequential reversible circuit in literature, our results cannot be compared with any other circuits. We expect that the sequential reversible circuits will help in debugging the reversible circuits, handling the ambiguous state of an FSM and generating the original input in reverse direction by reversing the original output.

40|$|Photoexcitation of p-nitroaniline (PNA) and its N-alkyl {{derivatives}} {{results in}} the formation of triplet states with dipole moments considerably larger than that of the ground state, as monitored by time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC). The triplet state lifetime, τT, is only 54 ns for PNA in benzene but increases to 1400 ns on N,N-dimethyl substitution and to 275 ns in the more polar solvent p-dioxane. This sensitivity of τT is attributed to the close proximity of all of the lowest lying singlet and triplet npi * and pipi * states of PNA, which results in substantial S 1 T T 1 mixing. The dipole moment of the “pure ” 3 pipi * state is estimated to be 11 D.
