The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know I have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E

6000|$|There {{was such}} {{kindness}} stamped {{on her face}} that <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to her, {{and it was almost}} huskily I said: [...] "I thank you. You have keen perceptions." ...|$|R
60|$|The sad little {{procession}} was now {{entering the}} old graveyard {{at the rear}} of the Mission. I could hear the sobs of the mourners, and <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to the poor mother, garbed in faded mourning, bowed with both grief and labor.|$|R
500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to him and I hope he recovers quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Robin's {{death on}} 20 May 2012, Beyoncé remarked: [...] "The Bee Gees were an early {{inspiration}} for me, Kelly Rowland and Michelle. We loved their songwriting and beautiful harmonies. Recording their classic song, 'Emotion' {{was a special}} time for Destiny's Child. Sadly we lost Robin Gibb this week. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to his brother Barry {{and the rest of}} his family.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Japan Today had {{reported}} that, by 2010, Japan {{would become a}} signatory of the convention. [...] However, this report later proved to be inaccurate. [...] The 2009 election saw the Democratic Party of Japan gain power. Yukio Hatoyama stated in an interview, <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to the fathers and mothers. There are cases of mothers as well. We support ratifying and enforcing the Hague Convention, and involved in this is a sweeping change to allow divorced fathers visitation of their children. That issue affects not just foreign national fathers, but Japanese fathers as well. I believe in this change.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to Nada as {{she stood}} in the moonlight, one forsaken, not having where to lay her head, Nada, who alone was left alive of all my children. I motioned to Umslopogaas to hide himself in the shadow, and stepped forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks to}} me as if our race was well-nigh run," [...] Saul said grimly, and even in that time of deadly peril did <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in rejoicing toward the lad whose courage revived at {{seemingly}} the very moment when his doom was sealed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As {{a boy in}} {{the dress}} of white men--when I first went to the Wonder House. And a second time thou wast a Hindu. What shall the third {{incarnation}} be?' He chuckled drearily.

2500|$|In December 2007, Norwood's {{attorney}} Blair Berk {{stated that}} the Los Angeles City Attorney determined Norwood should not be charged with any [...] "crime relating to the accident back in 2006." [...] In May 2009, Norwood stated, [...] "The whole experience did completely change my life, and I can say that I think I'm a better person from it. You know, I still don't understand all of it and why all of it happened, but I definitely have a heart, and <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to everyone involved. I pray about it every single day, and that's all I can really say on the subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Welcome, Teule,' {{she said}} smiling. 'You {{are not of}} our people, yet <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to such a man.' And still smiling she left us.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> {{in sympathy}} {{to any one}} who is making his first {{appearance}} before an audience of human beings. By a direct process of memory I go back forty years, less one month--for I'm older than I look.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{my faith}} and my troth," [...] quoth Robin at last, drawing a deep breath, [...] "lad, thou art--Thou must not leave our company, Allan!

6000|$|... 'A blessing on thee.' The lama {{inclined}} his solemn head. 'I {{have known}} many {{men in my}} so long life, and disciples not a few. But to none among men, if so be thou art woman-born, has <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> as it has to thee--thoughtful, wise, and courteous; but something of a small imp.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to {{this young}} nobleman. Handsome he was, as a picture. And {{he knew better}} than most of your fine gentlemen how to put a check on his inclinations. As a friend he had few equals, his purse being ever at the command of those he loved. And his privations on Fox's account were already greater than many knew.|$|R
6000|$|... "They must be {{good fun}} in a house, the little ones," [...] commented Ulrich, gazing upward with his dreamy {{eyes at the}} wreath of smoke {{ascending}} from his long-stemmed pipe. [...] "The little ones, always <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] said I, [...] "I do. I {{have been}} there before. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to Hong-Kong. In {{the name of the}} great Indian Mofussil I salute you.

60|$|Of such stuff {{are the men}} of {{my beloved}} Helium, and when I meet another of their kind, of {{whatever}} race or color, <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to him as it did now to my new friend who had risked his life for me simply because I wore the mate to the ring his ruler had put upon his finger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} could not be {{expected}} to know anything of my feelings for you," [...] said Olive, [...] "and perhaps it is very well you did not, for business is business, and the feelings of girls {{should not be allowed to}} interfere with it. But <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to you all the same. You were my first love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us begin afresh!" [...] This {{piece of}} obvious common sense seemed then to me {{instinct}} with courage, the noblest of words. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{to him as}} he spoke. It was, indeed, that day as vague as it was valiant; we did not at all see the forms of what we were thus beginning. All that we saw was the clear inevitableness that the old order should end. [...] .|$|R
6000|$|On {{the instant}} <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> in sympathy to Saul, for I knew {{full well that}} he loved his mare even as I did my own colt Silver Heels, and, harking back to the thought which had come into my mind a few seconds before, I said to him stoutly, shaking my fist in the {{direction}} of that popinjay of an officer who was riding so proudly in advance of his squad of thieves: ...|$|R
60|$|Abouthis, lost Abouthis! <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> toward thee! For the {{day comes}} when the desert sands shall fill thy secret places! Thy Gods are doomed, O Abouthis!

I weep--I weep tears of blood: for mine is the sin that brought about these evils and mine for ever is their shame.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead! dead!" [...] he whispered, [...] "and is Egypt dead? and is {{that form}} of glory now food for worms? Oh, what a woman was this! E'en now <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> towards her. And shall she outdo me at the last, I who have been so great; shall I become so small that a woman can overtop my courage and pass where I fear to follow? Eros, thou hast loved me from a boy--mindest thou how I found thee {{starving}} in the desert, and made thee rich, giving thee place and wealth? Come, now pay me back. Draw that sword thou wearest and make an end of the woes of Antony." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look at that {{pleasant}} person. There he is--Echt Deutsch--if anything ever was. Look at my son there! Do {{you see the}} two of them {{engaged in}} mortal combat? The thing's too ridiculous. The world grows sane. They may fight in the Balkans still; in many ways the Balkan States are in the very rear of civilisation; but to imagine decent countries like this or Germany going back to bloodshed! No.... When I see Rendezvous keeping it up and keeping it up, I begin to see just how poor Germany must be keeping it up. I begin to realise how sick Germany must be getting of the high road and the dust and heat and the everlasting drill and restraint.... <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to the South Germans. Old Manning here always reminds me of Austria. Think of Germany coming like Rendezvous on a Sunday morning, and looking stiffly over Austria's fence. 'Come for a good hard walk, man.

6000|$|How he {{must have}} loved her mother! It was {{the love of her}} mother's child, rather than the love of his own daughter, that appealed to him. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to him in a great wave of sympathy and kindliness. I began to {{understand}}. To understand the passion of these two great, silent, reserved natures, that successfully concealed the burning hunger for the other's love! It did not surprise me when presently he murmured to himself: ...|$|R
6000|$|Unless {{you happen}} to be an American woman. Never did <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> more gladly to America as a nation than one spring day {{travelling}} from Berne to Vevey. We had been sitting for an hour in an atmosphere that would have rendered a Dante disinclined to notice things. Dante, after ten minutes in that atmosphere, would have lost all interest in the show. He would not have asked questions. He would have whispered to Virgil: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> in childish {{homesickness}} to the Doña Maria and {{the little}} nest I had prepared for myself in her simple Spanish home. While I dressed myself and Marjorie, I turned over and over the subject which had taken possession of my thoughts. How could I escape the complications of this inopportune visit? How could I, without offending the Sandersons and noticeably meddling with {{the discretion of the}} Doña Maria, return quietly with Mariposilla to the ranch? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} {{convinced}} {{the time has}} come for a political movement. If I were, I'd join it, even though some of the planks in your platform were objectionable, for I am a farmer. My people for generations have been tillers of the soil. They have always been poor. All the blood in <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out,</b> therefore, towards the farmer and the farmers' movement. It seems a hopeless thing to fight the privileged classes, with all their power and money. It can be done, but it can be done only by union among all the poor of every class. Since coming to your State, since day before yesterday, my mind has been changed. If I thought--if I could believe--" [...] As he paused he caught Ida's eyes shining into his, and at the moment the one thing in all the world worth doing was to follow her wish. [...] "I do believe, and I'm with you from this time forward." [...] He ended there, but he stood for a moment numb, and tingling with emotion. He had uttered a resolution which changed the course of his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are not {{sufficiently}} democratic," [...] answered the policeman, [...] "but {{you were right}} when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business. I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate. But this new movement of ours {{is a very different}} affair. We deny the snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals. We remember the Roman Emperors. We remember the great poisoning princes of the Renaissance. We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal. We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher. Compared to him, burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men; <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to them. They accept the essential ideal of man; they merely seek it wrongly. Thieves respect property. They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it. But philosophers dislike property as property; they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession. Bigamists respect marriage, or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy. But philosophers despise marriage as marriage. Murderers respect human life; they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives. But philosophers hate life itself, their own as much as other people's." ...|$|E
6000|$|I can't {{tell you}} with what tender sympathy your rather disconcerting little news inspires me nor how <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> to you. Alack, alack, {{how we do}} have to pay for things--and for our virtues and grandeurs and beauties (even as you are now doing, overworked hero and model of {{distinguished}} valour,) as well as for our follies and mistakes. However, you have on your record exactly that mistake of too generous a sacrifice. Fortunately you have been pulled up before you have quite chucked away your all. It must be deuced dreary--yet if you ask me whether I think of you more willingly and endurably thus, or as your image of pale overstrain haunted me after you had left me at the New Year, I shall have no difficulty in replying. In fact, dearest Gaillard, and at the risk of aggravating you, I like to keep you a little before me in the passive, the recumbent, the luxurious and ministered-to posture, and my imagination rings all the possible changes on the forms of your noble surrender. Lie as flat as you can, and live and think and feel and talk (and keep silent!) as idly--and you will thereby be laying up the most precious treasure. It's a heaven-appointed interlude, and cela ne tient qu'à vous (I mean to the wave of your white hand) to let it become a thing of beauty like the masque of Comus. Cultivate, horizontally the waving of that hand--and you will brush away, for the time, all responsibilities and superstitions, and the peace of the Lord will descend upon you, and you will become {{as one of the most}} promising little good boys that ever was. Après quoi the whole process and experience will grow interesting, amusing, tissue-making (history-making,) to you, and you will, after you get well, feel it to have been the time of your life which you'd have been most sorry to miss. Some five years ago--or more--a very interesting young friend of mine, Paul Harvey (then in the War Office as Private Sec. to Lord Lansdowne), was taken exactly as you are, and stopped off just as you are and consigned exactly to your place, I think--or rather no, to a pseudo-Nordrach in the Mendips. I remember how I sat on just such a morning as this at this very table and in this very seat and wrote him on this very paper in the very sense in which I am no less confidently writing to you--urging him to let himself utterly go and cultivate the day-to-day and the hand-to-mouth and the questions-be-damned, even as an exquisite fine art. Well, it absolutely and directly and beautifully worked: he recula--to the very limit--pour mieux sauter, and has since sauté'd so well that his career has caught him up again.... Your case will have gone practically quite on all fours with this. I am drenching you with my fond eloquence--but what will you have when you have touched me so by writing me so charmingly out of your quiet--though ever so shining, I feel--little chamber in the great Temple of Simplification? I shall return to the charge--if it be allowed me--and perhaps some small sign from you I shall have after a while again. I came up from L.H. yesterday only--and shall be in town after this a good deal, D.V., through the rest of this month and April and May. At some stage of your mouvement ascensionnel I shall see you--for I hope they won't be sending you up quite to Alpine Heights. Take it from me, dear, dear G., that your cure will have a social iridescence, for your acute and ironic and genial observation, of the most beguiling kind. But you don't need to [...] "take" [...] that or any other wisdom that your beautiful intelligence now plays with from any other source but that intelligence; therefore be beholden to me almost only for the fresh reassurance that I am more affectionately than ever yours, ...|$|E

60|$|I {{told him}} that Chatellerault knew me, and I {{informed}} him that a wager lay between us--withholding the particulars of its nature--which had brought me into Languedoc and into the position wherein he had found and arrested me.
