25|$|Through {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, there was {{considerable}} experimentation with {{ways to improve the}} BBS experience from its command-line interface roots. Almost every popular system improved matters somewhat by adding ANSI-based color menus to make reading easier, and most also allowed cursor commands to offer command-line recall and similar features. Another common feature was the use of autocomplete to make <b>menu</b> <b>navigation</b> simpler, a feature that would not re-appear on the web until decades later.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 2007, Apple {{released}} a firmware update (1.0.2) via iTunes {{that was said}} to improve Cover Flow and yield faster <b>menu</b> <b>navigation.</b> The update was also released for the iPod Classic. On November 28, 2007, Apple {{released a}}nother firmware update (1.0.3) via iTunes, which included unspecified bugfixes. January 15, 2008 saw the release of version 1.1, which added support for iTunes movie rentals, music song lyrics support and included more unspecified bugfixes. Apple released update version 1.1.2 in May 2008 and version 1.1.3 in July 2008 with even more bug fixes.|$|E
25|$|The HUD {{has also}} been altered. Egosoft removed {{non-functional}} internal cockpit graphics, giving the player a largely unobstructed view of space. There are now markers over game objects such as ships, stations and large asteroids, and each object is selectable by a simple mouse click, or through a keyboard or controller. X3 uses a new interface designed to be faster, more user friendly, and compatible with a console controller. The game carries over {{many of the same}} short-cut keys from previous games, but now the mouse too can be used for functions including <b>menu</b> <b>navigation,</b> target selection, flying and combat.|$|E
50|$|Server Side Includes {{are useful}} for {{including}} a common piece of code throughout a site, such as a page header, a page footer and a <b>navigation</b> <b>menu.</b> Conditional <b>navigation</b> <b>menus</b> can be conditionally included using control directives.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pointing}} task involves {{moving a}} cursor inside a graphical object and pressing a button, whereas a goal-crossing task involves moving a cursor beyond a boundary of a targeted graphical object. Goal crossing {{has been little}} investigated, despite sometimes being used on today's interfaces (e.g., mouse-over effects, hierarchical <b>menus</b> <b>navigation,</b> auto-retractable taskbars and hot corners). Still, several advantages of crossing over pointing have been identified: ...|$|R

25|$|The Zune 30, the {{original}} Zune music player, has a 30 GB hard drive, 3inch screen, {{and a simple}} directional pad for <b>menu</b> <b>navigation.</b> The second generation of Zune devices includes the Zune 4, 8, 80 and 120. The Zune 4, and 8 are smaller in size and have 4GB, and 8GB of flash memory, respectively. The 80GB Zune acts {{as a replacement for}} the Zune 30: it is thinner and lighter than {{the original}}. All second generation Zunes have a Zune Pad instead of the original directional pad that was included on the Zune 30. Microsoft released an upgrade for all Zune models, including the Zune 30, to the second generation software/firmware.|$|E
25|$|The Kindle Keyboard is 0.5inches {{shorter and}} 0.5inches {{narrower}} than the Kindle 2. It supports additional fonts and international Unicode characters {{and has a}} Voice Guide feature with spoken <b>menu</b> <b>navigation.</b> Experimental features include a browser based on the popular WebKit rendering engine (but browser may be limited to 50MB of 3G per month to websites other than Amazon and Wikipedia in territories outside the United States), Text-to-Speech that can read aloud the text from books and other content, and an MP3 player. Internal memory is expanded to 4GB, with approximately 3GB available for user content. Battery life is advertised at up to two months of reading half {{an hour a day}} with the wireless turned off, which amounts to roughly 30 hours.|$|E
500|$|By now {{the team}} had four members: {{designer}} Jan Willem Nijman, marketer Rami Ismail, iOS developer Zach Gage, and artist Greg Wohlwend. The team continued work separately and sporadically, making meager headway and disheartened by the project's obstacles. Upon return to the Netherlands from GDC, Nijman and Ismail, the co-founders of Vlambeer, began to plan a [...] "really large game", but ultimately decided that the idea was a diversion from the realities of finishing Ridiculous Fishing. In August 2012, after a road trip home across the United States from Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle to New York City, the team set a deadline to finish the game. The game was in a [...] "disjointed" [...] state, with good fishing mechanics, but poor shooting and <b>menu</b> <b>navigation.</b> They scrapped the store, interface, and endgame along with [...] "90 percent" [...] of their work, which revealed a specific direction {{for the rest of}} the game's development. Wohlwend, the artist, moved in with Gage, the developer, in New York City, working 14-hour days during the final weeks. The music was composed by Eirik Suhrke. The last parts of the game assembled smoothly, and Ismail submitted the game to the iOS App Store for approval from New York.|$|E

The study presented here examines how {{the wording of}} hyperlinks in a <b>navigation</b> <b>menu</b> and embedded within the body text of a web page can influence usersâ€™ browsing behavior, perceptions, and comprehension. Five experimental conditions were tested that varied hyperlink wording (generic, intriguing, and informative) in a <b>navigation</b> <b>menu</b> and in embedded links.

2500|$|One-dimensional touchpads are {{the primary}} control {{interface}} for <b>menu</b> <b>navigation</b> on second-generation and later iPod Classic portable music players, where they {{are referred to as}} [...] "click wheels", since they only sense motion along one axis, which is wrapped around like a wheel. Creative Labs also uses a touchpad for their Zen line of MP3 players, beginning with the Zen Touch. The second-generation Microsoft Zune product line (the Zune 80/120 and Zune 4/8) uses touch for the Zune Pad.|$|E
50|$|Aside from {{recorded}} {{audio and}} video, AVCHD includes many user-friendly features to improve media presentation: <b>menu</b> <b>navigation,</b> simple slide shows and subtitles. The <b>menu</b> <b>navigation</b> system {{is similar to}} DVD-video, allowing access to individual videos from a common intro screen. Slide shows are prepared from a sequence of AVC still frames, and can {{be accompanied by a}} background audio track. Subtitles are used in some camcorders to timestamp the recordings.|$|E

Less-sophisticated designs similar to those on remote controls appear on some calculators, particularly scientific and graphing calculators, which use the d-pad for cursor control on multi-line screens, as well as input/output recall, <b>menu</b> <b>navigation,</b> and occasionally direct screen access (graphing calculators in particular allow {{the use of the}} d-pad to determine values at specific points on a displayed graph). On programmable units, the d-pad can also be mapped directly, allowing it {{to be used as a}} gaming or pointer control.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: One of {{the most}} {{mentioned}} problems of web accessibility, as recognized in several different studies, {{is related to the}} difficulty regarding the perception of what is or is not clickable in a web page. In particular, a key problem is the recognition of hyperlinks by a specific group of people, namely those with intellectual disabilities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This experiment investigated a methodology based on the direct observation, video recording, interview and data obtained by an eye tracker device. Ten participants took part in this study. They were divided into two groups and asked to perform two tasks: 'Sing a song' and 'Listen to a story' in two websites. These websites were developed to include specific details. The first website presented an image <b>navigation</b> <b>menu</b> (INM), whereas the other one showed a text <b>navigation</b> <b>menu</b> (TNM). RESULTS: There was a general improvement regarding the participants' performance when using INMs. CONCLUSION: The referred analysis indeed shows that not only did these specific participants {{gain a better understanding of}} the demanding task, but also they showed an improved perception concerning the content of the <b>navigation</b> <b>menu</b> that included hyperlinks with images...|$|R
