5|$|Wastewater {{networks}} may sustain damage {{similar to}} water supply networks. It {{is very difficult}} to exclude ash from the sewerage system. Systems with combined storm water/sewer lines are most at risk. Ash will enter sewer lines where there is inflow/infiltration by stormwater through illegal connections (e.g., from roof downpipes), cross connections, around <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> or through holes and cracks in sewer pipes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, local artists also {{supplemented}} the figure with items such as radishes, pretzels, laurel wreaths and foaming beer steins. The symbol diversely appears in numerous places such as on <b>manhole</b> <b>covers,</b> beer steins and the top of the tower of the town hall. While the symbol as a man through being a monk was previously clear, its gender has become ambiguous since being designated the Kindl. One interpretation is that it is simply genderless, however in the 1920s a female inclination became apparent, and portrayals in person are to this day by young women.|$|E
5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of <b>manhole</b> <b>covers)</b> in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.|$|E

25|$|<b>Manhole</b> <b>covers</b> in the {{sidewalks}} and streets nearby {{were made of}} bronze, to avoid unsightly rust stains from traditional iron <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> (the usual material). The interior elevator doors were also cast in bronze, and areas in the floors in suites, meeting rooms, and some public areas had removable panels and built-in tubing which allowed for the easy replacement or upgrading of electrical, telecommunications, and computer wiring. The cafeteria beneath the Dirksen Senate Office Building was doubled in size and extended beneath the Hart building, which allowed the public to use {{for the first time}} during lunch hours.|$|E

25|$|When {{construction}} on the line was halted in 1975, three tunnel segments were completed: one from 99th to 105th Streets and a second from 110th to 120th Streets, both under Second Avenue in East Harlem, and a third from Pell to Canal Streets in Chinatown, under the Confucius Apartments complex next to the Bowery. They were not initially outfitted with track or signals. In August 1982, the MTA put out advertisements in national journals announcing that the two tunnel segments in East Harlem were being put up for rent for temporary use, and that the rents on the tunnels were to last seven years. After the UMTA approved the MTA's plan, the MTA dispersed advertisements. The tunnels had no plumbing, ventilation, or access to the street, except through <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> on Second Avenue. To provide access to the tunnels, the MTA would have rented street-level rights that it had for subway entrances. Over the next few decades, the MTA regularly inspected and maintained the tunnel segments (spending $20,000 a year by the early 1990s), to maintain the structural integrity of the streets above, and in case construction would ever resume. Trespassers would often camp in the tunnels until the MTA increased security.|$|E

500|$|Numerous {{stations}} {{owned by}} Network Rail {{also continue to}} display much of their GWR heritage. This is seen {{not only at the}} large stations such as Paddington (built 1851, extended 1915) and Temple Meads (1840, 1875 & 1935) but other places such as Bath Spa (1840), [...] (1878), [...] (1879), [...] (1897), and [...] (1927). Many small stations are little changed from when they were opened, as there has been no need to rebuild them to cope with heavier traffic; good examples can be found at [...] (1841), [...] (1850, Network Rail's last surviving Brunel-style train shed), [...] (1857), and [...] (1859). Even where stations have been rebuilt, many fittings such as signs, <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> and seats can still be found with [...] "GWR" [...] cast into them.|$|E
500|$|Positive reviews {{praised the}} film's {{take on a}} classic Disney story, its comedy and musical numbers {{as well as the}} {{performance}} of its lead actress, Amy Adams. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "heart-winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> of actuality" [...] and one that [...] "has a Disney willingness to allow fantasy into life". Film critics of Variety and LA Weekly remarked on the film's ability to cater for all ages. LA Weekly described the film as [...] "the sort of buoyant, all-ages entertainment that Hollywood has been laboring to revive in recent years (most recently with Hairspray) but hasn't managed to get right until now" [...] while Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, [...] "More than Disney's strictly animated product, Enchanted, in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the '60s, is a film aimed at the entire population – niches be damned. It simply aims to please, without pandering, without vulgarity, without sops to pop-culture fads, and to pull this off today is no small feat." [...] Enchanted was the Broadcast Film Critics Association's choice for Best Family Film of 2007 while Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it the 4th best film of 2007.|$|E

2500|$|As Jenkins noted, {{the truth}} of the stories mattered less than their {{resonance}} with voter fears. [...] Three of the most famously recorded instances of [...] "Loony Left" [...] activities, [...] "Baa Baa White Sheep", renaming <b>manhole</b> <b>covers,</b> and [...] "black bin-liner bags" [...] were myths, outright fabrications by the press. Others stories, such as reports that London councils had insisted that homosexuals be placed at the heads of the waiting lists for council housing and that London councils had spent £500,000 on [...] "24 super-loos for gypsies" [...] were found to be highly misleading upon investigation by the Media Research Group of Goldsmiths' College, University of London.|$|E
2500|$|Such words today seem commonplace, {{but when}} Brooks was writing it was commonplace for {{financial}} writers to simply pull corporate press releases off the wires and massage them gently into 'journalism.' Among {{the first of}} a new breed of financial journalist, unafraid to lift the <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> to peer underneath, Brooks's copy was, at the time, revolutionary. In his portrait of portfolio manager Gerry Tsai, for instance, Brooks described the go-go operator as [...] "so swift and nimble in getting into and out of specific stocks that his relations with them, far from resembling a marriage or even a companionate marriage, were often more like that of a roue with a chorus line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Manhunt 2 has updates made to {{the stealth}} {{mechanics}} of the previous game. For example, players are now given more choices in terms of executing enemies.

Two further additions to the execution system are [...] "environmental executions" [...] whereby the player can use elements of the game world (such as <b>manhole</b> <b>covers,</b> telephones, fuse boxes, toilets, etc.) to eliminate opponents, and [...] "jump executions" [...] whereby players can attack enemies from above by leaping off a ledge. A scoring system based on how brutal the executions {{were excluded from the}} console versions in order to obtain an M rating from ESRB, while the PC version retained this feature.|$|E
