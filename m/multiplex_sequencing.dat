Together with a MD PhD student, Jay Shendure, Dr. Rob Mitra worked out ways to sequence in situ polonies using single-base extension which can achieved 5-6 bases reads.

50|$|Polony {{sequencing}} is {{an inexpensive}} but highly accurate <b>multiplex</b> <b>sequencing</b> technique {{that can be}} used to “read” millions of immobilized DNA sequences in parallel. This technique was first developed by Dr. George Church's group at Harvard Medical School. Unlike other sequencing techniques, Polony sequencing technology is an open platform with freely downloadable, open source software and protocols. Also, the hardware of this technique can be easily set up with a commonly available epifluorescence microscopy and a computer-controlled flowcell/fluidics system. Polony sequencing is generally performed on paired-end tags library that each molecule of DNA template is of 135 bp in length with two 17-18 bp paired genomic tags separated and flanked by common sequences. The current read length of this technique is 26 bases per amplicon and 13 bases per tag, leaving a gap of 4-5 bases in each tag.|$|E

40|$|Background. <b>Multiplexed</b> <b>sequencing</b> is {{commonly}} performed on massively parallel short-read sequencing platforms such as Illumina, and {{the efficiency of}} library normalisation can {{affect the quality of}} the output dataset. Although several library normalisation approaches have been established, none are ideal for highly <b>multiplexed</b> <b>sequencing</b> due to issues of cost and/or processing time. Methods. An inexpensive and high-throughput library quantification method has been developed, based on an adaptation of the melting curve assay. Sequencing libraries were subjected to the assay using the Bio-Rad Laboratories CFX ConnectTM Real-Time PCR Detection System. The library quantity was calculated through summation of reduction of relative fluorescence units between 86 and 95 °C. Results. PCR-enriched sequencing libraries are suitable for this quantification without pre-purification of DNA. Short DNA molecules, which ideally should be eliminated from the library for subsequent processing, were differentiated from the target DNA in a mixture on the basis of differences in melting temperature. Quantification results for long sequences targeted using the melting curve assay were correlated with those from existing methods (R 2 > 0. 77), and that observed from MiSeq sequencing (R 2 = 0. 82). Discussion. The results of <b>multiplexed</b> <b>sequencing</b> suggested that the normalisation performance of the described method is equivalent to that of another recently reported high-throughput bead-based method, BeNUS. However, costs for the melting curve assay are considerably lower and processing times shorter than those of other existing methods, suggesting greater suitability for highly <b>multiplexed</b> <b>sequencing</b> applications...|$|R
40|$|The paired-end ditagging (PET) {{technique}} {{has been shown}} to be efficient and accurate for large-scale transcriptome and genome analysis. However, as with other DNA tag-based sequencing strategies, it is constrained by the current efficiency of Sanger technology. A recently developed <b>multiplex</b> <b>sequencing</b> method (454 -sequencing™) using picolitre-scale reactions has achieved a remarkable advance in efficiency, but suffers from short-read lengths, and a lack of paired-end information. To further enhance the efficiency of PET analysis and at the same time overcome the drawbacks of the new sequencing method, we coupled <b>multiplex</b> <b>sequencing</b> with paired-end ditagging (MS-PET) using modified PET procedures to simultaneously sequence 200 [*] 000 to 300 [*] 000 dimerized PET (diPET) templates, with an output of nearly half-a-million PET sequences in a single 4 h machine run. We demonstrate the utility and robustness of MS-PET by analyzing the transcriptome of human breast carcinoma cells, and by mapping p 53 binding sites in the genome of human colorectal carcinoma cells. This combined sequencing strategy achieved an approximate 100 -fold efficiency increase over the current standard for PET analysis, and furthermore enables the short-read-length <b>multiplex</b> <b>sequencing</b> procedure to acquire paired-end information from large DNA fragments...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} throughput of current DNA sequencing instruments, sample multiplexing is necessary for making economical use of available sequencing capacities. A widely used multiplexing strategy for the Illumina Genome Analyzer utilizes sample-specific indexes, which are embedded {{in one of the}} library adapters. However, this and similar multiplex approaches come with a risk of sample misidentification. By introducing indexes into both library adapters (double indexing), we have developed a method that reveals the rate of sample misidentification within current <b>multiplex</b> <b>sequencing</b> experiments. With ~ 0. 3 % these rates are orders of magnitude higher than expected and may severely confound applications in cancer genomics and other fields requiring accurate detection of rare variants. We identified the occurrence of mixed clusters on the flow as the predominant source of error. The accuracy of sample identification is further impaired if indexed oligonucleotides are cross-contaminated or if indexed libraries are amplified in bulk. Double-indexing eliminates these problems and increases both the scope and accuracy of <b>multiplex</b> <b>sequencing</b> on the Illumina platform...|$|E
