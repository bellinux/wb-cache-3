25|$|When {{the parties}} express a clear {{intention}} in a choice-of-law clause, {{there is a}} rebuttable presumption {{that this is the}} proper law because it reflects the parties' freedom of contract and it produces certainty of outcome. It can only be rebutted when the choice is not bona fide, it produces illegality, or it breaches public policy. For example, the parties may have selected the particular law to evade the operation of otherwise <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> of the law which has the closest connection with the contract. The parties are not free to put themselves above the law and, in such cases, it will be for the parties to prove that there is a valid reason for selecting that law other than evasion.|$|E
