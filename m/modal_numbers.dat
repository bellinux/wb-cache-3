Such a theoretical study focuses on spherical micro-resonators and is carried out according to two complementary ways: Electromagnetic (E. M) approaches based respectively on an eigenvector problem resolution called modal field in integrated optics and an analogy with Quantum Mechanics (Q. M) using the notions of potential and geometric eikonal principle. Thus, using quantization and phase considerations, fundamental new formulation of caustics, that depend on the two previous quantum <b>modal</b> <b>numbers</b> simultaneously, have been shaped and confronted with numerical and graphical simulations. Both ways lead to results in good agreement (correlation coefficient superior to 0. 99) and allow us to specify the evolution of such caustics according to each modal number of the quantification; such an analytical caustics formulation involves a specific function f whose study is expanded for various values of n ranging from 1 to 500. Moreover a whole study of asymptotic behaviors of f-function and its inverse f- 1 on specific n and l values, {{directly related to the}} previous caustics expressions, is conducted, allowing the expansion of new analytical expressions of caustics in various limit cases and asymptotic behaviors. Then, the evolution of the positions of caustics in terms of <b>modal</b> <b>numbers</b> is interpreted, and the physical meanings of optical properties such as quasi-resonance, position and confinement of field with resonance, and associated electromagnetic fields are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Lygaeidae (Heteroptera) are a {{large and}} diverse family in which the male diploid {{chromosomal}} complement ranges from 10 to 30. Diploid numbers of 14 and 16 are taken as two <b>modal</b> <b>numbers</b> of the family. The Rhyparochrominae, {{one of the largest}} subfamilies of the Lygaeidae, are known to be heterogeneous both cytologically and morphologically. Available data on the tribe Rhyparochromini reveal that all species are characterized by the presence of a pair of microchromo-somes (m-chromosomes) and have an XY/XX (♂/♀) sex chromosome determinin...|$|E
40|$|We {{list the}} {{chromosome}} numbers for 65 species of Neotropical Hesperiidae and 104 species or subspecies of Pieridae. In Hesperiidae the tribe Pyrrhopygini have a modal n = 28, Eudaminae and Pyrgini a modal n = 31, while Hesperiinae have n = around 29. Among Pieridae, Coliadinae {{have a strong}} modal n = 31 and among Pierinae Anthocharidini are almost fixed for n = 15 while Pierini vary with n = 26 as the most common chromosome number. Dismorphiinae show wide variation. We discuss these results {{in the context of}} chromosome numbers of over 1400 Neotropical butterfly species and subspecies derived from about 3000 populations published here and in earlier papers of a series. The overall results show that many Neotropical groups are characterized by karyotype instability with several derived <b>modal</b> <b>numbers</b> or none at all, while almost all taxa of Lepidoptera studied from the {{other parts of the world}} have one of n = 29 - 31 as <b>modal</b> <b>numbers.</b> Possibly chromosome number changes become fixed in the course of speciation driven by biotic interactions. Population subdivision and structuring facilitate karyotype change. Factors that stabilize chromosome numbers include hybridization among species sharing the same number, migration, sexual selection and possibly the distribution of chromosomes within the nucleus...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the surface second-harmonic generation {{can lead to the}} formation of nonlinear plasmonic whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) in microcavities made of metallic nanowires. Since these WGMs are excited by induced surface nonlinear dipoles, they can be generated even when they are not coupled to the radiation continuum. Consequently, the quality factor of these nonlinear modes can be as large as the theoretical limit imposed by the optical losses in the metal. Remarkably, our theoretical analysis shows that nonlinear plasmonic WGMs are characterized by fractional azimuthal <b>modal</b> <b>numbers.</b> This suggests that the plasmonic cavities investigated here can be used to generate multi-color optical fields with fractional angular momentum.

It follows that these scattering problems are uniquely solvable except possibly for an infinite series of exceptional values of the wavenumber with no finite accumulation point.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of meiotic {{chromosomes}} in air-dried preparations from 30 genitally sound rams (Ovis aries). Three of the rams had a normal mitotic karyotype (2 n = 54) and the remainder were carriers of the t 1, t 2 and t 3 Robertsonian translocations in various heterozygous and homozygous combinations. The studies on the primary spermatocytes showed that the normal rams had a <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of 27 chromosomal elements and the translocation-carrying rams were recorded with a <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of either 24 or 25. The translocation in the heterozygous state was characterized {{by the presence of}} a trivalent in cells at the diplotene, diakinesis and metaphase I stages, while in the homozygous state it was characterized by the presence of a bivalent. The <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of chromosomal elements was recorded in 90. 5 to 97. 3 percent of the cells at diakinesis and metaphase I in the translocation-carrying rams. The <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of chromosomal elements was recorded in 88. 3 percent of the cells in the normal rams. An association between the sex bivalent and a small autosomal bivalent was recorded in 3. 5 to 5. 3 percent of the cells at diakinesis and metaphase I in the translocation-carrying rams. Eight percent of the cells in the normal rams were seen with a sex bivalent association. The sex chromosomes were separated in 0. 0 to 1. 1 percent of the cells at diakinesis and metaphase I in the translocation-carrying rams, while 0. 7 percent of the cells in the normal rams had separated sex chromosomes. However, aneuploidy involving the sex chromosomes was not observed in the secondary spermatocytes from the normal and translocation-carrying rams. A total of 1, 757 secondary spermatocytes were counted from 27 translocation-carrying rams and 103 secondary spermatocytes from 3 normal rams. The studies on the secondary spermatocytes showed that the <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of 30 chromosome arms was recorded in 87. 3 to 96. 0 percent of the non-polyploid cells in the translocation-carrying rams and 95. 2 percent of the cells in the normal rams. No hypermodal cells were found in the normal rams. Hypermodal cells were recorded in 0. 0 to 3. 6 per cent of the non-polyploid cells in the translocation-carrying rams. There were individual variations in the percentage of hypermodal cells recorded in rams with identical karyotypes. There were also significantly greater numbers of cells with 29 chromosome arms than with 31 chromosome arms in the translocation-carrying rams. This suggested that chromosome loss due to lagging at anaphase I or technical manipulation, must have occurred in addition to non-disjunction. A significant surplus of secondary spermatocytes of normal karyotype and a deficit of 25, t 1 t 3 were found in the metaphase II figures from the triple heterozygous rams. Significantly uneven distributions of segregation products were also found in the multiple translocation-carrying rams with karyotypes of 50,xy,t 1 t 2 t 2 t 3 and 49,xy,t 1 t 2 t 2 t 3 tx. The translocation-carrying sheep have been shown to have good conception rates and an average breeding performance. This would suggest that only balanced (euploid) spermatozoa are involved in fertilization and the unbalanced (aneuploid) spermatocytes fail to mature into spermatozoa and are selected against or degenerate during spermatogenesis. The evidence indicates that the fertility of the ram is unaffected by the presence of the translocation chromosomes and consequently these sheep should not be eliminated arbitrarily from our animal populations...|$|R

RESULTS [...] All journals except Cell and Nature showed a trend towards increasing authorship numbers over the study period. The trend was most noticeable in journals such as JCO which feature clinical research. General medical journals (Lancet, NEJM) with a median of six to seven authors per article published far fewer seven author than six author studies, which suggests that author number may be influenced by the Vancouver convention which precludes citation of more than six authors. CONCLUSIONS [...] The phenomenon of expanding authorship in biomedical journal articles is not explained by the hypothesis that newer research technologies have necessitated more extensive collaboration. Rather, the data suggest that conferral of authorship may sometimes have a volitional component which contributes to rising author numbers.

We examined the effect of sex, age, individual trisomies, <b>modal</b> <b>number,</b> and structural abnormalities on survival among 700 children with HeH. Univariate analysis showed that age. sex, + 4, + 10, + 18, and a high <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> were associated with survival. Multivariate analysis however, revealed that only age, sex, + 4, and + 18 were independent indicators. Hazard scores for predicting relapse and mortality were constructed. Three risk groups with 5 -year event-free survival (EFS) rates of 86 %, 75 %, and 50 % (P <. 0001) were identified. The high-risk group comprised boys older than 9 years, boys aged 1 through 9 years without + 18, and girls older than 9 years without + 18, while girls aged 1 through 9 years with + 18 had the best EFS. In terms of mortality, those younger than age 10 years with both + 4 and + 18 had an improved survival (96 % vs 84 % at 5 years, P <. 0001). These findings confirm that the outcome of children with HeH is heterogeneous and that specific trisomies can identify patients with the greatest and least risk of treatment failur...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{karyotype}} of murine lymphoblastic leukemia L 1210 was {{studied with}} the use of the trypsin-Giemsa technique. The line was hypodiploid with a <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of 38 chromo-somes. including three biarmed chromosomes. All cells examined contained at least one copy of each normal chromosome with the exception of chromosome # 1. in which a whole copy along with parts of the second copy was found in the marker chromo-some's composition. In 65 % of the cells. trisomy of chromosome # 15 was observed. Nearly all cells contained only one X-chromosome. The 13 marker chromosomes that frequently oc-curred are described. and the presumed origin of seven of these chromosomes is described in detail. Comparison of the karyo-type of murine L 1210 leukemia with the karyotypes of other leukemias of the mouse showed the existence of similar chromo-some aberrations. Among these aberrations. the trisomy of chromosome # 15 and monosomy of the X-chromosome may be of special importance. The possible role of karyotypic changes in the genesis of the malignant phenotype of the cells is dis-cussed. -JNCI 1981; 66 : 177 - 182. Mouse lymphoblastic leukemia Ll 21 O. originated over 30 years ago by Law et al. in 1949 (1). is still widely used in cancer research. Karyotypic findings obtained with the Ll 210 line in the ascites form are of considerable interest because the presence of marker chromosomes and shifts in <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> can be used as indices of drug sensitivity or resistance (2 - 5). The description of the chromosome composition of Ll 210 murine leukemia investigated before the advent of banding methods (2 - 8) was limited to the determina-tion of the <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> and the establishment of the presence or absence of those markers that exhibit gross morphologic differences from ordinary mouse chromo-somes and are therefore distinguishable as markers even by conventional staining methods. The first cytogenetic study of Ll 210 leukemia based on G-banding techniques was published by Kusyk (9); it concerned mainly the banding pattern of chromo-somes of an in vitro Ll 210 leukemia line. The present paper describes in detail the karyotype of the ascites line of Ll 210 murine leukemia con-structed on the basis of observations on metaphase chromosomes stained by the trypsin-Giemsa technique...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is given of somatic chromosomes in Bison bonasus, Bos taurus and hybrids {{between these two}} species (Vi wisent, 3 Ai cattle). The <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of chromosomes in all the animals examined is the same — 2 N = 60. There are 58 acrocentric autosomes, and X chromo-some is a large submetacentric element. The Y chromosome in the European bison is a small submetacentric element. A relatively high percentage of peridiploid metaphase plates was found in B t hybrids. The role of morphological studies of chromosomes is discussed {{as a means of}} solving the problem of sterility of male hybrids. I...|$|R
