5|$|The {{pages of}} the Grolier Codex contain seven hieroglyphs {{representing}} days; the style of these glyphs {{differs from that of}} the other three Maya codices but is most similar to the glyphs of the Dresden Codex. The glyphs are arranged in vertical columns incorporating day signs accompanied by a number; each date corresponds to a manifestation of Venus. Whereas the Venus almanac in the Dresden Codex documents the planet after inferior conjunction as the <b>morning</b> <b>star,</b> the Grolier Codex documents all four of the stations of Venus: rising after inferior conjunction as <b>morning</b> <b>star</b> in the east, disappearance before superior conjunction, reappearance as evening star in the west and disappearance before inferior conjunction.|$|E

5|$|As the sun, the Eye of Ra is {{a source}} of heat and light, and it is {{associated}} with fire and flames. It is also equated with the red light that appears before sunrise, and with the <b>morning</b> <b>star</b> that precedes and signals the sun's arrival.|$|E
5|$|English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson cast strong doubts {{upon the}} {{authenticity}} of the Grolier Codex in his 1975 article The Grolier Codex, published in volume 27 of the Contributions of the University of California. Thompson argued that the codex was a modern forgery and that the unusual mix of styles in the document was not due to the mixing of cultures but rather due to the hand of a forger. Thompson queried the illustration of all four stations of Venus in the codex, noting that other Mesoamerican codices only illustrated the more spectacular appearance of Venus as <b>morning</b> <b>star.</b> This claim has been refuted more recently, with evidence presented from the Codex Telleriano-Remensis that the god of the <b>morning</b> <b>star</b> also presided over the evening star. The contents of the document have not been copied directly from any of the generally accepted Maya codices, although they do resemble pages 46 to 50 of the Dresden Codex.|$|E

5|$|Despite much speculation, {{there is}} no {{definitive}} explanation of either Linnaeus fils or Herbert's thinking. For instance the 'Knight's Star' {{has been compared to}} Linnaeus' decoration as a Knight of the Order of the Polar Star. The Latin word equestris (of a knight, or horseman) may have been confused with equi (of a horse), or possibly Herbert was making a literary Knight's Move on the Linnaean term. The flower name has even been compared to the mediaeval weapon, the spoked mace or <b>Morning</b> <b>Star</b> which it superficially resembles.|$|E
5|$|The {{tears of}} the Eye of Ra {{are part of}} a more general {{connection}} between the Eye and moisture. In addition to representing the <b>morning</b> <b>star,</b> the Eye can also be equated with the star Sothis (Sirius). Every summer, {{at the start of the}} Egyptian year, Sothis' heliacal rising, in which the star rose above the horizon just before the sun itself, heralded the start of the Nile inundation, which watered and fertilized Egypt's farmland. Therefore, the Eye of Ra precedes and represents the floodwaters that restore fertility to all of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{claims that}} another {{building}} {{associated with the}} planet Venus {{in the form of}} Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the Caracol. This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and <b>morning</b> <b>star.</b> However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.|$|E

5|$|Cabaniss' {{body was}} ordered to be embalmed but was not; the damage to his body was so severe that the {{embalming}} fluid would leak out. His body was buried in Kobe on February 24 with military honors. The entire crew of the Swatara attended, {{as well as the}} entire crew of HMS Flying Fish and many noted Japanese citizens. Ensign Parker reportedly suffered from depression following the accident. Cabaniss' death received significant media coverage in the Eastern United States. The New York Times published an article on its second page, and among other papers that carried the story were the Wilmington <b>Morning</b> <b>Star</b> and the Petersburg Index-Appeal.|$|E

5|$|Docherty {{remained}} {{a member of}} the Communist Party for 70 years, at times working with Alex Moffat and Abe Moffat. She campaigned for J. V. Leckie when he was a candidate for the Dunfermline Burghs constituency. She worked for Willie Gallacher, the communist Member of Parliament for Fife, for several years, and in 1952 unsuccessfully ran for a city council seat. At various points, Docherty held the positions of treasurer, Women's Group leader, and secretary for the Fife branch of the Communist Party. She retired from active political life when she was 60 years old, but despite being crippled by arthritis, participated in fundraising efforts for the newspaper <b>Morning</b> <b>Star.</b> She lived in a modest house in Cowdenbeath, and spent her time working on her memoirs. She continued to give talks and participate in International Women's Day events nearly every year until her death.|$|E
5|$|Ebla was a polytheistic state. During {{the first}} kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon {{of the first}} Ebla {{included}} pairs of deities {{and they can be}} separated into three genres; in the first and most common one, there were the couples, such as the deity and his female consort. The second type of pairs was the divine twosomes, such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos, like in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons. The third type included divine pairs who were actually a single deity that had two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first genre of pairs included Nidakul, who was exclusive to Ebla, and his consort, Belatu ("his wife"); Rasap and his consort Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his consort Barama. The third genre included the artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain Gods; Shahar as the <b>morning</b> <b>star</b> and Shalim as the evening star.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, the {{division}} cleared and secured {{the area around}} Banja Luka, and in February 1944 Hühnewaldt was replaced as commander of the 383rd Regiment by Major Ristow of I/383. At the end of March, most of the 383rd Regiment was deployed to Knin with responsibility for the road between Knin and Bihać, with the regimental commander designated as {{the commander of the}} garrison. In the latter task, it was assisted by the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen. From 7 to 16 May 1944, {{the division}} participated in Operation Morgenstern (<b>Morning</b> <b>Star)</b> in the Krbavsko Polje region west and southwest of Bihać, along with elements of its sister formation, the 392nd (Croatian) Infantry Division, the 92nd Motorised Regiment, the 1st Jäger Regiment of the Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg, and Ustase units. The operation was a significant success, killing 438 Partisans and capturing 56, along with large quantities of arms, ammunition, vehicles and supplies.|$|E

5|$|From here to Finch Avenue, {{the freeway}} follows the {{boundary}} line between Toronto and Mississauga. It encounters the third multi-level junction along its length, with Highway409, which {{provides access to}} the airport {{as well as the}} southbound to eastbound movement that cannot be performed at the interchange with Highway401 to the south. Highway427 continues straight north and narrows again to six lanes. After crossing the Kitchener GO line, it passes west of Woodbine Racetrack and beneath Rexdale Boulevard, <b>Morning</b> <b>Star</b> Drive, and Finch Avenue West, the first and last interchange with the route. The freeway bends slightly eastward, diverging from the Mississauga–Toronto boundary, and crosses the West Humber River where it drains from Claireville Reservoir. Approaching the fourth and final sprawling interchange, it crosses Steeles Avenue and enters Vaughan. It passes beneath Highway407 and crosses through an undeveloped area before terminating at its final interchange with Highway7. The mainline continues north as a four lane arterial road to Zenway Boulevard and is designated as York Regional Road99.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, {{with whom}} she entered into a relationship. An engraver, {{photographer}} and former journalist for the Brighton Argus, he shared her interest in the occult, and together they developed a magical system based upon Luciferianism, the veneration of the deity Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom they {{considered to be a}} benevolent angelic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the <b>Morning</b> <b>Star,</b> or Ordo Stella Matutina (OSM), propagating it through a correspondence course. The couple sent out lessons to those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained The Book of Lumiel, a short work written by Montalban that documented her understanding of Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind. The couple initially lived together in Torrington Place, London, from where they ran the course, but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of Southsea in Essex, where there was greater room for Heron's engraving equipment.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May, the Partisan 35th Lika Division {{attacked}} {{from the}} Plitvice Lakes area and captured {{the village of}} Ramljane. Partisans also interdicted the Otočac-Gospić road. In response, Mickl planned Operation Morgenstern (<b>Morning</b> <b>Star)</b> to clear Partisan forces from the Krbavsko Polje region around Udbina. From 7 to 16 May 1944, along with elements of the 373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division, the 92nd Motorised Regiment, a battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division, and Ustaše units, were involved in Operation Morgenstern. According to German sources, Operation Morgenstern resulted in significant Partisan losses, including 438 killed, 56 captured, and 18 defectors, as well as capturing weapons, ammunition, vehicles, animals and large amounts of equipment. Also in May, the division received 500 German reinforcements, and formed a field replacement battalion. The division saw action against the Partisans {{until the end of}} the war, often fighting alongside a grouping of Ustaše units that numbered up to 12,000 troops.|$|E
