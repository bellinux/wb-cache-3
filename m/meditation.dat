5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian <b>meditation</b> set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of <b>meditation.</b> The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian <b>meditation</b> with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian <b>meditation.</b> The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern <b>meditation</b> {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, <b>meditation,</b> which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Wynne, {{author of}} The Origin of Buddhist <b>Meditation,</b> observes that formless <b>meditation</b> and {{elemental}} <b>meditation</b> might have {{originated in the}} Upanishadic tradition. The earliest reference to <b>meditation</b> is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, {{one of the oldest}} Upanishads. Chandogya Upanishad describes the five kinds of vital energies (prana). Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins (nadis) are also described in the Upanishad. Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as the mastery of body and senses.|$|E

5|$|During a {{ministry}} of over half-a-century, Luang Pu Sodh taught Dhammakaya <b>meditation</b> continuously, guiding <b>meditation</b> every Thursday and preaching on Buddhism on Sundays and Uposatha days. Luang Pu Sodh would distribute an introductory book about <b>meditation</b> to practitioners. At first, the Dhammakaya <b>meditation</b> method drew {{criticism from the}} Thai Sangha authorities, {{because it was a}} new method. Discussion within the Sangha led to an inspection at Wat Paknam, but it was concluded that Luang Pu Sodh's method was correct.|$|E
5|$|<b>Meditation</b> is an {{integral}} part of the rosary. This mode of <b>meditation</b> is the process of reflecting on the mysteries of the rosary. With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries. The practice of <b>meditation</b> during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large. By the 16th century the practice of <b>meditation</b> during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual <b>meditation</b> to accompany each bead or prayer.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian <b>meditation.</b> Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings {{have emphasized the}} use of <b>meditation</b> as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using <b>meditation</b> and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and <b>meditation</b> continues {{to be used in the}} Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.|$|E

5|$|Christian <b>meditation</b> aims {{to heighten}} the {{personal}} relationship {{based on the}} love of God that marks Christian communion. Both in Eastern and Western Christianity <b>meditation</b> is the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplative prayer. Teachings in both the Eastern and Western Christian churches have emphasized the use of Christian <b>meditation</b> as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ.|$|E

5|$|When Sodh was {{twenty-two years}} old, he was ordained at Wat Songpinong in his {{hometown}} and was given the Pāli language monastic name Candasaro. Phra (phra meaning 'monk, venerable') Candasaro studied both under masters of the oral <b>meditation</b> tradition as well as experts in scriptural analysis, which was uncommon during that period. In his autobiographical notes, he wrote that he practiced <b>meditation</b> every day, {{from the first day}} following his ordination. In his first years as a monk, he had difficulty obtaining food on traditional alms rounds, where monks go house to house looking for laypeople to offer them food. This hardship led him to resolve that he would one day built a kitchen for monastics, who would then enjoy convenience in the spiritual life. After his third rainy season (third year after monk's ordination), Phra Candasaro traveled far and wide in Thailand to study scriptures and <b>meditation</b> practice with teachers from established traditions. He learnt about a broad range of things, and was in the habit of respecting all spiritual things. He studied scriptures at Wat Pho and learnt about <b>meditation</b> at eight centers, among which Wat Ratchasittharam. At Wat Ratchasittharam he studied a visualization <b>meditation</b> method with Luang Por Aium, and experienced a development in <b>meditation</b> regarded as important, when he perceived a sphere of light. Buddhist Studies scholars Kate Crosby and Catherine Newell believe Wat Ratchasittharam to be crucial in Luang Pu Sodh's development of Dhammakaya <b>meditation.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} third meditation-category—automatic self-transcending— {{to extend the}} {{dichotomy}} of focused attention and open monitoring proposed by Lutz. Automatic self-transcending includes techniques designed to transcend their own activity. This contrasts with focused attention, which keeps attention focused on an object; and open monitoring, which keeps attention involved in the monitoring process. Each category was assigned EEG bands, based on reported brain patterns during mental tasks, and <b>meditations</b> were categorized based on their reported EEG. Focused attention, characterized by beta/gamma activity, included <b>meditations</b> from Tibetan Buddhist, Buddhist, and Chinese traditions. Open Monitoring, characterized by theta activity, included <b>meditations</b> from Buddhist, Chinese, and Vedic traditions. Automatic self-transcending, characterized by alpha 1 activity, included <b>meditations</b> from Vedic and Chinese traditions. Between categories, the included <b>meditations</b> differed in focus, subject/object relation, and procedures. These findings {{shed light on the}} common mistake of averaging <b>meditations</b> together to determine mechanisms or clinical effects...|$|R
5|$|Although Phra Candasaro {{had studied}} with many masters, and had {{mastered}} many important Pali texts, {{he was not}} satisfied. He withdrew himself in the more peaceful area of his hometown twice. Some sources state he also withdrew himself in the jungles to meditate more, but Newell doubts this. In the eleventh rains retreat (vassa) after his ordination, in 1916, he stayed at Wat Botbon at Bangkuvieng, Nonthaburi Province. Wat Botbon was the temple {{where he used to}} receive education as a child, a temple known for its peacefulness. As seen from Luang Pu Sodh's autobiographical notes, he reflected to himself that he had been practicing <b>meditation</b> for many years and had still not understood the essential knowledge which the Buddha had taught. Thus, on the full-moon day in the tenth lunar month of 1916, he sat down in the main shrine hall of Wat Botbon, resolving not to waver in his practice of sitting <b>meditation,</b> whatever might disturb his single-mindedness. That same night he experienced in <b>meditation</b> {{what became known as the}} attainment of the Dhammakaya, which marked the start of Dhammakaya <b>meditation</b> as a tradition.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} two tower complexes, there is a {{reception}} office, administrative block, monastic quarters, <b>meditation</b> halls and a kitchen complex where lay supporters prepare meals for the monks and visitors. The monastic quarters and <b>meditation</b> hall are not open to laypeople and can provide accommodation for hundreds of monks. This large capacity is often utilised during the Rains Retreat. This retreat commemorates events during {{the life of the}} Buddha, when the rainy season came between the full moons of the fourth and seventh lunar months. As a result, monks of the time stayed in one place to practice rather than travel from place to place.|$|E
