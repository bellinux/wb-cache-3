We consider pairs of individuals discussing on two attitudinal dimensions, and we suppose that one dimension is important, the other secondary. The dynamics are mainly ruled by the level of agreement on the <b>main</b> <b>dimension.</b> If two individuals are close on the <b>main</b> <b>dimension,</b> then they attract {{each other on the}} main and on the secondary dimensions, whatever their disagreement on the secondary dimension. If they are far from each other on the <b>main</b> <b>dimension,</b> then too much proximity on the secondary dimension is uncomfortable, and generates rejection on this dimension. The proximity is defined by comparing the opinion distance with a threshold called attraction threshold on the <b>main</b> <b>dimension</b> and rejection threshold on the secondary dimension. With such dynamics, a population with opinions initially uniformly drawn evolves to a set of clusters, inside which secondary opinions fluctuate more or less depending on threshold values. We observe that a low attraction threshold favours fluctuations on the secondary dimension, especially when the rejection threshold is high. The opinion evolutions of the model can be related to some stylised facts. 1...|$|R
25|$|In December 2003 the Finnish-Swedish {{ice class}} of Botnica was {{unexpectedly}} downgraded from 1A Super to III, {{the lowest possible}} ice class which is mainly used for barges and other vessels unsuitable for navigation in ice. Since the icebreaker is built to DNV's ICE-10 ice class which far exceeds the requirements for the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, this was not due to any technical or structural issue, but {{a problem with the}} ship's paperwork. Botnica operates at different draughts depending on her mission, and when returning to Finland from abroad her true <b>main</b> <b>dimensions</b> were found out to be different from those stated in the ship's documentation.

The <b>main</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the new 4,415-ton icebreaker, large enough to escort 10,000-ton dry cargo ships or 16,000-ton tankers, were based on the old Jääkarhu, but the triple-expansion steam engines were replaced with a modern diesel-electric propulsion system, similar to the 1939-built Sisu, with a combined output of 10,500 shp. In the early drafts, the new icebreaker was designed with three propellers (two in the stern and one in the bow) and an asymmetric stem that would compensate for the transverse force caused by the bow propeller. However, these features were later dropped after extensive model testing and co-operation with Swedish naval architects in favor of a completely new design.|$|E

30|$|RoRo {{carriers}} are key stones in shore based logistical systems {{and as a}} result diverse in design speeds and <b>main</b> <b>dimension</b> ratio’s. This diversity could be threatened by the relative simplicity of the EEDI regulations. This article aims to estimate the influence of the EEDI approach on 30 existing RoRo cargo carriers. The attained EEDI’s per design are determined. Also the costs per transport effort are calculated based on the private costs and based on the social costs, both at the economically optimum speeds based on a uniformly applied sailing profile. The social costs are based on all emissions because the number of Environmental Special Area’s is limited and the impact of speed reductions will not be limited to climate change. The expected speed reductions for these designs based on the EEDI, but also the required speed reductions when taking into account the total social costs are used to estimate the effectivity from the EEDI regulations.
