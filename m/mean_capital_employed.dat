This paper investigates the relationship between <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> efficiency and operating cash flow. To test this hypothesis, data has been collected from a sample of 161 firms in Tehran Stock Exchange over the period 2008 - 2012.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the nexus amongst government agricultural spending and its inherent volatility level, total <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> and turnover {{of the agricultural}} sector {{of the stock market}} and agricultural output in Nigeria. Time series data from 1978 - 2008 were employed. Data were analyzed using square of mean-adjusted relative change volatility estimation method, co-integration and error correction model and two-stage-least squares regression technique. There is the existence of a long-run relationship amongst government agricultural spending, total <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> and turnover of the agricultural sector of the stock market and agricultural output. Government agricultural spending is influenced by its lag (0. 42) and agricultural output (- 1. 94). Total <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> in the agricultural sector of the stock market is influenced by government agricultural spending (0. 15). Total turnover of the agricultural sector of the stock market is influenced by the total <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> in the sector and the volatility level in government agricultural spending (- 0. 03). Agricultural output is influenced by government agricultural spending (0. 09) and total turnover of the agricultural sector of the stock market (0. 23). Government agricultural spending stimulates the development of the agricultural sector of the stock market, while its volatility is an impediment.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} factors that are {{associated}} with annual changes in the share price of Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listed companies. In this study, an increase in value of a share is when the share price of a company goes up {{by the end of the}} financial year as compared to the previous year. Secondary data that was sourced from McGregor BFA website was used. The data was from 2004 up to 2011. Deciding which share to buy is the biggest challenge faced by both investment companies and individuals when investing on the stock exchange. This thesis uses binary logistic regression to identify the variables {{that are associated with}} share price increase. The dependent variable was annual change in share price (ACSP) and the independent variables were assets per <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> ratio, debt per assets ratio, debt per equity ratio, dividend yield, earnings per share, earnings yield, operating profit margin, price earnings ratio, return on assets, return on equity and return on <b>capital</b> <b>employed.</b> Different variable selection methods were used and it was established that the backward elimination method produced the best model. It was established that the probability of success of a share is higher if the shareholders are anticipating a higher return on <b>capital</b> <b>employed,</b> and high earnings/ share. It was however, noted that the share price is negatively impacted by dividend yield and earnings yield. Since the odds of an increase in share price is higher if there is a higher return on <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> and high earning per share, investors and investment companies are encouraged to choose companies with high earnings per share and the best returns on <b>capital</b> <b>employed.</b> The final model had a classification rate of 68. 3 % and the validation sample produced a classification rate of 65. 2 %Mathematical SciencesM.

40|$|Introduction: Maximizing the {{shareholder}} value {{is the main}} purpose for many firms. To {{be able to do}} so it is important to work with the firm’s cash flow and return on <b>capital</b> <b>employed.</b> Many firms only focus on generating a good profit and forget or find it complicating to work with the cash flow due to difficult calculations. These problems are often face on lower levels such as for business units. By improving the Return on <b>Capital</b> <b>Employed</b> and Cash Flow already at lower levels it will have a greater impact on the whole firm. It will also be easier for a deeper look to find slacks and which factors the company need to work with. Purpose: The purpose with this study is to make it easier for the financial managers to work with cash flow at lower levels by creating a simpler cash flow model. The study also aims to highlight the relationship between <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> and cash flow. Method: A case study is performed and the essay uses a quantitative approach with help of a qualitative method for a deeper analysis. Two simpler cash flow models is created and analyzed on each of the three business units. Important variables and how those affect ROCE is investigated from earlier research. The relationship between the <b>Capital</b> <b>Employed</b> and Cash Flow is analyzed. Conclusion: The study shows that both of the models can be used when calculating cash flow for a whole year. When considering monthly basis there is still some improvement that needs to be made. The study provides propositions for further improvements, since the study its self is limited in this area because of lack of information. The created model 1 is recommended over model 2, since it provides a better overall result and would also be easier to adjust when needed. The study shows that there is a relationship between <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> and cash flow. It also confirms earlier researches regarding which parameters that influence ROCE the most...|$|R
