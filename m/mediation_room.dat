40|$|Creating a false reality: "All that glitters is not gold". The {{presentation}} {{is not always}} reality. It is therefore not wise to believe everything you hear in the <b>mediation</b> <b>room.</b> To get the mediator as a supporter and ally in a conflict with the other party, many different strategies are being used. As a mediator, one {{is in danger of}} contributing {{to the conclusion that the}} agreements in the mediation process ends up with the other party being unfairly treated if you do not reveal the false stories...|$|E

A fetaure of the local community is its multi-racial make up with a higher than average number of overseas-born residents. The name Inala {{is derived from the}} name given by the originial inhabitant of the area and means "place of the winds" or "meeting of the winds" in the local aboriginal language. The artworks reflect this concept of the wind and the "flow" and energy in the works help unify the public spaces in the building.

It shows the {{technologies that are}} usually employed in this field and presents the prototype of Consumedia, an online mediation platform, {{as well as its}} functionalities and technological architecture. Moreover, it uncovers the technology implemented as regards the recognition of emotions in the <b>mediation</b> <b>room.</b> Furthermore, it considers that an online mediation platform may automatically provide the parties with all the required documentation of the process. Thus, it unveils the documents that an online mediation platform should automatically provide to the disputants. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014...|$|E
40|$|This article {{looks at}} the uses and {{application}} of the tools and tactics of negotiation in the <b>mediation</b> <b>room.</b> It explores how the art and practice of negotiation might be of practical use to skilled mediators as they assist parties to devise a solution they have worked for by effectively negotiating their way skillfully through the issues. Mediation is a profession, and understanding {{the dynamics of the}} dance of negotiation and how it affects the mindsets and actions of parties in a conflict can help mediators get behind the initial positions of parties, through effective dialogue to explore interests and to have the parties meet their needs without sacrificing the needs or goals of the other party. “Words and Concessions are the lubrication of negotiations” Prof. Robert Mnookin Head of the Program on Negotiation Harvard Law School...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the potential relevance of developments in cognitive psychology and neuro-science for mediation and its practitioners. It begins by noting the linkages between mediation and micro-economic market theory and then illustrates the adoption within behavioural economics of key psychological insights, involving cognitive and social biases and heuristics, in human decision-making. Assuming the scientific validity of six potentially relevant biases, it examines how mediators might use this knowledge in the <b>mediation</b> <b>room</b> in assisting their clients, often unaware of their own biases, in making wise decisions. The article then relates the behaviourist principles to other supportive evidence on decision-making, some of which is already accommodated in the mediation literature and mediation training. It concludes by acknowledging the challenges for mediators, and mediation models and standards, in {{coming to terms with}} the sometimes indeterminate insights of 2 ̆ 2 predictable irrationality 2 ̆ 2...|$|E
30|$|The second aim of {{our study}} was to examine whether perfectionism mediates the {{relationship}} between stress and anxiety symptoms and BD symptoms in an attempt to understand mechanisms underlying the high comorbidity between anxiety symptoms and BD. For chronic bipolar depressive symptoms, the mediation models were significant with self-orientated perfectionism found to significantly mediate the relationship between anxiety and stress symptoms and bipolar depressive symptoms. These findings remained after controlling for the presence of chronic (hypo)manic symptoms. These findings are consistent with our previous finding in a clinical sample (Corry et al. 2013). Our hypothesis that socially-prescribed perfectionism and goal attainment values would mediate the relationship between anxiety and stress symptoms and chronic hypomanic symptoms was partially supported. Only socially-prescribed perfectionism (not goal attainment values) was uniquely associated with chronic hypomanic symptoms in the linear regression models in the current study; therefore, we considered only socially-prescribed perfectionism in the mediation models. In mediation models, socially-prescribed perfectionism significantly mediated associations between both anxiety and stress, and chronic hypomanic symptoms after controlling for the presence of chronic depressive symptoms. This finding is inconsistent with our previous study and likely represents methodological differences in the measurement of (hypo)mania (chronic in the present study versus current in our previous study) (Corry et al. 2013). It {{is important to note that}} the present findings do not imply that perfectionism is the only mediator between anxiety and stress symptoms and bipolar disorder symptoms. Perfectionism is only a partial mediator in the <b>mediation</b> models, leaving <b>room</b> for other constructs to play a role. For example, the perfectionism literature also highlights the importance of coping styles, emotional regulation strategies and congruent life events to explain the relationship between perfectionism and psychopathology [e.g. (Dunkley and Blankstein 2000; Dunkley et al. 2003)].|$|R
40|$|Existing {{research}} into workplace mediation in the UK {{has tended to}} focus on managerial perceptions. Consequently, there has been a unitarist emphasis on the business case for mediation, revolving around its alleged superior efficiency properties compared to conventional rights-based procedures. This paper develops the research agenda in two respects: first, it foregrounds the experiences of participants in mediation through 25 interviews with individuals drawn from a variety of contexts. Second, it extends the analysis beyond the efficiency of mediation to consider issues of voice and equity. In doing so it explores the role played by mediation within the negotiation and re-negotiation of workplace relations and also {{the way in which it}} shapes, and is shaped by, power and control. In the cases examined in the paper, mediation not only facilitated employee voice, but allowed subordinates to challenge the authority of supervisors and line managers. However, the influence of mediation on the balance of workplace power relations outside the <b>mediation</b> <b>room</b> was much more limited...|$|E
