40|$|We use an {{aluminium}} {{single electron}} transistor with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>gate</b> to directly quantify the chemical potential anisotropy of GaMnAs materials. Uniaxial and cubic {{contributions to the}} chemical potential anisotropy are determined from field rotation experiments. In performing magnetic field sweeps we observe additional isotropic magnetic field dependence of the chemical potential which shows a non-monotonic behavior. The observed effects are explained by calculations based on the k·p kinetic exchange model of ferromagnetism in GaMnAs. Our device inverts the conventional approach for constructing spin transistors: instead of spin-transport controlled by ordinary gates we spin-gate ordinary charge transport.

By applying an electric field, electrons propagating through the FeCr/CeO 2 layer from Si were injected into the Cr 2 O 3 -x layer. When a magnetic field was applied, the resistance of this capacitor above the flat-band voltage was reduced, causing the hysteresis window to become large.

We demonstrate that such splittings in proximity induced ferromagnetic graphene could be determined directly from the tunneling resonances in the linear response conductance, as the top gate creates also a tunable barrier in the graphene layer. We show how such splittings could also be determined independently by magnetoresistance measurements in a spin-valve geometry. Because the spin polarization of the current near the Dirac point increases with the length of the barrier, long <b>magnetic</b> <b>gates</b> are desirable for determining Δ experimentally.

40|$|Context: Vela X- 1 is the {{prototype}} of the classical sgHMXB systems. Recent continuous and long monitoring campaigns revealed a large hard X-rays variability amplitude with strong flares and off-states. This activity has been interpreted invoking clumpy stellar winds and/or <b>magnetic</b> <b>gating</b> mechanisms. Aims: We are probing if the observed behaviour {{could be explained by}} unstable hydrodynamic flows close to the neutron star rather than the more exotic phenomena. Methods: We have used the hydrodynamic code VH- 1 to simulate the flow of the stellar wind with high temporal resolution and to compare the predicted accretion rate with the observed light-curves. Results: The simulation results are similar to the observed variability. Off-states are predicted with a duration of 5 to 120 minutes corresponding to transient low density bubbles forming around the neutron star. Oscillations of the accretion rate with a typical period of ∼ 6800 sec are generated in our simulations and observed. They correspond to the complex motion of a bow shock, moving either towards or away from the neutron star. Flares are also produced by the simulations up to a level of 10 ^ 37 erg/s. Conclusions: We have qualitatively reproduced the hard X-ray variations observed in Vela X- 1 with hydrodynamic instabilities predicted by a simple model. More sophisticated phenomena, such as clumpy winds or the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gating</b> mechanism, are not excluded but not required to explain the basic phenomenology.

40|$|Hard {{disk drives}} (HDDs) {{have been the}} {{dominant}} secondary memory device in computing for over 50 years, while more recently magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) {{has emerged as a}} candidate for primary computing memory. Both HDDs and MRAM store information in the polarity of a magnetic layer, which is written and read by non relativistic mechanisms. There is now gathering interesting in using relativistic mechanisms whose origins lie with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for MRAM writing because of potential benefits in terms of scalability, device design, and efficiency. This thesis investigates the fundamental physics of SOC phenomena that can write (spin-orbit torque (SOT), Neel order SOT) or read (anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), <b>magnetic</b> <b>gating)</b> the <b>magnetic</b> state by the application of electrical current. These phenomena are studied in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic semiconducting materials that offer a relevant electrical conductivity for integration into commercial electronic devices. Effective magnetic fields which parametrise the SOT phenomenon are measured in the diluted magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn) As using a technique based upon experimental planar Hall effect measurements and analytical fitting with a free energy equation for coherent magnetization rotation. It is found that effective magnetic fields which originate from Dresselhaus SOC increase in magnitude with increasing temperature, whereas those originating from Rashba SO have no significant temperature dependence within experimental uncertainty. The size of the measured effective fields per unit of current density, as well as the ratio of Dresselhaus to Rashba effective field magnitudes averaged over all temperatures are comparable to previous experimental measurements. Sb-based diluted magnetic semiconductors (Ga,Mn (As 0. 9,Sb 0. 1) and (Ga,Mn) Sb are characterised by magnetic and transport measurements. The Curie temperature (Tc) of (Ga,Mn) (As 0. 9,Sb 0. 1) increases from 28 K to 55 K upon sample annealing. The Tc of as-grown (Ga,Mn) Sb is found to be 34 K, and in contrast to (Ga,Mn) (As 0. 9,Sb 0. 1) does not change upon annealing, indicating a lack of interstitial Mn in (Ga,Mn) Sb. Field rotation transport measurements for current along various crystalline directions reveal significant crystalline and non crystalline contributions to the AMR of both as-grown and annealed (Ga,Mn) (As 0. 9,Sb 0. 1). An anomalous temperature dependence of the AMR of the annealed (Ga,Mn (As 0. 9,Sb 0. 1) sample for current along the [110] crystalline direction is accounted for by considering the relative sizes of the individual AMR contributions as a function of temperature. Results are shown of an attempt to vary the current flow through a non-magnetic GaAs/AlGaAs 2 D electron gas (2 DEG) by changing the magnetization orientation of an electrically insulated Fe <b>gate</b> layer. Such <b>magnetic</b> <b>gating</b> of electrical current is based upon the principle that, as a result of SOC, the electrochemical potential of a ferromagnet is anisotropic with respect to its magnetization orientation.

The archival data of the first 15 years of Chandra observations were retrieved and analysed by means of fast Fourier transforms, employing a peak-detection algorithm able to screen candidate signals in an automatic fashion. We carried out the search for new X-ray pulsators in light curves with more than 50 photons, {{for a total of}} about 190, 000 lightcurves out of about 430, 000 extracted. With these numbers, the ChAndra Timing Survey at Brera And Roma astronomical observatories (CATS@BAR) - as we called the project - represents the largest ever systematic search for coherent signals in the classic X-ray band. More than 50 per cent of the signals were confirmed by further Chandra (for those sources with two or more pointings), XMM-Newton or ROSAT data. The period distribution of the new X-ray pulsators above about 2, 000 s resembles that of cataclysmic variables, while there is a paucity of sources with shorter period and low fluxes. Since there is not an obvious bias against these detections, a possible interpretation is in terms of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>gating</b> mechanism in accreting neutron stars. Finally, we note that CATS@BAR is a living project and the detection algorithm will continue to be routinely applied to the new Chandra data as they become public.
