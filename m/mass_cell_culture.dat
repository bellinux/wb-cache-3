All three fungal species grew comparatively well on plant cell biomass with no requirement for supplementary nutrients. Of the three species assessed B. cinerea demonstrated the most growth. This species also produced the greatest yield of D-glucose. However, when culture conditions were modified, yields of D-glucose were markedly reduced indicating {{that the combination of}} species and culture conditions must be thoroughly investigated to ensure maximum product yield. The growth of filamentous fungi on plant cells also markedly affected the nature of the resulting fungal-plant cell residue, increasing the levels of soluble carbohydrates and essential amino acids with the largest increase in these materials being promoted by B. cinerea...|$|E

40|$|The {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} of Autographa californica (AcNPV) was {{evaluated}} by using in vitro test systems for toxicity and transforming potential in mammalian <b>cells.</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> of CV- 1 and WI 38 cells appeared unaffected by AcNPV at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Human foreskin cells grew more slowly after inoculation but eventually produced healthy monolayers. The sensitivities of the inhibition of reproductive survivability assays were greater and demonstrated slight AcNPV toxicity to CV- 1, WI 38, and human foreskin cells. Toxicity was not ameliorated when gradient-purified or psoralen-inactivated virus was used, suggesting that the toxic component of the preparation {{is part of the}} virion or copurifies with it. AcNPV was not toxic to and did not transform BALB/c 3 T 3 cells or primary <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> derived from Syrian hamster embryo cells (SHE). Unlike the BALB/c 3 T 3 transformation assay, the SHE assay detected no spontaneous transformants. The SHE transformation assay can employ simian adenovirus 7 as a positive control. SHE are transformed by numerous viruses and so are useful in assessment protocols. This study suggests that in vitro assessment of viral pesticide toxicity should employ the inhibition of reproductive survivability assay and that transformation assessment is best done with the SHE-simian adenovirus 7 procedure...|$|R
40|$|Hemivannusal (6), a bicyclic sesquiterpenoid with an {{unprecedented}} skeleton, has been {{isolated from the}} marine ciliate Euplotes vannus (strain TB 6). The relative configuration of 6 has been established through an extended conformational search performed by molecular mechanics and refined through ab initio quantum chemical calculations. Another strain (CM 1) of the same morphospecies {{has been found to}} produce the linear prevannusadial A (7) and the monocyclic prevannusadial B (8), which could represent key intermediates for the biosynthesis both of hemivannusal (6) and of the C 30 terpenoids vannusals A and B (5 a and 5 b), the latter pair being metabolites isolated from conspecific strains (Sil 21 andBUN 3) of the same E. vannus morphospecies. The occurrence of hemivannusal (6) in <b>mass</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> both of an E. vannus endosymbiont-free strain and of a penicillin-treated E. vannus bacteria-infected strain strongly suggests that its biosynthesis is coded by the ciliates and not by prokaryotic endosymbiont genes.

30|$|Telomerase {{activity}} {{was determined by}} TRAP as described previously (Li et al., 1997). For telomeres in cultured cells, metaphase spreads from cycling MCF- 7 cells treated with or without BMP 7 (30  ng/mL, 15  h) thee times per week for two weeks were generated using standard laboratory protocols. The slides of metaphase cells or tumor sections were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde before treatment with acidified 1 % pepsin solution, and hybridized with probe solution (0.3  µg/mL Cy 3 -conjugated [CCCTAA] 3 PNA probe (Panagene, Daejeon, South Korea), 70 % formamide, 20  mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 % BSA). Washing was conducted in PBS/tween- 20 with one high stringency wash at 57 °C. DNA was counterstained with DAPI and visualized and captured using Nikon Eclipse TE 2000 microscope, Plan Fluor 40 × objective, DS- 5 MC CCD camera and NIS-Elements F 2.20 software (Nikon). Telomere images were captured with a Plan Fluor 100 × oil-emersion objective, and individual telomere fluorescence was integrated using spot IOD analysis in the TFL-Telo 2.2 program (gift from Dr. Peter Lansdorp, Vancouver) (Rufer et al., 1998). Images from at least 13 metaphase spreads from each data point were quantified before assembly of data in a standard spreadsheet program. At least 50 nuclei from each condition were analyzed. Average length of telomere repeat fragment (TRF) from <b>mass</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> were determined by in-gel hybridization following collection of total genomic DNA, HindF 1 /RSA 1 digestions and pulse-field agarose gel electrophoresis, using radioisotope-labelled oligonucleotide probe (sequence in Table S 1).

Dynamic light scattering assay determined the polydisperse existence of micronized particles of size 3 nm to 2 mu m. Field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed distinct morphology and size distribution heterogeneity of particles. Integrity of zeaxanthin after the antisolvent process was assessed by LC-MS/MS.

40|$|Preventing the {{formation}} of insoluble polyglutamine containing protein aggregates in neurons may represent an attractive therapeutic strategy to ameliorate Huntington's disease (HD). Therefore, the ability to screen for small molecules that suppress the self-assembly of huntingtin would have potential clinical and significant research applications. We have developed an automated filter retardation assay for the rapid identification of chemical compounds that prevent HD exon 1 protein aggregation in vitro. Using this method, a total of 25 benzothiazole derivatives that inhibit huntingtin fibrillogenesis in a dose-dependent manner were discovered from a library of ≈ 184, 000 small molecules. The results obtained by the filter assay were confirmed by immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and <b>mass</b> spectrometry. Furthermore, <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> studies revealed that 2 -amino- 4, 7 -dimethyl-benzothiazol- 6 -ol, a chemical compound similar to riluzole, significantly inhibits HD exon 1 aggregation in vivo.

40|$|Porous NiTi {{shape memory}} alloys {{are one of}} the {{promising}} biomaterials for surgical implants because of their unique shape memory effects and porous structure with open pores. However, the complex surface morphology and larger area of porous NiTi compared to dense NiTi make it more vulnerable from the viewpoint of release of nickel, which can cause deleterious effects in the human body. It is also more difficult to modify the exposed surfaces of a porous structure using conventional surface modification technologies. In this work, oxidation in conjunction with postreaction heat treatment was used to modify the surfaces of porous single-phase NiTi prepared by capsule-free hot isostatic pressing to mitigate Ni leaching and enhance the surface properties. Differential scanning calorimetry thermal analysis, uniaxial compression tests, inductively-coupled plasma <b>mass</b> spectrometry, and <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> reveal that porous NiTi alloys oxidized at 450 °C for 1 h have an austenite transition temperature below 37 °C, excellent superelasticity, lower nickel release, and no cytotoxicity. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Simulation {{consists of a}} clinostatically-rotated <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> system. The system is a horizontally-rotated cylinder completely filled with culture medium. Low speed rotation results in continuous-fall of the cells through the fluid medium. In this setting, cells: 1) aggregate, 2) propagate in three dimensions, 3) synthesize matrix, 4) differentiate, and 5) form sinusoids that facilitate <b>mass</b> transfer. Space <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> is conducted in flight bioreactors and in static incubators. Cells grown in microgravity are: bovine cartilage, promyelocytic leukemia, kidney proximal tubule cells, adrenal medulla, breast and colon cancer, and endothelium. Cells were cultured in space to test specific hypotheses. Cartilage cells {{were used to determine}} structural differences in cartilage grown in space compared to ground-based bioreactors. Results from a 130 -day experiment on Mir revealed that cartilage grown in space was substantially more compressible due to insufficient glycosaminoglycan in the matrix. Interestingly, earth-grown cartilage conformed better to the dimensions of the scaffolding material, while the Mir specimens were spherical. The other cell populations are currently being analyzed for cell surface properties, gene expression, and differentiation. Results suggest that some cells spontaneously differentiate in microgravity. Additionally, vast changes in gene expression may occur in response to microgravity. In conclusion, the transition to microgravity may constitute a physical perturbation in cells resulting in unique gene expressions, the consequences of which may be useful in tissue engineering, disease modeling, and space cell biology...|$|R
30|$|To prevent {{limonene}} volatilizing and {{to extract}} {{it from the}} culture medium, a two-phase culture system composed of n-hexadecane was adopted in this study. Hexadecane was chosen for its high hydrophobicity (log PO/W, 8.8) for the extraction of limonene, and low volatility, which prevents loss due to evaporation. A ratio of 1 / 50 (Vorg/Vaq, 2  mL of hexadecane was layered over 100  mL of culture broth) was adopted in this two-phase culture system. Limonene was extracted into the hexadecane phase, and negligible amounts of limonene were detected in the <b>cell</b> <b>mass</b> and <b>culture</b> broth (data not shown). As a result, limonene production was measured only from the hexadecane phase.

This {{study was conducted to}} design and establish industrial platform for high cell density cultivation of this novel probiotic strain, L. lactis (WICC-B 25). During bioreactor cultivation of lactic acid bacteria in industrial scale, there are two main problems during process namely: low cell growth rate and high lactate production. These both together resulted in low <b>cell</b> <b>mass</b> production. Therefore, this study was focused on cultivation parameters optimization for high <b>cell</b> <b>mass</b> production with minimal lactate formation in shake flask and bioreactor levels. Cell growth was studied in 16 -L stirred tank bioreactor under controlled and uncontrolled pH conditions. The maximal <b>cell</b> <b>mass</b> of about 5. 6 g L- 1 was obtained after 14 h cultivations under uncontrolled pH condition. This value was almost 35 % higher than those <b>cell</b> <b>mass</b> obtained in pH controlled culture. Based on this data, fed-batch cultivation strategy was developed using mixed substrate feeding solution (containing all medium component) and mono-feeding (using glucose alone). For both cultures, fed was adjusted to constant rate of 3 g L- 1 h- 1 and, DO was cascaded to agitation speed to prevent the drop of DO to value less than 30 % saturation as oxygen is limited factor for high <b>cell</b> <b>mass</b> production. <b>Culture</b> of mono-glucose feeding yielded the maximal <b>cell</b> <b>mass</b> of about 20 g L- 1 after 30 h. On the other hand, the <b>cell</b> <b>mass</b> obtained in mixed substrate feeding culture was only 8. 4 g L- 1.

40|$|AbstractCulture {{of cells}} using various {{microfluidic}} devices {{is becoming more}} common within experimental cell biology. At the same time, a technological radiation of microfluidic <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> device designs is currently in progress. Ultimately, the utility of microfluidic <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> {{will be determined by}} its capacity to permit new insights into cellular function. Especially insights that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain with macroscopic <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> in traditional polystyrene dishes, flasks or well-plates. Many decades of heuristic optimization have gone into perfecting conventional <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> devices and protocols. In comparison, even for the most commonly used microfluidic <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> devices, such as those fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), collective understanding of the differences in cellular behavior between microfluidic and macroscopic culture is still developing. Moving in vitro culture from macroscopic culture to PDMS based devices can come with unforeseen challenges. Changes in device material, surface coating, cell number per unit surface area or per unit media volume may all affect the outcome of otherwise standard protocols. In this review, we outline some of the advantages and challenges that may accompany a transition from macroscopic to microfluidic <b>cell</b> <b>culture.</b> We focus on decisive factors that distinguish macroscopic from microfluidic <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> to encourage a reconsideration of how macroscopic <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> principles might apply to microfluidic <b>cell</b> <b>culture...</b>|$|R
40|$|Screening of {{therapeutics}} {{relies on}} representative cancer models. The representation of human glioblastoma by in vitro <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> models is questionable. We obtained genomic profiles by array comparative genomic hybridization of both short-and long-term primary <b>cell</b> and spheroid <b>cultures,</b> derived from seven glioblastomas and one anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Chromosomal copy numbers were compared between <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> and spheroids {{and related to}} the parental gliomas using unsupervised hierarchical clustering and correlation coefficient. In seven out of eight short-term <b>cell</b> <b>cultures,</b> the genomic profiles clustered further apart from their parental tumors than spheroid cultures. In four out of eight samples, the genetic changes in <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> were substantial. T he average correlation coefficient between parental tumors and spheroid profiles was 0. 89 (range: 0. 79 - 0. 97), whereas that between parental tumors and <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> was 0. 62 (range: 0. 10 - 0. 96). In {{two out of three}} long-term <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> progressive genetic changes had developed, whereas the spheroid cultures were genetically stable. It is concluded that genomic profiles of primary <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> from glioblastoma are frequently deviant from parental tumor profiles, whereas spheroids are genetically more representative of the glioblastoma. This implies that glioma <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> data have to be handled with the highest cautio...|$|R
