40|$|How do {{minority}} {{regions in}} <b>multi-national</b> <b>states</b> respond to immigration? Do they use regional policy-making competencies {{to foster the}} inclusion of immigrants, or to tighten the boundaries of belonging exclusively around the minority? This paper answers these questions through {{a comparison of the}} immigrant integration laws of Catalonia (Spain) and South Tyrol (Italy). Qualitative content analysis of the laws shows that both regions place most emphasis on helping immigrants to become equal members of the society in the socio-economic dimension. Only the South Tyrolean law then adds also some restrictions. By contrast, South Tyrol is more flexible when it comes to cultural integration granting immigrants free choice of whether to integrate into the German or the Italian language, or both, while the Catalan law prioritises integration into Catalan culture. The paper links these differences to the dominant political dividing lines in regional party competition before the adoption of each law...|$|R

2500|$|The 1919 {{treaties}} generally included {{guarantees of}} minority rights, {{but there was}} no enforcement mechanism. [...] The new states of eastern Europe mostly all had large ethnic minorities. Millions of Germans found themselves in the newly created countries as minorities. More than two million ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside of Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. Many of these national minorities found themselves in hostile situations because the modern governments were intent on defining the national character of the countries, often {{at the expense of the}} other nationalities. [...] The interwar years were hard for religious minorities in the new states built around ethnic nationalism. The Jews were especially distrusted because of their minority religion and distinct subculture. [...] This was a dramatic come-down from the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Although antisemitism had been widespread during Habsburg rule, Jews faced no official discrimination because they were, for the most part, ardent supporters of the <b>multi-national</b> <b>state</b> and the monarchy.|$|E

40|$|This {{special issue}} studies the {{strategic}} interaction between major state-wide and regional parties {{in a political}} setting defined by multiple, potentially cross-cutting, political issues pertaining {{to the economy and}} the territorial organization of <b>multi-national</b> <b>states.</b> Through this framework, this special issue locates itself decisively in the behaviorist tradition of studying political competition. Stemming from the classical works of Riker and the Rochester school, and focusing on rational choice models, this tradition has influenced a lively literature on party strategies. This concluding article of the special issue argues that the findings of the substantive contributions create a bridge between the strategic, Rikerian literature they stem from and seek to engage with, and more sociological approaches to the study of political parties that focus on the structural features of politics reaching back to the works of Lipset and Rokkan. I suggest that, ultimately, this special issue demonstrates the socially, historically, and institutionally bounded opportunities of political parties. Fundamentally, the special issue makes a significant contribution to the strategic literature by suggesting structural limits to strategic behavior...|$|R

40|$|How {{does the}} {{international}} community understand and apply the right of self-determination? Who holds this right: individuals, peoples, nations, states, ethnicities, minorities, majorities? What limits are there to the exercise of this right and which claims are ‘valid’ and which are not? This thesis addresses these issues as it seeks, above all, {{to answer the question}} of when, why and in what ways {{the international community}}’s understanding of and normative responses to self-determination have evolved. To do so, Part I explores critically the theories and history of nationalism, human rights, sovereignty and self-determination to explain the challenges of ‘emerging nationalism’ (defined herein as nationalism within established <b>multi-national</b> <b>states</b> aimed at altering the constitutional and/or social standing of the nation vis-à-vis the larger political entity). This part identifies the genesis of the interconnected ideas of identity, human rights, and sovereignty and begins to trace the evolution of the norm of self-determination over time as it has been conceived and employed by international society. It suggests new approaches to these concepts based within the liberal democratic tradition, which are, arguably, more philosophically coherent than other explanations for self-determination. Part II assesses international normative responses to state fragmentation and national liberation prior {{to the end of the}} Cold War to determine how much they have resembled the interpretation of national self-determination suggested in Part I, contending that the conceptual evolution of selfdetermination can only be interpreted accurately by understanding the parallel evolution and development of international society. Part III examines the evolution of self-determination and emerging nationalism in the post-Cold War era, asking whether the norms generated by the present-day society of states are consistent with the theoretical and historical observations made earlier. The recent case of Kosovo is examined in detail as it best suggests the present trajectory of international norms and responses to emerging nationalism...|$|R

Lithuania therefore offers a notable example of peaceful transition, all the more impressive in the light of the bloody conflict elsewhere in the former Soviet Union or Yugoslavia, where the aspirations to independence of the constituent republics were either violently resisted or dissolved into inter-ethnic violence.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 90 s, {{managers}} in Eastern Europe {{have had to}} adjust to the consequences of large scale re-structuring from a command to a market economy. Building on a previous paper accepted by the journal which examined shifts in HRM during transitional times, this study exaines the evolution of management cultures in one EE country- Romania. During the Communist period, Romania experienced a highly centralised and hierarchical system of economic management which tightly constrained the roles of the individual managers within it. At the enterprise level, the operational activities of managers were largely concerned with fulfilling the targets of planners laid down from above. Broader currents of historical and political culture also served to inculcate values of bureaucratic formalism and conformity among the cadres of managers. However, with the fall of Communism and fundamental system change (marketisation, privatisation etc), the post- command system forced managers to acquire new skills, knowledge and attitudes. As a consequence, it appears that the management role and identities are being re-defined and management cultures are changing. This article seeks to understand these cultural movements by examining management experience in a number of organisations- <b>multi-national</b> subsidiaries, <b>state</b> owned enterprises, public service organisations, charities and newly established companies- based in Romania...|$|R
