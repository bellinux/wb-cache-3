5|$|Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), a {{biomedical}} engineer from Lake Zurich, Illinois, is {{aboard the}} NASA Space Shuttle Explorer {{for her first}} space mission, STS-157. Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney) is commanding his final mission. During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of debris in space. <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re-entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the Shuttle. Communication with <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> is lost shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, several {{fundamental}} {{changes were made}} to the robot. The control system was reorganized and the <b>mission</b> <b>control</b> software was revamped to improve communication and to limit overhead. A low-level microcontroller-based control system was added to free up system resources. This extra processing capability will be used for <b>mission</b> <b>control</b> and image processing tasks.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} NASA and meet Belt, a {{childhood}} hero of Mulder's. Belt, who now manages the shuttle program, dismisses the agents' concerns and states {{that nothing can}} possibly go wrong with the mission. He allows the agents to watch the launch from <b>Mission</b> <b>Control.</b> The launch is successful. As the agents are leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit.

5|$|In 2001, Kraft {{published}} his autobiography, Flight: My Life in <b>Mission</b> <b>Control.</b> It dealt {{with his life}} up {{until the end of}} the Apollo program, only briefly mentioning his time as center director in the epilogue.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft expected to return to his role in <b>Mission</b> <b>Control.</b> He would have been lead flight director on the first manned Apollo mission (later known as Apollo 1), which was scheduled to launch in early 1967. However, on January 27, 1967, the three crew members were killed in a fire during a countdown test on the pad. At the time of the fire, Kraft was in <b>Mission</b> <b>Control,</b> but under the circumstances there was little he could do. He was asked by Betty Grissom, the widow of astronaut Gus Grissom, {{to be one of the}} pallbearers at Grissom's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
50|$|Later that year, Paul Galeski founded MAVERICK Technologies and {{acquired}} Software Architects, also an Inc. 500 company.

5|$|After {{the ride}} was renovated in 1990, a new space theme was given. The {{story of the}} ride was the {{passengers}} had been to deliver cargo from a suborbital factory to a station in Alaska. Large screen projections, simulated lasers, mist, and recordings {{were added to the}} ride. In the queue, guests would go through three rooms including Rocket Recovery, <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> and Repair Bay. The original entrance to the ride was located next to Troika. During HalloWeekends, the park would change the entrance of Disaster Transport to under the lift hill, leaving the one next to Troika to be used for the Halloween Haunt. For the 2009 season, the entrance was permanently changed to under the lift hill. When the entrance was changed, the Rocket Recovery and <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> rooms were closed, leaving the Repair Bay the only room guests walked through.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft retired as a flight director to concentrate on management and mission planning. In 1972, he became director of the Manned Spacecraft Center (later Johnson Space Center), {{following in the footsteps of}} his mentor Robert R. Gilruth. He held the position until his 1982 retirement from NASA. During his retirement, Kraft has consulted for numerous companies including IBM and Rockwell International, and he published an autobiography entitled Flight: My Life in <b>Mission</b> <b>Control.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gemini was a {{step forward}} for NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule was larger and more {{advanced}} than Mercury, capable of supporting two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four.|$|E

50|$|STS-70 Discovery (July 13-22, 1995) was a 9-day mission {{during which}} the crew {{performed}} a variety of experiments in addition to deploying the sixth and final NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite. The mission was completed in 142 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.7 million miles in 214 hours, 20 minutes. STS-70 was the first <b>mission</b> <b>controlled</b> from the new combined control center.|$|R
5000|$|STS-70 {{launched}} from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 13, 1995, and returned there July 22, 1995.

STS-70, with an [...] "all-Ohio" [...] crew, was the first <b>mission</b> <b>controlled</b> from the new combined control center.|$|R
5|$|Lunney worked backup on Gemini 3, {{taking charge}} of the newly {{established}} <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> Center in Houston, {{at a time when}} flights were still controlled from Cape Canaveral in Florida. On Gemini 4, he again was working backup, this time in Florida, supporting the first mission that was controlled entirely from Houston. After spending some time on unmanned testing for the Apollo program, he returned to work as a flight director on Gemini 9, 10, 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston {{is home to}} the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> Center, {{where all}} flight control is managed for manned space missions.

5|$|On Christmas Eve, 1968, Apollo 8 {{went into}} {{orbit around the}} moon. Only ten years earlier, Kraft had joined Gilruth's newly founded Space Task Group. Now, the two men sat {{together}} in <b>Mission</b> <b>Control,</b> reflecting on how far they had come. Around them, the room was filled with cheers, but Kraft and Gilruth celebrated more quietly.|$|E

5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much, particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were anxious for the {{president}} to appear to be recovering quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked two hours a day in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead of the Oval Office. Reagan did not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought recovery was not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit <b>Mission</b> <b>Control</b> during STS-2 that November.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at <b>Mission</b> <b>Control,</b> {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E
