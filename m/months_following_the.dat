5|$|As combat {{operations}} quickly revealed, {{the two sides}} were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it in the <b>months</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations {{and the need to}} replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E
5|$|As president-elect, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the <b>months</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to {{the frustration of}} his fellow Whigs.

5|$|In Thailand, however, {{substantial}} {{efforts to}} prevent further such occurrences had not materialized in the <b>months</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> accident. Labour activists, trade unions and workers were lobbying {{for the creation of}} an independent occupational health and safety institute.

Leaves of Grass was revised and re-released in 1860 again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.|$|E

5|$|King's Highway140, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway140, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The highway connects Port Colborne near Lake Erie with Highway406 in Welland, via the Main Street Tunnel. It was constructed in the early 1970s as part of the Welland Bypass project of the Welland Canal, which resulted in the severance of several highways and rail lines. Opened to traffic in late 1972, several <b>months</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> tunnel, Highway140 has remained unchanged since, despite growing calls to resign it as an extension of Highway406.|$|E
