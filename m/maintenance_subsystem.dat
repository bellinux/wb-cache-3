40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Holistic Knowledge Management System design {{which is based}} on culture, behavioural and ontology approach that addresses the need to support a better management of the tacit and explicit knowledge, learning processes, knowledge creation, sharing and transfer; and continuous learning. The Cultural Behaviour concept models some characteristics of users interacting with a knowledge management system and acknowledges the behaviour of users in the system that can be associated with incentives so that users are willing to share their knowledge and be active in the system. The framework designed focuses on three features, i. e. the cultural behaviour of people in the organization, incentives system and technical system. Detailed analysis was conducted on the cultural behavioural perspectives of users based on existing cultural practiced in the organization and factors that can motivate staff to share knowledge through the KM system was also looked at. Based on the analysis performed, it was discovered that the behaviour of KM users may be influenced by the technical system. From the technical system, the behaviour of users can be identified and the system rewards a form of incentive to staff that share knowledge. The methodology in developing this system involves identifying KM initiatives towards developing methodologies to convert tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge that can be codified, captured, stored, transmitted, used and be acted on by others. The knowledge system architecture proposed gives emphasis on the three main components namely the people, process and technology. The architecture designed had focused on the interaction between employees in the organisation through the use of the platform provided in the Internal Generated Repository (IGR), and the User Profile Editor; knowledge warehouse (External Knowledge Acquisition and Environmental Scanning) that enables access to internal and external repositories, infrastructure provided and the enabling environment (Knowledge <b>Maintenance</b> <b>subsystem</b> and Knowledge Manipulation...|$|E

Dramatic recent increases in youth crime and delinquency have stimulated numerous programmatic efforts by units of government to devise techniques for the control or diminution of those phenomena. Youth services bureaus are one of the kinds of organizations that were created under the provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to combat juvenile delinquency. They are community-based agencies whose purpose [...] treatment of delinquents [...] as an alternative to involvement in the juvenile justice system is in accord with the so-called "medical model. " The youth services bureau model has as a goal the identification of the needs of youths who are involved in anti-social activities and the utilization of community resources in the service of rehabilitation for such youths. In order to accomplish that goal youth services bureaus might utilize the help of existing youth-serving agencies, or, where needed services are not available, the bureaus might provide them. This field study was concerned with the initiation, the growth and the development of Omni-House, a youth services bureau that is located in Wheeling, Illinois. That organization provides services for six communities in the north-west suburban area of Chicago. The conceptual framework that was developed for this case study consisted of a cubistic model that was based upon the literature of sociology, political science and systems analysis. Using the five subsystems of an organizational systems model, and analysis of each of the stages of organizational growth was completed. Five subsystems, interacting with two measures of the investment of energy within the organization, yielded a matrix for each of three stages of organizational growth and development. The measures of energy expended by the organization included the amount in dollars allocated to each subsystem and the number of staff-day equivalents allocated to each subsystem. Those ten characteristics of organizational growth and development (i. e., five organizational subsystems, two specifications of the internal allocation of organizational energy, and three stages of growth) were combined into a cubistic model for use in this field study research in the description of the growth and development of Omni-House: Youth Services Bureau. The three growth stages include an initiation stage, an operational stage and an organizational maturity stage. The five subsystems are as follows: a production subsystem which produces the services that are the reason for the existence of the agency; the boundary-spanning subsystem, which described activities that are performed within the boundaries of the organization but which serve to link it with the outside world; the <b>maintenance</b> <b>subsystem,</b> which consists of organizational activities which attempt to smooth out the operation of the other subsystems and to conduct the support functions for agency operations; the managerial subsystem, which includes the use of authority to control, to coordinate and to direct the activities of the organization; and the adaptive subsystem, which monitors the environment with regard to the functioning of the agency and provides information for the agency with regard to the need for changes. Eight conclusions were reported, based upon the study of Omni-House. In addition, a number of statements of additional research questions were presented in connection with six of the conclusions. Several suggestions were also made for the modification of the cubistic model. Those suggestions included the following: that an additional subsystem, concerned with the activities of the agency's board of directors, be added; that the name of the production subsystem be changed for studies of organizations of this type to services subsystem; that two additional stages of growth and development (a stage of dissonance, and a stage of decline and disorganization) be added...|$|E

Thus, considering the necessity of promoting multiculturalism in society, the particularities of indigenous peoples should be considered in the elaboration of public policies, {{as well as in the}} <b>maintenance</b> of health <b>subsystem.</b> By respecting differences, you can reframe the concept of citizenship, unlinking the meaning of binomial citizen / nation-State, in order to allow the construction of a differentiated citizenship to indigenous peoples, thus justifying the formulation of public policies that respect and consider the particularities of these communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{seas and}} oceans are an {{intrinsic}} {{part of the}} earth and climate systems. They cover 70 % of our planet, provide 95 % by volume of its biosphere, support more than 50 % of global primary production and harbour an enormous diversity of life adapted to extremely broad-ranging environmental conditions. The oceans are a driver of our climate but are also affected by climate change and ocean acidification. They are under increasing pressure from human activities and pollution, and growing coastal populations. The combination of natural and human-induced changes taking place in our seas and oceans including, for example, rising temperatures, the melting of Arctic sea ice, ocean acidification, increasingly extreme weather events, transfer of non-indigenous marine species, changes in biodiversity and species distribution, and depletion of fisheries stocks, may have potentially profound impacts on our societies and economies in the medium-term. European research focused on the seas and oceans is central to addressing these challenges by delivering knowledge and tools to enable Europe to prepare for, and adapt to, these changes. Moreover The growth of new and existing industries such as marine renewable energy, marine biotechnology, fisheries and aquaculture and sustainable maritime transport must be supported by research and innovation, involving a range of actors to develop technologies and best practices in support of a thriving European maritime economy. A key issue is how will society be placed in the coming decades to tackle these threats and turn challenges into opportunities? The Rio Ocean declaration (16 June 2012) called for an “integrated approach addressing the interlinked issues of oceans, climate change, and security” and for countries to “Establish the scientific capacity for marine environmental assessment, monitoring, and prediction, including the implementation of……the global ocean observing system”. Routine and sustained ocean observations are crucial to further our understanding of the complex and vast oceanic environment and to supply scientific data and analyses sufficient to meet society’s needs. In particular for the coastal environment, needs are even higher as the natural variability is interlinked with the human induced and efforts to identify and distinguish the various components are crucial. Furthermore most economic activity is based at the coastal ocean. Europe spends € 1. 4 billion p. a. for marine data collection: € 0. 4 billion for satellite data and € 1. 0 billion for insitu observations, respectively. In the case of the latter, the traditional and expensive practice of vessel-based data-gathering is progressively giving way to monitoring via “observatories” - complexes of distributed, autonomous, real-time sensor systems. Burgeoning technology and pressing societal needs will soon make such observatories the backbone of European marine observing activity because of their ability to provide copious quantities of diversified data over large areas at reasonable costs. Around European coastal seas, the number of marine observing systems is quickly increasing under the pressure of both monitoring requirements and oceanographic research. Present demands for such systems include reliable, high-quality and comprehensive observations, automated platforms and sensors systems, as well as autonomy over long time periods. In-situ data collected, combined with remote sensing and models output, contribute to detect, understand and forecast the most crucial coastal processes over extensive areas within the various national and regional marine environments. Coastal observations {{are an important part of}} the marine research puzzle of activities and applications. However significant heterogeneity exists in Europe concerning technological design of observing systems, measured parameters, practices for maintenance and quality control, as well as quality standards for sensors and data exchange. Coastal observatories have been developed in Europe in a rather uncoordinated way. Usually based on national funding and priorities these observatories have very diverse design and architecture and have established very different practices for their operation and <b>maintenance.</b> For certain <b>subsystems</b> (e. g. FerryBox) past EU projects have established a network of operators through which experience and best practices have been shared but this is not the case for other observing platforms, and certainly not for integrated coastal observatories. Considering the importance of observing systems and the substantial investment made until now, an important task of JERICO is to describe best practices in all phases of the system (pre-deployment test, maintenance, calibration etc); to adopt common methodologies and protocols and to move towards the harmonisation of equipment which will help in reducing maintenance and calibration costs. These efforts are described and analysed in depth in this deliverable...|$|R
