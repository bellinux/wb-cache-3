It proposed an innovative {{application of a}} revolutionary new technology that could transform the way we produce and dispose of textiles. Each sample represents a different fabric finish {{that can be achieved}} with this process without the addition of any further materials or added chemicals. This preserves the textile as a <b>monomaterial,</b> unlike traditional techniques, and therefore it is fully recyclable at end of its life...|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} FGM was first {{considered}} in Japan in 1984 during a space plane project. Where {{a combination of}} materials used would serve {{the purpose of a}} thermal barrier capable of withstanding a surface temperature of 2000 K and a temperature gradient of 1000 k across a 10 mm section. In recent years this concept has become more popular in Europe, particularly in Germany. A transregional collaborative research center (SFB Transregio) is funded since 2006 in order to exploit the potential of grading <b>monomaterials,</b> such as steel, aluminium and polypropylen, by using thermomechanically coupled manufacturing processes.|$|R
40|$|For the {{recycling}} of carpet and artificial turf the latex backing {{is often a}} real stumble block. Many strategies have been developed like freezing the carpet, followed by grinding and subsequent separation of the milled particles. Once it has been separated from its backing materials, PA 6 {{is relatively easy to}} depolymerise. This produces fresh caprolactam {{that can be used to}} manufacture PA 6 with no loss in quality, and is suitable for further recycling [1]. The comparable process for PA 6, 6 is not as easy, but DuPont and Polyamid 2000 have developed and patented a process that depolymerises any mixture of PA 6 and 6, 6 using ammonia. The result is fresh caprolactam and 1, 6 diaminohexane for manufacture of PA 6 and 6, 6 respectively [2]. Obviously a lot of research has been devoted to avoiding latex as a backing like e. g. polyurethane carpet backing systems based on natural oil polyols and polymer polyols [4]. Still carboxylated styrene butadiene is the leading synthetic latex polymer used in EU- 27 for carpet backing, followed by styrene-acrylics and pure acrylics. This contrasts with Eastern Europe, Russia, and Turkey where styrene-acrylics dominate, followed by PVAc and redispersible powders [3]. In addition there has been a lot of research into developing alternative backing systems where the backing can easily be removed. Examples are the use of gecko technology [5] or using click chemistry (reversible Diels Alder reactions) [6]. But the best option for recycling is of course to develop carpets based completely on <b>monomaterials.</b>   Paper for the 14 th Autex World Textile Conference May 26 th- 28 th 2014, Bursa, Turkey...|$|R

First high purity submicron powders of <b>monomaterials</b> of alumina, spinel and zirconia were pressed at 100 to 250 MPa {{with different}} dry pressing techniques like UP (uniaxial pressing) and CIP (cold isostatic pressing). The latter {{was found to}} provide higher green densities. Before co-sintering of bi-materials, sintering behaviors of their end-members were studied by vertical dilatometer to determine the degree of shrinkage mismatches between the end-members. The effects of precoarsening and two-step sintering on the densification and microstructure of spinel ceramics were tested. Samples were etched both chemically and thermally to better understand their structure. Crack-free bonds were observed in alumina-spinel bi-materials after compaction by UP+CIP. Interfaces between alumina and spinel after treatment at 1400 - 1500 C were investigated by SEM, EDS, WDS, EBSD. A spinel interlayer with columnar grains of up to 40. m length and 5. m width was observed after 16 hours at 1500 C. Growth rate of this interlayer from spinel toward alumina was found to follow parabolic kinetics, controlled by a diffusion mechanism of probably lattice diffusion of O 2 - ions. Two isothermal steps co-sintering at 1400 C and 1500 C on the interlayer formation was tested. Two separate areas formed in the interlayer spinel. Diffusion couple tests of spinel and alumina produced the same columnar spinel grains at the interface with the same kinetics as in co-sintering experiments. Phase boundaries between the columnar spinel and alumina grains had a characteristic center of curvature located in alumina which was further indication of the direction of growth of the interlayer...|$|R

40|$|Plastic {{materials}} recovery and recycling is assuming growing relevance in industrialized countries. The main problem in plastics recovery and recycling {{is related to}} the variety of plastic waste, even if a selective collection occurs. Therefore, plastic materials can be recycled either as mixtures or as single kinds, separating the different typologies by physical (size, specific mass, etc.) and/or chemical properties. However, separation of plastics in single typologies by traditional processes and devices is difficult due to their typical low variability in properties. This work focuses on the set up of the so called "Multidune" separator, a hydraulic separator, whose particular profile determines differential transport of particles of low specific mass, near to 1 g/cm 3, allowing their separation. The experimental set-up has been designed to investigate the solid transport phenomena settled in the apparatus. Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) was employed to reconstruct tracer particle trajectories to compute the velocity field. Preliminary tests on <b>monomaterial</b> samples have been performed, choosing several operative parameters of the Multidune separator, to determine the best operative conditions. Therefore, separation tests have been executed on composite samples, obtaining satisfactory results in terms of plastic separation feasibility...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} performed on a pilot building from Gainesti, Suceava county. The constructive system used is unique in that it employs a <b>monomaterial,</b> namely ecological concrete of type MOPATEL® or ECOPIERRA®. These types of concrete, created by eng. Petrache Teleman, possess international patents and have received awards in Brussels, {{but they are not}} yet used in Romania. These materials can be used integrally to make all the constructive elements of a building – load-bearing elements (floors, beams, pillars, walls) as well as the secondary elements of a partly finished building, such as screeds or non-load-bearing masonry. The constructive system also uses ecological mortars which integrally ensure the interior and exterior finishing. The final result is a building practically made from a single type of material, in which the effect of thermal bridges is reduced to a maximum. The MOPATEL and ECOPIERRA types of concrete have a mechanical resistance similar to regular concrete, but they also have superior thermal insulation qualities (between 0. 09 and 0. 28 W/mK), they are permeable to the transfer of water vapours from the interior to the exterior of the building, and, in certain compositions, they can also be considered waterproof...|$|E
40|$|For {{semimetal}} nanowires with diameters {{smaller than}} a few tens of nanometers, a semimetal-to-semiconductor transition is observed as {{the emergence of an}} energy band gap resulting from quantum confinement. Quantum confinement in a semimetal results in either lifting of the degeneracy of the conduction and valence bands in a zero gap semimetal, or shifting of bands with a negative energy overlap to form conduction and valence bands. For semimetal nanowires with diameters below 10 nanometer, the magnitude of the band gap can become significantly larger than the thermal energy at room temperature resulting in a new class of semiconductors relevant for nanoelectronics with critical dimensions on the order of a few atomic lengths. The smaller a nanowire's diameter, the larger its surface-to-volume ratio thus leading to an increasing impact of surface chemistry on its electronic structure. Energy level shifts to states {{in the vicinity of the}} Fermi level due to the electronegativity of surface terminating species are shown to be comparable in magnitude to quantum confinement effects at nanowire diameters of a few nanometer; these two effects can be used to counteract one another leading to semimetallic behavior for nanowire cross sections at which the quantum confinement effect would otherwise dominate. Abruptly changing the surface terminating species along the length of a nanowire leads to an abrupt change in the surface electronegativity. This can result in the formation of a semimetal-semiconductor junction within a <b>monomaterial</b> nanowire, without the need for impurity doping nor requiring the formation of a heterojunction...|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{recycling}} {{is the process}} of recovering scrap or waste plastics and reprocessing the material into useful products that sometimes differ completely in form from their original state. An important issue in plastic recovery and {{recycling is}} that plastic waste usually contains a variety of plastics that differ in their physical and chemical properties. Separation of recovered plastics into distinct classes is a fundamental prerequisite for their use as secondary raw materials. The Multidune separator is a hydraulic channel that permits solid particle sorting on the basis of differential transport mechanisms. Steady flow conditions are established within the apparatus. An image analysis technique was employed to reconstruct the trajectories of tracer particles within the fluid and to determine the evolution of the velocity field with time. Pollen and plastic particles Were used as tracers. Unlike plastic particles, pollen is expected to passively follow the fluid flow field. Tests on <b>monomaterial</b> and composite samples were conducted while varying the operative conditions, and comparisons were made. The presence of three different recirculation areas occurred regardless of the hydraulic head at the Multidune inlet except for the first and last chambers. The lower recirculation zone is larger than the upper recirculation zone because of geometrical constraints. With variation in the hydraulic head, the geometry of the inner structures does not change appreciably. if a plastic particle within the principal transport path interacts with the lower recirculation area and its physical characteristics (density and dimensions) are such that it remains trapped, the separation process is successful. Because of its smaller dimensions and the reduced value of its velocity field, the upper recirculation area is relatively ineffective in the separation process...|$|E
40|$|Recycling {{of plastic}} {{materials}} is a rapidly developing discipline because of environmental awareness, {{the need to}} conserve materials and energy, and the growing demand to increase the production economy. The main problem in plastics recovery and recycling {{is related to the}} variety of plastic wastes, even if selective collection occurs. Therefore, plastic materials call be recycled either as mixtures or as single types, separating the different typologies by their physical (size, specific mass, etc.) and/or chemical properties. However, separation of plastics in single typologies by traditional processes and devices is difficult due to their typical low variability in properties. This paper presents a new research development for recycling industry: the Multidune separator. This is a device constructed from a sequence of parallel semi-cylindrical tubes of transparent plastic welded together in a plane. The lower half is shifted laterally and then fixed relative to the upper half. Flow is then induced in the lateral direction normal to the axis of the tubes, creating a main flow channel 3 and two recirculation zones. This apparatus creates a differential transport of particles of low specific mass, near to 1 g/cm(3), allowing their separation. The flow field in the Multidune separator is studied via Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV). Eulerian analysis of the data is performed to gather information about the fluid-dynamics features established by different hydraulic heads at the inlet of the Multidune. Preliminary tests on <b>monomaterial</b> samples have been performed, varying several operative parameters to determine the best set of values. Therefore, separation tests have been executed oil composite samples, obtaining satisfactory results in terms of plastic separation feasibility. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|My {{research}} into {{the development of new}} finishing processes for fully closed-loop textiles included a period of intense experimentation during 2008 with a new laser-welding technology, based at TWI Cambridge. As a textile designer who trained in print-making, my aim was to produce new aesthetic surface qualities through controlled laser-manipulation, while my interest in sustainable innovation required me to preserve the <b>monomaterial</b> nature of the textile and so its recyclability. Many traditional finishing processes fail to achieve both. The approach was a practice-based ‘craft approach’ to exploring the technology, and tacit knowledge was developed though hands-on interaction with the materials over time. Periods of ‘problem seeking and solving‘ evolved through intuitive and reflective decision making. Scrivener (2002) writes; ‘If we are to give greater attention to the process of creative production, then this should focus on the recording and reporting of these moments of reflection, including intended and unintended consequences and responses to them. ’ In this case the systematic recording of making and reflection emerged as a visualisation and mapping process. Methods were developed from standard creative record-keeping such as a ‘technical sketchbook’, while other aspects derived more from an increasing understanding of research methodology and mapping. This visual response to and communication of the process of making alongside the making itself was key to moving the work forward and clarifying both the problem and the solution. The techniques developed during this project have led to numerous further explorations of the technology and an evolving understanding of how it could be the basis for developing a new vision for 21 st century digital production which places materiality and aesthetics alongside sustainability and invention. This paper will explore the opportunities for intuitive craft methods to offer a meaningful contribution to such developing technologies...|$|E
40|$|By {{stitching}} {{second hand}} garments together – an old H&M sundress {{with a home}} made Shanghai shirt – these pieces reflect upon the need for us to consider the disconnect that exists between {{the people in the}} supply chain. The H&M Buying Office staff I worked with in Stockholm are very much removed from the decisions made by staff in the Production Offices in China. Sustainability concerns often exist within large fashion companies but the organisational infrastructure may prevent change taking place at the speed that is required. For these pieces I continued to explore the upcycling of polyester shirts and exhaust transfer printing - here using over-printing and stitch to create a quilted jacket full of symbolism and messages for a young Swedish consumer, inspired by the Hundred Family Jacket. The design of dragons, horses and flowers has been hand drawn and painted, fusing visual research from Dong Hua Museum in Shanghai, the Ming Dynasty artifacts at the British Museum in London and folk textiles from museums in Stockholm. Isabel Dodd stitched into the first print design to bind the <b>monomaterial</b> fabric layers together, making the sculptural garment warmer, more durable and adding more decorative surface detailing inside and out (Shanghai Shirt, Earley & Dodd, 2014). I wanted to turn the simple, inexpensive yellow Shanghai shirt into something of much higher value, and potentially imbue it with greater meaning, significance and emotional durability for the owner. The second paper print went onto a subsequent item - a crepe jacket - and produced a paler, more faded effect. Karen Spurgin then hand stitched into the jacket, using naturally dyes threads. She also stitched into the hand painted papers, creating beautiful artworks from the 'waste' created in the print process...|$|E
