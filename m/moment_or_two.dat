500|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} [...] "Counterfeit", Gutierrez wrote that [...] "...despite {{the fact that}} the having an exact twin of Tessa's pop up is flatly ludicrous, it plays out due to MacLeod's desire to have Tessa back {{overriding}} his sense of reason. (...) Vandernoot likes the Tessa character quite a bit and gave me the impression she was sad to see her go," [...] and that she [...] "...looks like she enjoys playing the good/bad Lisa. Her triple performance as Tessa shows Vandernoot's range." [...] Kathie Huddleston of Scifi.com felt that [...] "...a visit from Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit", even an evil Tessa look-alike, is a welcome nod to a significant character from the first season, and it gave our boy Duncan a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> to reflect on his recent lost love." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Clayson approves of {{the more}} [...] "understated {{production}} aesthetic" [...] next to what he views as an at-times [...] "bloated" [...] sound found elsewhere on All Things Must Pass. Simon Leng also acknowledges Harrison's success in [...] "temper Phil Spector's taste for the extreme" [...] and describes [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] {{as one of its}} composer's [...] "more attractive" [...] songs, with a fine lead vocal. [...] " [...] is refreshing to hear Harrison singing about another's pain," [...] Leng adds, [...] "suggesting that, unlike some of his contemporaries, he was able to displace himself as the center of his universe for a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> at least." [...] In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams identifies [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] as an example of [...] "how sympathetic to the performer" [...] Spector could be as a producer, in this case, by giving the recording a [...] "mellow, autumnal mix" [...] that [...] "beautifully display" [...] Drake's pedal steel.|$|E
500|$|Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising Thompson and Kendrick's {{performances}} and the film's honesty and plausibility. He suspected that [...] "a lot {{of high school}} students will recognize elements of real life in the movie." [...] Bruce Feld of Film Journal International agreed, calling the film a [...] "dead-on revelation of what high school is really like". Variety magazine's Justin Chang thought that Blitz displayed a [...] "terrific ability to embrace people's idiosyncrasies, real or fictitious" [...] and called the cast a [...] "strong ensemble", commending Thompson, Kendrick and D'Agosto in particular. The San Francisco Chronicles Peter Hartlaub thought that the script [...] "never fails to present an unexpected scenario– usually accompanied by a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of hilarity", but felt that Hal's ultimate failure was anticlimactic and [...] "frustrating for moviegoers who prefer tidy endings". Stephen Holden, however, writing for The New York Times, believed that the final scenes were a [...] " [...] sign of the movie's integrity". TV Guides Ken Fox similarly admired the more [...] "real" [...] ending, and wrote that the film was [...] "sharp, observant... wonderfully dry". Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Blitz for straying from common stereotypes and [...] "opt for deeper, darker and wittier developments".|$|E
6000|$|... "La!" [...] said Sir Percy, after a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> silence, {{as no one}} offered any comment, [...] "how sheepish you {{all look}} [...] . What's up?" ...|$|R
60|$|Von Ragastein {{paused and}} turned his head. The deep {{breathing}} inside the banda had certainly ceased. He {{rose to his feet}} and, stealing uneasily to the opening, gazed down upon his guest's outstretched form. To all appearance, Dominey still slept deeply. After a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> watch, Von Ragastein returned to his place.|$|R
6000|$|There was a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> tense silence after that, {{and then}} Agatha made a dejected gesture. [...] "He warned {{me that this}} might happen if I went on singing, but what could I do? I couldn't cancel my engagements without telling people why. He said I must go to Norway and give my throat and chest a rest." ...|$|R
60|$|Beamish sat silent a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> {{regarding}} George steadily.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel smoked for a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> in {{thoughtful}} silence.|$|E
60|$|Dalton {{looked up}} sharply, but {{was silent for}} a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{six o'clock}} that evening, Tavernake rang up the Milan Court and inquired for Elizabeth. There was a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> delay {{and then he}} heard her reply. Even over the {{telephone}} wires, even though he stood, cramped and uncomfortable, in that stuffy little telephone booth, he felt the quick start of pleasure, the thrill of something different in life, which came to him always {{at the sound of}} her voice, at the slightest suggestion of her presence.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{spite of}} the power of the Black & Scholes option pricing method, there are {{situations}} in which the hypothesis of a lognormal model is too restrictive. One possibility to deal with this problem, consists of a weaker hypothesis, fixing only successive moments and eventually the mode of the price process of a risky asset, and not the complete distribution. The consequence of this generalization is the fact that the option price is no longer a unique value, but a range of several possible values. We show how to find upper and lower bounds, resulting in a rather narrow range. We give results in case <b>two</b> <b>moments,</b> three <b>moments,</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>moments</b> and the mode of the underlying price process are fixed...|$|R
60|$|At this <b>moment</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> {{three men}} were heard issuing {{from the door}} of the “Bold Dragoon,” and among them the voice of Billy Kirby.|$|R
60|$|For a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> Tommy's indignation got {{the better}} of him.|$|E
60|$|Hardy {{brushed his}} master's hat for a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> in silence.|$|E
60|$|Hawtrey {{was clearly}} startled, {{but in a}} <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> he smiled.|$|E
50|$|The Silly Song, when present, always {{appears in}} the middle of an episode, usually at a cliffhanger <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> between <b>two</b> {{separate}} segments. The segment either takes place on the familiar countertop which opens and closes most episodes, or is presented in another setting off the countertop. On some videos, the background scenery often appeared as a stage set, behind which electrical outlets and ceramic tile can be seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Saturday night. On Sunday morning I {{was awakened}} by a rushing [...] of water so furious that I fancied the sea must have proved more than [...] a match for the 12-inch armour and 18-inch backing; but a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> [...] <b>two</b> of {{attentive}} reflection relieved me. Your friend Firebrand's [...] voice was audible. I listened. He muttered something, and yawned [...] vociferously, then muttered again--`Splend--propns--a--yi--a--ou!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Millie, old girl," [...] said Ukridge, {{adjusting}} the ginger-beer wire behind {{his ears and}} hoisting up his grey flannel-trousers, which showed an inclination to sag, [...] "you'd better go indoors. I propose to speak pretty chattily to these blighters, and {{in the heat of}} the <b>moment</b> one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> expressions might occur to me which you would not like. It would hamper me, your being here." ...|$|R
60|$|The waiter {{disappeared}} {{and in a}} <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> Julien was served.|$|E
60|$|A <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> {{later she}} was able to finish her pathetic narrative.|$|E
60|$|Big Otter {{looked after}} {{them for a}} <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> in grave silence.|$|E
5000|$|Archbishop Gänswein said: “I {{personally}} can see {{no significant}} reason which would necessitate a {{reform of the}} Curia at the <b>moment.</b> One <b>or</b> <b>two</b> changes have been made but {{that is part of}} the normal run of things. To speak of ‘Curial reform’ is, if I may so, somewhat of an exaggeration.” Asked whether the Vatican and the Church in general are polarised at the moment, he said [...] "There is no polarisation as far as I can see and I haven’t experienced any. Certain measures here and there have been criticised and if the criticism is justified, that can surely benefit the general climate." ...|$|R
60|$|The tap-room {{was almost}} deserted for the <b>moment.</b> In one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> corners {{only a few}} stragglers lingered; they were {{sprawling}} across the tables with arms outstretched. Ignácz Goldstein's silvorium had proved too potent and too plentiful. They lay there in a drunken sleep--logs that were of no account. Presently {{they would have to}} be thrown out, but there was no hurry for that--they were not in the way.|$|R
60|$|Let it be {{observed}} also {{that we have}} hitherto been speaking as if all things were produced under a monopoly. The objection might at once be raised that with competitive producers the price will also keep falling down towards cost {{and will not be}} based upon the point of maximum profit. We shall turn to this objection in a <b>moment.</b> But one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> other points must be considered before doing so.|$|R
60|$|Captain Francis lit a {{cigarette}} and smoked thoughtfully for a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dan {{regarded}} them steadfastly for a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> without winking or flinching.|$|E
60|$|Esmond, {{who made}} no disclaimer, {{appeared}} to reflect for a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "There are a {{whole lot}} of them coming round the other side," [...] he said, [...] "sixty or seventy of them at least. Some {{distance}} behind I can see a lot of cattle and waggons. I suppose they were making for home when they heard the firing." [...] Just at this <b>moment</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three shots rang out, telling that the surviving Boers were seen running down the donga.|$|R
6000|$|Bernard {{was glad}} to have made no promise, and, indeed, Wilfred's {{physical}} condition chiefly occupied him at the <b>moment,</b> for one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of the girls were hurrying in, asking what was the matter, and at the answer, [...] "He is gone up to his room with a bad headache," [...] Valetta declared with satisfaction, [...] "Then he has got it! We told him so! But he would go to the office! and, Bernard, so has Lily." ...|$|R
60|$|Francis, glad of a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> {{solitude}} {{in which}} to rearrange his somewhat distorted sensations, found an empty space in {{the stern of the}} launch and stood leaning over the rail. His pulses were still tingling with the indubitable excitement of the last half-hour. It was all there, even now, before his eyes like a cinematograph picture--the duel between those two men, a duel of knowledge, of strength, of science, of courage. From beginning to end, there had been no moment when Francis had felt that he was looking on at what was in any way a degrading or immoral spectacle. Each man had fought in his way to win. Young Wilmore, graceful as a panther, with a keen, joyous desire of youth for supremacy written in his face and in the dogged lines of his mouth; the budding champion from the East End less graceful, perhaps, but with even more strength and at least as much determination, had certainly done his best to justify his selection. There were no points to be scored. There had been no undue feinting, no holding, few of the tricks of the professional ring. It was a fight to a finish, or until Harrison gave the word. And the better man had won. But even that knock-out blow which Reggie Wilmore had delivered after a wonderful feint, had had little that was cruel in it. There was something beautiful almost in the strength and grace with which it had been delivered--the breathless eagerness, the waiting, the end.|$|R
60|$|Grace {{felt her}} heart beat and {{was silent for a}} <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
60|$|Wyllard started, but {{he stood}} very still {{again for a}} <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
60|$|The man withdrew, and {{returned}} in a <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> {{looking a little}} puzzled.|$|E
6000|$|His way led him {{past the}} [...] "Blue Boar," [...] which at that moment, however, {{proved to be}} no temptation to him. He paused to listen. Sounds of revelry issued from its door, {{and the voice of}} Joe Stubley was heard singing with {{tremendous}} energy--"Britons, never, never, never, shall be slaves," [...] although he and all his companions were at that very <b>moment</b> thoroughly--in one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> cases almost hopelessly--enslaved to the most terrible tyrant that has ever crushed the human race! ...|$|R
60|$|Stanmer came in, {{interrupting}} our talk, {{and looking}} at me, I thought, with a little air of bravado. He must think me indeed a tiresome, meddlesome bore; and upon my word, turning it all over, I wonder at his docility. After all, he's five-and-twenty--and yet I must add, it does irritate me--the way he sticks! He was followed in a <b>moment</b> by <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three of the regular Italians, and I made my visit short.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} about my early hours, and I admit I have been restless. It {{is not a}} {{pleasant}} idea that, but a mile away, there is an army big enough to eat us up; and nothing whatever to prevent their pouncing upon us, at any <b>moment,</b> except <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three batteries. The marshal was saying, last night, he should regard it as the most fortunate escape he ever had, if we drew off safely tonight without being attacked.|$|R
