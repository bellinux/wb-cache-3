50|$|Depending on {{the size}} and {{orientation}} of the mulching head, forestry <b>mulchers</b> can only fell smaller trees. <b>Mulchers</b> with a mulching head that rotates about a vertical axis can typically handle trees up to 6-8 inches in diameter, while <b>mulchers</b> with a mulching head that rotates about a horizontal axis can handle trees up to 30 inches in diameter. Mulching trees at {{the upper end of}} this size range can be dangerous for both the equipment and the operator. Mulching areas with a variety of vegetation and terrain may require multiple pieces of equipment, including tracked mulching machines, excavator <b>mulchers,</b> and skid steer tractors equipped with mulching attachments.|$|R
50|$|Heavy duty {{forestry}} <b>mulchers</b> can {{clear up}} to fifteen acres of vegetation a day depending on terrain, density, {{and type of}} material.

50|$|Clayton Carmine, {{brother of}} Anthony and Benjamin, of the {{previous}} two games, appears in Gears of War 3. Carmine is more competent, witty, and muscular in the third game, with tattoos of his brothers and the reasons they died on his arms (Keep your head down! and Practice reloading!). He was shown wielding a <b>Mulcher</b> machine gun in several released pictures from the game. A vote was held between July 29, 2010 and September 6, 2010 to determine whether Carmine would live or die based on sales of Xbox avatar T-shirts available for purchase on Xbox Live; Epic had developed endings reflecting either choice prior to {{the conclusion of the}} vote. Additionally, actual T-shirts were available from San Diego Comic-Con with all purchases. The voting campaign raised over $150,000, which was all donated to Child's Play.|$|E

5000|$|Over the {{following}} years, the case shifted from Cowan to convicted sex offender Douglas Jackway. Witnesses reported seeing a blue vehicle near {{the location of}} Morcombe's disappearance and Jackway had a vehicle that very closely matched witness descriptions. Cowan was brought before the Daniel Morcombe coronial inquest six years later, where he {{was referred to as}} P7. Cowan stated he had driven along the road where Morcombe was last seen, but he was only travelling along there to pick up a <b>mulcher.</b> He also provided this as an alibi for the missing time, and said he had visited his cannabis dealer during the time Daniel was supposedly taken. Further police investigation revealed that Cowan's dealers were not home during the time Morcombe disappeared, meaning that Cowan could not have been with them. However, despite an unreliable alibi, police had no real forensic evidence to charge Cowan with the abduction and murder of the teenager. During this time, Cowan changed his name to Shaddo N-unyah Hunter, possibly to evade police. He later remarked that 'Shaddo' was his dog's name and 'N-unyah' a euphemism which translates to the idiom [...] "none of your business". Moncrieff, Cowan's wife at the time, later admitted in court that she lied about her husband's whereabouts on the day of Morcombe's disappearance because she was [...] "blinded by love". After their divorce, she revealed in court that he was gone for up to five hours that day.|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation thesis deals with rotary mowers, specifically {{with the issue}} of mulching. In the theoretical part the reader is being familiar with the technology of mulching and its importance. Further, the individual types of mulchers and its advantages and disadvantages are described. The literary analysis of energy demands of rotary mowers is stated. Further, the parameters influencing energy demands of the <b>mulcher</b> are also analyzed. The results of measurement of the energy demands of the <b>mulcher</b> with vertical axis of rotation are presented. The dependency of input power, specific energy consumption and fuel consumption on mass performance of the machine are created. Furthermore, the energy demands was determined, while <b>mulcher</b> was working continuously at the permanent grassland. The energy losses of the <b>mulcher</b> were also analyzed. The effect of modification of operational and constructional parameters on the energy demands and quality of work of the <b>mulcher</b> wit vertical axis of rotation is studied. From the constructional parameters the shape of working tool, especially cloth angle and rake angle of the tool, and shape of the cover of the <b>mulcher</b> workspace is modified. From the operational parameters the cutting speed and mass performance according to conditions is modified...|$|E
40|$|The main {{direction}} {{of reducing the}} cost of soil treatment based on resource-saving technologies is the transition to surface treatment of soil with disk tools. Double-row and four-row disc tools are manufactured. Four-row tools significantly increase tillage intensity. In the disk tools, the spherical disc is fixed on the individual pole. Disc headers are equipped with a rigid adjustment fixing the standalone pole to the frame. Recommended operating speed is up to 12 km/h. The advantage of a disc header over the disc harrow is as follows: winding plant residues on the axis are excluded. Disc mulchers are equipped with a spiral bar on which a spherical disk is mounted. The presence of the elastic element allows the working unit to do lowfrequency oscillations during movement. The result of processing is the formation of mulch in the layer of soil, which {{is a mixture of}} plant residues and soil particles with a diameter of up to 25 mm. To assess the effectiveness of the disc <b>mulcher</b> and the disc header a unit is composed. The initial data for calculation are as follows: tractor HTZ- 150 K, the resistivity of the soil is 6 kN/m, disk tool working width is 4 m, operating speed of the disc header is 12 km/h, operating speed of the disc <b>mulcher</b> is 15 km/h. Technical and economic performance of these units is defined during disking the soil. The choice of energy-saving operating regime was made in a well-known manner. Theoretical value of slippage of the leading tractor with disk <b>mulcher</b> was 6 %, against 9 % with the disc header. Working speed of the <b>mulcher</b> made up 14. 07 km/h against 10, 89 of the disc header. The performance of the unit with the <b>mulcher</b> made up 16. 21 hectares, disc harrow performance is 12, 54 ha. Fuel mass flow of <b>mulcher</b> decreased by 29 % and made 9. 68 kg/ha. Using <b>mulcher</b> for surface treatment of the soil allows to reduce the tillage energy costs thanks to resource-conserving technologie...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance and to estimate costs of two round baling systems for harvesting understory biomass. One system was a cutter-shredderbaler prototype (Bio-baler). The other system required two successive operations. The first operation was cutting and shredding with a Supertrak tractor equipped with a Fecon <b>mulcher</b> head. The second operation was baling with a Claas baler. The machines were evaluated in three different pine stands on the Osceola National Forest in Florida, United States. Data collection included time study, fuel consumption and bale measurements. Material was collected from a sample of bales for heat and moisture content determination. On the most representative site (Site 2), the Bio-baler recovered 8. 05 green t ha(- 1) while the <b>mulcher</b> and the Claas baler recovered 9. 75 green t ha(- 1) (43 and 52 percent of original understory biomass, respectively). Productivity was 0. 30 ha h(- 1) for the Bio-baler and 0. 51 ha h(- 1) for the Claas baler. Density of the bales was 321 green kg m(- 3) for the Bio-baler and 373 green kg m(- 3) for the Claas baler. Average net heat content was 6263 MJ bale(- 1) for the Bio-baler and 6695 MJ bale(- 1) for the Claas baler with biomass containing 38 percent of moisture content on a wet basis. cost per unit area was less with the Bio-baler (US$ 320. 91 ha(- 1)) than with the mulcher-baler system (US$ 336. 62 -US$ 596. 77 ha(- 1)).

40|$|Ploughing {{in winter}} field peas in spring {{provides}} 100 kg of nitrogen to the succeeding crop and increases yield. The improved {{development of the}} crop also leads to an improved weed control. Possible disadvantages are the growing costs and restrictions when cultivating peas as a main crop in the rotation. Position of green manure in the crop rotation •	After late crops like potatoes, sun flowers and field vegetables. After grains, green manure is possible after repeated stubble treatment against root weeds. •	Possible succeeding crops are maize, potatoes or field vegetables that require nitrogen (e. g. spinach). Not grain legumes. •	The earliest point for repeating the pea fertilization on the same field is after 6 years. In between this time frame, peas must not be cultivated as a main crop. Cultivation of winter field peas •	In case of soil compaction, primary soil tillage should be carried out. Seedbed preparation with a rotary harrow or a tined rotor. •	Ideal seeding period: Beginning of October to middle of November. Sowing depth: 3 - 5 cm. •	Quantity of seeds: End of September/beginning of October: about 1, 5 kg/a (100 seeds/m 2), middle to end of Octo-ber: 2 kg/a, frost seeding in winter: max. 4 kg/a Mulching •	Do not incorporate the peas too early as the N fixation of the peas does not start until April. •	Ideally, use with a <b>mulcher</b> mounted at the front end to ensure the shredding of all stems. •	After 1 - 3 days, mix dried-in green matter into the soil surface (10 cm deep) – on light and medium soils with a disk harrow or a flat cultivator, in heavy, smooth soils use a skim plough. •	In no-till farming of maize, compress the peas after blooming in May with a crimper- roller {{and allow them to}} dry. Precautions •	Green manuring is less suitable before sunflowers, flax and millet, as they do not require so much nitrogen and more than 60 kg N per ha from the winter peas could be lost. •	The seed quantity can vary depending to the weight of a thousand seeds of field peas. •	Before grain maize, the field peas often do not have enough time to properly develop. •	Cultivating carrots after a green manure with field peas is not recommended due to the increased risk of spread of sooty mould (Chalara) and carrots cannot fully utilise the available nitrogen...|$|E
