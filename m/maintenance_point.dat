50|$|It {{was built}} {{because it had}} been shown during the First World War that it was a great disadvantage, from a {{servicing}} and <b>maintenance</b> <b>point</b> of view, for each state railway to have its own locomotive classes with no standardization.

50|$|Advancing {{technology}} {{saw many}} lighthouses automated during the 1920s and 1930s {{and replaced with}} more reliable electronic beacons, something which heavily altered {{the scope of the}} Depot’s mission as much of the upkeep, maintenance and lighthouse keeper supply work it performed was severely curtailed. This tail-off of work was checked by the massive increase in the use of Floating Aids-to-Navigation, or buoys. The Staten Island Depot’s foundry became one of the key manufacturing and <b>maintenance</b> <b>point</b> for many of the buoys used along the US East Coast, its quayside spaces became a forest of ocean buoys, channel markers, ice buoys, day-marks and their chains, anchors and sinkers.|$|E
5000|$|As {{well as the}} {{speaking}} clocks, there was ancillary equipment to provide timing signals, 1 pulse per second, 8 pulses per minute and 8 pulses per hour. The Time and Frequency Standards Section in the PMG Research Laboratories at 59 Little Collins Street, Melbourne maintained the frequency checks {{to ensure that the}} system was [...] "on time". From a <b>maintenance</b> <b>point</b> of view, {{the most important part of}} the mechanical clocks was to ensure that they were well oiled to minimise wear on the cams and to replace blown bulbs in the optical pickups from the glass disk recordings. When Time & Frequency Standards moved from 59 Collins Street to Clayton, the control signals were duplicated and a second bank of Caesium Beam Primary standards installed so the cutover was transparent with no loss of service.|$|E
50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} each bogie frame. The motors drove large cogwheels via {{spring-loaded}} sprockets on each side, and the cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The crank pins of the jackshafts drove - via a coupling rod - the crank pins {{of the two}} outer drive axles of the bogie. The inner side of this coupling rod contained a pin, which drove the crank pins of the two inner drive axles via a second coupling rod. Because {{of the position of}} the motors, and therefore also the jackshaft, the coupling rods were offset slightly relative to the drive axles. From a <b>maintenance</b> <b>point</b> of view this kind of drive was cheaper than a complex split coupling rod, but during service it was considerably more bumpy. For this reason primarily, the locomotive was not used for high speed operation.|$|E
50|$|Another {{emerging}} technology - intelligent vehicle health management systems - could allow the launch vehicle {{to determine its}} own health without human inspection. Sensors embedded in the vehicle could send signals to determine if any damage occurs during flight.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the form of British track had converged on the use of wrought iron bullhead rails supported in cast iron chairs on timber sleepers, laid in some form of ballast. In North America, the standard was T-rails and tie plates fastened to timber crossties with cut spikes. Many railways were using very light rails and, as locomotive weights and speeds increased, these became inadequate. Consequently, on main lines, the rails in use were made progressively heavier (and stronger). Metallurgical processes improved and better rails, including some of steel, came into use. From a <b>maintenance</b> <b>point</b> of view, the rail joints were the source of most of the work, and as steel-making techniques improved it became possible to roll steel rails of increased length - reducing the number of joints per mile. The standard length became 30 ft (9 144mm), then 45 ft (13 716mm) and finally 60 ft (18 288mm) rails became the norm. For main line use, the standard rail section became the 95BH section, weighing 95 lb per yard (47.13 kg per metre). For secondary routes, a lighter 85BH (42.16 kg per metre) section was used.|$|E
50|$|Built on {{the site}} of the {{original}} built Bristol and Exeter Railway shed, it was rebuilt under the Loans and Guarantees Act (1929) in 1934 by the Great Western Railway, allocated shed code 82A. The site scale meant that although the depot was to be the major repair and <b>maintenance</b> <b>point</b> for the Bristol divisional area, the shed was restricted to a steel-frame straight 8-road with northernlight roof pattern form, as opposed to the GWR standard-pattern turntable model like Old Oak Common. Secondly, as the depot was so close to Bristol Temple Meads, it was required to keep the depot in full operation while construction took place. The twin-ramp coal stage was of standard GWR pattern but used concrete beams and brick piers to restrict ramp width. The divisional repair shop was located to the far north of the site, close to the River Avon. There were two 65 ft standard-pattern over-girder turntables on site, one to the rear of the shed, and one to the Northeast of the repair shop.While Bath Road handled passenger traffic locomotives, St Philip's Marsh depot on the eastern throat handled freight types. Post nationalisation, under British Railways both Bath Road (Code: BR) and St Philip's Marsh gained additional allocation from the closure of the local London Midland and Scottish Railway sheds. By 1950 it had an allocation of 93 locomotives, half of them classic GWR 4-6-0s, most of the others 2-6-2Ts for running local and regional passenger traffic.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to automatic provisioning of the CE device, E-LMI can provide EVC status {{information to the}} CE device. Thus, if an EVC fault is detected (by CFM) the service provider edge device can notify the CE device of the failure which the CE device could use to trigger a corrective action, e. g. switch to a backup link. OAM Domain Concept OAM within service provider networks typically relies on a functional model consisting of hierarchical maintenance domains. Similar to other technologies (e. g. SDH OAM), Ethernet OAM also adopts the maintenance domain model. A maintenance domain is an administrative grouping of devices {{for the purpose of}} managing and administering a network. A domain is assigned a unique maintenance level by the administrator, which defines the hierarchical relationship of domains. Maintenance domains may nest or touch, but cannot intersect. If two domains nest, the outer domain must have a higher maintenance level than the one it engulfs. A maintenance domain is constituted by a set of OAM-aware control points (which are typically ports of the involved devices). Typically, only those <b>maintenance</b> <b>points</b> which are located at an edge of a domai...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{traffic demand}} and {{competition between the}} traffic modes force the railway operators to improve their economical results. Thisou can be achieved primarily by reducing costs and by keeping a high standard in service and quality whereby an increase of attractiveness for potential customers can be realised. Especially the German Railways, while preparing itself for going public, demands for a higher relevance of the financial result. Both infrastructure managers and railway operators have to consider that cost reducing actions are most effective when having a high impact on the life cycle costs (LCC) of the railway system and its compo-nents. Maintenance costs of railway infrastructure are such cost drivers. Track sections owned by the German Railways are categorised depending on their load per week for determining the time intervals of preventive maintenance of the infrastructure devices such as points. Unfortunately, there are only 3 cate-gories. Such a rough classification is far from condition based maintenance and therefore includes optimi-sation potential. This paper summarises the results of simulation supported evaluations of cost savings which can be realized by a more load than time dependent <b>maintenance</b> of <b>points.</b> A track section north of Hanover, Germany owned by the German Railways is taken as an example to compare the current situa-tion with an alternative <b>point</b> <b>maintenance</b> concept based on the recordings of the vehicle crossings. The study points out the possible reduction of scheduled inspections and shows cost savings under the premise of a constant system availability and safety. The examinations underline the need for load-dependent <b>maintenance</b> of <b>points</b> as a step towards more cost-efficient preventive maintenance of railway infrastructure and therefore a decrease in whole-life costing (LCC) ...|$|R
