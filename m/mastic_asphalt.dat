40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate rutting, fracture and thermal cracking resistance behavior of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> containing inert and active fillers. A control neat binder (AC- 30) along with basalt (B) as an inert filler and hydrated lime (HL) as active filler were selected in this study. The <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastics</b> were prepared for different percentages of HL (5, 10, 15 and 20 %) filler, {{in such a way}} that Filler to Binder (F/B) ratio becomes 0. 8. A total of five combinations of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> were prepared such as: AC- 30 + 80 % B + 0 % HL, AC- 30 + 75 % B + 5 %HL, AC- 30 + 70 % B + 10 %HL, AC- 30 + 65 % B + 15 %HL, and AC- 30 + 60 % B + 20 % HL. The rutting, fracture and thermal cracking resistance of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastics</b> was evaluated using Superpave rutting factor parameter, Double Edge Notched Tension (DENT) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR), respectively. Influence of HL on the, performance of neat <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> was observed to be predominant in high-temperature range as obtained from the G*/Sin delta value. The aging resistivity of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> increased with the inclusion of HL, indicating a better rutting performance of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic.</b> The intermediate-temperature performance of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> with HL was found to be higher compared to neat <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> from Critical Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) results, implying better resistance to fracture. The addition of HL increased the low-temperature performance of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> obtained from S(t) and m(t) values with S(t) and E(t) master curve, indicating enhanced resistance to thermal cracking. The combined effect of B and HL filler on the G*/Sin delta, CTOD, S(t), m(t) and E(t) parameters are presented in this study. In addition, ranking of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastics</b> based on various parameters (i. e. CTOD and m(t)) is discussed in this paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|During {{their service}} lives, {{asphalts}} in traffic area pavements {{are subjected to}} loadings from the weather and traffic. In jointless asphalt pavements, at low temperatures, so-called cryogenic tensile stresses due to cooling occur. Not taking account of these leads to fundamental errors in the prediction of the conjectured service life. The estimation of the cryogenic tensile stresses in asphalts by mathematical methods presupposes knowledge of the temperature, the modulus of elasticity, the one-dimensional {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and also the tensile viscosity. Within the framework of the research project under discussion, which was assisted by the Federal Ministry of Transport and performed at the Institute of Highway Engineering of the Technical University Braunschweig, it was proved that, using process-controlled testing machines, it is possible to examine the thermo-rheological behaviour of different asphalts by means of tensile retardation and tensile relaxation tests. It was shown that the tensile viscosities and the moduli of elasticity of asphaltic concretes, <b>mastic</b> <b>asphalts</b> and stone <b>mastic</b> <b>asphalts</b> are influenced to a high degree by the temperature and the tensile stress. The correlations between the material characteristic quantities referred to and the testing temperature T and the tensile stress #sigma#_z as influencing quantities were described mathematically with the aid of exponential functions, and represented nomographically.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Micromechanical {{models have}} been {{directly}} used to predict the effective complex modulus of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastics</b> from the mechanical properties of their constituents. Because the micromechanics models traditionally employed {{have been based on}} elastic theory, the viscoelastic effects of binders have not been considered. Moreover, due to the unique features of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastics</b> such as high concentration and irregular shape of filler particles, some micromechanical models may not be suitable. A comprehensive investigation of four existing micromechanical methods is conducted considering viscoelastic effects. It is observed that the self-consistent model well predicts the experimental results without introducing any calibration; whereas the Mori-Tanaka model and the generalized self-consistent model, which have been widely used for asphalt materials, significantly underestimate the complex Young’s modulus. Assuming binders to be incompressible and fillers to be rigid, the dilute model and the self-consistent model provide the same prediction, but they considerably overestimate the complex Young’s modulus. The analyses suggest that these conventional assumptions are invalid for <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastics</b> at low temperatures and high frequencies. In addition, contradictory to the assumption of the previous elastic model, it is found that the phase angle of binders produces considerable effects on the absolute value of the complex modulus of mastics...|$|R
40|$|Porous asphalt shows {{excellent}} {{performance in}} both noise reduction and water drainage. Although porous asphalt has these great qualities, its service life is much shorter (sometimes only half) compared to dense graded asphalt roads. Ravelling, {{which is the}} loss of aggregate particles from the surface layer, is the main damage mechanism of porous asphalt surface wearing courses. In this research, an induction healing approach (namely, activating the healing process of asphalt concrete through induction heating) was developed to enhance the durability of the porous asphalt roads. Steel fibers are added to a porous asphalt mixture to make it electrically conductive and suitable for induction heating. When micro cracks are expected to occur in the <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> of the pavement, the temperature of the mastic can be increased locally by induction heating of the steel fibers so that porous asphalt concrete can repair itself and close the cracks through the high temperature healing of the bitumen (diffusion and flow). The closure of micro cracks will prevent the formation of macro cracks. In such a way, ravelling can be avoided or delayed in the end. To make <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> and porous <b>asphalt</b> concrete electrically conductive and suitable for induction heating, steel (wool) fibers were incorporated into them. The electrical conductivity and induction heating speed of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> and porous <b>asphalt</b> concrete were first studied in this research. <b>Asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> and porous <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel fibers can be heated with induction energy. There is an optimal volume content of steel fiber in <b>asphalt</b> <b>mastic</b> or porous <b>asphalt</b> concrete to obtain the highest induction heating speed. Adding more steel fiber above this optimal volume content does not increase the induction heating speed anymore. Furthermore, the highest induction heating speed corresponds to the minimum electrical resistivity. However, porous asphalt concrete {{does not need to be}} fully conductive for induction heating. Every single steel wool is a heating unit. Nonconductive samples with steel fiber can still be heated with induction heating, but at a low heating speed. The diameter, length and content of steel wool fiber are important for the conductivity and heating speed of asphalt concrete matrix. It is proven that induction heating does not cause extra ageing to bitumen. Addition of steel wool also reduces the binder drainage problem in porous asphalt concrete. The mechanical properties of porous asphalt concrete with steel wool fiber were studied in this research. Adding moderate percentage steel wool to porous asphalt concrete reinforce it by increasing its particle loss resistance, indirect tensile strength and fracture energy, water damage resistance, stiffness and fatigue resistance. The steel wool was optimized to obtain the best particle loss resistance in porous asphalt concrete. 8 % steel wool type 00 (volume fraction of bitumen) was considered as the optimal content. The healing potential of porous asphalt concrete with steel wool fiber was also evaluated in this research with both cylinder and beam samples. Damaged porous asphalt concrete with steel wool fiber can greatly restore its stiffness, strength and fatigue life with induction heating, which proves that the healing capacity of porous asphalt concrete with steel wool fiber is enhanced by induction heating. The optimal induction heating temperature is 85 ºC for porous asphalt concrete to obtain the best healing rate. Reheating does not decrease the healing rate of porous asphalt concrete, which means that heating can be repeated when cracks appear again. To apply the induction healing technology in real porous asphalt road, a trial section was constructed on Dutch motorway A 58 in December 2010. This trial section survived the past two winters perfectly. Experiments were done on the cores drilled from the trial section and the results coincided with those on the laboratory made samples. The field cores showed good particle loss resistance, high strength, good fatigue resistance and high induction healing capacity. Based on the laboratory experiments and field experiences, induction healing can be a very good approach to enhance the durability of porous asphalt pavement. Finally, some recommendations are given for further research. Steel fiber, mixing technology and induction generator need to be optimized. Modeling work is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms involved in induction healing. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
