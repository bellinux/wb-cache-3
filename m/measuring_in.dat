5|$|A 1937 {{survey of}} Kennedy's rebuilt church by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire {{said that it}} was formed from a {{continuous}} nave and chancel, <b>measuring</b> <b>in</b> total 43 by 15feet (13.3 by 4.7m). The church, which was at that time in good condition, was entered through a porch on the south side, and there was a vestry on the north side. As well as the font, the church contained some 18th-century memorials. The font is now in the south chapel of St Cybi's Church, Holyhead.|$|E

25|$|After several {{supporting}} {{experiments were}} published, Jacques et al. claimed that an experiment of theirs follows fully the original scheme proposed by Wheeler. Their complicated experiment {{is based on}} the Mach-Zender interferometer, involving a triggered diamond N-V colour centre photon generator, polarization, and an electro-optical modulator acting as a switchable beam splitter. <b>Measuring</b> <b>in</b> a closed configuration showed interference, while <b>measuring</b> <b>in</b> an open configuration allowed the path of the particle to be determined, which made interference impossible.|$|E

25|$|Similar results exist {{regarding}} {{studies of}} the circumference of the adult fully erect penis, with the measurement usually taken mid-shaft. As with length, studies that relied on self-measurement consistently reported a significantly higher average than those with staff <b>measuring.</b> <b>In</b> a study of penis size where measurements were taken in a laboratory setting, the average penis circumference when erect was 4.8 inches (12.3cm), {{which means that the}} average width of the erect penis is approximately 1.5 inches (4cm).|$|E
25|$|According to quantum {{mechanics}} (particularly quantum indeterminacy), no possible measurement distinguishes between the 4 different polarization states, {{as they are}} not all orthogonal. The only possible measurement is between any two orthogonal states (an orthonormal basis). So, for example, <b>measuring</b> <b>in</b> the rectilinear basis gives a result of horizontal or vertical. If the photon was created as horizontal or vertical (as a rectilinear eigenstate) then this measures the correct state, {{but if it was}} created as 45° or 135° (diagonal eigenstates) then the rectilinear measurement instead returns either horizontal or vertical at random. Furthermore, after this measurement the photon is polarized in the state it was measured in (horizontal or vertical), with all information about its initial polarization lost.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a growing}} economy, capital is {{accumulated}} faster than people are born, so the denominator {{in the growth}} function under the MFP calculation is growing faster than in the ALP calculation.

2500|$|Chapultepec, more {{commonly}} called the [...] "Bosque de Chapultepec" [...] (Chapultepec Forest) in Mexico City, {{is one of}} the largest city parks in the Western Hemisphere, <b>measuring</b> <b>in</b> total just over 686 hectares (1,695 acres). Centered on a rock formation called Chapultepec Hill, one of the park's main functions is to be an ecological space in Greater Mexico City. It is considered the first and most important of Mexico City's [...] "lungs", with trees that replenish oxygen to the Valley of Mexico. The park area has been inhabited and considered a landmark since the Pre-Columbian era, when it became a retreat for Aztec rulers. In the colonial period, Chapultepec Castle was built here, eventually becoming the official residence of Mexican heads of state. It would remain so until 1940, when it was moved to another part of the park called Los Pinos.|$|E
2500|$|The {{system also}} models the {{phases of the}} moon. The moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the sun pointer at B0 (the {{connection}} between B0 {{and the rest of}} B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean sun pointer or a hypothetical true sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the moon, but is also geared to the sun— the effect is to perform a differential gear operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, <b>measuring</b> <b>in</b> effect, the angle of the difference between the sun and moon pointers. [...] The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.|$|E

2500|$|Chapultepec Park is {{the largest}} city park in Latin America, <b>measuring</b> <b>in</b> total just over 686 {{hectares}} (1700 acres).

The name [...] "Chapultepec" [...] means [...] "at the grasshopper hill" [...] in Nahuatl and refers to a large rock formation that is the center of the park's first section. Originally, this area was a forest outside of Tenochtitlan, once considered sacred in pre-Columbian times, but today it is entirely within the city (mostly in the borough of Miguel Hidalgo), surrounded by some of its primary business and commercial districts. The park is divided into three sections, the first and oldest surrounded by fence and shut at night, and the other two left open. It contains nine museums, amusement parks, winding paths, commemorative sculptures, lakes and fountains. Paseo de la Reforma passes most of the park and cuts through a portion on the north side.|$|E

Namely, if the man in the carriage covers the distance w in a unit of time -- measured from the train, -- then this distance -- as measured from the embankment -- is not necessarily also equal to w.|$|E
