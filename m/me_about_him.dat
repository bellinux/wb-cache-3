2500|$|The amplified {{stringed}} instruments, {{especially the}} steel guitar, gave the music its distinctive sound. As early as 1934 or 1935 Bob Dunn electrified a Martin O-series acoustic guitar while playing with Milton Brown's Brownies. According to Jimmy Thomason, [...] "It happened when Dunn {{was working at}} Coney Island in New York...he ran into this black guy who was playing a steel guitar with a homemade pickup attached to it...hooked up to this old radio or something and was playing blues licks...and he got this guy to show him how he was doing it. I never knew this black musician's name but both Bob and Avis talked to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> often." ...|$|E
2500|$|The two met in {{the semifinals}} of the 1998 US Open, where Sampras was slowed in the third set by a leg injury {{and called for a}} trainer, and Rafter broke Sampras twice in the {{deciding}} fifth set. [...] Sampras's loss denied him the chance to match two records—Jimmy Connors' mark of five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles. Sampras cited a leg injury as the reason Rafter won, an attitude that upset the Australian: [...] "He really does say some funny things at the wrong time", said Rafter, [...] "We are out there busting our guts and he doesn't show a lot of respect {{at the end of the}} day. He tries to play down the reason why he lost, giving no respect to the other player, and that is what really upsets <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> and the reason I try to piss him off as much as I can." [...] Following Rafter's successful defense of his 1997 U.S. Open title by defeating Mark Philippoussis in the 1998 final, when asked about Sampras' earlier comments about having to win another Grand Slam in order to be considered great, Rafter replied: [...] "Maybe you can ask him that question, if he thinks that now. For me, I won another Slam, and it hasn't sunk in yet. It's very, very exciting for me, especially to repeat it". For his part, Sampras said about Rafter, [...] "When I see him holding the US Open trophy, it pisses me off." [...] Rafter responded by calling Sampras a “cry baby” and saying that it would be better for tennis if someone besides the American were No. 1.|$|E
60|$|RAINA (breathless). Ah, I knew it! Tell me--tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|LUBIN. Savvy! I {{never heard}} of <b>him.</b> Tell <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Keep <b>me</b> up to date.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{there you}} are," [...] said Lord Badgery. You see me already {{preparing}} for the great man's coming. Now you must tell <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, sir, can {{you tell}} <b>me</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>him?</b> Can {{you tell me where}} he lodges? For my poor uncle was too much weighed down with trouble to remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But wasn't he there? Haven't {{they got}} him? Weren't they asking <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and saying I must {{be tried for}} {{stealing}} father's cheque?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes.... At noon I lecture.... take my farewell, rather, {{for ever}} of the schools....Gods! What have I to say?.... And tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>Him</b> of Nazareth. Farewell!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{you told}} <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> Mr. Medlin, I {{should have thought}} it would quite spoil the holiday. But I do not feel it so bad, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{about this}} stranger," [...] said I. [...] "Can you tell <b>me</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>him?</b> What did Selden say? Did he {{find out where}} he hid, or what he was doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O yes! As dearly as {{he loves}} me. Father loved me, first, for her sake. He carried <b>me</b> <b>about</b> with <b>him</b> when I {{was quite a}} baby. We have never been asunder from that time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{must have}} seemed very stupid to--the gentleman who took me in," [...] remarked Fan. [...] "Can you tell <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> Mrs. Travers? Is he {{a friend of yours}} and Mr. Travers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Call him not my enemy!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "An enemy cannot love! But, tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> I {{had heard}} the report that he was recovering." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> just now," [...] said George. [...] "I {{dare say}} it's true, but somehow I don't feel I {{want to hear}} about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, she sought her brother's {{knowledge}} of Kelley. [...] "Tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> Fred. Where did you meet him first? He interests me." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE [soothing her]. Of course I believe him, dearest. But {{you should}} have broken it to me by degrees. [Drawing {{her back to her}} seat]. Now tell <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Are you in love with him? ...|$|R
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Ah! Now we're {{coming to}} it. Tell <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> I knew {{there must be}} somebody, or you'd never have been so miserable about Mangan: you'd have thought it quite a lark to marry him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can {{you tell}} <b>me</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> Mr. Greatson? The doctor {{will be here}} in a moment, but I feel that I ought to be sending for some of his friends. I am afraid that he is very ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Jubal," [...] I insisted. [...] "Tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> {{and why you}} {{ran away}} to be chained by the neck and scourged {{across the face of}} a world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know that}} Johnny Chuck had a cousin until you {{mentioned}} it," [...] said Peter. [...] "Does {{he look like}} Johnny? Won't you tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> Mr. Coyote?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, say! I'll bet I {{know who}} that fellow is," [...] {{declared}} Randy. [...] "It must be Spouter's friend, Will Hendry. Spouter told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> They call him Fatty." ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not feel}} {{justified}} in giving a wife of Mrs. Micawber's experience any other recommendation, than that she should try to reclaim Mr. Micawber by patience and kindness (as I knew she would in any case); but the letter set <b>me</b> thinking <b>about</b> <b>him</b> very much.|$|R
60|$|In {{making my}} {{inquiries}} the cabman was of much assistance to me. And {{after having been}} referred {{from one person to}} another, I at last found a man, first mate of a vessel in the docks, who knew Captain Chesters, and could tell <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'And so, my dear Cousin, {{the blow}} has fallen upon you, and dear Mr. and Mrs. Keble have passed away to their eternal rest. I found letters at Norfolk Island on October 2, not my April letters, which will tell <b>me</b> most <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> but my May budget.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I {{hear you}} say. I {{do not think}} it very dutiful of you to come and talk to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> knowing as you do what I think about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt Charlotte, when is Uncle Paul {{coming up}} to see me? I long to see him; Mother has talked so much to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> She was his {{favourite}} sister, wasn't she?" ...|$|E
60|$|If it {{concerns}} Tom, don't tell me, please. You know he does do ridiculous things at times. But I don't let him worry me any more; so don't worry <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] exclaimed Mrs Stoutley, with {{increasing}} animation, as {{she rose and}} held out her hand; [...] "any friend of my brother-in-law is heartily welcome. Be seated, Mr Wopper, and let <b>me</b> hear <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> He was very kind to my dear husband during his last illness--very kind. I shall never forget him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then tell <b>me</b> again <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> dear father," [...] said Bertha. [...] "Many times again! His face is benevolent, kind, and tender. Honest and true, I am sure it is. The manly {{heart that}} tries to cloak all favours with a show of {{roughness}} and unwillingness, beats in its every look and glance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Austrian," [...] {{interrupted}} Locker. [...] "Mrs. Easterfield {{has told}} <b>me</b> something <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> He {{may have a}} title some day, and he is about as dangerous as they make them. Instead of accusing me of trifling, {{you ought to go}} down on your knees and thank me for still standing between him and her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, no, no; I {{liked him}} at first. I could have liked him very much, if Lord Marchmont {{had not told}} <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and then I had the key to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I won't tell him, anyway. But I'm {{glad you}} told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Dudley was so eloquent about burglars that he almost had me going. I wonder where he rushed off to?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{seems to}} have taken a dislike to the fellow," [...] Hurd admitted. [...] "She was {{speaking}} to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> just now. He is to be turned out of his lodgings here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shake {{hands with}} Bridges an' Lindsay," [...] said Burley, {{indicating}} his two comrades. [...] "Stockmen from Grand Lake.... Boys, you've heerd <b>me</b> talk <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Wade an' I was {{both in the}} old fight at Blair's ranch on the Gunnison. An' I've shore reason to recollect him!... Wade, what're you doin' up in these diggin's?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But this Alan Fairford?' said Nanty--'come--sip up {{the drop}} of brandy, man, and tell <b>me</b> some more <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and whether you are seeking him for good or for harm.' ...|$|R
60|$|Winter told <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Captain Butler {{had spent}} {{all his life}} on the Pacific. He had been in much better circumstances than he was now, for he had been first officer and then captain of a passenger-boat plying along the coast of California, but he had lost his ship and a number of passengers had been drowned.|$|R
