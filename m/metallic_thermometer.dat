40|$|Interest in the {{critical}} dynamics of superfluid He in microgravity conditions has motivated {{the development of new}} high resolution thermometry technology for use in space experiments near 2 K. The current material commonly used as the temperature sensing element for high resolution thermometers (HRTs) is copper ammonium bromide (Cu(NH{sub 4 }) {sub 2 }Br{sub 4 } 2 H{sub 2 }O) or CAB, which undergoes a ferromagnetic phase transition at 1. 8 K. HRTs made from CAB have demonstrated low drift (< 10 fK/s) and a temperature resolution of 0. 1 nK. Unfortunately, paramagnetic salts such as CAB are difficult to prepare and handle, corrosive to most metals, and become dehydrated if kept under vacuum conditions at room temperature. We have developed a magnetic thermometer using dilute magnetic alloys of Mn or Fe dissolved in a pure Pd matrix. These <b>metallic</b> <b>thermometers</b> are easy to fabricate, chemically inert, and mechanically robust. Unlike salts, they may be directly soldered to the stage to be measured. Also, the Curie temperature can be varied by changing the concentration of Fe or Mn, making them available for use in a wide temperature range. Susceptibility measurements, as well as preliminary noise and drift measurements, show them to have sub-nK resolution with a drift of less than 10 {sup {minus} 13 } K/s...|$|R

40|$|Nanostructured samples, be it {{semiconducting}} or metallic ones, {{have received}} considerable experimental and theoretical attention {{due to the}} manifold of possibilities to investigate fundamental physics. Not only are they viable candidates for realizations of qubits, the key ingredient of quantum computation, but the surrounding solid makes it a testing ground for many-body physics. Novel quantum mechanical effects, such as topological phases and electron-mediated ferromagnetic nuclear spin ordering, are predicted to emerge in such systems. Low temperatures are crucial for these many-body effects as the energies scales involved are typically very small. State of the art electron transport experiments reach an electron temperature of roughly 10 mK. In order to reach sub-millikelvin electron temperatures, we develop a novel type of refrigerator aimed at cooling nanostructured samples, where nuclear demagnetization refrigerators are integrated into every measurement lead, directly cooling the electrons therein. Hence circumventing the limitation of electron-phonon coupling which is drastically suppressed at the lowest temperatures due to its T^ 5 dependence. We implement various kinds of electron thermometers to measure the electron temperature in typical samples. In <b>metallic</b> Coulomb blockade <b>thermometers</b> (CBTs), we observe a deviation from the electron-phonon cooling mechanism, indicating that we succeed in cooling samples through the conduction electrons. Further, we investigate a quantum dot in a typical GaAs device. The quantum dot thermometer is operated in deep Coulomb blockade and probes the Fermi edge of the surrounding electron reservoir both through direct transport and a proximal charge sensing device. After considerable tuning effort an electron temperature of 10 mK is extracted. Our experiments show that the temperature reading is very susceptible to the electrostatic environment, emphasizing {{the importance of the}} surrounding solid and demonstrating the difficulty to implement a temperature sensor at the lowest temperatures. More importantly the low electron temperatures open the possibility for very sensitive measurements of back-action effects of the charge sensor or the charge stability of the material. After optimizing the chip socket and improving the filtering in the system, an electron temperature of 5. 2 mK Â± 0. 3 mK in a CBT is measured after demagnetization. By measuring the temperature dependent I-V curves of a normal metal/insulator/superconductor (NIS) tunnel junction, we implement yet another thermometer, which we employ as both primary and secondary thermometer. On top of that, we demonstrate with the help of reentrant features in the fractional quantum Hall regime, cooling of electrons in a high mobility GaAs two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) below the base temperature of our dilution refrigerator. Using our low electron temperatures, we investigate high mobility GaAs 2 DEG devices in large magnetic fields. In our samples the typical signature of the quantum Hall effect is dramatically altered, resulting in a quantized longitudinal resistance. We can show that this quantization, which occurs only at the lowest temperatures, is due to a large electron density gradient in the 2 DEG. As we show subsequently for the Î½= 5 / 2 fractional quantum Hall state, the electron density gradient heavily influences the extraction of the energy gap between the ground and excited state. Being a candidate for one of the above mentioned topologically non-trivial ground states, our findings could have important consequences for the fabrication of Î½= 5 / 2 fractional quantum Hall state samples. Additionally, we measure the electrical resistance anisotropy in both natural graphite and highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), comparing macroscopic samples, with exfoliated, nanofabricated specimens of nanometer thickness. In nanoscale samples, independent on the graphite type, we find a very large c-axis resistivity Ï_c [...] much larger than expected from simple band theory [...] and non-monotonic temperature dependence. This is similar to macroscopic HOPG, but in stark contrast to macroscopic natural graphite. A recent model of disorder-induced delocalization is consistent with our transport data. Furthermore, Micro-Raman spectroscopy reveals clearly reduced disorder in exfoliated samples and HOPG, as expected within the model. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we focus on}} low {{temperature}} transport through cleaved edge overgrowth (CEO) quantum wires. This thesis is motivated by recent theoretical work on one hand that predicts {{the formation of a}} nuclear helimagnet in presence of a Luttinger liquid (LL) below a critical system temperature [1] and previous measurements on CEO wires on the other hand that might indicate the onset of such a phase transition [2]. The first task for this thesis was to create suitable measurement conditions to approach the theoretically predicted strongly correlated state of matter. More precisely,electron sample temperatures much lower than the predicted ordering temperature of 75 mK for GaAs CEO wires have to be demonstrated. For this purpose, cryogenic microwave filters with very low cut-off frequency and good thermalization properties were developed and installed for all measurement cables. With that a minimum electron temperature of 7. 5 mK was reached in <b>metallic</b> coulomb blockade <b>thermometers</b> [3],and furthermore, {{for the first time in}} these devices, a deviation from pure electron-phonon cooling is observed [4]. At low refrigerator temperatures T_R, the CEO (double) wires show pronounced and completely reproducible conductance oscillations as a function of density. We show that these oscillations, also present in the zero magnetic field tunneling current between the parallel quantum wires, emerge as 1 D Fabry Perot resonances in the ballistic CEO wires [5]. We analyze the maximum transmission (T= 1) through these wires, i. e the oscillation maxima, in the single mode regime as a function of temperature. While the quantum wires approach universal conductance quantization of 2 e^ 2 /h for a single quantum wire only at quite large T_R> 15 K, we find that the conductance saturates below T_R= 75 mK at 1 e^ 2 /h [6]. Furthermore, we give strong evidence that the conductance saturation is not related to insuffcient thermalization, i. e. the CEO wires cool far beyond the saturation temperature of 75 mK. This seems to indicate lifting of electron spin degeneracy at zero external magnetic field, consistent with the theo- retically predicted low temperature limit for a clean LL in the ordered helicalstate [1]. We can further exclude other potential mechanisms (temperature dependent contact resistance, freeze-out of weakly disordered LL, Wigner crystal formation/incoherent LL), leaving only nuclear spins as candidates for the source of the (possibly) observed lifted spin degeneracy as spin-orbit coupling is rather weak in GaAs, and the saturation at 1 e^ 2 /h is observed in absence of an external magnetic field. This might resolve the long-standing mystery of the temperature-dependent (non-universal) conductance quantization in GaAs cleaved edge overgrowth quantum wires, and furthermore might give first experimental evidence for a new, strongly correlated state of matter, namely (helical) nuclear order induced by the strongly interacting electrons via hyperfine coupling. We also measure real-time tunneling in a GaAs few electron double quantum dot (DQD) by means of an adjacent quantum dot as charge sensor. At low temperatures, in the limit of negligible interdot tunneling and low tunnel rates to source and drain, we observe metastable charge state switching. The metastability only occurs within diamond shaped regions that are centered between associated triple points of the charge stability diagram (CSD). We show that these charge fluctuations arise as an intrinsic property in DQDs, and take place via fast intermediate states that include an electron exchange with the leads [7]. Due to the geometrical shape of the diamond (in very good agreement with our model of thermally activated electron exchange with the leads), its large energy scale (> 1. 7 K) and due to its visibility even at charge sensor bias voltages as small as 5 ÂµV, we exclude extrinsic effects such as phonon or photon assisted tunneling. Furthermore, the simultaneous observation of the diamond shaped region of metastable charge state switching at various points in the CSD and its pinning to associated triple points upon reshaping the DQD, make charge traps and other defects a very unlikely explanation...|$|R
