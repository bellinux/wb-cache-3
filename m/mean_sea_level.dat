5|$|In geodesy, {{the exact}} shape that Earth's oceans would adopt {{in the absence}} of land and {{perturbations}} such as tides and winds is called the geoid. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Spectral {{analysis}} was used to investigate semidaily <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> and atmospheric pressures at San Francisco, California, Coos Bay, Oregon, and Tofino, British Columbia, in the frequency band 0 to 0. 5 cpd. Cross spectral analysis of semidaily <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> and atmospheric pressures at the three stations show that the response of <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> to low-frequency atmospheric pressure fluctuations is nonbarometric in the frequency band studied, and varies with season. Cross spectral analysis of semidaily <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> between adjacent stations shows that there exists significant coherence between the Coos Bay and Tofino <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> within the frequency band studied and phase difference between the stations is consistent with the hypothesis of continental shelf waves traveling from south to north along the coast...|$|R

5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm tide is measured using a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm surge {{is defined as the}} rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is measured using tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.|$|E
5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E
5|$|In Texas, most of {{the damage}} was due to inland flooding. Heavy {{rainfall}} of 6 to 18inches (150 to 450mm) was reported across a large swath of Texas. The heaviest measured amount was 17.4inches (426mm) near Monroe City, Texas. Rainfall amounts of two to six inches were common throughout {{the eastern part of}} the state. In total, 38 houses were flooded in southeast Texas. The freshwater flooding resulted in the evacuation of 20 families in Chambers County. 250 people had to evacuate from their homes near Abilene, Texas due to floodwater. The storm surge impacts were fairly minor, ranging from 3 to 5feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) above <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>level.</b> A portion of State Highway 87 was flooded from the storm surge, although no significant property damage was reported as a result of it. Minor beach erosion and street flooding was also reported on Galveston Island. The highest wind gust on land was 51mph (82km/h) at Scholes Field. There were two tornadoes confirmed as a result of Dean. One touched down on High Island in Galveston County, and the other touched down near Anahuac. Both tornadoes were rated as F0 on the Fujita scale, with minor damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} the {{undulation}} is not standardised, as different countries use different <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> as reference but mostly refers to the EGM96 geoid.

The existing four tide gauges, operated by General Command of Mapping since 1985 with an analogous system, were upgraded to high standards enabling automatic data collection and real time data transfer. Monthly <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> values are obtained from hourly data between 1985 - 1999 after pre-analysis and <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> and their changes are estimated by applying harmonic analysis. GPS measurements carried out at those tide gauges between 1992 to 1999 are also processed and evaluated. <b>Sea</b> <b>level</b> data, GPS and precise leveling observation connecting tide gauges are combined to estimate relations between <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> as well as vertical crustal movements at Turkish coasts...|$|R
5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} on Louisiana, Hurricane Florence produced {{higher than}} normal tides, including a peak observation of 7.5feet (2.3m) above <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> on the Bayou Benvenue {{to the east of}} New Orleans. Rainfall was relatively light, ranging from about 1inch (25mm) to a maximum of 4.05inches (103mm) at Watson. Winds of tropical storm force occurred across southeastern Louisiana, with wind gusts peaking at 64mph (103km/h) at an automatic Coast Guard Station on the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River Delta. An unofficial tornado was reported in Tangipahoa Parish. Minor storm surge flooding occurred outside of the levee system of southern Louisiana in Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, and Saint Tammany Parishes. On Grand Isle, strong wave action resulted in significant beach erosion, with most areas on the island losing about 40feet (12.2m) of beach. The storm surge also flooded a portion of Louisiana Highway 300 near Delacroix. The passage of the hurricane broke a levee in Delacroix; it was quickly repaired with flooding from the levee being pumped to the gulf. Light to moderate damage was reported across the southeastern portion of the state, primarily from falling trees. The winds also downed numerous power lines, leaving about 150,000people without power for some period of time during the storm. The power outages were short-lived, with about 6,900left without power by the day after the hurricane. Damage in the state was fairly minor, totaling about $2.5million (1988USD, $4.4million 2007USD).|$|E

40|$|Analyses of {{long time}} series of hourly tide-gauge data at four {{stations}} in the Gulf of Maine reveal that the amplitude of the M 2 tide underwent a nearly linear secular increase {{throughout most of the}} twentieth century.

Tidal models that account for Holocene <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise do predict an amplification of M 2, but much smaller than the currently observed trends. Nor do recent annual <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> correlate with the recent trend discontinuity.

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of tides on {{the orientation of}} channels on ebb-tidal deltas is investigated using the state-of-the-art numerical model Delft 3 D-MOR in a highly schematized geometry. The water motion is described by the depth-averaged shallow water equations. It is forced with {{a limited number of}} tidal constituents at boundaries far away from the inlet. Due to the interaction of the water motion and the erodible bed, tidally averaged sediment fluxes occur which result in bedform changes. The sediment transport is modeled using a total load formula. The resulting bathymetry resembles that of an ebb-tidal delta. If the sea surface is forced with a semi-diurnal (M 2) constituent only, the main channel on the ebb-tidal delta is always oriented downdrift with respect to the direction of propagation of the M 2 tidal wave. When forcing the sea surface with both an M 2 and mean component, both channel orientations are observed: if the difference in <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> surface <b>level</b> is positive over the inlet, the resulting channel will be updrift oriented. A negative difference of <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> surface <b>level</b> results in a downdrift-oriented channel. The apparent relation between channel orientation and difference in <b>mean</b> <b>sea</b> surface <b>level</b> over the inlet seems to be supported by an analysis of quai-realistic simulations of tidal motion in the Dutch Wadden Sea...|$|R
