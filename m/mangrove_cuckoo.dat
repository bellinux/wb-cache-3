5|$|Bird {{life on the}} {{shoreline}} includes yellow-crowned night herons, loggerhead shrikes, prairie warblers and shorebirds. <b>Mangrove</b> <b>cuckoos,</b> a notoriously difficult-to-observe species, may be seen at Convoy Point and Black Point.

40|$|I used radio-telemetry {{to track}} the {{movements}} of <b>Mangrove</b> <b>Cuckoos</b> (Coccyzus minor) captured in southwest Florida. Relatively {{little is known about}} the natural history of <b>Mangrove</b> <b>Cuckoos,</b> and my goal was to provide an initial description of how individuals use space, with a focus on the size and placement of home ranges. I captured and affixed VHF radio-transmitters to 32 individuals between 2012 and 2015, and obtained a sufficient number of relocations from 16 of them to estimate home-range boundaries and describe patterns of movement. Home-range area varied widely among individuals, but in general was roughly four times larger than expected based on the body size of <b>Mangrove</b> <b>Cuckoos.</b> The median core area (50 % isopleth) of a home range was 42 ha (range: 9 – 91 ha), and the median overall home range (90 % isopleth) was 128 ha (range: 28 – 319 ha). The median distance between estimated locations recorded on subsequent days was 298 m (95 % CI [187 m– 409 m]), but variation within and among individuals was substantial, and it was not uncommon to relocate individuals > 1 km from their location on the previous day. Site fidelity by individual birds was low; although <b>Mangrove</b> <b>Cuckoos</b> were present year-round within the study area, I did not observe any individuals that remained on a single home range throughout the year. Although individual birds showed no evidence of avoiding anthropogenic edges, they did not incorporate developed areas into their daily movements and home ranges consisted almost entirely of mangrove forest. The persistence of the species in the study area depended on a network of conserved lands–mostly public, but some privately conserved land as well–because large patches of mangrove forest did not occur on tracts left unprotected from development...|$|R
5|$|Within the Florida {{mangrove}} systems live 220species of fish, and {{a variety}} of crabs, crayfish, shrimp, mollusks, and other invertebrates, which serve as the main source of food for many birds. Dozens of bird species use mangroves as nurseries and food stores, including pelicans, grebes, tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), gulls, terns, hawks and kites, and arboreal birds like <b>mangrove</b> <b>cuckoos</b> (Coccyzus minor), yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia), and white-crowned pigeons (Patagioenas leucocephala). The mangroves also support 24species of amphibians and reptiles, and 18species of mammals, including the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).|$|R

50|$|The <b>mangrove</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is a {{resident}} of southern Florida in the United States, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, both coasts of Mexico and Central America, and the Atlantic coast of South America {{as far south as}} the mouth of the Amazon River.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} of {{variable}} size with slender bodies, long tails and strong legs. Many have {{black and white}} undertail patterns. They occur {{in a variety of}} forests, woodlands or <b>mangroves.</b> Coccyzus <b>cuckoos,</b> unlike many Old World species, build their own nests in trees and lay two or more eggs. Yellow-billed and black-billed cuckoos occasionally lay eggs in the nests of other birds, but are not obligate brood parasites like the common cuckoo of Eurasia.|$|R
50|$|These {{birds are}} birds with {{relatively}} slender bodies, long tails and strong legs. The black-bellied cuckoo is essentially restricted to rainforest, {{but the more}} widespread squirrel cuckoo also occurs in other forest types, woodlands or <b>mangroves.</b> Piaya <b>cuckoos,</b> unlike many Old World species, are not brood parasites; they build their own nests in trees and lay two eggs. Parasitic cuckoos lay coloured eggs to match those of their passerine hosts, but the non-parasitic Piaya species, like most other non-passerines, lay white eggs.|$|R
50|$|Florida: On April 30-May 1, 2010, 2,500 citizen {{scientists}} {{worked with}} their professional counterparts to explore life {{in one of}} the nation’s largest marine national parks, Biscayne National Park. More than 800 species were found, including a number of species rare to the park, such as the <b>mangrove</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> and silver hairstreak butterfly. Also 11 species of lichen and 22 species of ants were found that had not previously been documented in the park.|$|E
50|$|Florida Keys and Miami Rock Ridge hammocks are {{important}} {{for a number of}} West Indian land birds including the <b>mangrove</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Coccyzus minor), the black-whiskered vireo (Vireo altiloquus), and the white-crowned pigeon (Columba leucocephala) (Snyder et al. 1990). Gray kingbirds (Tyrannus dominicensis) and smooth billed anis (Crotophaga ani) are also present, and the Key West quail dove (Geotrygon chrysia) and the Zenaida dove (Zenaida aurita) are reportedly historic breeders in the Florida Keys (Robertson and Woolfenden 1992).|$|E
50|$|The faunal fossils {{found in}} the area belong mostly to estuarine fish {{supporting}} marine diet concentrations approaching as high as 73%. The presence of non-estuarine fossil evidence supports {{the claim that the}} Paleo-Indian peoples tapped into their fresh-water resources for food in addition to marine selections from Parita Bay. Non-estuarine remains have been calculated to account for as much as 11% of the diet. In addition, fossil evidence for over 400 species of birds and other animals include the orange-chinned parakeet (Brotogeris jugularis), crested bobwhite (Colinus cristatus), possible <b>mangrove</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Coccyzus minor), groove-billed ani (Crotophaga sulcirostris), great-tailed grackle (Cassidix mexicanus), giant toad (Bufo marinus), a lizard (Ameiva ameiva), Green Iguana (Iguana iguana), mud turtle (Kinosternon spp.), painted terrapin (Chrysemys scripta), several species of shark (superorder Selachimorpha), estuarine fishes, non-estuarine marine fishes, freshwater fish, mangrove and mudflat mollusks, and mudflat crabs (Haller 2004).|$|E
50|$|For the cuckoos {{suitable}} habitat {{provides a}} source of food (principally insects and especially caterpillars) {{and a place to}} breed, for brood parasites the need is for suitable habitat for the host species. Cuckoos occur {{in a wide variety of}} habitats. The majority of species occur in forests and woodland, principally in the evergreen rainforests of the tropics. Some species inhabit or are even restricted to mangrove forests; these include the little bronze cuckoo of Australia, some malkohas, coucals, and the aptly-named <b>mangrove</b> <b>cuckoo</b> of the New World. In addition to forests come species of cuckoo occupy more open environments; this can include even arid areas like deserts in the case of the greater roadrunner or the pallid cuckoo. Temperate migratory species like the common cuckoo inhabit a wide range of habitats in order to make maximum use of the potential brood hosts, from reed beds (where they parasitise reed warblers) to treeless moors (where they parasitise meadow pipits).|$|E
40|$|<b>Mangrove</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> (Coccyzus minor) {{exhibits}} substantial phenotypic variation {{across its}} geographic range, but {{the significance of}} this variation for taxonomy remains unresolved. Using measurements of bill size and ventral color recorded from 274 museum specimens, I found that variation in these traits was clinal. No named subspecies was reciprocally diagnosable from all others, and none was distinguishable from the nominate form, such that previously recognized subspecific distinctions are invalid. Greatest differences in phenotype occurred between populations in Florida, the Bahamas, and the Greater Antilles [...] characteristically small-billed [...] and those in the Lesser Antilles, which had larger bills. Phenotypically intermediate individuals on the geographically intermediate islands of Barbuda and Antigua linked these two extremes. Individuals intermediate in bill size and color also characterized populations from throughout the remainder of the range in northern South America and Middle America. Mechanisms maintaining the fairly pronounced phenotypic differences between nearby populations of Greater and Lesser Antillean birds are unknown, yet the geographic proximity of these populations suggests that they probably persist despite occasional gene flow, and may be adaptive...|$|E
