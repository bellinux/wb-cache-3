40|$|<b>Mandatory</b> {{community}} <b>service</b> {{has been}} an immensely important issue {{in the last decade}} or more of educational reform, although both opponents and advocates for <b>mandatory</b> <b>service</b> have passionate and persuasive arguments, there is a middle ground. Both sides of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>service</b> debate agree that community service is not only a great learning tool for educational institutions to adopt because "schools are places of learning where people grow through an enhancement of their own capacities and human possibilities" (Purpel, 123), but an agent for the higher good of society. The best solution is for schools to concentrate on creating the best conditions for their students to contribute meaningfully to community service work and to learn effectively from their experiences. That best condition is to develop a culture of service, which in the school context, is a democratic school culture based on an ideology of service. The grassroots ideology of social change, social justice, and social equality seems to engender school cultures that produce socially conscious students who are inclined toward a lifestyle of social action. There are two main inter-related threads of thought in this paper. Because I argue that practitioners need to transcend the debate of <b>mandatory</b> <b>service</b> and embrace the idea of a culture ofservice that over-rides all the educational arguments against and for <b>mandatory</b> <b>service,</b> this paper is a thesis. Because I am proposing what a school culture ofservice should look like, this paper is also a proposal. Chapter one introduces the problem of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>service</b> debate and then the concept of a culture of service. The literature reviewed in chapter two will provide important concepts to develop a multidisciplinary conceptualization of a school culture of service. The two case studies examined in the third chapter will provide examples of how the organizational and ideological components of a school culture can engender service-oriented students. Chapter four will conclude this thesis/proposal with a discussion of what characterizes a school culture of service and how that has implications for other educational institutions...|$|R

40|$|Serious {{concerns}} {{are being raised}} about the well-being of South Africa’s young people. This article uses the Pathways to Resilience Youth Measure {{to examine the relationship}} between services and resilience through a quantitative cross-sectional study of 1, 209 Sesotho-speaking adolescents. The results indicate that no positive correlations exist between resilience and service use, but there are significant negative correlations between resilience and participants who had been in foster homes, questioned by the police, in jail, on probation, or had made use of substance abuse or addiction services. Strong correlations exist between service use satisfaction and resilience. We conclude that young people’s satisfaction with the services used and not the mere fact of service use might support resilience. This has implications for social workers, including the need to nurture youth agency and healthy practitioner–youth bonds, and to shape communities towards providing constructive contexts where <b>mandatory</b> <b>services</b> are less necessary...|$|E
40|$|Localization {{has become}} one of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>services</b> in {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) while dealing with critical operations such as coverage, deployment, routing, target tracking and rescue operations. Since the necessity of WSN has increased drastically to provide best solution with accurate results of sensor nodes, it mainly depends on the WSN node localization. This paper initially describes on Mobile Anchor Positioning- Mobile Anchor & Neighbour (MAP- M&N), a range-free localization method, which makes use of the beacon packets of mobile anchor and the location packets of neighboring nodes to estimate the position of nodes and to improve the localization accuracy. The anchor node, which is equipped with global positioning system (GPS), broadcasts its coordinates to the sensor nodes as it moves through the network. The result of MAP-M&N method serves as input to Heuristic Particle Swarm Optimization (H-PSO) algorithm. By using H-PSO algorithm, it can be observed that localization accuracy of the sensor nodes seems to improve significantly than by using only MAP-M&N method for location estimation...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{provision}} for the handicapped in Brunei Darussalam set {{in the context of the}} general evolution of education in the country since schooling was first introduced on a formal basis about eighty years ago. The first chapter describes the salient geographical, economic, demographic and cultural characteristics of the country. Chapter 2 presents an outline of the development of education together with an account of its current structure and organisation. Chapters 3 and 4 are detailed analyses of the 1972 and 1985 education policies respectively. These policies are important because they continue to provide the ideological basis for the system. The reasons for the changes in emphasis between the two policies are discussed. Chapter 5 sets out the ways in which the handicapped are currently defined and identified in Brunei. Chapter 6 is a consideration of the roles of the various agencies currently involved with the handicapped and the relationships among them. Chapter 7 describes the present provisions for the handicapped and offers suggestions for how to these could be modified to make them both more effective and more comprehensive. Chapter 8 consists of recommendations for the additional services which are required if all the handicapped in the country are to receive fully adequate care, support and training. It is stressed chat the concept of the Welfare State should be embodied in legislation which should both implement <b>mandatory</b> <b>services</b> and clearly define the responsibilities of the various agencies involved. The crucial element in provision for the handicapped is appropriate education and training but for a fully integrated service, the co-operation of other government departments must be ensured. The emphasis throughout the study is essentially practical; that is, what can realistically be done given the present development, resources and attitudes of Brunei Darussalam...|$|E
40|$|Tanzania’s good climatic {{condition}} of four agro-ecological zones and six farming system together with adequate good soils and water resources with reasonable rainfall patterns (except in semi-arid regions) are favourable for agricultural production. Despite this abundance of resources, Tanzania {{is still far}} from taping full potentials in crop production and productivity that could be attained if the existing agricultural resources were fully utilised. The agricultural sector has failed toraise the rural poor above the poverty line and has perpetuated the existing pervasive poverty among farming communities. These constraints facing the agricultural sector have contributed to low production and productivity of the agricultural sector. For several decades the agricultural sector has failed to fulfil its role as the “engine of economic growth”; as a result, the general picture of the Tanzania’s economy has remained untransformed and unreliable. Given the importance of agriculture as the mainstay of rural livelihoods, it must grow much faster to realise rural poverty reduction in Tanzania. In view of the above state of affairs, this study posed the following research questions: Are support activities and services in coffee production, processing and marketing significantly linked to allow application of Supply Chain Management (SCM) ?; Do institutions responsible for coffee provide <b>mandatory</b> <b>services</b> to enable farmers undertake support activities and services in production, processing and marketing of this crop? Finally, are the coffee marketing support activities and services significantly integrated along the supply chain {{in order to enhance}} its marketing? Thus, the above underlined challenges and questions imply thatstagnation in agricultural development is a function of a multiplicity of soci-economic, technological and political factors. As a result, the call for improving the agricultural sector production and productivity needs a holistic approach, particularly the application of SCM. The above fact suggests that Tanzania should among others, find ways to increase agricultural production, productivity, promote agro-processing and expand markets for its agriproducts through a well co-coordinated system. The present study calls for a collaborative and integrative approach in the supply chain to plan and control the flow of value adding materials from the producers to the consumers. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the application of the Conceptual Supply Chain Management Model (SCMM) in coffee support activities and services in the areas of production, processing and marketing in order to suggest an appropriate model that can improve production and productivity of the agricultural sector thereby enhancing the income of the rural poor and ultimately alleviating poverty and raising the standard of living of Tanzanians. Following the format prescribed by the University of South Africa, this thesis is organized into eight chapters. Also, it is structured in a coherent manner to bring the logic for the development of the conceptual framework for the coffee subsector in Kagera region. Chapter One provides the introduction and background information. It creates a base and sets a framework for the entire study. Chapter Two presents the literature review including both the theory and practice of SCM. It also presents the background and SCM development as well as the importance of integrating SCM in the agricultural sector in Kagera, Tanzania and the world at large. The objective of the chapter is to present an in-depth review of literature and show the gap so as to make justification for proposing a study on the application of the SCM in agriculture with reference to Coffee in Kagera Region. Chapter Three discusses the Model Development. It discusses the meaning and the type of conceptual models. Further more, it discusses the reasons for and the advantage of applying the conceptual models. Finally, it highlights the rationale for selecting a particular criterion for evaluating the conceptual models. Chapter Four presents research methodology including identification of the definition of research and different research methods and their respective instruments for undertaking this study. It presents the theoretical and research process, showing the types of research methods and research designs. It also presents in detail, sampling, sampling techniques and data collection techniques. Finally, the chapter highlights how the collected data have been organised, analysed and presented. Chapter Five is about research findings. It covers the outcome of the exercise set by Chapter Four. It presents descriptive and empirical information of basic agricultural support activities along the supply chain from production through consumption. It involves the analysis of the production, processing and marketing support activities to examine their influence on the production and productivity of coffee in Kagera Region. Chapter Six entails synthesis analysis and results. This is an amalgamation of the research findings as well as synthesis, descriptive and empirical analysis of those findings. Thus, the chapter is about the analysis of coffee production, processing and marketing support activities and services in Kagera Region. Chapter Seven describes the contribution to knowledge which shows the existing conceptual SCMM for coffee in Kagera. The Chapter presents the appropriate conceptual model which adopts planning of many components in the coffee supply chain such as suppliers, materials, resources, warehouses, transporters and customers. The Model has been developed and proposed for application in Kagera Region in order to address the shortcomings addressed in the analysis made in the existing model as indicated in Chapter Six. Chapter Eight presents the summary, conclusions and recommendations. In this chapter, the study concludes that coffee marketing support activities and services in Kagera are not significantly linked to production and processing in order to allow the application of SCM principles. Furthermore, it shows that coffee management institutions such as private coffee traders, cooperative unions, government regional and district agricultural offices and other stakeholders do not provide all <b>mandatory</b> <b>services</b> to enable coffee production, processing and marketing support activities and services. According to this study, marketing support services are not significantly integrated in the coffee supply chain that will enhance its marketing. Given this reality, this study proposes the adoption of the appropriate conceptual SCMM. The Coffee SCMM has been developed to coordinate key players and processes in coffee SCM for the integrated framework. The proposed model has been successfully implemented in many successful management systems. The conceptual model for Kagera integrates various participants involved in the entire coffee supply chain including coffee producers, processors and exporters. The Tanzania Coffee Board (TCB) is proposed to be the overall coordinator of the entire coffee supply chain. In addition, it proposes an information exchange procedure among players (feedback) initiated by consumers. For further studies, the study recommends three major blocks of studies such as support activities and services in the areas of SCM in coffee production, processing and marketing. Finally, the study proposes these three major areas to be individually and deeply studied. Business ManagementD. B. L...|$|E
