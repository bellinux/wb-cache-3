500|$|A {{reviewer}} for TVoholic {{claimed he}} would have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] {{changed his mind about}} changing the past or how he thought this could work. There <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> that made Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain." ...|$|E
500|$|Shearer has {{released}} five solo comedy albums: It <b>Must</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Been</b> <b>Something</b> I Said (1994), Dropping Anchors (2006), Songs Pointed and Pointless (2007), Songs of the Bushmen (2008) and Greed and Fear (2010). His most recent CD, Greed and Fear is mainly about Wall Street economic issues, rather than politics like his previous albums. Shearer {{decided to make}} the album when he"started getting amused by the language of the economic meltdown – when 'toxic assets' suddenly became 'troubled assets,' going from something poisoning the system to just a bunch of delinquent youth with dirty faces that needed not removal from the system but just...understanding." [...] In May 2006, Shearer received an honorary doctorate from Goucher College.|$|E
500|$|Mona's visual {{actress in}} Max Payne 2 was Kathy Tong, a Hollywood model. [...] According {{to the first}} two games' writer Sam Lake, he [...] "did want to switch to Mona [...] but it was problematic. In the end, Max frames those {{sequences}} with his narration, saying that he doesn’t know exactly what happened, or what Mona did, but it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> like this. In other words, when you are playing Mona, you are actually experiencing Max’s guess of the events". Regarding Mona's possible survival {{at the end of}} Max Payne 2, Rockstar's Dan Houser stated that Max Payne 3 would [...] "not continue that aspect of the story. We toyed with figuring out some way, or doing something clever, and then [...] 'No, no, just move on from that bit of the story.' It really didn't work because there was no way of knowing the choices someone made." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Of course, {{that the}} Škoda became such {{a figure of}} fun was {{in part due to}} its ubiquity on Britain's roads. The company <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing <b>something</b> right." [...] (from a BBC report on Škoda sales in 1980s) ...|$|R
500|$|The episode also {{received}} some criticism. Dan Compora of Airlock Alpha {{said after a}} run of [...] "several strong" [...] episodes, Lost [...] "has slipped into mediocrity. While none of the recent episodes have been bad, they haven't been anything special. For a hundredth episode, average simply isn't good enough. While the shooting of Daniel at the end was stunning, I expected something much more {{from the rest of}} the episode than learning the identity of Daniel's parents." [...] A reviewer for TVoholic.com thought the episode was good, though not as good as [...] "The Constant", and he thought [...] "it came with lots of answers and references to past episodes from this season and the ones before it, making it all the more exciting." [...] The reviewer would, however, have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] changed his mind about changing the past or how he thought this could work. There <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> that made Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain." [...] Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind said that as an internal character piece, [...] "The Variable" [...] was not [...] "so much a great ending for Daniel. We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late January 1875, The Times ran {{advertisements}} for the Royalty Theatre: [...] "In preparation, a new comic opera composed expressly for this theatre by Mr. Arthur Sullivan, in which Madame Dolaro and Nelly Bromley will appear." [...] Reginald Allen and other writers took {{this as an}} advertisement for Trial by Jury. [...] However, as George McElroy noted, the advertisement does not mention a librettist, a peculiar omission if {{it was to have}} been W. S. Gilbert, since Gilbert was, at that point, better known to London theatregoers than Sullivan. [...] Moreover, Trial has no place for two principal ladies, but The Zoo does. [...] McElroy demonstrated that the January advertisement definitely was not for Trial, when he discovered a further advertisement in The Era of 14 March 1875, which noted that [...] "In consequence of the continued success of La Périchole, the production of Mr. Sullivan's two-act opera is postponed." [...] That two-act work <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> entirely different from Trial by Jury, which is in one act, and which opened just eleven days later.|$|E
2500|$|They have elongated, {{cylindrical}} skulls, but possess {{no visible}} eyes, {{though in the}} original Alien film, {{the top of the}} creature's head was translucent, with empty, human-looking eye sockets within. In the novelization of Alien, the character Ash speculates that the Xenomorphs [...] "see" [...] by way of electrical impulse, similar to a shark's lateral line. [...] This method is illustrated in the original Alien vs Predator PC game, and reused for the [...] "Predalien" [...] 28 years later. There is a cyclopean species of Xenomorph, which is the creature in its original form, it has a single large eye under its natural silicon / keratin forehead which can give the creature 180 degree vision. The larval stage or [...] "facehugger" [...] does have a single eye. Whatever the original host was is unknown, it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> on the Xenomorph's home planet. The Aliens' inner set of jaws are powerful enough to smash through bone and metal. How the creatures see is uncertain; in Alien 3, a spherical lens was used to illustrate the Alien's point of view, so, when the film was projected anamorphically, the image exhibited severe distortion. In the novelization of the movie Alien, the creature is held mesmerized by a spinning green light for several minutes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{spite of}} all the things he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> put up with in 30-something years, he's still there. ... In a {{political}} climate like Louisiana, he stayed head of a public institution for one-third of a century. He <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing <b>something</b> right.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Mr. Green {{was running}} through the papers, and {{as fast as he}} ran through them he {{permitted}} himself certain comments that passed for humor with his followers. There could be no doubt that in his own social stratum Mr. Green <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accounted <b>something</b> of a wag.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{never quite}} {{agreed with the}} popular opinion about what you were {{supposed}} to have done. It wasn't like you; there <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> that did not come out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} Rogers say {{a single word}} against Byron, which is rather [...] odd too. Byron wrote a bitter and undeserved satire on Rogers. This [...] conduct <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> motived by <b>something</b> or other." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well then, if {{all this}} was but a {{preparation}} for the doctrines of Christ, those doctrines themselves <b>must</b> surely <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> different, and more difficult? Oh no! John's preparation consisted in a complete rehearsal of the 'Drama didacticum', which Christ and the Apostles were to exhibit to a full audience!--Nay, prithee, good Barrister! do not be too rash in charging the Methodists with a monstrous burlesque of the Gospel! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An' it's the truth, Plums; but I can't {{make other}} folks believe it, not even you, {{on account of}} that advertisement. Everybody says I <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> up to <b>something</b> crooked, else the lawyers wouldn't try {{so hard to get}} hold of me." ...|$|R

50|$|It <b>must</b> therefore, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> of a {{shock when}} the Prussian vanguard under the Swiss General Lentulus, came {{streaming}} out of the woods. Wehla rallied his Croat regiment and formed his artillery but a well aimed Prussian cannonade swept through his Corps. Within {{a matter of minutes}} the Austrians were in full flight with their General captured and six hundred dead on the field. His hopes destroyed, von Daun was now forced to head west into Saxony himself, in order to shore up his forces there, leaving his Russian allies to face Frederick alone.|$|R
5000|$|... "Legislators <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> on <b>something</b> {{to zero in}} on this obscure organic {{substance}} ... The last time we checked, Illinois was not besieged by a salvia epidemic. We don't see the urgency in criminalizing a substance with no clear track record of causing people to act in a dangerous manner or hurt other people ... considering how overcrowded our prisons are with dangerous criminals, trolling around for more nonviolent drug offenders to punish is counterintuitive... Regulating use of, rather than banning salvia, would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a more sober approach." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why {{should he}} not come?" [...] There <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> {{in the tone}} of Mr. Greenwood's voice which had grated against the sick man's ears, or he would not have {{answered}} so sulkily.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> mighty bad, {{for the old}} man, who swears by him, looked rather troubled. And it was deuced queer, you know, this {{changing}} {{clothes with}} somebody, just before this surprise!" ...|$|E

[...] And so saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody.

He <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing <b>something</b> very wicked, and he ought to tell us all about it, to amuse us. I am sure you are a dreadful Parisian, Mr. Longueville. Remember that we are three dull, virtuous people, exceedingly bored with each other's society, and wanting to hear something strange and exciting. If it 's a little improper, that won't spoil it." ...|$|R
50|$|Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-1274) adapted and {{enhanced}} the argument {{he found in}} his reading of Aristotle and Avicenna to form {{one of the most}} influential versions of the cosmological argument.
