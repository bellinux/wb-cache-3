5|$|Logan {{comes over}} for dinner at Veronica’s house, and Keith becomes {{increasingly}} annoyed when Logan refuses to answer some questions. Veronica goes into Parker Lee's (Julie Gonzalo) room, where Veronica reveals that she was raped as well. A journalist interviews Parker, while Logan discusses finances with his accountant. Logan asks Veronica for help in searching through records {{in an attempt to}} catch the accountant. Meanwhile, a woman asks Keith to investigate her husband, who <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> an affair. Wallace informs Veronica that there was a Pi Sigma fraternity party the night of every rape. Later, Dick (Ryan Hansen) asks Veronica to prove that the fraternity is innocent, and Veronica agrees just to infiltrate the fraternity. Keith sees the husband getting into a car with several other women. He contacts Harmony, the woman, and presents the evidence.|$|E
5|$|On his day off, Nikumbh {{sets off}} to Mumbai, to visit Ishaan's parents. Nikumbh is {{surprised}} to learn that Ishaan is passionate about painting, and shows great talent in art. Nikumbh then asks Mr Awasthi as to why he sent Ishaan to a boarding school. Mr Awasthi replies that Ishaan was an ill-mannered boy and was a poor student. Nikumbh shows Ishaan's mother her son's notebooks and gives an analysis of the script. Nikumbh deduces that Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words. Mr Awasthi tries to dismiss it as a mere excuse for Ishaan's laziness. Nikumbh demonstrates what Ishaan experiences every day at school. He states that Ishaan has dyslexia as well as he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> other conditions, which make him a difficult child.|$|E

Scully learns that Skinner had been receiving treatment for a sleep disorder, in which he apparently had dreams about being suffocated in bed by an old woman. She fears that Skinner may have unwittingly killed Sayles in his sleep. However, Mulder believes that Skinner <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> visions of a succubus, a female demon, with the mention of similar symptoms of people's bad dreams they've experienced.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand forest {{relies heavily}} on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the woody plants have fruits that are {{probably}} dispersed by birds, which included the huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), pigeonwood (Hedycarya arborea) and various species of Coprosma are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio, and the diminishing range of many others, including the kiwi, weka, and kōkako, has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest. For plants with fruit greater than 1cm in diameter, kereru are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.|$|E

500|$|Interactions with Succinea sp. B <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> a {{significant}} impact on Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, as both species may be competing for food, breeding or wintering habitat. Hubricht (1985) reported that Succinea putris (Succinea sp. B of Hoagland and Davis) is a [...] "very common species within its range. I found no other Succineidae with it. It appears to crowd out all other species." [...] It does not appear that the other sympatric snail species (e.g., Oxyloma spp.) occurring at the Falls are having {{a significant}} impact on Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, as they are thought to be native species. There are no reports of disease or parasites threatening Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E

[...] Harris quotes Philip Weiss: [...] "Things are changing.... My perception is that the Jewish community, the Jewish progressives, are feeling licensed and rising up." [...] Weiss himself notes two recent developments: the launch by Jewish Voice for Peace of the Muzzlewatch Project dedicated to chronicling the alleged suppression of criticism of Israel, and the failure of the Zionist Organization of America to oust a liberal Jewish group from a national pro-Israel alliance.|$|E

2500|$|In 1993, under mayor Patrus Ananias de Souza, {{the city}} started {{a series of}} {{innovations}} based on its citizens having the [...] "right to food". These include, for example, creating farmers' markets in the town to enable direct sales and regularly surveying market prices and posting the results across the city. The city's process of participatory budgeting was linked with these innovations, {{as a result of}} which the infant mortality rate was reduced by 50% in a decade. There is some evidence that these programs have helped support a higher quality of life for the local farmers partnering with the city and that this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> positive effects on biodiversity in the Atlantic rainforest around the city. The city's development of these policies garnered the first [...] "Future Policy Award" [...] in 2009, awarded by the World Future Council, a group of 50 activists (including Frances Moore Lappé, Vandana Shiva, Wes Jackson, and Youssou N'Dour) concerned with the development and recognition of policies to promote a just and sustainable future.|$|E
