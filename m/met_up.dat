Here, the fire <b>met</b> <b>up</b> {{with the other}} branch of the fire which ate its way down present day Nørre Voldgade. Around midnight, the church Reformert Kirke was ablaze. The {{only place in the}} city where there was some control over the fire was around Vandkunsten.|$|E
5|$|Leeds {{lost the}} tie 4–2 on aggregate. On {{the day of}} the final in Copenhagen, Denmark, members of Leeds United's {{hooligan}} firm the Leeds United Service Crew, joined members of other British hooligan firms led by Arsenal's firm The Herd. In Copenhagen, they <b>met</b> <b>up</b> in order to enact revenge attacks on Galatasaray fans in City Hall Square.|$|E
5|$|Mukunda and Janaki <b>met</b> <b>up</b> {{with friends}} from college, {{who would later}} {{come to be known}} as Shyamasundar Das, Gurudas, Malati Dasi, and Yamuna Dasi. Teaming up with them, Mukunda rented a {{storefront}} in the San Francisco Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, which at that time was turning into the hub of the hippie counterculture, and stayed to take care of the developing new center.|$|E
50|$|Carrying {{the hopes}} and hatred of an entire city, Olerud got back at John Rocker. After a double steal, Olerud's two-run single put the <b>Mets</b> <b>up</b> 3-2 and Armando Benitez retired the Braves in order in the ninth to keep New York in the NLCS.|$|R
50|$|For {{the third}} {{game in the}} series, the Mets scored in the first with a double by Yoenis Céspedes that drove in David Wright off of Cubs starter, Kyle Hendricks. A home run by Kyle Schwarber tied {{the game in the}} bottom of the first. In the third, the Mets responded with Daniel Murphy's solo homer, his fifth {{consecutive}} postseason game with a home run, to put the <b>Mets</b> <b>up</b> 2-1. Jorge Soler's homer in the fourth again tied the game. The bottom fell out for the Cubs in the sixth when a wild pitch by Trevor Cahill (the losing pitcher) on strike three allowed Yoenis Céspedes to score, putting the <b>Mets</b> <b>up</b> 3-2.

5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff. A large wagon train left in July 1862 and <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide. Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E
5|$|Berge and Brundtland were {{introduced}} to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a drum machine together during the Tromsø techno scene before going their separate ways. Several years later, the two <b>met</b> <b>up</b> again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave. After experimenting with different genres of electronic music, the band solidified {{their place in the}} electronica scene with their 2001 debut album, Melody A.M., released on the Wall of Sound record label.|$|E
5|$|Development of MediEvil {{begun in}} late 1995 at {{independent}} developer Millennium Interactive in Cambridge. Chris Sorrell, previously {{known for the}} James Pond series of games, created the original concept for MediEvil and served as the game's creative director. Sorrell joined Millennium, {{with whom he had}} been working with for a while, after completing James Pond 3. When asked what he wanted to do, {{he said he wanted to}} work with someone on the visual side. Jason Wilson, who would be the designer and a writer for the game, <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with Sorrell and began working on MediEvil.|$|E
50|$|With the <b>Mets</b> <b>up</b> 5-2, deGrom {{shut the}} Cubs {{down with a}} perfect seventh inning, ending his night having only allowed four hits and two runs while {{striking}} out seven.

5|$|In 1926, when M-40 was extended, M-89 was rerouted out of Allegan to the {{southeast}} along its present-day alignment to terminate at US131 in Plainwell. Just a few years later, the road was extended further to {{the southeast}} to Richland then east along its present-day routing to end at M-96 in Augusta. In 1931, the route was realigned to run east, rather than south into Augusta, where it then <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with M-96 just inside the Calhoun County line. The road remained in this fashion for the next 20 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} act, {{a group of}} friends (including Sir Danvers Carew's {{daughter}} Agnes, attorney Gabriel Utterson, and Dr. and Mrs. Lanyon) has <b>met</b> <b>up</b> at Sir Danvers' home. Dr. Lanyon brings word that Agnes' fiancé, Dr. Henry Jekyll, will be late to the gathering. He then repeats a second-hand story about a man named Hyde, who injured a child in a collision on the street. The story upsets Utterson because Jekyll recently made a new will that gives his estate to a mysterious friend named Edward Hyde. Jekyll arrives; Utterson confronts him about the will, but Jekyll refuses to consider changing it.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the band}} had been offered {{large sums of money}} to reunite for concerts and tours, and had turned the offers down. Rumors of tension between de la Rocha and the other former band members {{subsequently}} circulated, but Commerford said that he and de la Rocha saw each other often and went surfing together, while Morello said he and de la Rocha communicated by phone, and had <b>met</b> <b>up</b> at a September 15, 2005 protest in support of the South Central Farm.|$|E
500|$|In Game 2, Jacob deGrom {{started for}} the Mets, and Johnny Cueto {{started for the}} Royals. The {{ceremonial}} first pitch was thrown out by Medal of Honor recipients Don Ballard, Charles Hagemeister, and Roger Donlon.

5|$|The {{band had}} already {{released}} their debut album, Survivors, in 1979 on an independent label, {{two months before}} Dickinson joined. Immediately following the completion of his University work, he <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with the band at Greenwich's Wood Wharf studios to learn the Survivors album. Although the tracks did not suit his vocal style, the band soon wrote {{the majority of the}} following Head On album in their earliest rehearsal sessions, some of which were immediately incorporated into their live set.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} was confusing {{for both}} sides, {{and the view}} was soon obscured by gunpowder smoke. Many ships on both sides were badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with Dutch and escorted them into the harbor of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached the beleaguered Danish town. The combined Danish and Dutch fleet now had control of the seas, forcing the Swedish fleet to seek refuge in the harbor of Landskrona on the Swedish mainland.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} events, Queen Margaret still {{considered}} Warwick {{a threat to}} the throne, and cut off his supplies. In August 1457, however, a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off fears of a full-scale French invasion. Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast. In disregard of royal authority, he then conducted highly successful acts of piracy, against the Castilian fleet in May 1458, and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later. He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip the Good of Burgundy. Developing a solid military reputation and with good international connections, he then brought a part of his garrison to England, where he <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with his father and York in the summer of 1459.|$|E

5|$|After {{undergoing}} trials {{following a}} refit, the Gnat <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with the Ladybird, {{who also had}} a ship's dog. However Judy had to be kept away as while he took a fancy to her, she did not care for him. In the early morning after the Ladybird departed, Judy alerted the ship {{to the presence of}} river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly tried to use her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure.|$|E
5|$|Agnew and Beverly {{moved to}} the Los Alamos Laboratory in March 1943. Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman first went to the University of Illinois, where the men {{disassembled}} the Cockcroft–Walton generator and particle accelerator while Beverly catalogued all the parts. The parts were shipped to New Mexico, where Agnew and Beverly <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, {{for the rest of}} the war. Agnew's job was to reassemble the accelerator, which was then used for experiments by John Manley's group.|$|E
5|$|Around 3 August García {{moved his}} entire army forward to Chunpich, and by October Spanish {{soldiers}} had established themselves near {{the source of}} the San Pedro River. By November Tzuktok' was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki; in that month García once again returned to Campeche. By December 1695 Ursúa was under pressure to complete the conquest of the Itza, and he approved the despatch of reinforcements along the Camino Real to join the main garrison. The reinforcements included 150 Spanish and pardo soldiers and 100 Maya soldiers, together with labourers and muleteers. An advance group of 150 mixed Maya and non-Maya soldiers <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with García at Campeche and proceeded southwards along the Camino Real towards the San Pedro River. The rest of the reinforcements did not leave Campeche until March 1696.|$|E

5|$|During {{his stay}} in London in late 1885, Abu Bakar {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} Meade for a formal recognition as the Sultan of Johor. He also <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with Queen Victoria, who had become a personal friend of Abu Bakar, within the same course of his visit. Queen Victoria consented to his wishes, and a treaty was signed on 11 December 1885 which formalised relations between Great Britain and Johor, was concluded between Abu Bakar and the Colonial Office. Abu Bakar also founded the state advisory board in London, which was intended to oversee state interests in London. Several retired officers from the Colonial Office, including William Fielding and Cecil Smith were personally appointed by Abu Bakar to oversee the board's administration.|$|E
5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909. They <b>met</b> <b>up</b> in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, the British staged an {{invasion}} of Kentucky {{with the help of}} their Native American allies, including Wyandots, Ottawas and Ojibwas. When Trigg received word of their attack on Bryan Station, he was commanding the fort at Harrodsburg. He quickly assembled 135 local militiamen and <b>met</b> <b>up</b> with Colonel Daniel Boone and Major Levi Todd and more militia at Bryan Station. When they approached the Blue Licks, a salt lick next to the Licking River, officers suspected a trap and convened a war council, but unruly troops lost patience and crossed the river. The three leaders formed a column each, with Trigg commanding the right. When they met with the opposing force, Trigg's column was ambushed. Trigg was killed and his men fell back after only five minutes of battle. When troops returned to the scene of battle, Trigg's body was found quartered.|$|E
