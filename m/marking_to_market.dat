40|$|This Article {{examines}} the relative strength of two imperfect accounting rules: historical cost and <b>mark</b> <b>to</b> <b>market.</b> The manifest inaccuracy of historical cost {{is well known}} and, paradoxically, one source of its hidden strength. Because private parties know of its evident weaknesses, they look elsewhere for information. In contrast, <b>mark</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> for hard-to-value assets has many hidden weaknesses. In this Article we show how it creates asset bubbles and exacerbates their negative collateral consequences once they burst. It does the former by allowing banks to adopt generous valuations in up-markets that increase their lending capacity. It does the latter by forcing the hand of counterparties to demand collateral, even when watchful waiting and inaction is the more efficient course of action when downward cascades generated by mark-to-market accounting might trigger massive sell-offs at prices below true asset value. The fears of private suits and regulatory sanctions on counterparties can compound the problem. <b>Mark</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> generates the functional equivalent of bank runs for which the functional equivalent of the automatic-stay rule in bankruptcy is the appropriate response...|$|R
50|$|A {{closely related}} {{contract}} is a forward contract. A forward {{is like a}} futures in that it specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified future date. However, a forward is not traded on an exchange and thus {{does not have the}} interim partial payments due to <b>marking</b> <b>to</b> <b>market.</b> Nor is the contract standardized, as on the exchange.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{practice}} of <b>marking</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> became more used by corporations and banks, some {{of them seem to}} have discovered that this was a tempting way to commit accounting fraud, especially when the market price could not be determined objectively (because there was no real day-to-day market available or the asset value was derived from other traded commodities, such as crude oil futures), so assets were being [...] "marked to model" [...] in a hypothetical or synthetic manner using estimated valuations derived from financial modeling, and sometimes marked in a manipulative manner to achieve spurious valuations. The most infamous use of mark-to-market in this way was the Enron scandal.|$|E
50|$|The {{risks that}} arise {{are the same}} that Banks have always faced: First, the {{solvency}} of the SIV {{may be at risk}} if the value of the long-term security that the SIV has bought falls below that of the short-term securities that the SIV has sold. Banks typically avoid this risk by not <b>marking</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> their loan portfolios. Second, there is a liquidity risk, as the SIV borrows short term and invests long term; i.e., outpayments become due before the inpayments are due. Unless the borrower can refinance short-term at favorable rates, he may be forced to sell the asset into a depressed market.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, all {{derivatives}} {{are treated}} as trading assets and are <b>marked</b> <b>to</b> <b>market.</b> However, as the crisis evolved and liquidity deteriorated, fair value assets held by banks increasingly became Level 3 inputs because their market prices became unobservable.|$|R
25|$|A futures {{account is}} <b>marked</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> daily. If the margin drops below the margin {{maintenance}} requirement {{established by the}} exchange listing the futures, a margin call will be issued to bring the account {{back up to the}} required level.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand {{it is argued that}} Asset {{managers}} and Custodians have a real problem valuing illiquid assets in their portfolios even though many of these assets are perfectly sound and the asset manager has no intention of selling them. Assets should be valued at <b>mark</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> prices as required by the Basel rules. However <b>mark</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> prices should not be used in isolation, but rather compared to model prices to test their validity. Models should be improved {{to take into account the}} greater amount of market data available. New methods and new data are available to help improve models and these should be used. In the end all prices start off from a model.|$|R
50|$|A {{closely related}} {{contract}} is a forward contract. A forward {{is like a}} futures in that it specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified future date. However, a forward is not traded on an exchange and thus {{does not have the}} interim partial payments due to <b>marking</b> <b>to</b> <b>market.</b> Nor is the contract standardized, as on the exchange.Unlike an option, both parties of a futures contract must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying asset to the buyer, or, if it is a cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures position can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss..|$|E
5000|$|Although the Basic and Alternative Methods {{end with}} these {{different}} tests, both begin by requiring a broker-dealer to compute its [...] "net capital." [...] To do so, the broker-dealer first computes its equity under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") by <b>marking</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> securities {{and other assets}} and then reduces that computation {{by the amount of}} [...] "illiquid assets" [...] it holds. The broker-dealer adds to this total the amount of any [...] "qualifying subordinated debt" [...] it owes. This preliminary amount is the broker-dealer's [...] "tentative net capital." [...] After so computing [...] "tentative net capital" [...] the broker-dealer adjust that amount by making further reductions in the value of its securities based on percentage reductions ("haircuts") in their market value. The amount of the [...] "haircut" [...] applied to a security depends upon its perceived [...] "risk characteristics." [...] A stock portfolio, for example, would have a haircut of 15%, while a 30-year U.S. treasury bond, because it is less risky, would have a 6% haircut.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the futures}} {{contract}} specifies a trade {{taking place in}} the future, the purpose of the futures exchange is to act as intermediary and mitigate the risk of default by either party in the intervening period. For this reason, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up an initial amount of cash (performance bond), the margin. Margins, sometimes set {{as a percentage of the}} value of the futures contract, need to be proportionally maintained at all times during the life of the contract to underpin this mitigation because the price of the contract will vary in keeping with supply and demand and will change daily and thus one party or the other will theoretically be making or losing money. To mitigate risk and the possibility of default by either party, the product is marked to market on a daily basis whereby the difference between the prior agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is settled on a daily basis. This is sometimes known as the variation margin where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party's margin account and put it into the other party's thus ensuring that the correct daily loss or profit is reflected in the respective account. If the margin account goes below a certain value set by the Exchange, then a margin call is made and the account owner must replenish the margin account. This process is known as [...] "marking to market". Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the spot value (i.e., the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by <b>marking</b> <b>to</b> <b>market).</b> Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates lots of income for the [...] "caller".|$|E
50|$|After the Enron scandal, {{changes were}} made <b>to</b> the <b>mark</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> method by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act during 2002. The Act {{affected}} <b>mark</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> by forcing companies to implement stricter accounting standards. The stricter standards included more explicit financial reporting, stronger internal controls to prevent and identify fraud, and auditor independence. In addition, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) {{was created by the}} Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the purpose of overseeing audits. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also implemented harsher penalties for fraud, such as enhanced prison sentences and fines for committing fraud. Although the law was created to restore investor confidence, the cost of implementing the regulations caused many companies to avoid registering on stock exchanges in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|A capped-style {{option is}} not an {{interest}} rate cap but a conventional option with a pre-defined profit cap written into the contract. A capped-style option is automatically exercised when the underlying security closes at a price making the option's <b>mark</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> match the specified amount.|$|R
50|$|Although {{short term}} horizons such as end of day, end of week, end of month matter in accounting, {{generally}} it is mere summing-up and the simplest <b>mark</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> processes {{that take place}} at these short term horizons. No scenario analysis or <b>mark</b> <b>to</b> future activities are usually undertaken for such short periods, except for very large portfolios.|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a tri-party repo {{is that a}} custodian bank or international clearing organization, the tri-party agent, acts as an intermediary {{between the two parties}} to the repo. The tri-party agent is responsible for the administration of the transaction including collateral allocation, <b>marking</b> <b>to</b> <b>market,</b> and substitution of collateral. In the US, the two principal tri-party agents are The Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase, whilst in Europe the principal tri-party agents are Euroclear and Clearstream with SIX offering services in the Swiss market. The size of the US tri-party repo market peaked in 2008 before the worst effects of the crisis at approximately $2.8 trillion and by mid-2010 was about $1.6 trillion.As tri-party agents administer the equivalent of hundreds of billions of USD of global collateral, they have the scale to subscribe to multiple data feeds to maximise the universe of coverage. As part of a tri-party agreement the three parties to the agreement, the tri-party agent, the repo buyer (the Collateral Taker/Cash Provider, [...] "CAP") and the repo seller (Cash Borrower/Collateral Provider, [...] "COP") agree to a collateral management service agreement which includes an [...] "eligible collateral profile". It is this [...] "eligible collateral profile" [...] that enables the repo buyer to define their risk appetite in respect of the collateral that they are prepared to hold against their cash. For example, a more risk averse repo buyer may wish to only hold [...] "on-the-run" [...] government bonds as collateral. In the event of a liquidation event of the repo seller the collateral is highly liquid thus enabling the repo buyer to sell the collateral quickly. A less risk averse repo buyer may be prepared to take non investment grade bonds or equities as collateral, which may be less liquid and may suffer a higher price volatility {{in the event of a}} repo seller default, making it more difficult for the repo buyer to sell the collateral and recover their cash. The tri-party agents are able to offer sophisticated collateral eligibility filters which allow the repo buyer to create these [...] "eligible collateral profiles" [...] which can systemically generate collateral pools which reflect the buyers risk appetite. Collateral eligibility criteria could include asset type, issuer, currency, domicile, credit rating, maturity, index, issue size, average daily traded volume, etc. Both the lender (repo buyer) and borrower (repo seller) of cash enter into these transactions to avoid the administrative burden of bi-lateral repos. In addition, because the collateral is being held by an agent, counterparty risk is reduced. A tri-party repo may be seen as the outgrowth of the due bill repo. A due bill repo is a repo in which the collateral is retained by the Cash borrower and not delivered to the cash provider. There is an increased element of risk when compared to the tri-party repo as collateral on a due bill repo is held within a client custody account at the Cash Borrower rather than a collateral account at a neutral third party.|$|E
