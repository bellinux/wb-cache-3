5|$|The pygmy slow loris mates {{once every}} 12–18 <b>months</b> and has {{one or two}} {{offspring}} after an average gestation period of six <b>months.</b> For the first few days, the young loris clings to the belly of its mother. After six <b>months</b> the baby will be weaned, the females reach sexual maturity by 16 <b>months,</b> while the male reaches maturity by about 18 <b>months.</b> The pygmy slow loris is seasonally fertile during the <b>months</b> of July and August. Chemical signals {{play a role in}} the reproductive behavior of female pygmy slow lorises. Urine scent markings have a strong characteristic odor and are used to communication information about social relationships.|$|E

5|$|A {{key feature}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps program was its {{accelerated}} training curricula. Participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 <b>months</b> to 30 <b>months.</b> They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets {{in the last six}} <b>months</b> before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent to that of a graduate nurse. During their first nine <b>months</b> of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.|$|E

5|$|Care {{of young}} is protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six <b>months,</b> among the longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several <b>months</b> at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill, with each chick fledging after four to six <b>months</b> and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen <b>months.</b> Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E
