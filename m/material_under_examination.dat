40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{two-dimensional}} materials have attracted incredible interest from the electronic device community. The first two-dimensional material studied in detail was graphene and, since 2007, it has intensively been explored as a material for electronic devices, in particular, transistors. While graphene transistors {{are still on}} the agenda, researchers have extended their work to two-dimensional materials beyond graphene and the number of two-dimensional <b>materials</b> <b>under</b> <b>examination</b> has literally exploded recently.

The intention of the present paper is to shed more light on the merits and drawbacks of two-dimensional materials for transistor electronics and to add a few more facets to the ongoing discussion on the prospects of two-dimensional transistors.

Low carbon steels must be featured by high plastic formability properties, since the production process consists in the piping of a rolled band, followed by an Electric Resistance Welding (ERW) of the edges. The optimal technological parameters have been identified performing welding tests at several levels of electric power, squashing length and forward velocity of the pipe along the coil axis. Several mechanical tests have been performed for {{the determination of the}} properties of the <b>materials</b> <b>under</b> <b>examination,</b> in order to characterize the main mechanical properties, i. e.

The microstructural characteristics of the steels have been obtained through micrographic analyses coupled with the use of Electron Back Scattered Diffraction techniques (EBSD).

40|$|A maximum superconductive {{transition}} temperature T_C = 203. 5 K {{has recently been}} reported for {{a sample of the}} binary compound tri-hydrogen sulfide (H_ 3 S) prepared at high pressure and with room temperature annealing. Measurements of T_C for H_ 3 S and its deuterium counterpart D_ 3 S have suggested a mass isotope effect exponent α with anomalous enhancements for reduced applied pressures. While widely cited for evidence of phonon-based superconductivity, the measured T_C is shown to exhibit important dependences on the quality and character of the H_ 3 S and D_ 3 S <b>materials</b> <b>under</b> study; <b>examination</b> of resistance versus temperature data shows that variations in T_C and apparent α are strongly correlated with residual resistance ratio, indicative of sensitivity to metallic order. Correlations also extend to the fractional widths of the superconducting transitions. Using resistance data to quantify and compensate for the evident materials differences between H_ 3 S and D_ 3 S samples, a value of α = 0. 043 ± 0. 140 is obtained. Thus, when corrected for the varying levels of disorder, the experimental upper limit (≤ 0. 183) lies well below α derived in phonon-based theories. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Neutrons are {{an ideal}} probe for {{understanding}} the microscopic structure and dynamics of the matter and its behaviour. They are mainly produced by the fission chain reaction in reactors or by some accelerator-based reactions such as the spallation. An increase of the neutron flux of reactors for a better instrumental resolution is limited by heat transfer problems. Even if pulsed reactors may partially overcome this limits, a more effective way to produce neutrons {{seems to be the}} spallation reaction because the amount of energy released per available neutron is smaller by an order of magnitude. Profiting of the significant advances in the accelerator technology during the past 20 years, a new spallation source has been planned. The specifications given for the European spallation source (ESS), a 2 x 5 MW linear accelerator as the power source, two target stations with different pulse repetition rates: short pulse target station (SPTS) at 50 Hz repetition rate, 1 #mu#s proton pulse length, long pulse target station (LPTS) at 16 _ 2 _/_ 3 s"-" 1 repetition rate, 2 ms proton pulse length, a peak neutron flux up to 2 x 10 " 1 " 7 n cm"-" 2 s"-" 1 for the SPTS, will, besides assuring the availability of a general purpose neutron source for the research, also enlarge its actual application field. A liquid metal target appeared to be the best choice in order to fulfil the given specifications for the neutron production and lifetime. In order to identify and solve the problems connected with the structural integrity of the liquid metal target within the specified operative conditions the international ASTE (AGS spallation target experiment) collaboration was created. Within this collaboration a liquid mercury target with a simplified geometry was built. In different experiments which took place between 1997 and 2001 various efforts in order to measure relevant quantities as pressure, strain or temperature under realistic conditions were done. Considerable experience was gained concerning the experimental techniques necessary to measure such quantities in a highly radioactive environment. The finite elements simulations of the problem besides giving results in good agreement with the experimental strain data, provided a better insight as far as the pressure measurements in the mercury are concerned. The estimated maximum stress values under the ESS operative conditions in the first critical instants after the beam energy deposition are still within the elasticity limits for the <b>materials</b> <b>under</b> <b>examination.</b> Nevertheless, the modifications in the mechanical properties induced by the irradiation and also by the probable corrosion and cavitation need further investigations.

40|$|Powder {{diffraction}} is {{a specialized}} technique whose investigatory limits are {{constrained by the}} scale of the crystallized substance being scanned versus the probe beam used.

We endeavored to construct a series of computational tools (the amalgamation of them known as 2 DPeakFinder) for refining and extracting this relevant data, toward the end of employing previously developed algorithms in the material's structural analysis.

Design, fabrication, and initial tests of a ``SQUID Microscope`` has been completed utilizing the extraordinary sensitivity of High-Critical-Temperature (HTC) Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) technology. SQUIDs, the most sensitive magnetic field detectors known, are used to sense magnetic anomalies caused by the perturbation of an induction field by defects in the <b>material</b> <b>under</b> <b>examination.</b> Time variation of the amplitude (A) and angle ({theta}) of an induction field with unique spatial distribution allows examination of material defects {{as a function of}} depth and orientation within the sample.

40|$|As of {{the present}} moment a fairly {{well-established}} concept of “attractiveness of nuclear materials” is widely used in scientific publications. This term implies that nuclear materials which {{are involved in the}} civil fuel cycle may be used for fabricating primitive nuclear explosive devices or even nuclear weapons. This concept serves as an instrument for comparative analysis of various nuclear materials as pertains to their possible diversion for unauthorized application. Attractiveness of nuclear materials is determined in the first place by the neutronics properties inherent to these materials. These properties include the capability of the <b>material</b> <b>under</b> <b>examination</b> to initiate self-sustained chain reaction because otherwise this material will be absolutely unattractive for the above-mentioned purposes.

40|$|Homicide {{rates have}} {{remained}} consistently high in Chicago {{in spite of}} a nationwide downward trend in the past decades. This thesis examines the effects of public housing policy on homicide rates in Chicago in order {{to see whether or not}} the city's decision to demolish high-rise public housing projects had the intended effect of lowering homicide rates. This thesis applies game theory to build a model on expected actions of relocated gang members. Spatial and traditional analysis methods are used to analyze data to see if the game theoretic prediction holds true, and if the city's policy choices produced the desired effects. The data used in the thesis is compiled from crime statistics from the Chicago Police Department and population data from the U. S. Census Bureau. Spatiotemporal analysis indicates that homicide rates decreased in areas where high-rise projects were demolished, but increased in other areas. A spatial lag model indicates that detrimental socioeconomic factors are correlated with homicide rates spatially. A regression model with fixed effects for community areas indicates that the presence of high-rise housing increases homicide rates. The results emphasize the need to consider possibly unintended consequences in public housing policy. Based on the literature and data, preventive measures are vital, as bad policies and designs present the risk of a downward spiral that is almost impossible to break once it has begun.

40|$|Aim of the study: Since {{there have}} been only few works {{reporting}} the diagnosis of kidneys using Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse technique and those works do not provide consistent results of shear wave velocity measurements in renal tissue, we have decided to use kidney phantoms with known properties to examine the reliability of the method itself in a controlled setup similar to kidneys examination. Materials and methods: Four gelatin-based phantoms imitating different clinical situations were manufactured – two with thick and two with thin renal cortex, each type at a depth similar to a normal-weight or overweight patient. For each phantom, a series of interest points was chosen and for each point 20 Shear Wave Velocity measurements were taken using the build-in Virtual Touch Tissue QuantificationTM tool in a Siemens Acuson S 2000 ultrasound scanner equipped with a 6 C 1 HD Transducer (Siemens Mountainview, USA). Results: Mean Shear Wave Velocity values obtained for all the examined points ranged from 2. 445 to 3. 941 m/s, with standard deviation exceeding 0. 1 in only one case out of 29 points, but differing significantly between all points. Conclusions: The obtained results indicate that the method is highly reliable as long as the measurement volume contains a uniform tissue region. If the measurement window covers a region with different properties even partially, the obtained results are affected. The variance of measured values on the other hand is not affected by the said non-uniformity of <b>material</b> <b>under</b> <b>examination.</b> Furthermore, the variance of measured values does not show a clear dependency on the depth at which the shear wave velocities are measured...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{the problem of}} {{safeguarding}} historical and artistic heritage, in Italy and in the world, has become increasingly more apparent. Along with this constant cultural growth, an accelerated technological development has occurred creating numerous methodologies and equipment, which are more effective and less intrusive towards researched heritage. In this article we intend to provide a concise re-evaluation of some applications that aim to conserve {{with the use of}} undisruptive multispectral methodologies conducted by us in recent years on mosaics, frescos, archaeological structures, wall vestments and graffiti in Ravenna, Rome and Pompeii. Simplified, {{it is a matter of}} collecting, with adapted cameras, and then studying, with the aid of a variety of mathematical techniques, an object's reflected or emitted radiation, not only dealing with visible spectrum, that the human eye can perceive, but also utilising the nearby infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) groups, invisible to us. In this publication we cannot describe every single technique that has been used in detail. Nevertheless, to provide an example, we can mention an outline of the reflectography, that also happens to be the first method that we experimented with. This is a multispectral enquiry in common use for the study of textile paintings; moreover, in various cases it has proven itself to be useful for wall paintings, and has recently been applied by us in an extensive manner to improve knowledge and preservation of mosaic surfaces located on walls. This type of monitoring is objective if it is performed with a systematic and well defined methodology. lt is also entirely non-invasive and allows the eventual identification of sub-superficial elements (contrition, preparatory drawings, interventions to restore surfaces and/or underlying material, etc.) through the use of acquired infrared images. It can also provide an expert user a qualitative description of the surface <b>materials</b> <b>under</b> <b>examination.</b> The possibility of comparing at least eight different images (corresponding to as many spectral bands) for each single region provides a large quantity of often undervalued information. In other words, this process analyses the same subject from eight distinct points of view and it allows us to make a comparison: a patient and competent scholar of various reflectography images is like an expert musician listening to a choir, with his own experience and expert opinion being able to distinguish the scores of single voices thus developing a sort of stratigraphy of the musical piece. Before describing the area of our research we would like to quickly spend a few moments trying to clarify the meaning of the chosen title. The first part obviously refers to the object of our research, even if the terni image is intended in an allembracing way: a representation of a work of art allowed by the tools applied, not necessarily mimetic of the work <b>under</b> <b>examination</b> (as suggested by the meaning of the word image), but in some cases very different in respect to the impression that an observer could perceive. The second part aims to underline an important aspect of our research, that as the years have gone by we have continued learning how to value. In fact, in virtue of the technical means and mathematics at out disposition, today it is possible to produce a large quantity of data and thus images of the studied heritage. However, a growth of information actually useful for our knowledge and ability to preserve does not automatically derive from this. The risk is that we could lose ourselves in descriptions which are too analytical, not grasping synthetic aspects, capable of suggesting something new that we did not already understand or that had not been adequately figured out, which might be able to guide us towards the maximum conservation of the works of art to insure their integrity for those who follow us. So, in certain cases what occurs for interpreting the images is not only a precise methodology 171 - that is certainly essential - but also a special aptitude, nourished by vast experience, a knowledge which is in a certain way craftsmanship, that in various aspects seems to be dose to an art. In fact, there are some similarities, like imagination, quick and infiltrating intuition yet the patience to experiment and to lead ourselves without preconception towards new solutions by what we discover bit by bit. In conclusion, even if it is easy to remain fascinated by the extraordinary possibilities offered by modern technology, amplified by processing on evermore powerful computers, in our opinion to obtain real progress the contribution of fully developed and mature professionals, as mentioned above, will always remain essential...|$|R
