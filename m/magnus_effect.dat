5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the <b>Magnus</b> <b>effect,</b> every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, <b>Magnus</b> <b>effect</b> of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} the {{equations}} of motion for a spinning ballistic projectile. The goal of such an examination {{is to determine the}} possible mechanisms by which a directed energy weapon may induce sufficient instability as to significantly alter the projectile's flight path. A ballistic projectile is generally launched with a "fire and forget" philosophy. The desired impact point is determined before firing. It may be possible to alter the projectile {{in such a way that}} it fails to follow the desired trajectory thereby missing the intended target. Several variables appear to be worthy of investigation to assess their contribution to a required instability or range reduction. Skin friction drag may be increased from surface roughness generated by a pulsed energy source. The results that this thesis will examine include: impulse generated by the laser interaction, additional <b>Magnus</b> <b>effects</b> and aerodynamic drag. Moment induced instability may also result from these in the form of a Magnus moment or drag torque. Increasing the drag force appears to be the most promising theoretical solution to defeating an incoming spinning ballistic projectile. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

25|$|The {{motion of}} a ball is {{generally}} described by projectile motion (which {{can be affected}} by gravity, drag, the <b>Magnus</b> <b>effect,</b> and buoyancy), while its impact is usually characterized through the coefficient of restitution (which can {{be affected by the}} nature of the ball, the nature of the impacting surface, the impact velocity, rotation, and local conditions such as temperature and pressure). To ensure fair play, many sports governing bodies set limits on the bounciness of their ball and forbid tampering with the ball's aerodynamic properties.|$|E
25|$|Seam {{deliveries}} can be bowled at any pace, {{but most}} specialist seamers bowl at medium, medium-fast or fast-medium pace. The basic technique of seam bowling is {{to employ the}} normal fast bowling or slower ball grip {{and to try to}} ensure that the seam remains upright until the ball hits the pitch. If the seam is upright and the ball is spinning around its horizontal axis, there is no appreciable <b>Magnus</b> <b>effect</b> and the ball will not move in the air. The seam of the ball is raised and will cause variations in bounce and movement if it is {{the first part of the}} ball to hit the pitch.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first general metric for attractor overlap (MAO) facilitating an {{unsupervised}} data comparison. The {{starting point is}} two or more attractors, i. e. ensembles of states representing different operating conditions. The proposed metric quantifies the overlap between these attractors in three steps. First, all states are clustered into discrete centroid-based bins. Second, the probability distribution of each operating condition is determined. Third, the pairwise similarity of attractors is assessed with a cluster-based pseudometric for the probability distributions. MAO is augmented by proximity maps for the snapshots, the clusters, and the attractors. We demonstrate MAO for seven different control laws applied to the fluidic pinball, i. e. the flow around three circular cylinders whose centers form an equilateral triangle pointing in the upstream direction. These seven different operating conditions comprise unforced shedding, boat tailing, base bleed, high- and low-frequency forcing {{as well as two}} opposing <b>Magnus</b> <b>effects.</b> MAO compares and classifies these actuated flows in agreement with physical intuition. Moreover, the overlap and difference of the attractors are identified via shared and unshared clusters. MAO has a large spectrum of potential applications ranging from a quantitative comparison between numerical simulations and experimental particle image velocimetry data to the analysis of simulations representing a myriad of different operating conditions.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{depinning}} and nonequilibrium phases of collectively interacting particle systems driven over random or periodic substrates. This {{type of system}} is relevant to vortices in type-II superconductors, sliding charge density waves, electron crystals, colloids, stripe and pattern forming systems, and skyrmions, and could also have connections to jamming, glassy behaviors, and active matter. These systems are ideal for exploring the broader issues of characterizing transient and steady state nonequilibrium flow phases as well as nonequilibrium phase transitions between distinct dynamical phases, analogous to phase transitions between different equilibrium states. We discuss elastic and plastic depinning on random substrates and {{the different types of}} nonequilibrium phases that produce features in the velocity-force curves, fluctuation spectra, scaling relations, and local or global particle ordering. We describe how these quantities change depending on dimension, anisotropy, disorder strength, and the presence of hysteresis. Within the moving phase we discuss transitions from a liquid-like state to dynamically ordered moving crystal, smectic, or nematic states. Systems with periodic or quasiperiodic substrates can have multiple nonequilibrium transitions in the moving state between chaotic and coherent phases, and can exhibit hysteresis. We also discuss systems with competing repulsive and attractive interactions, which undergo dynamical transitions into stripes and other complex morphologies when driven over random substrates. Throughout this work we highlight open issues and future directions such as absorbing phase transitions, nonequilibrium work relations, inertia, the role of non-dissipative dynamics such as <b>Magnus</b> <b>effects,</b> and how these results could be extended to the broader issues of plasticity in crystals, amorphous solids, and jamming phenomena.

25|$|Bowlers {{are also}} {{able to get the}} ball to move {{sideways}} by using either spin or swing. Adding a spin to a cricket ball will make it deviate due to the <b>Magnus</b> <b>effect</b> in its flight, and then produce sideways movement off the ground. Swing is obtained by using air pressure differences caused by angling the seam of the cricket ball to produce a lateral movement in the air. Fast bowlers will generally only use swing to obtain movement, but medium pace and slow bowlers will often use a combination of the two. The intention is that in creating movement in the delivery, the batsman will misjudge the line of the ball as it arrives, causing him to miss it entirely, in which case he may be dismissed bowled or lbw, or miss-hit it, in which case he may be out caught.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic skyrmions are particle-like topological {{excitations}} in ferromagnets, {{which have}} the topological number Q=± 1, and hence show the skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE) due to the <b>Magnus</b> force <b>effect</b> originating from the topology. Here, we propose the counterpart of the magnetic skyrmion in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) system, that is, the AFM skyrmion, which is topologically protected but without showing the SkHE. Two approaches for creating the AFM skyrmion have been described based on micromagnetic lattice simulations: (i) by injecting a vertical spin-polarized current to a nanodisk with the AFM ground state; (ii) by converting an AFM domain-wall pair in a nanowire junction. It is demonstrated that the AFM skyrmion, driven by the spin-polarized current, can move straightly over long distance, benefiting from {{the absence of the}} SkHE. Our results will open a new strategy on designing the novel spintronic devices based on AFM materials. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

The blended polymers consisted of a blue emitting polymer and a charge transport polymer. The effect of the interlayer design on the electrical and electroluminescent characteristics of these hybrid LEDs was investigated. We demonstrated that by adding a calcium (2) acetylacetonate [Ca(acac) (2) ] layer between the blended polymer layer and the ZnO nanorods, an increase in device performance was observed. The purpose of the extra layer was {{to act as a}} band offset stepping layer (offset divider). Moreover, the effect of the stepper layer thickness for this offset stepping layer was studied.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} and velocity-force curves of a skyrmion moving over a two-dimensional periodic substrate using simulations of a particle-based skyrmion model, {{focusing on the}} role of the non-dissipative Magnus term. In the overdamped limit, the skyrmion depins into a sliding state with a Hall angle of zero. When a Magnus term is included, the Hall angle is nonzero in the absence of a substrate. On a periodic substrate, the Hall angle varies with the drive amplitude. Due to the substrate symmetry the Hall angle does not change continuously with drive, but forms a series of discrete steps at rational ratios of the skyrmion velocity components perpendicular and parallel to the drive direction, when the skyrmion motion locks to symmetry directions of the substrate for fixed intervals of the drive amplitude. On each step, the Hall angle is constant and the skyrmion motion is orderly. Transitions between locked phases generate pronounced cusps in the velocity-force curves, as well as regions of negative differential mobility. The number of observable locking steps increases when the relative strength of the Magnus term increases. We find an overshoot phenomena where the Hall angle exceeds the clean limit value, as well as an acceleration effect where the skyrmion moves faster over a substrate than through a clean sample. These effects are robust for different types of periodic substrates. With a simple model for a skyrmion interacting with a single pin, we can capture the behavior of the Hall angle. The Magnus term induces a curvature in the skrymion orbit as it moves through the pin, resulting in a side step phenomenon that decreases with increasing drive. When the Magnus term is large, the range of impact parameters that permit the skyrmion to be trapped by the pin is small, which is a reasons that strong <b>Magnus</b> force <b>effects</b> reduce the pinning in skyrmion systems.
