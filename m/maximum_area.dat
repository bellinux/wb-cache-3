Maize, mixed beans, rice, sorghum, soya beans, sunflower, sweet potatoes and wheat were the major crops in the provinces. Among all provinces, Central had the <b>maximum</b> <b>area,</b> , constituting 20.64 per cent, while Luapula had the smallest area at 3.06 per cent of the total area. Maize production was maximum in Eastern (22.5%), mixed beans (51.66%) in Northern, sorghum in Southern (40.62%), sunflower in Eastern (70.2%), soya beans (45.06%), sweet potatoes (28.5%) and wheat (49.51%) in Central Province.|$|E

25|$|The central Sahara is {{estimated}} to include five hundred species of plants, which is extremely low considering the huge extent of the area. Plants such as acacia trees, palms, succulents, spiny shrubs, and grasses have adapted to the arid conditions, by growing lower to avoid water loss by strong winds, by storing water in their thick stems {{to use it in}} dry periods, by having long roots that travel horizontally to reach the <b>maximum</b> <b>area</b> of water and to find any surface moisture, and by having small thick leaves or needles to prevent water loss by evapotranspiration. Plant leaves may dry out totally and then recover.|$|E

2500|$|Matthew Stout gives many {{examples}} of why the people who built these structures chose a circular formation. [...] First of all, they had strategic advantages. Circular sites allowed for a broad perspective of the surrounding area and allowed the <b>maximum</b> <b>area</b> to be enclosed relative to the bank constructed. He also comes up with some much more metaphysical theories. He suggests that a circular formation linked the site and its occupants with the circular burial mounds of their ancestors. About {{a third of all}} Irish hillforts have mounds or cairns within them. [...] The Aileach is no exception. He also puts forward the idea that a circular form was favoured because corners could act as a dwelling-place of evil spirits. He bases these claims on ethnographic comparisons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{method of}} making flat panes of clear glass from blown {{cylinders}} began in Germany and evolved through the Middle Ages, until being perfected by the Venetians {{in the sixteenth}} century. The Venetians began using lead glass for its crystal-clarity and its easier workability. Some time during the early Renaissance, European manufacturers perfected a superior method of coating glass with a tin-mercury amalgam, producing an amorphous coating with better reflectivity than crystalline metals and causing little thermal shock to the glass. The exact date and location of the discovery is unknown, but in the sixteenth century, Venice, a city famed for its glass-making expertise, became a center of mirror production using this new technique. Glass mirrors from this period were extremely expensive luxuries. For example, in the late seventeenth century, the Countess de Fiesque {{was reported to have}} traded an entire wheat farm for a mirror, considering it a bargain. These Venetian mirrors were limited in size to a <b>maximum</b> <b>area</b> of around [...] square, until modern glass panes began to be produced during the Industrial Revolution. The Saint-Gobain factory, founded by royal initiative in France, was an important manufacturer, and Bohemian and German glass, often rather cheaper, was also important.|$|E
60|$|So {{far as we}} {{can judge}} without a close and uncongenial {{scrutiny}} of statistics, that daily journey, that has governed and still to a very considerable extent governs the growth of cities, has had, and probably always will have, a maximum limit of two hours, one hour each way from sleeping place to council chamber, counter, workroom, or office stool. And taking this assumption as sound, we can state precisely the <b>maximum</b> <b>area</b> of various types of town. A pedestrian agglomeration such as we find in China, and such as most of the European towns probably were before the nineteenth century, would be swept entirely by a radius of four miles about the business quarter and industrial centre; and, under these circumstances, where the area of the feeding regions has been very large the massing of human beings has probably reached its extreme limit.[16] Of course, {{in the case of a}} navigable river, for example, the commercial centre might be elongated into a line and the circle of the city modified into an ellipse with a long diameter considerably exceeding eight miles, as, for example, in the case of Hankow.|$|E
