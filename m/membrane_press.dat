To aid in the sedimentation process, flocculants and coagulants are added to reduce the repulsive forces between the particles. This repulsive force is due to the double layer formed on the surface of the particles. The flocculants work by binding multiple particles together while the coagulants work by reducing the thickness of the charged layer on the outside of the particle. After thickening, slurry is often stored in ponds or impoundments.

The enrichment and {{depletion of the}} main triacylglycerols in the liquid and solid phase was plotted {{as a function of}} the crystallization degree of the oil. It was shown that for the given conditions and palm olein composition, the initial crystals mainly consisted of PPP, diacylglycerols, POP and PLP. At higher crystallization degrees, a sharp viscosity increase in the crystal suspension was primarily related to an obvious decrease of POP but also of POS in the recovered superolein, while the general crystallization rate of the system remained unchanged. Rather than a change in crystallization rate of POP, a change in the ratio between the crystallizing monounsaturated triacylglycerols is linked with the high viscosity of the crystal slurry. For a comparable degree of crystallization, the superolein of the more viscous crystal slurry, obtained through a <b>membrane</b> <b>press</b> filtration up to 15 bar, was more unsaturated than the superolein filtered from the less viscous slurry. Consequently, the high unsaturation in the corresponding soft palm mid fraction is only the result of an incomplete phase separation, and not due to an increased intersolubility of unsaturated triacylglycerols in the crystals. status: publishe...|$|E

Separation of the clear liquor and the calcium carbonate is done by filtration. The filter station at the refinery consists of 13 rotary leaf filters and four plate and frame filters.

40|$|The {{attention}} and {{respect of the}} qualitative aspects of wine production has brought about an ever increasing respect for the products utilised in all phases of transformation. In particular, the interaction of mechanical influences {{is considered one of}} the possible critical points in the wine making process (De Vita, De Vita 2004). There are numerous technological innovations aimed at reducing the effects of direct contact with mechanical influences; recent examples refer to the diffusion of a particular type of oenological pumps (peristaltic, mohno, etc.), pumpover systems (carbon air type, rotary, etc.) and the general utilisation of polymeric or elastic materials (De Vita, De Vita 2004). The more important technical innovation could very well regard the introduction of pneumatic presses (Eynard I, 1986) that up until the 70 ’s permitted a significant improvement in the initial phases of grape processing. The current availability of pneumatic presses able to work efficiently, with pressure levels that rarely exceed 2 bar, may lead one to believe that the evolution of this machinery has reached its maturation. This is absolutely not the case if one thinks of new construction principles and the utilisation of new materials. A recent innovation, still not widely embraced or diffused, is the central tubular <b>membrane</b> <b>press</b> built entirely of elastic materials. This solution was created with the intention of uniting the prestige qualities of a central membrane (improved relationship between drainage surface and pomace thickness) with the advantage of an elastic membrane (improved cleaning and homogeneous distribution of pressure when low pressure is utilised).

40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} {{are important}} constituents {{of white wine}} that can impart bitterness and astringency and influence stability and colour. The specific types and concentrations of phenolic compounds vary between the different grape tissues. For example grape skins contain much higher concentrations of phenolics than grape pulp. Consequently, grape processing techniques, particularly the method by which juice is expressed, can influence the phenolic profile of white wines. Concerns of elevated phenolic levels tend to lead to conservative practices such as limiting the time between machine harvesting and winery processing, {{and the use of}} relatively expensive batch draining and pressing equipment. Phenolic extraction during pomace contact, such as might occur after machine harvesting prior to winery processing, was investigated at a controlled laboratory scale. Contact time significantly increased phenolic extraction as did the fraction of broken berries. However, given the uncertainty in the amount of berry breakage in industrial practice, full scale transport trials should be performed by wineries where economic advantage could be gained from relaxing restriction on times between harvesting and winery processing. Techniques used for white grape juice expression both now and in the past were critically reviewed and winery sampling was performed to develop a practical understanding of operational issues. For the expression of juice from white grapes, pneumatic membrane presses have been increasingly adopted both for pressing and draining. This is principally a product of their ability to express high yields of juice with relatively low levels of phenolics and suspended solids. These devices can be operated in many different manners and quality and productivity is highly dependent on the specific mode of operation. Adaptive programmes based principally on continuous assessment of juice flow rate, and the use of conductivity measurement to monitor skin extraction are important tools that can aid economic optimisation of expression operations. The principal problem with the pneumatic <b>membrane</b> <b>press</b> {{is that it is a}} batch operation with a relatively low throughput. In the longer term, the ideal outcome would be the development of expression equipment that achieved the high throughput and relatively low cost per tonne of continuous inclined drainers and screw presses, while still maintaining the quality obtained with pneumatic membrane presses. Continuous devices that mimic the repeated cycles of compression and crumbling of these batch presses may be one means of achieving this. Exploration of the different continuous screw presses used historically suggests that there still may be room for improvement in these devices. This merits further specific investigation. Experiments involving repeated cycles of compression and crumbling were performed with a constant rate laboratory apparatus. These experiments demonstrated the importance of bed height, pressing speed, sieve plate design and crumbling on press operation. Solids content appears to be a major issue in the development of rapid juice expression equipment. One means of achieving appropriately low solids levels, without requiring large devices with large cake beds for juice filtration, may be to maintain the structure of the grape for as long as possible so that juice is filtered as it is expelled from the berry.

40|$|AbstractStrong {{adhesion}} {{of highly}} active cells often nucleates focal adhesions, synapses, and related structures. Red cells lack such complex adhesion systems {{and are also}} nonmotile, but they are shown here to dynamically evolve complex spatial patterns beyond an electrostatic threshold for strong adhesion. Spreading of the cell onto a dense, homogeneous poly-L-lysine surface appears complete in < 1 s with occasional blisters that form and dissipate on a similar timescale; distinct rippled or stippled patterns in fluorescently labeled membrane components emerge later, however, on timescales more typical of long-range lipid diffusion (approximately minutes). Within the contact zone, the anionic fluorescent lipid fluorescein phosphoethanolamine is seen to rearrange, forming worm-like rippled or stippled domains of < 500 nm that prove independent of whether the cell is intact and sustaining a tension or ruptured. Lipid patterns are accompanied by visible perturbations in Band 3 distribution and weaker perturbations in <b>membrane</b> skeleton actin. <b>Pressing</b> down on the membrane quenches the lipid patterns, revealing a clear topographical basis for pattern formation.

Traditionally, ion exchange membranes, separated by non-conductive spacers, are used in this technology. As an alternative for these non-conductive spacers, in this work, heterogeneous ion exchange <b>membranes</b> were hot <b>pressed</b> in the dry state to create a profiled membrane comprising 230 – 245 μm ridges (in wet state) {{on one side of}} the membrane. Stacking such profiled membranes creates channels for the feed water, thus make the use of spacers obsolete. The performance of a RED-stack with such profiled membranes was compared for the first time with a RED-stack with traditional, non-conductive spacers. The ohmic resistance was significantly lower for the stack with profiled membranes compared to that with spacers, whereas the boundary layer resistance was higher. This resulted in slightly higher power densities for the stack with profiled membranes. Despite this small improvement, profiled membranes have a strong future development potential. Experimental data show that the hydraulic friction is much lower for the stack with profiled membranes and hence higher Reynolds numbers are possible than in a stack with spacers. Furthermore, profiling membranes allow much freedom to create new profile geometries where a hydrodynamic flow can be combined with efficient mixing in the boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} plasmas have on polymer {{electrolyte}} membranes such as Nafion is important if plasma technologies {{are to be}} employed in the fabrication of MEA components. An argon plasma {{has been used to}} treat the surface of Nation membranes at several energy doses from 0 to 3. 056 J cm(- 2). The effect of the treatment has been characterised using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) as well as measuring water contact angles, proton conductivity and electrical performance. It was found that as energy dose is increased, hydrophobicity of the membrane decreases, as does proton conductivity. The water contact angle for untreated Nafion is around 120 degrees while the surface treated with the maximum dose has a contact angle of 50 degrees. Similarly the proton conductivity drops from above 200 to 35. 8 mS cm(- 1). SEM and AFM results showed only a small change in the surface roughness of the treated samples while XPS results indicated a marked reduction in the concentration of fluorine at the surface of the membrane for increasing dose. Fuel cell electrical performance was also very poor for the treated membranes and this was attributed to the decrease in conductivity as well as an observed poor adherence between electrode and <b>membrane</b> in the <b>pressed</b> MEA.

The most important structural components of the wall are long cellulose microfibrils, which are synthesized by synthases embedded in the plasma membrane. A fundamental question is how the microfibrils become oriented during deposition at the plasma membrane. The current textbook explanation for the orientation mechanism is a guidance system mediated by cortical microtubules. However, too many contraindications are known in secondary cell walls {{for this to be}} a universal mechanism, particularly in the case of helicoidal arrangements, which occur in many situations. An additional construction mechanism involves liquid crystalline self-assembly [A. C.

Therefore, we have asked whether the complex ordered texture of helicoidal cell walls can be formed in the absence of direct cellular guidance mechanisms. We propose that they can be formed by a mechanism that is based on geometrical considerations. It explains the genesis of the complicated helicoidal texture and shows that the cell has intrinsic, versatile tools for creating a variety of textures.

One of the objectives of this thesis was to show that conventional ltration theories are di cult to use when the system to be modelled contains all of the stages and features that are present in a complete solid/liquid separation process. Furthermore, most of the ltration theories require experimental work to be performed {{in order to obtain}} critical parameters required by the theoretical models. Creating a good overall understanding of how the variables a ect the nal product in ltration is somewhat impossible on a purely theoretical basis. The complexity of solid/liquid separation processes require experimental work and when tests are needed, it is advisable to use experimental design techniques so that the goals can be achieved. The statistical design of experiments provides the necessary tools for recognising the e ects of variables. It also helps to perform experimental work more economically. Design of experiments is a prerequisite for creating empirical models that can describe how the measured response is related to the changes in the values of the variable. A software package was developed that provides a ltration practitioner with experimental designs and calculates the parameters for linear regression models, along with the graphical representation of the responses. The developed software consists of two software modules. These modules are LTDoE and LTRead. The LTDoE module is used to create experimental designs for di erent lter types. The lter types considered in the software are automatic vertical pressure lter, double-sided vertical pressure lter, horizontal <b>membrane</b> lter <b>press,</b> vacuum belt lter and ceramic capillary action disc lter. It is also possible to create experimental designs for those cases where the variables are totally user de ned, say for a customized ltration cycle or di erent piece of equipment.
