50|$|Because of {{destruction}} during recent war, few historic wat <b>murals</b> remain in Cambodia. In the 1960s, art historians Guy and Jacqueline Nafilyan photographed 19th-century <b>murals,</b> providing {{a record of}} this lost cultural heritage. The best known surviving <b>murals</b> are at the Silver Pagoda in Phnom Penh, Wat Rajabo in Siem Reap province, and Wat Kompong Tralach Leu in Kompong Chhnang Province. In the last decade, wat <b>murals</b> have seen a resurgence, but Cambodia's surviving older <b>murals</b> are generally more refined and detailed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>murals</b> are {{on public}} {{display at the}} governor’s palace. Unlike {{traditional}} <b>murals</b> that are pained directly onto the wall, Castro Pacheco’s <b>murals</b> are unique, “transportable murals.” Because the <b>murals</b> were not “produced and conceived on the walls, {{in relation to the}} architecture” his <b>murals</b> cannot be considered part of the traditional “Mexican Renaissance” of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part. Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective, the <b>murals</b> appear as large format paintings, Castro Pacheco does not rely upon “exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives” in these works the images are merely of large proportion.|$|R

5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; the <b>mural</b> of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's original tracing of the drawing was missing, and he could not remember the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's original drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of the <b>mural</b> in 1988. He was, by then, not fit enough to restore the actual <b>mural.</b>|$|E

5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} {{improvement of the}} ancient breast harness was the horse collar. The horse collar was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) <b>mural</b> at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential collar cushion behind the cross bar, though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) <b>mural</b> of about 851 accurately displays the cushioned collar behind the cross bar. An earlier painting of the Sui Dynasty (581–618) accurately depicted the horse collar as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{all forms}} of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several {{complaints}} regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked {{the view of the}} coast. In 1981, an illegal <b>mural</b> that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the <b>mural</b> of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Lazzell {{was one of}} two West Virginians who {{received}} Federal Art Project grants through the Works Progress Administration. That same year she created a <b>mural</b> for a court room in the Monongalia County Courthouse entitled, Justice. The <b>mural</b> took fourteen weeks to complete. The <b>mural</b> is currently displayed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. She continued experimenting with woodprints and, in 1935, studied with the renowned German abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann in Provincetown. Hofmann's push/pull spatial theory is evident in the asymmetry of her later works. Lazzell's studies of flowers were inspired by her lavish potted gardens, such as Star Phlox (1931). Her 1948 floral print, Red and White Petunia, won first prize at the American Color Print Society exhibition. A collection of her prints are housed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University.|$|E
