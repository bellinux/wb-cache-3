25|$|In the mid 30s tastes {{changed and}} heavily {{modelled}} ware came into vogue. The <b>My</b> <b>Garden</b> series issued from 1934 onwards led the way, with small flowers modelled as a handle or base on more rounded shapes. These were fully painted in bright colours – {{the body of}} the ware was covered in thin colour washes – 'Verdant' was green, 'Sunrise' yellow and so on. The range included vases, bowls, jugs, a biscuit barrel, and proved very popular as gift ware. It was produced in more muted colours, right until {{the start of the war}} in 1939.|$|E

500|$|From about 1920 Frise {{shared an}} {{office with the}} {{journalist}} and Vimy ridge veteran Greg Clark (1892–77). [...] They became friends, and Frise began providing colour illustrations to Clark's tales in the Star of the pair's misadventures in Toronto—Frise tall and gangly, and Clark short and stout. [...] A selection appeared in a volume titled Which We Did in 1936. [...] Frise talked of their blunderings to the Star: [...] "We've fried eggs on the city hall steps. We caulked my house and flooded the parlor with cement. I once let Greg persuade {{me to get a}} steam shovel to do my spring digging and ruined <b>my</b> <b>garden.</b> Perhaps this book is our most foolish adventure." ...|$|E

Harrison commented on gardening {{as a form of}} escapism: [...] "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in <b>my</b> <b>garden,</b> but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'" [...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: [...] "George is not disowning the Beatles... but {{it was a long time}} ago and actually a short part of his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Potter was at Hill Top in July 1906 {{during the}} {{development}} of Miss Moppet, and the kitten she borrowed as a model from a mason from Windermere was a difficult subject. [...] "n exasperating model," [...] Potter wrote, [...] "I have borrowed a Kitten and I am rather glad of the opportunity of working at the drawings. It is very young and pretty and a most fearful pickle." [...] Biographer Linda Lear explains that [...] "pickle" [...] was a word Potter used to describe [...] "free-thinking exuberant people, like her cousin Caroline, or mischievous kittens and small children." [...] Potter used the same drawings of the kitten {{as a model for}} her next book, The Tale of Tom Kitten, which she dedicated in 1907 [...] "to all Pickles—especially those that get upon <b>my</b> <b>garden</b> wall". Miss Moppet is one of Tom Kitten's sisters, and appears as a character in both books featuring him: The Tale of Tom Kitten and The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding (1908).|$|E

'Neighbor, <b>my</b> <b>garden</b> hose cost me $15; you have to pay me $15 for it' …I don't want $15 — I want <b>my</b> <b>garden</b> hose back after the fire is over."

Kohsar Market is a popular shopping and cafe spot for the city's elite and expatriates.

2500|$|Such a fruit {{as the one}} {{shown in}} the {{illustration}} grew one year ago in <b>my</b> <b>garden,</b> and I hope to grow more of those. This fruit is pointed above and has at the top a small long distaff (- the pitom); {{it has a very}} pleasant smell, very like that of the Florentine citron described below. It contains very little juice and tastes somewhat sour and also somewhat bitter. As it seems, this plant thrives better in pots, than standing in the ground, for this tree of mine has remained very short in height, and its branches have not overgrown the [...] stalk.|$|E
2500|$|One day {{he asked}} me to do his portrait. I agreed with joy, all the more so because his head and his whole {{personality}} [...] {{seemed to me to be}} perfect models for emphasising the plastic elements I was trying to develop. His face with clearly demarcated surfaces that made up a passionate interplay of facets, his hair in dark masses projecting lightly in waves over his temples, his solidly constructed body - straightaway suggested to me equivalences, echoes , interpenetrations, rhythmic correspondences with the surrounding elements, fields, trees, houses. So I suggested painting him in <b>my</b> <b>garden,</b> where I found easily to hand an environment that was highly suitable for my model.|$|E
