5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (<b>mydriasis).</b> Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|Turbinellus floccosus is {{poisonous}} to {{some people}} who eat it, but has been consumed without incident by others. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A tricarboxylic acid known as α-tetradecylcitric acid {{may be responsible for}} the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to <b>mydriasis,</b> skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and <b>mydriasis</b> progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E
25|$|Uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma: in {{clinical}} trials, Cymbalta use {{was associated with}} an increased risk of <b>mydriasis</b> (dilation of the pupil); therefore, its use should be avoided in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma, in which <b>mydriasis</b> can cause sudden worsening.|$|E
25|$|This {{is due to}} the {{contraction}} of the pupil, instead of the usual dilation (<b>mydriasis)</b> that is undergone when a normal, untrained eye, accustomed to viewing in air, is submerged.|$|E
25|$|In an emergency, {{intravenous}} clenbuterol or atropine may be used, but {{care must}} be exercised with atropine, as it may predispose to adverse systemic side effects such as <b>mydriasis,</b> excitement, GI stasis and colic.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{electrical}} {{stimulation of the}} ARAS produces pain responses in cats and educes verbal reports of pain in humans. Additionally, ascending reticular activation in cats can produce <b>mydriasis,</b> which can result from prolonged pain. These results suggest some relationship between ARAS circuits and physiological pain pathways.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{reports of}} the effects of {{consumption}} of plants described as Mandragora autumnalis (Mandragora offinarum s.l.) include severe symptoms similar to those of atropine poisoning, including blurred vision, dilation of the pupils (<b>mydriasis),</b> dryness of the mouth, difficulty in urinating, dizziness, headache, vomiting, blushing and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). Hyperactivity and hallucinations also occurred in the majority of patients.|$|E

25|$|Ketorolac is {{used during}} eye surgery to {{maintain}} <b>mydriasis,</b> or the 'relaxing' of the iris muscles {{that will allow}} surgeons to perform cataract surgery. Ketorolac is effective in treating ocular itching. The ketorolac ophthalmic formulation {{is associated with a}} decreased development of macular edema after cataract surgery and is more effective alone rather than as an opioid/keterolac combination treatment. Ketorolac has also been used to manage pain from corneal abrasions.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that valproic acid may cause premature growth plate ossification in children and adolescents, resulting in decreased height. Valproic acid can also cause <b>mydriasis,</b> a dilation of the pupils. There {{is evidence}} that shows valproic acid may increase the chance of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder. Studies have shown this risk of PCOS is higher in women with epilepsy compared to those with bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{associated with}} pseudoephedrine therapy include {{central nervous system}} stimulation, insomnia, nervousness, excitability, dizziness and anxiety. Infrequent ADRs include tachycardia or palpitations. Rarely, pseudoephedrine therapy {{may be associated with}} <b>mydriasis</b> (dilated pupils), hallucinations, arrhythmias, hypertension, seizures and ischemic colitis; as well as severe skin reactions known as recurrent pseudo-scarlatina, systemic contact dermatitis, and nonpigmenting fixed drug eruption. Pseudoephedrine, particularly when combined with other drugs including narcotics, may also {{play a role in the}} precipitation of episodes of paranoid psychosis.|$|E
25|$|Mirtazapine is a {{very strong}} H1 {{receptor}} inverse agonist and, as a result, it can cause powerful sedative and hypnotic effects. A single 15mg dose of mirtazapine to healthy volunteers has been found to result in over 80% occupancy of the H1 receptor and to induce intense sleepiness. After a short period of chronic treatment, however, the H1 receptor tends to desensitize and the antihistamine effects become more tolerable. Many patients may also dose at night to avoid the effects, and this appears to be an effective strategy for combating them. Blockade of the H1 receptor may improve pre-existing allergies, pruritus, nausea, and insomnia in afflicted individuals. It may also contribute to weight gain, however. In contrast to the H1 receptor, mirtazapine has only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, although anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, constipation, and <b>mydriasis</b> are still sometimes seen in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{experiments}} on frogs, the Japanese group {{carried out a}} series of classical pharmacological investigations of candicine on cats and rabbits, and on various isolated animal organs/tissues. In rabbits, doses of 0.6mg/kg, i.v., of candicine produced respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances lasting about 15 minutes. Body temperature was not affected; there was also <b>mydriasis</b> followed by miosis, and hypersalivation. In rabbits, i.v. doses of 2.1mg/kg produced apnea, followed by death. In anesthetized cats, doses of 0.06–0.12mg/kg, iv., also caused respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances: although the details were concentration-and time-dependent, the ultimate effects were ones of sustained respiratory stimulation and elevated blood pressure; the hypertension was not inhibited by atropine, but was antagonized by hexamethonium. Candicine caused contraction of the cat nictitating membrane. A concentration of 0.012mg/mL applied to the isolated guinea pig atrium caused a decrease in the amplitude and rate of contractions, these effects being enhanced by eserine, but inhibited by atropine pre-treatment. Concentrations of 3-6μg/mL produced contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum which were inhibited by pre-treatment with atropine, hexamethonium, tubocurarine or cocaine, but were not affected by the presence of pyribenzamine or chlorpheniramine. Summarizing the results of these and other observations, the authors concluded that: candicine was primarily a stimulant of autonomic ganglia; it liberated catecholamines from the adrenal medulla; it showed muscarine-like and sympathomimetic effects in some assays, and it was a neuromuscular blocker of the depolarizing type. In many of these respects, candicine resembled nicotine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP).|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the pain}} {{associated}} with corneal ulceration {{is due to the}} secondary uveitis and miosis, and effective relief can often be gained with topical atropine(1%), leading to <b>mydriasis.</b> [...] Dosing is generally q4h initially, and then as required to maintain dilation. [...] <b>Mydriasis</b> is also important to avoid some of the complications associated with uveitis, such as synechiae formation and glaucoma. [...] Pain is also associated with inflammatory response occurring in the adjacent sclera and conjunctiva, and systemic analgesia in the form of NSAIDs is usually indicated, for example, flunixin meglumin 1.1mg/kg, BID. [...] Topical NSAIDs are available (diclofenac, flurbiprofen) and effective, but have been shown to increase corneal healing time.|$|E
2500|$|In the eye, {{atropine}} induces <b>mydriasis</b> {{by blocking}} contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial pupillary dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, and treats ciliary block (malignant) glaucoma.|$|E
2500|$|A fully paralyzed {{patient is}} unable to move, speak, blink the eyes, or {{otherwise}} respond to the pain. It is incorrect to think that physiological signs such as increased heart rate (tachycardia), blood pressure (hypertension), dilation of the pupils (<b>mydriasis),</b> sweating (diaphoresis), {{and the formation of}} tears (lacrimation) will continue to occur normally in response to pain in the anesthetized state [...] [...] If neuromuscular blocking drugs are used this causes skeletal muscle paralysis and interferes with the functioning of the autonomic nervous system. [...] The patient cannot signal their distress and they may not exhibit the signs of awareness that would be expected to be detectable by clinical vigilance.|$|E
2500|$|Case 6. [...] This case also {{illustrates}} {{the features of}} syncope-like epileptic seizures together with other variable autonomic symptoms (emesis, respiratory abnormalities, pallor, <b>mydriasis)</b> in Panayiotopoulos syndrome. A 5-year-old boy at age 13 months woke up vomiting profusely and then, {{while he was still}} in bed, became unresponsive and floppy with shallow breathing for 20 minutes. Later the same night, he woke up, vomited, and then collapsed in the bath. He remained flaccid and unresponsive for 1 hour, and his mother, described him as “flat” and pale with dilated nonreactive pupils. At age 20 months, he collapsed on the floor pale, unresponsive, and flaccid for approximately 10 minutes. On another occasion, he was found in bed unresponsive, floppy, and pale for 5 minutes. The last seizure occurred at age 28 months in the nursery. He fell on the floor and remained unresponsive and flaccid for 20 minutes and then he rapidly recovered. EEGs consistently showed multifocal spikes in various brain locations. Cardiologic assessment was normal.|$|E
2500|$|There are now {{significant}} {{reports of}} ictal EEGs in 20 cases, which objectively document the seizures of Panayiotopoulos syndrome and their variable localisation at onset. [...] All these recorded seizures occurred while {{the children were}} asleep. The onset of the electrical ictal discharge was mainly occipital (7 cases) or frontal (7 cases)and consisted of rhythmic monomorphic decelerating theta or delta activity with small spikes. The ﬁrst clinical manifestation which appeared long (1–10 minutes) after the electrical onset, usually consisted of opening of the eyes as if the children were waking from sleep. At this stage, usually the children responded, often correctly, to simple questions. On many occasions, tachycardia was the first objective sign when ||ECG|| was recorded. Vomiting was a common ictal symptom occurring at any stage of the seizures but not as the ﬁrst clinical manifestation. Seizures associated with ictal vomiting {{did not have any}} particular localization or lateralization. Vomiting occurred mainly when the ictal discharges were more diffuse than localized. Sometimes only retching without vomiting occurred, and on a few occasions, vomiting did not occur. Other autonomic manifestations included <b>mydriasis,</b> pallor, cyanosis, tachypnea, hypersalivation, and perspiration at various stages of the ictus. Of non-autonomic manifestations, deviation of eyes to the right or left occurred before or after vomiting without any apparent EEG localisation; it was present in seizures starting from the occipital or frontal regions.|$|E
2500|$|Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} occurs {{exclusively in}} otherwise normal children and manifests mainly with infrequent autonomic epileptic seizures and autonomic status epilepticus. [...] Onset of seizures is from age 1 to 14 years with 76% starting between 3–6 years. Autonomic seizures consist of episodes of disturbed autonomic function with nausea, retching and vomiting as predominant symptoms. [...] Other autonomic manifestations include pallor (or, less often, flushing or cyanosis), <b>mydriasis</b> (or, less often, miosis), cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory alterations, {{incontinence of urine}} and/or feces, hypersalivation, and modifications of intestinal motility. In approximately one fifth of the seizures the child becomes unresponsive and flaccid (syncope-like epileptic seizures or ictal syncope) before or often without convulsions. Syncope-like epileptic seizures (ictal syncope) with the child becoming [...] "completely unresponsive and flaccid like a rag doll" [...] occur in one fifth of the seizures. [...] More-conventional seizure symptoms often appear after the onset of autonomic manifestations. The child, who was initially fully conscious, becomes confused and unresponsive. Eyes turn to one side or gaze widely open. Only half of the seizures end with brief hemiconvulsions or generalized convulsions. Autonomic symptoms {{may be the only}} features of the seizures. None of the above symptoms alone is a prerequisite for diagnosis. [...] Recurrent seizures may not be stereotyped. The same child may have brief or prolonged seizures and autonomic manifestations may be severe or inconspicuous. [...] The full emetic triad (nausea, retching, vomiting) culminates in vomiting in 74% of the seizures; in others only nausea or retching occur, and in a few, none of the emetic symptoms are apparent.|$|E
