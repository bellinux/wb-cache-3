5|$|By the June deadline, Laing {{had made}} a payment of $200,000. GEDCA {{requested}} the outstanding $50,000 along with the $100,000 remaining balance to be paid by Laing by the September deadline. When asked by a local talk radio station if the Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon settlement <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be a windfall for GEDCA and {{could be used for}} future economic development projects on Guam, GEDCA administrator Karl Pangelinan stated that the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> barely pay for the legal fees incurred during the years of legal fighting with Laing. In September, Rigel Entertainment declared bankruptcy. On October 26, GEDCA board met and established that Laing {{had made a}} partial late payment of $75,000 on the $150,000 still outstanding. A new deadline was set for January 31, 2013. Laing missed the January deadline, but in late February, GEDCA reported receiving the money, thus bringing the lawsuit to a close.|$|E
5|$|After the Virginia Tech {{massacre}} on April 16, 2007, Vick and the United Way donated $10,000 {{to assist}} families affected. The Vick Foundation collected donations from communities in Atlanta and Virginia {{to be placed}} in the United In Caring Fund for Victims of the Virginia Tech Tragedy and a special fund at the United Way of Montgomery, Radford and Floyd counties, which serves the Virginia Tech area. The Vick Foundation said the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be used to provide help with funeral expenses, transportation for family members and other support services.|$|E
5|$|Another issue confronting both Patton and the {{legislature}} {{was how to}} spend federal funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky's share of the settlement totaled $3.5billion over 25years. Because tobacco was a major cash crop in Kentucky, Patton proposed {{that half of the}} settlement be used to diversify the state's farmers' crops. One-fourth of the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> support health care and anti-smoking efforts. The remaining one-fourth would address early-childhood care and education, a cause important to Patton's daughter, Nicki, an early-childhood educator.|$|E

5|$|Asked {{what impact}} the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play}} the same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
5|$|Following a lost {{vote in the}} Scottish Parliament, the SNP-led {{minority}} Scottish Government {{agreed to}} continue the line {{from the airport to}} Leith on condition that no more public <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be supplied. A report by Audit Scotland, commissioned by the Scottish Government, confirmed that the cost projections were sound. The cost of the scheme in 2003 was estimated at £498 million, £375 million in funding from the Scottish Government and £45 million from Edinburgh Council.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{attitude}} toward business was {{that government should}} aid {{it as much as}} possible. He was suspicious of organized labor, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought to get them to work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned in his opening address that no federal <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be available. No important legislation came as a result, though some public works projects were accelerated.|$|E
30|$|It is {{relevant}} {{at this point}} to recall that different measures of the equivalents between money and another attribute can be defined according to whether a loss or a gain is incurred. The theory of reference-dependent preferences, which applies the ideas of prospect theory to riskless choice, define four valuation measures (found in Bateman et al. [3] and in Munro and Sugden [20]): willingness to pay (<b>money</b> one <b>would</b> pay in return for a given gain in the attribute), willingness to accept (<b>money</b> one <b>would</b> accept in return for a given loss in the attribute), equivalent loss (<b>money</b> loss one <b>would</b> accept in place of a given loss in the attribute), and equivalent gain (<b>money</b> gain one <b>would</b> accept in place of a given gain in the attribute). A central assumption in the theory is loss aversion: losses are valued more heavily than gains. This implies that the four valuation measures need to be different and satisfy certain inequalities.|$|R

5|$|Hsu may in {{fact have}} been running {{multiple}} cons on a massive scale. As an example, a New York investment fund run by Woodstock Festival founder Joel Rosenman invested $40 million spread over 37 separate deals with a Hsu company. Hsu reportedly told Rosenman the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be used to manufacture apparel for well known luxury brands, yielding a 40% profit on each deal. When Rosenman's fund recently attempted to cash checks from Hsu's company in September 2007, there were insufficient funds. Federal charges of fraud have since been brought against Hsu.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{is active}} {{in a number of}} issues. Along with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, he set up Farm Aid in 1985 to assist and {{increase}} awareness of the importance of family farms, after Bob Dylan's comments during the Live Aid concert that he hoped some of the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> help American farmers in danger of losing their farms through mortgage debt. The first concert included Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, B.B. King, Roy Orbison, and Neil Young among many others, and raised over $9million for America's family farmers. Besides organizing and performing in the annual concerts, Nelson {{is the president of the}} board of Farm Aid.|$|E
5|$|The game began {{development}} immediately after Menace, and borrowed similar gameplay elements. The development team used advanced hardware to develop Blood Money, utilising improved graphical and technological processes. The game {{was inspired by}} the presentation of Mr. Heli, and the animations of Blood <b>Money</b> <b>would</b> later inspire the development of Lemmings. The game was released to positive reviews; praise was given to the game's graphics and gameplay. The game was also commercially successful, selling over 40,000 copies.|$|E

Also, the only items or services with a price attached would most likely be those considered wants or non-essentials and anything deemed a need would be completely free of charge (e.g.: health care, public transportation).|$|R
5|$|The winning {{candidates}} were informed {{of their success}} in an e-mail from NRP and were also sent various contracts to sign and return. They {{were told that the}} project would last for a year, so most of them gave up their flats and jobs. The contracts stated that their food, accommodation and leisure <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be provided, and that they were to meet in London on 10 June 2002 for the programme to begin filming. Each contestant was also told to set up a new bank account to which Russian could have access and to arrive without money or credit cards on the launch day.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5|$|Brashear was {{not given}} an {{extension}} during the season, and {{prior to the start}} of the free agency he indicated that he would like to return to Washington, citing the prospect of winning a Stanley Cup. Brashear noted that at his age and place in his career, taking care of his family was his top priority and that <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be the deciding factor in his destination. The Capitals, however, opted not re-sign him. After initial talks with the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)'s Vityaz Chekhov, he eventually agreed to a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the New York Rangers. At an event for season-ticket holders, Brashear was booed due to the altercation with the Rangers in the previous post-season. He set a personal milestone during the 2009–10 season by playing in his 1,000th NHL game on November 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
5000|$|The Ceann Comhairle's {{opinion on}} whether a bill is a <b>money</b> bill <b>would</b> have been {{definitive}} unless the Dáil resolved otherwise. The only remaining significance of <b>money</b> bills <b>would</b> have been that they couldn't have been referred to the Supreme Court by the President under Article 26. At present the designation also limits the Seanad's power to oppose such bills; and if the Seanad disagrees with the Ceann Comhairle's designation, the question may be referred by the President to a committee of privileges chaired by a judge.|$|R

5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when <b>money</b> <b>would</b> become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to restricting photography of public art, closing {{a public park}} for a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both occasions, {{as one of the}} park's primary attractions, Cloud Gate was the focus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent most venues in the park including Cloud Gate on AT Plaza from 6a.m. to 11p.m. On August 7, 2006, Allstate paid $700,000 to rent the park. For this price, Allstate acquired the visitation rights to a different set of features and only had exclusive access to Cloud Gate after 4p.m. These corporate closures denied tourists access to Kapoor's public sculpture, and commuters who walk through the park were forced to take alternative routes. City officials stated that the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> help finance free public programs in Millennium Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{multiple}} steps during 2012–2013, the ECB {{lowered its}} bank rate to historical lows, reaching 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were shaved to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 {{the central bank}} shocked financial markets by cutting the razor-thin rates by a further two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%, the lowest on record. The moves were designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that lower cost of <b>money</b> <b>would</b> {{be passed on to}} businesses taking out loans, boosting investment in the economy. The lowered borrowing rates caused the euro to fall in relation to other currencies, which it was hoped would boost exports from the eurozone.|$|E

5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 2013, Dunderdale held a {{major news}} conference {{regarding}} the fishery at The Rooms in St. John's. Along with cabinet ministers and industry officials, Dunderdale {{announced that the}} federal and provincial governments would be investing $400 million, over three years, into the fishery. The federal government portion of the money totalled $280 million while the provincial portion was $120 million. The money is compensation for the province eliminating minimum processing requirements for the European Union. Although the premier said that her government plans to work with industry officials on how the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be spent, she {{said it would be}} invested into such things as research and development, new marketing initiatives and infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The church faced {{internal}} {{dissent in}} 1991 over {{its decision to}} publish The Destiny of The Mother Church. Written and privately printed in 1943 by Bliss Knapp, {{former president of the}} Mother Church, the book suggested that Eddy was the Woman of the Apocalypse of the New Testament. Knapp and his family bequeathed $98 million to the church on condition that it publish and authorize the book by 1993; otherwise the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> go to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The church published and made the book available in Christian Science reading rooms. One senior employee was fired for failing to support the church's decision, and 18 of the 21 editorial staff of the religious journals resigned. In the end the other parties disputed that making the book available in Reading Rooms constituted authorization, and the bequest was split three ways.|$|E
