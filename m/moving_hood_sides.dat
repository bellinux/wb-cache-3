As at least one historian has pointed out, this checkmate had been achieved simply by <b>moving</b> <b>Hood's</b> corps into the general area of Kolb's Farm; no attack had been necessary.

50|$|Having {{encountered}} entrenched Confederates astride Kennesaw Mountain stretching southward, Sherman fixed them {{in front}} and extended his right wing to envelop their flank and menace the railroad.
