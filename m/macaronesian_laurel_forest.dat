Echinodium as traditionally circumscribed comprises six extant species, four restricted to the Macaronesian archipelagos and two confined to the Australasian/Pacific regions. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on plastid trnLUAA intron and nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences indicate that Echinodium is polyphyletic and split into three groups. Three of the four Macaronesian species (E. spinosum and the single island endemics E. renauldii and E. setigerum) are closely related to each other and treated as Echinodium s. str. (Echinodiaceae). Further clarification of the relationships of Echinodium s. str. with Orthostichella, a segregate of Lembophyllaceae, is needed. The remaining Macaronesian species, E. prolixum, is transferred to Isothecium (Lembophyllaceae); this systematic position is also strongly supported by leaf characters. The two Australasian species, E. hispidum and E. umbrosum, are molecularly unrelated to the Macaronesian species and are transferred to Thamnobryum in the Neckeraceae. While the molecular data suggest that the peculiar distribution pattern of ‘Echinodium’ is an artefact, the striking morphological similarity observed in Macaronesian and Australasian species cannot be dismissed.

50|$|The islands have {{a unique}} biogeography, and are home to several {{distinct}} plant and animal communities. The jumping spider genus Macaroeris is named after Macaronesia. None of the Macaronesian islands {{were part of a}} continent, so the native plants and animals reached the islands via long-distance dispersal. Laurel-leaved forests, called laurisilva, once covered most of the Azores, Madeira, and parts of the Canaries between 400-1200 m altitude (the eastern Canaries and Cape Verde being too dry). These forests resemble the ancient forests that covered the Mediterranean basin and northwestern Africa before the cooling and drying of the ice ages. Trees of the genera Apollonias (Lauraceae), Clethra (Clethraceae), Dracaena (Ruscaceae), Ocotea (Lauraceae), Persea (Lauraceae), and Picconia (Oleaceae), which are found in the <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>laurel</b> <b>forests,</b> are also known from fossil evidence to have lived around the Mediterranean before the ice ages.|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} and climatic {{features of a}} relatively small volcanic island such as Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) cause increased difficulties to vegetation monitoring by means of moderate resolution satellite data. The use of multispectral very high resolution WorldView- 2 (WV 2) imagery provides promising perspectives for vegetation mapping in such a heterogeneous landscape. In order to assess its potential to estimate the cover fraction of dominant plant species in endemic <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>laurel</b> <b>forests</b> and heathlands, a hierarchical Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was performed within a study area where different patches from mature forest, to degraded forest and pine plantations can be found. First, a selection of pure pixels in the WV 2 image for fern, Morella faya Ait., Laurus novocanariensis and the introduced species Pinus radiata were used to build a spectral library for each species. Last species Erica arborea L. was characterized in field {{by means of an}} ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer, due to the rarity of pure pixels in this case, and to the simultaneous presence of two spectral subclasses depending on its flowering onset; WV 2 -adjusted spectral signatures from field reflectances were estimated by empirical calibration. Preliminary results showed a good separation of degraded from mature native forests and from plantations, although pine cover fraction is, in general, underestimated. The second MESMA cycle was useful to tell between most similar species, like in case of M. faya and L. novocanariensis...|$|R
50|$|Laurus azorica (also called Azores <b>laurel</b> or <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>laurel)</b> is {{a species}} of plant in the Lauraceae family, related to Laurus nobilis.

50|$|According to {{the recent}} study by Box and Fujiwara (Evergreen Broadleaved Forests of the Southeastern United States: Preliminary Description), <b>laurel</b> <b>forests</b> occur in patches in the {{southeast}}ern United States from southeast North Carolina southward to Florida, and west to Texas, mostly along the coast and coastal plain of the Gulf and south Atlantic coast. In the southeastern United States, evergreen Hammock (ecology) (i.e. topographically induced forest islands) contain many <b>laurel</b> <b>forests.</b> These <b>laurel</b> <b>forests</b> occur mostly in moist depression and floodplains. In many portions of the coastal plain, a low-laying mosaic topography of white sand, silt, and limestone (mostly in Florida), separate these <b>laurel</b> <b>forests.</b> Frequent fire is also thought {{to be responsible for}} the disjointed geography of <b>laurel</b> <b>forests</b> across the coastal plain of the southeastern United States.|$|R
50|$|<b>Laurel</b> <b>forest</b> {{appears on}} {{mountains}} {{of the coastal}} strip of New South Wales in Australia, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Tasmania, and New Zealand.

40|$|Aim of study: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the effects of clearcutting and recovery of a <b>laurel</b> <b>forest</b> stand, 50 years after felling. Area of study: <b>Laurel</b> <b>forest</b> stand in Agua García, Tenerife (Canary Islands) Material and methods: Structural stand parameters were measured in a large patch of <b>laurel</b> <b>forest.</b> Main results: The results revealed that Erica arborea and Ilex canariensis have acted as pioneer species in the broad sense of the term, while Morella faya has remained abundant throughout the study. Persea indica became increasingly dominant throughout succession, as indicated by several different structural parameters. Research highlights: Recovery of the <b>laurel</b> <b>forest</b> after clearcutting has been possible in some areas without any further forest management, as indicated by the species composition and forest structure...|$|R
50|$|With {{the drying}} of Australia, the <b>laurel</b> <b>forests</b> habitat {{gradually}} retreated, and <b>laurel</b> <b>forests</b> {{were replaced by}} the more drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities familiar today. Corynocarpus rupestris grows well in limy soils where there is shelter due to its late flowering. Growth as a multi-stemmed shrub rather than a tree is an adaptation to this new habitat. Corynocarpus rupestris subsp. rupestris is naturally adapted to dry summers, although it also grows well in cool, wet summers. Corynocarpus rupestris is a typical representative of the <b>laurel</b> <b>forest</b> ecoregion.|$|R
50|$|The Lauraceae {{give their}} name to {{habitats}} known as <b>laurel</b> <b>forests,</b> which have many trees that superficially resemble the Lauraceae, {{though they may}} belong to other plant families such as Magnoliaceae or Myrtaceae. <b>Laurel</b> <b>forests</b> of various types occur on most continents and on many major islands.|$|R

50|$|During the Cenozoic Era, the Mediterranean region, Europe, and {{northwest}} Africa had a wetter climate and were largely covered by <b>laurel</b> <b>forests.</b> Holly {{was a typical}} representative species of this biome, where many current species of the genus Ilex were present. With the drying of the Mediterranean Basin during the Pliocene, the <b>laurel</b> <b>forests</b> gradually retreated, replaced by more drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities. The modern Ilex aquifolium resulted from this change.

50|$|<b>Laurel</b> <b>forests</b> {{occur in}} small areas where their {{particular}} climatic requirements prevail, {{in both the}} northern and southern hemispheres. Inner <b>laurel</b> <b>forest</b> ecoregions, a related and distinct community of vascular plants, evolved millions of years ago on the supercontinent of Gondwana, and species of this community are now found in several separate areas of the Southern Hemisphere, including southern South America, southernmost Africa, New Zealand, Australia and New Caledonia. Most <b>Laurel</b> <b>forest</b> species are evergreen, and occur in tropical, subtropical, and mild temperate regions and cloud forests of {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres, in particular the Macaronesian islands, southern Japan, Madagascar, New Caledonia, Tasmania, and central Chile, but they are pantropical, and for example in Africa they are endemic in the Congo region, Cameroon, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, in lowland forest and Afromontane areas.Since <b>laurel</b> <b>forests</b> are archaic populations that diversified as a result of isolation on islands and tropical mountains, their presence is a key to dating climatic history.|$|R

50|$|The {{highlands}} of New Guinea and New Britain {{are home to}} montane <b>laurel</b> <b>forests,</b> from about 1000 to(-) 2500 m elevation.

New Guinea and Northern Australia are closely related. Around 40 million years ago, the Indo-Australian tectonic plate began to split apart from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. As it collided with the Pacific Plate on its northward journey, the high mountain ranges of central New Guinea emerged around 5 million years ago. In the lee of this collision zone, the ancient rock formations {{of what is now}} Cape York Peninsula remained largely undisturbed.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{being located}} in a humid climate zone, much of the {{broadleaf}} <b>Laurel</b> <b>forests</b> in the Southeast USA are semi-sclerophyll in character.
