Study results show that transshipment routes between nearby ports need to be established in the medium to long term. In the short term, direct routes to Qingdao Port and Tianjin Port need to be vitalized. Based on analysis results of priority and satisfaction in port selection factors, cargo volumes should be secured by providing various incentives to Gimpo terminal at Gyeong-In Port and using aggressive marketing from a logistics company on commission. A clear management strategy and active cooperation among the government, project operators of K-water, and terminal operation companies are necessary...|$|R

One useful application of this allocation is to consider the frequency of calls allocated in each <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> as representing demand of services provided in this area and use this demand to assess the competitiveness of utilities in cargo <b>trade</b> <b>areas.</b> Ports are taken as an example for such utilities. The analysis given by the case study on port development demonstrates the case where an optimal <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> improvement is advised by SOS Voyager and SOS Allocator so that all calling frequencies in this area are serviced and ship layups are avoided, while maintaining maximum revenue of area ports. Sensitivity and what-if analysis is the SOS tool to reach this optimal <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> improvement. Findings of this part of the research paper can easily be extended to other ship types, other port services, other utilities; namely canals and straits.|$|R

40|$|Using the {{modified}} gravity model, {{this study examines}} whether the free <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> of NAFTA, ANZCER and ASEAN would result in trade creation among the member countries and trade diversion with the non-member countries. Further, it applies Linder's income similarity concept to explain the trade patterns in the developed and developing countries within these free <b>trade</b> <b>areas.</b> First, {{the results suggest that}} the implementations of the free <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> have facilitated higher trade among the member countries, particularly the ANZCER and ASEAN countries. However, among all three free <b>trade</b> <b>areas,</b> the formation of the ANZCER free <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> has resulted in trade diversion with non-member countries, whereas that of the ASEAN free <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> has resulted in a trade increase with non-member countries. Surprisingly, the formation of the NAFTA free <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> has no significant effect on trade with non-member countries as their trade flows remain quite low even before its implementation. Second, the result indicates that the trade-enhancing effect of income similarity is confirmed for the developing rather than developed member countries. The developing member countries with similar incomes would trade extensively more with each other. This result can be partly explained by Hanink's income threshold concept, which argues that the income similarity effect is only applicable to developed countries with very small difference in incomes. Given the heterogeneous country sample in this study, the substantial income differences among the developed member countries would probably account for the lack of income similarity effect in these countries.
