40|$|Design is a fast {{changing}} {{discipline that}} is highly responsive to societal, market and economic transformations. Design itself is today acknowledged as a driver for transformation: with a particular reference to service design, scenario design and all participatory design practices, design is actually considered a discipline with a transformational role because of its capacity for systemic thinking, sense <b>making</b> and <b>capacity</b> building. As such, it deals with issues of organisational change, new economies, sustainability, social change and also with setting up or scaling innovations by “empowering people” to invent solutions together. Incubating or scaling innovations is therefore {{something that has to}} do with the above-mentioned three main capacities of systemic thinking, sense <b>making</b> and <b>capacity</b> building...|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{centers on}} a {{critical}} analysis {{of the concept of}} the "educated person" in Kieran Egan's theory of educational development. Egan presupposes that the erudite human being in western societies is ideally a sophisticated ironic thinker, that is, a person who possesses the fullest range of sense <b>making</b> <b>capacities</b> known to our culture; and furthermore, a person who tactfully and innovatively applies these capacities in everyday life. My thesis attempts a "thick" description of Egan's notion of ironic understanding in light of the writings of Martin Buber on dialogue, Hannah Arendt on human thinking, Hans Georg Gadamer on the serious playfulness of the interpretative act, Richard Rorty on private irony and liberal democracy, and finally, Michael Oakeshott on the educational conversation. It suggests that these theoretical notions of the fully human life may be practically realized in the educated ironist characterized by Egan in his various writings...|$|R
