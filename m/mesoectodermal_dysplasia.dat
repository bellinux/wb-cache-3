5000|$|... 'Six-fingered dwarfism' ('digital integer deficiency') was an {{alternative}} designation {{used for this}} condition when it was being studied in the Amish and may have served a useful function in defining this then little known condition for the medical profession, {{as well as the}} lay public. The term, however, has been found offensive by some, apparently not because of 'dwarfism,' but because of the reference to the polydactyly, which is seen as a 'freakish' labeling. For this reason, 6-fingered dwarfism has been removed as {{an alternative}} name for this entry. This leaves Ellis-van Creveld syndrome with its initialism, EVC, as the only satisfactory designation. Chondroectodermal dysplasia and <b>mesoectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> do not well define the entity and are not satisfactory for general usage, either medical or otherwise.|$|E
40|$|Ellisâ€“van Creveld Syndrome 1 (also called chondroectodermal {{dysplasia}} or <b>mesoectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia)</b> {{is a rare}} genetic disorder of the skeletal dysplasia type. People with this condition have particularly short forearms and lower legs and a narrow chest with short ribs. Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is also characterized {{by the presence of}} extra fingers and toes (polydactyly), malformed fingernails and toenails, and dental abnormalities. More than half of affected individuals are born with a heart defect, which can cause serious or life-threatening health problems...|$|E
40|$|Focal dermal {{hypoplasia}} (FDH) {{is a rare}} <b>mesoectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> syndrome charac-terized by cutaneous, skeletal, dental, ocular and soft-tissue defects. An X-linked {{dominant mode}} of inheritance with lethality in male sub-jects has been proposed. Only around 30 cases of FDH {{have been reported in}} male subjects. Live born affected males are mosaic for muta-tions in PORCN gene. We present the mosaic pattern of FDH in a young boy. Case Report Focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH) is a rare genodermatosis with multisystem involve-ment. It is an X-linked dominant disorder wit...|$|E
40|$|Goltz Syndrome (Focal Dermal Hypoplasia) {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} <b>mesoectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> with multisystemic involvement. It {{was first}} described by Goltz in 1962 and more than 200 cases reported worldwide (Leite et al., 2005). Skin lesions are characterized by athrophic, hyperpigmented linear or reticulated macules, multiple mucocutaneous papillomas, fat herniations or fat tumors. Besides the skin, other structures frequently involved are the skeletal system, eyes, teeth, hair, nails and central nervous system (Kanitakis et al., 2003). The association between Goltz syndrome and anti-HIV serology was {{not found in the}} literature. We report 32 year-old woman with typical cutaneous leisons of Goltz Syndrome associated with false positive anti-HIV serology and secondary infertility...|$|E
40|$|Segmental odontomaxillary {{dysplasia}} {{is a type}} of hemi-maxillofacial dysplasia. It is a sporadic, <b>mesoectodermal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> {{that presents}} early in life, possibly as early as in utero and exhibits male gender predominance (1. 7 : 1. 0). Its features include enlargement of the soft tissue and/or bone of one hemimaxilla that may produce mild facial asymmetry, sclerotic radiographic bone changes and dental developmental abnormalities. The dense bone, which often exhibits a radiographic vertical orientation of the trabecular bone pattern, is generally associated with delayed eruption of the teeth. Congenitally missing premolar teeth (eithe or both) is a common feature of this condition that is of significant diagnostic value. Ipsilateral cutaneous findings have been reported in 23 % of cases. Immature woven bone forming irregular patterns are seen histologically. Herein, we present a case report on segmental odontomaxillary dysplasia in a 13 -year-old boy...|$|E
