40|$|Kenaf {{is grown}} these {{days as a}} <b>minor</b> <b>fibre</b> crop in some Asian countries, {{but also in the}} US and {{recently}} in Southern European countries such as Italy. The yield of extracted bast fibres is below 1 / 3 of that of the kenaf stem weight. In the US and Europe a profitable outlet for the remaining woody core is important for economical production of the crop. The use of kenaf core as animal bedding material is considered here as potential market outlet. An important aspect for this application is the moisture absorption capacity of the material. This paper describes evaluation of the water absorption capacity of different kenaf core fractions in comparison with other commercial animal bedding materials like straw and wood shavings. The water absorption of kenaf core particles is shown to be in the range of the other tested materials and especially the soft pith material showed very high absorbency...|$|E
40|$|Fifty Polish Friesian {{veal calves}} were {{administrated}} high amounts {{of two different}} solid feeds (maize grain and a mix diet containing 10 % of straw and 8 % of soy) {{in addition to the}} traditional milk replacer diet. Compared to the mix diet, maize grain had a lower content of iron, copper and zinc and a <b>minor</b> <b>fibre</b> level. Effects of the two diets on calves’ blood haemoglobin, iron, iron metabolism parameters, copper and zinc concentrations were studied. Haemoglobin concentration resulted higher {{at the end of the}} fattening for calves fed the mix diet, as expected. Values remained, however, within ranges that allowed acceptable carcass paleness. Haematic iron, unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) levels were not significantly different between the two solid feeds. Lower copper and zinc blood concentrations resulted for calves fed the mix diet were likely due to the feed fibre interfering with the bioavailability of the two minerals, according to what happens for iron...|$|E
40|$|Thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) fibres {{made from}} beech wood were {{produced}} using increasing refiner gap widths and thus with increasing fibre length and coarseness. Fibres (60 % by weight) were compounded in an internal kneading mixer using high-density polyethylene as the matrix and injection-moulded. Fibre lengths and length/width ratios were determined (a) before processing and (b) after injection-moulding and Soxhlet extraction using the optical FibreShape system. An increase in fibre length {{resulted in a}} decrease in water absorption and an improvement in flexural strength and modulus of elasticity of the wood-plastic composites (WPC). However, flexural strength of the WPC with TMP fibres was not improved compared to WPC with wood flour when maleic anhydride-grafted polyethylene (MAPE) {{was used as a}} coupling agent. After injection-moulding, differences in length of the various TMP fibre types were <b>minor.</b> <b>Fibre</b> geometry before processing strongly influences the water absorption and flexural properties of the composite. Fibre treatment with emulsified methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (EMDI) resin before compounding was shown to be equally efficient in reducing water absorption and improving flexural strength as the addition of MAPE during the compounding step...|$|E
40|$|Injury due to burning {{is known}} to impact on {{coagulation}} and haemostasis by disturbing the coagulation cascade and is also associated with impaired fibrinolysis. Also, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and hypercoagulability are common during thermal injury. Using a Wistar albino rat model, we investigated in this study whether burn injury affects the ultrastructure of the fibrin networks. A typical fibrin network will contain mostly major, thick <b>fibres</b> with <b>minor,</b> thin <b>fibres</b> distributed amongst them. We found that the clot architecture changes after burn injury, showing more prominent <b>minor,</b> thin <b>fibres</b> in a netted appearance. Also, the clot showed areas of matted fibrin. We suggest that the thrombotic events associated with burn injury are due to the thickened and netlike areas formed when thrombin activates the coagulation cascade. This is due to impaired fibrinolysis activities, causing the resulting fibrin clots not to be successfully disseminated. Small fragments of these netted, clumped areas may therefore break loose and lead to thrombotic events after burn injuries. The current study therefore provided morphological evidence for thrombotic events associated with burn injury. How to cite this article: Pretorius, E., Olivier, J., Oberholzer, H.

The as-deposited texture was characterized by a mixture of major //ND and <b>minor</b> //ND <b>fibre</b> components. Grain growth occurred in the specimen during annealing above 410 o C, and resulted in the texture change that the //ND fibre component developed strongly with decreasing //ND fibre component.

40|$|Modul 8 ® is a {{composite}} mixture of natural products that {{are known to be}} an immunomodulator. In the current study the effect of this immunomodulator is tested on an experimental asthmatic BALB/c mouse model to investigate its properties on the white blood cell count in the blood and bronchial lavage of the animals since white blood cells play a fundamental role in the inflammatory process involved in asthma. As it is known that platelets also {{play an important role in}} the immune system, the ultrastructure of platelets and fibrin networks were also investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The animals were sensitised, nebulized and treated over a period of 43 days until termination. Results from the blood smears as well as the bronchial lavage smears revealed significantly higher eosinophil counts in the asthmatic group compared to the control and treated groups. Changes in the ultrastructure of the platelets and fibrin networks could also be observed, with the Modul 8 ® -treated group appearing similar to that of the control group where thick major and thin <b>minor</b> <b>fibres</b> could clearly be distinguished and a tight mass of platelet aggregate could be observed. Whereas the fibrin networks from the asthmatic animals appeared flimsy with a tight mass of thin fibres covering the thick major fibres. The asthmatic platelet aggregates appeared granular without the tight round appearance of the control platelet aggregates. It is therefore concluded that Modul 8 ® positively influences the white blood cell counts by altering the asthmatic profile to look similar to that of the control. Also, it seems as if Modul 8 ® has a stabilizing effect on the platelets and fibrin networks. From these results it can be suggested that Modul 8 ® might successfully be used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as asthma...|$|R
40|$|While astrocytes are {{recognised}} to play {{a central}} role in repair processes following stroke, at this stage we do not have a clear understanding of how these cells are engaged during the chronic recovery phase. Accordingly, the principal aim of this study was to undertake a quantitative multi-regional investigation of astrocytes throughout the recovery process. Specifically, we have induced experimental vascular occlusion using cold-light photothrombotic occlusion of the somatosensory/motor cortex in adult male C 57 B 6 mice. Four weeks following occlusion we collected, processed, and immunolabelled tissue using an antibody directed at the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte specific cytoskeletal protein marker. We investigated GFAP changes in 13 regions in both the contra- and ipsi-lateral hemispheres from control and occluded animals. Specifically, we examined the infra-limbic (A 24 a), pre-limbic (A 25), anterior cingulate (A 32), motor (M 1 and M 2) cortices, the forceps <b>minor</b> <b>fibre</b> tract, as well the shell of the accumbens, thalamus, cingulate cortex (A 29 c), hippocampus (CA 1 - 3) and lateral hypothalamus. Tissue from occluded animals was compared against sham treated controls. We have identified that the focal occlusion produced significant astrogliosis (p p < 0. 05) in 9 of the 13 contralesional sites examined. This work underscores that both the ipsilateral and contralesional hemispheres, at sites distal to the infarct, are very active many weeks after the initial occlusion, a finding that potentially has significant implications for understanding and improving the regeneration of the damaged brain...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} genome contains three ancient sarcomeric myosin {{heavy chain}} (MYH) genes, MYH 14 / 7 b, MYH 15 and MYH 16, {{in addition to}} the two well characterized clusters of skeletal and cardiac MYHs. MYH 16 is expressed in jaw muscles of carnivores; however the expression pattern of MYH 14 and MYH 15 is not known. MYH 14 and MYH 15 orthologues are present in frogs and birds, coding for chicken slow myosin 2 and ventricular MYH, respectively, whereas only MYH 14 orthologues have been detected in fish. In all species the MYH 14 gene contains a microRNA, miR- 499. Here we report that in rat and mouse, MYH 14 and miR- 499 transcripts are detected in heart, slow muscles and extraocular (EO) muscles, whereas MYH 15 transcripts are detected exclusively in EO muscles. However, MYH 14 protein is detected only in a <b>minor</b> <b>fibre</b> population in EO muscles, corresponding to slow-tonic fibres, and in bag fibres of muscle spindles. MYH 15 protein is present in most fibres of the orbital layer of EO muscles and in the extracapsular region of bag fibres. During development, MYH 14 is expressed at low levels in skeletal muscles, heart and all EO muscle fibres but disappears from most fibres, except the slow-tonic fibres, after birth. In contrast, MYH 15 is absent in embryonic and fetal muscles and is first detected after birth in the orbital layer of EO muscles. The identification of the expression pattern of MYH 14 and MYH 15 brings to completion the inventory of the MYH isoforms involved in sarcomeric architecture of skeletal muscles and provides an unambiguous molecular basis to study the contractile properties of slow-tonic fibres in mammals...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: During transgluteal total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) the gluteus medius muscle (GM) is incised {{to achieve}} an ideal exposure for the hip replacement. Particularly severe muscle traumas can induce an insufficient repair {{which can lead to}} functional limitations based on a lack of contractile units and a replacement by fatty and fibrotic tissue. Currently the potential to support the regeneration process by cell-based therapies is investigated widely. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the influence of mesenchymal stromal cells of the placenta (placental expanded stromal cell product, PLX cells) on the traumatized GM after THA with the focus on morphological parameters. Method: In a monocentric, placebo-controlled, double blind, prospective study 20 patients were randomized in three groups and examined. After the THA the following study interventions were compared: intramuscular application of 1) placebo (N= 7), 2) 150 x 106 (N= 7) and 3) 300 x 106 (N= 6) PLX cells. For the macromorphological analysis magnet resonance imaging (MRI) images were investigated for muscle volume and fatty infiltrations preoperatively and 6, 12, as well as 26 weeks postoperatively. For the analysis of the microstructure muscle biopsies of the GM were removed intraoperatively and 12 weeks postoperatively for the following measurements: muscle fibre diameter, amount of regenerated fibres, fibre type distribution, vessel density, infiltration of t- lymphocytes and macrophages. Results: 26 weeks postoperatively the MRI analysis demonstrated {{a significant difference in the}} increase of muscle volume in patients treated with 150 M PLX cells in comparison to the placebo group (p= 0. 004). Patients of the 300 M group represented inferior to the 150 M group with a GM volume which was between the placebo and 150 M. The change of intramuscular fat was equal in all groups. The micromorphological analysis presented a pattern describing faster regeneration processes after cell therapy. This was marked by ongoing regeneration in the placebo group 12 weeks postoperatively, as represented by myoblasts and <b>minor</b> <b>fibre</b> size diameter. Angiogenic effects and changes in fibre type distribution were not detected in the biopsy. An influence of the cell therapy on local immunological parameters, like the infiltration of the lymphocytes and the macrophages, was equally not established. Conclusion: The micro- and macromorphological analysis of the traumatised GM after clinical application of PLX cells indicate an increase of contractile muscle tissue as a potential mode of action. A faster regeneration could also be relevant. For definitive statements further studies with higher number of patients are necessary...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the occurrence of}} large amounts of talc within a continental normal fault. The talc-in reaction is deformation-enhanced and occurs by the interaction between dolostones and silica-rich hydrothermal fluids. In the high-strain, foliated fault core, talc forms an interconnected network of oriented (001) lamellae, 200 – 300 nm thick, locally associated with <b>minor</b> tremolite <b>fibres,</b> up to 300 nm in diameter. The talc structure is affected by several strain-induced defects, among which (001) interlayer delamination that produces talc ‘‘sublamellae’’ down to 10 – 30 nm thick. Micro/nanostructural observations definitely point to a predominant deformation mechanism of (001) frictional sliding, further enhanced by pervasive delamination that gives rise to an almost infinite number of possible sliding surfaces. These effects have fundamental implications in fault mechanics, resulting in significant fault weakening...|$|R

40|$|Minor {{natural fibres}} such as sisal, kenaf and coir were {{important}} exports from ACP countries until low-cost synthetic polypropylene destroyed their markets almost over-night. Ij {{the last two}} decades these natural fibres have regained some of their lost markets as oil and its derivatives have increased in price and as environmental concerns have encouraged a return to 'natural' products. Despite this, production of hard fibres remains stagnant. Could these industries be revitalized and their economic potential realized? Asia dominates world markets for hard industrial fibres, and certain countries have won themselves leading positions as suppliers of coir (India and Sri Lanka), jute (India and Bangladesh) and abaca (Philippines). In Africa sisal is the major hard fibre, although smaller quantities of coir (coconut fibre) and kenaf are also produced. Until the 1960 s Tanzania, followed by Kenya, led the world market in sisal, with smaller but economically significant quantities grown in Angola, Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique. The development of lower-cost rot-proof twine for baling hay and straw in Europe and the US and the trend to the use of plastic sacks was a damaging blow to sisal; large acreages were abandoned. In Tanzania, the sisal production collapsed from 250, 000 tonnes to 30, 000 tonnes. Mauritius abandoned the crop completely. Coir also suffered competition from synthetics and although never a major product in Africa, it was again Kenya and Tanzania that suffered, in common with many islands with extensive coconut plantations in the Caribbean. and Pacific. Despite this damaging reversal there was a revival of interest in natural fibres in the eighties; as the price of polypropylene increased, natural fibre products were seen to be equal or better value for money Unfortunately, weakened industries were in a poor position to exploit their opportunity. The sisal industry in Tanzania was perhaps typical: nationalization of estates, lack of investment in processing machinery and poor management had eroded output, quality and buyer confidence. Skilled estate workers had drifted away to alternative employment or subsistence farming. A future, or only a past? Natural hard fibres have been used to manufacture a great variety of products from twines and ropes to woven fabrics for bags and carpet backing and for brush bristles, matting, screens and wall hangings. New possibilities include making paper from sisal, geotextiles for stabilizing ground disturbed by civil engineering, using natural fibres for soundproofing cars and developing coir dust as a plant growing medium in place of peat. The tragedy of recent policy decisions in ACP producing countries has been that not even local domestic, industrial and government buyers have supported their own industries but instead have opted for, and paid hard currency for, imported polypropylene twines, plastic bags and sheets, and nylon brush heads. Despite these damaging developments, production of hard fibres in ACP countries is remarkably stable and production is now concentrated {{in the hands of a}} relatively small but committed core of growers and processors. These could provide a foundation of expertise and production on which to expand production on which to expand national output of selected fibres, develop value-added processing, stimulate rural industries and provide much sought-after employment. World demand for industrial hard fibres currently exceeds supply and there is considerable potential for using more locally-grown and processed, fibre-based products. Fibre crops are not demanding with regard to fertilizer or pesticide inputs; they provide substantial employment opportunities at harvesting and processing and offer the benefit of substituting for imports paid for in hard currency. But, to be economically successful and sustainable, fibre-based industries require careful planning, quality control and stronger links between research and development and commercial developments. The manufacturers of oil-based competitor products invest in research to improve their products and to develop new uses and new products. They also advertise to promote their products. Natural fibre producers and processors must be prepared to compete in all these activities. There are many examples of successful producers of other commodities which have developed brand awareness and loyalty: Mauritius sugar, Ivorien, Jamaican and Kenyan coffee, Dominica's coconut oil soap and Indian jute. Some have achieved this entirely through commercial endeavour, some with a degree of government assistance; but all have benefited the respective countries in terms of employment, import substitution and export earnings. Many ACP countries could do the same with the <b>minor</b> <b>fibre</b> crops suited to their agro-ecological conditions if long-term political and commercial commitments were made.

PST films deposited on a Pt/(100) -Si substrate exhibit a strong [111] fibre texture, tilted 5 degrees to the normal.

40|$|Plain {{concrete}} {{which is}} strong in compressive strength possesses {{a very low}} tensile strength, limited ductility and little resistance to cracking. Internal micro cracks are inherently present in the concrete due to drying, shrinkage and poor tensile strength, eventually leading to brittle fracture of concrete. Hence fibres are added to concrete to overcome these disadvantages. Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) is a concrete composite of cement, fine and coarse aggregate and fibres with different proportions. In plain concrete, micro cracks develop even before loading, particularly due to drying, shrinkage or other causes of volume change. The width of these initial cracks seldom exceeds few microns. When loaded the micro cracks propagate and open up, due {{to the effect of}} stress concentration additional cracks form in place of <b>minor</b> defects. <b>Fibres</b> enable concrete to progress from plastic state to hardened state without weakness. This is achieved by the reduction of micro crack formation, reduced segregation and decreasing the scope of capillary formation, thus reducing permeability. Generally, fibres are chosen depending upon the aspect ratio. Out of all types of fibres, steel fibres are mostly used because steel has high modulus of elasticity, high elongation, high tensile strength and the bond between steel and the fibre is enormous. The present experimental investigation was carried out to evaluate the influence of steel fibres on physical and mechanical properties of concrete, containing cold drawn carbon steel fibres of hooked end type having aspect ratio of 50 with diameter 0. 6 mm and length 30 mm with varying percentages of 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: No {{attention}} has been paid so far to the preservation of fungal-treated lignocellulose for longer periods. In the present study, we treated wheat straw (WS) with the white-rot fungi Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Lentinula edodes for 8 weeks and assessed changes in pH, chemical composition and in vitro gas production (IVGP) weekly. Fungal-treated WS was also stored for 64 days 'as is', with the addition of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) or with a combination of LAB and molasses in airtight glass jars mimicking ensiling conditions. RESULTS: Both fungi significantly reduced the lignin and hemicellulose content of WS, and increased the cellulose content. The IVGP increased with increasing time of incubation, indicating the increase in digestibility. Both fungi lowered the pH of WS under 4. 3, which guarantees an initial and stable low pH during anaerobic storage. <b>Minor</b> changes in <b>fibre</b> composition and IVGP were observed for stored L. edodes treated WS, whereas no change occurred for C. subvermispora. CONCLUSION: It is possible to conserve C. subvermispora and L. edodes treated straw under anaerobic condition without additives up to 64 days.

40|$|Abstract The {{impact of}} staple {{strength}} on later stage processing of fine fleece wools (19 µm) and the blending with pieces is investigated. The staple strength findings complement those of previous researchers who used wools of different fibre diameters or from single flocks. The results reported here show that, as previously, the direct effect of sta-ple strength {{is limited to}} the production of tops, where staple strength influences fibre length in the top and the generation of combing waste. Blend-ing fleece wool and pieces was shown to increase combing noil and reduce fibre length in the top. The topmaking results conducted at CSIRO sug-gest that there may be an economic advantage in incorporating lower staple strength, and hence cheaper wools, in an all-fleeces consignment while still being able to meet the technical requirements for yarn and fabric production. Although statisti-cally significant, the small tenacity and elongation differences for 1 / 64 Nm yarns produced from the high and low staple strength test batches appear to have had no significant impact on the fabric tensile properties. There were no inter-batch yarn even-ness and fault level differences recorded, with top dyeing having a much greater influence on yarn quality than any differences associated with staple strength. Blending fleeces and pieces in a 60 / 40 ratio had a greater impact on processing from raw wool to fabric than the effect of staple strength over the range investigated. In comparison to an all-fleeces batch it would appear the economics of processing a fleeces-and-pieces batch may not be attractive, as the blend composition had an adverse effect on yarn fault levels, tenacity and elongation, which in turn may adversely affect weaving performance. However, the effect on fabric properties appears to be <b>minor.</b> Key words <b>fibre,</b> yarn, fabric formation, process...|$|R
