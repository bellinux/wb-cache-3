5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite to the popular idea that The Waste Land served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people <b>must</b> <b>recognize</b> Christ as their savior as well as their need for redemption.|$|E

25|$|Masrour, Masoud’s son, {{is now in}} the Political Bureau. Nechirvan, as Prime Minister, spearheaded {{unprecedented}} {{social and}} economic reforms, including attention to violence against women, improvements in infrastructure, and a focus on the private sector and foreign investment. He has also {{been at the forefront of}} the rapprochement with Turkey and the active development of oil and gas fields in the Region. According to Bruinessen, the traditional structure of Kurdish social and political organization was inherently tribal, with a tribe being a socio-political unit with distinct territorial limits and membership based on kinship. Tribal power is widespread in Erbil and Dahuk. And one <b>must</b> <b>recognize</b> the cultural differences between Erbil and Sulaymaniyah to understand the political nature of the region.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 an Immigration Judge {{agreed not}} to send Fidel Armando-Alfanso back to Cuba, based on his {{membership}} in a particular social group (gay people) who were persecuted and feared further persecution {{by the government of}} Cuba. The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the decision in 1990, and in 1994, then-Attorney General Janet Reno ordered this decision to be a legal precedent binding on Immigration Judges and the Asylum Office, and established sexual orientation as a grounds for asylum. However, in 2002 the Board of Immigration Appeals “suggested in an ambiguous and internally inconsistent decision that the ‘protected characteristic’ and ‘social visibility’ tests may represent dual requirements in all social group cases.” The requirement for social visibility means that the government of a country from which the person seeking asylum is fleeing <b>must</b> <b>recognize</b> their social group, and that LGBT people who hide their sexual orientation, for example out of fear of persecution, may not be eligible for asylum under this mandate.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 Palestinian {{legislative}} elections Hamas won {{a majority}} in the Palestinian Legislative Council, prompting the United States and many European countries to cut off all funds to the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority insisting that the Hamas <b>must</b> <b>recognize</b> Israel, renounce violence and accept previous peace pacts. Israel refused to negotiate with Hamas, since Hamas never renounced its beliefs that Israel has no right to exist and that the entire State of Israel is an illegal occupation which must be wiped out. EU countries and the United States threatened an economic boycott if Hamas will not recognize Israel's existence, not renounce terrorism and shall support the peace agreements signed between the PLO and Israel in the past. Hamas officials have openly stated that the organization does not recognize Israel's right to exist, even though the organization expressed openness to hold a long-term truce. Hamas is considered by Israel and many other countries to be a terrorist organization and therefore not entitled to participate in formal peace negotiations.|$|E

25|$|For Fitzpatrick, {{the key to}} {{establishing}} financially viable models for university presses and modes of scholarly publishing more generally is the reconceptualization of the university’s mission. Universities <b>must</b> <b>recognize</b> that their mission is, {{in addition to the}} production of knowledge, the communication of knowledge. Fitzpatrick conceptualizes scholarship as an ongoing conversation between scholars that can only continue if participants have the means to contribute to it. Publishing and disseminating information via the university press is one possible mode of communication. This reconceptualization of the university’s mission is part and parcel to the restructuring of its press’s functioning. If the university is reimagined as a center of communication, rather than principally as a credential-bestowing organization, its central mission becomes the production and dissemination of scholarly work. In this rethinking, the press has a future as the knowledge-disseminating organ of the university. For this to happen, the press must be integrated within the university and be provided sufficient funding so that its mission is not financially based but, rather, aligns with that of the university.|$|E

The report also notes that whilst the reported incidents showed very little success, [...] "e <b>must</b> <b>recognize</b> that these calls were mostly because the attempted IWR failed.
