A set of flexural <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> in a limited number of nodes is obtained by modal testing, while a different set of approximated mode is calculated by a Finite ElementModel (FEM) at all the nodes and degrees of freedom of the structure. The technique is based on the classical assumption that the response can be determined by a linear combination of the structure's <b>mode</b> <b>shapes.</b> The structure's <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> are approximated by using the local correspondence principle for <b>mode</b> <b>shapes,</b> i. e. by using an optimally selected set of finite element <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> as Ritz vectors for the true <b>mode</b> <b>shapes.</b> This allows to obtain the rotational response at unmeasured DoFs.

To map out the local shape properties of the physical stimuli, such as {{the distribution of the}} mass density of a molecule, sensory information should be collected through multiple modes of a mechanical sensor. By utilizing the specific <b>mode</b> <b>shapes,</b> the spatial distribution of a physical stimulus can be reverse calculated. However, the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> of a sensor may deviate from their ideal forms once analytes start to accumulate on the sensor. As a result, algorithms based on the ideal form of the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> no longer work accurately. Here, we developed a theoretical framework to calculate the change in the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> of a nanomechanical beam after analyte adsorption. We verified the theoretical model by performing finite element simulations and comparing the change in the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> obtained from each approach. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to relate the maximum deviation in the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> to the surface roughness of the sensor after analyte accumulation. By predicting the change in the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> and using the corrected forms, the accuracy of the nanomechanical sensing can be improved significantly...|$|R

This article presents a new methodology to identify antiresonant frequencies from transmissibility measurements. A transmissibility function represents the relation in the frequency domain of the measured response of two points in the structure. Hence, it does not involve the measurement of excitation forces. These antiresonances are used to update the numerical models of two experimental structures: An 8 -dof mass–spring system, and an exhaust system of a car.

40|$|ABSTRACT. There {{are several}} {{existing}} methods for damage detection based on identifying changes in strain energy <b>mode</b> <b>shapes.</b> Most {{of these methods}} require knowing strain energy <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> for a structure without damage {{in order to establish}} a baseline for damage detection. Usually, the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> from the structure under test should be compared to the baseline <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> to identify and locate damage. However, these methods of damage detection are not very suitable for application on structures where baseline <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> cannot be readily obtained, for example, structures with preexisting damage. Conventional methods, like building a finite element model of a structure {{to be used as a}} baseline might be an expensive and time-consuming task that can be impossible for complex structures. A new (non-baseline) method for the extraction of localized changes (damage peaks) from strain energy <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> based on Fourier analysis of the strain energy <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> has been developed and analytically proved for the cases of a pinned-pinned and a free-free beam. The new method looks for characteristic changes in the power spectrum of the strain energy <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> in order to locate and identify damage. The analytical results have been confirmed both by the finite element model and impact testing experiments on a free-free aluminum beam, including single and multiple damage scenarios. This paper presents results of testing the non-baseline method on a complex structure – Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge, which consists of loosely coupled hinged beams with variable cross-section. The results of testing confirm applicability of the non-baseline method to damage detection in complex structures and highlight certain particularities of its use...|$|R
