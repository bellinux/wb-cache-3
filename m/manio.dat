2500|$|Jack de <b>Manio</b> {{became its}} {{principal}} presenter in 1958. He {{was held in}} affection by listeners, but became notorious for on-air gaffes (announcing a documentary on Nigeria titled 'The Land of Niger' as 'The Land of Nigger', and referring to Yoko Ono as [...] "Yoko Hama, or whatever her name is", for instance). In 1970 the programme format was changed so {{that there were two}} presenters each day. De <b>Manio</b> left in 1971, and in the late 1970s the team of John Timpson and Brian Redhead became established. Timpson had been critical of the content, style and professionalism of Today—describing it once as [...] "not so much a programme, more a way of telling the time" [...] and being filled with [...] "eccentric octogenarians, prize pumpkins, and folk who ate lightbulbs and spiders".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Manios</b> {{intended}} {{to run as}} a Liberal again in the 2003 election, and was bitterly disappointed when party leader Dalton McGuinty appointed Brad Duguid as the party's candidate in Scarborough Centre instead. (Such appointments are permitted under {{the constitution of the}} Ontario Liberal Party, but are not commonly utilized.) <b>Manios</b> and his supporters claimed that McGuinty had previously given <b>Manios</b> full sanction to run for the Liberal nomination again, and described Duguid's appointment as a betrayal of trust. With the support of the local Liberal riding association, <b>Manios</b> entered the race as a [...] "liberal independent candidate". He officially appeared on the ballot as an independent, but used Liberal red and white colours in his campaign handouts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Manios</b> first {{campaigned for}} the Ontario {{legislature}} in the 1999 provincial election, against Progressive Conservative incumbent Marilyn Mushinski {{in the eastern}} Toronto riding of Scarborough Centre. Although <b>Manios</b> {{did not have a}} strong public profile when the election was called, he came within 4,000 votes of defeating Mushinski, and many believe he would have been elected had not been for vote-splitting with New Democratic Party candidate Sid Ryan, who received about 20% of the vote and took third-place. After the election, <b>Manios</b> undertook extensive promotional work for the Liberal Party in Toronto.|$|R
50|$|<b>Manios</b> had {{a support}} base in Scarborough's Greek community, and many {{believed}} that he could split the vote with Duguid to allow Mushinski another victory. In the event, however, provincial trends overrode local factors. Duguid won a convincing majority over Mushinski, as the Liberals formed a majority government provincially. <b>Manios</b> finished fourth, behind Michael Laxer of the NDP, with 3,259 votes (7.82%). His vote total, while credible for an independent candidate, {{was not enough to}} influence the outcome. After the election, <b>Manios</b> claimed that McGuinty and his supporters had drifted away from the party's principles.|$|R

5000|$|On May 1, 2003, Duguid was {{appointed}} by Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty as the party's candidate for Scarborough Centre in the upcoming provincial election. This upset many in the local party association, as Ontario general election, 1999 candidate Costas <b>Manios</b> was widely expected {{to win the nomination}} again. <b>Manios</b> decided to run against Duguid as an Independent (essentially campaigning as an [...] "Independent Liberal"), and many believed he would deny Duguid victory by splitting the Liberal vote. [...] Instead, the provincial trend overrode local factors—Duguid defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Marilyn Mushinski by over 10,000 votes, while <b>Manios</b> finished fourth, behind Michael Laxer of the Ontario New Democratic Party.|$|R

30|$|Trends in {{electrical}} conductivity changes were similar {{for both the}} composts containing grass and those with maize straw {{for each of the}} mixtures. Trends were more distinct in the composts containing maize stover whereby electrical conductivity increased significantly with increasing straw contents of composts. Mupondi et al. (2006) and <b>Manios</b> (2004) also observed an increase {{in electrical}} conductivity with composting time for different compost mixtures. This highlights the role of carbonaceous amendments in moderating the increases in concentration of salts that accompany composting. As composting progresses, components of organic matter mineralize into their soluble forms and become more concentrated with drying. High electrical conductivity of composts has been cited as one of the factors that inhibit seedling germination in some composts (Eklind 1998), hence seedling germination is used as a test for maturity and quality of composts (Wang et al. 2004; Nakasaki and Marui 2011). Addition of straw up to 10 % by weight of the composting mixture does not seem to alter the electrical conductivity of the compost water extracts significantly (Figure  4) as indicated by the electrical conductivities ranging from 3 to 8 mS/cm and 2 to 6.2 mS/cm for the no straw and 10 % straw mixtures, respectively. Findings by <b>Manios</b> (2004) were also in the range of 3.6 to 6.8 for various solid waste mixtures containing olive leaves. These results suggest that, {{on the basis of the}} electrical conductivity, composts mixtures with high (30 % or 50 %) straw are better suited for use in agriculture as soils amendments.|$|R

30|$|Contrary of {{the results}} about their own diets, when asked about their {{perceptions}} of their children’s diets, 72 % of the participants considered them to be healthy. A similar result was found in a study that compared mothers’ perceptions of their children’s diets with the children’s actual diet quality. Although only 0.2 % of the children had diets considered good, 78 % of the mothers reported believing that their children’s diets were adequate (Kourlaba, Kondaki, Grammatikaki, Roma-Giannikou, & <b>Manios,</b> 2009). Although the present study did not assess the food actually consumed by the children (since it focused on mothers’ perceptions), national review studies (Carvalho, Fonsêca, Priore, Franceschini, & Novaes, 2015) using similar samples (Sparrenberger, Friedrich, Schiffner, Schuch, & Wagner, 2015), and other studies that considered data from the sample’s main project from which the present study is derived (Valmórbida & Vitolo, 2014), indicate that children’s diets fall well short of recommendations and do so at increasingly younger ages. Thus, it is noted that mothers’ perceptions of the healthy feeding of their children may not be consistent with the food their children actually receive, as is indicated in the literature (Kourlaba et al., 2009).|$|R

Patients and methods: 123 patients participated in our study, including 65 cases of acute myocardial infarction (MI), 27 cases of newly diagnosed CAD &ndash; without MI &ndash; and 31 controls. In all subjects, myocardial serum enzyme levels (creatine phosphokinase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase) and inflammatory indices (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, white blood cells, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were measured. Patients were all submitted to coronary angiography and CAD severity was evaluated by Gensini score. Results: Significant differences concerning enzyme serum levels and inflammatory indices were found to exist between the three study groups, being highest among patients with acute MI (p&nbsp;&lt; 0. 001). A significant&nbsp; association was demonstrated between Gensini score and serum enzyme levels as well as inflammatory biomarkers. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that serum levels of myocardial enzymes and inflammatory indices correlate with CAD severity in Greek patients.
