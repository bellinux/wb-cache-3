A tripod and a quadruped {{with the same kind}} of legs are studied. The robots' kinematic models are built for achieving the machining and walking scenarios. The simulations show that: integrating some clamping devices and some lockable passive joints, six actuators are enough to build a legged manipulator which can not only perform 6 -axis machining but can also walk on a curved supporting media. Using the "modiﬁed condition number" index, the two mechanisms are compared. They have similar workspaces and static wrench performances during the <b>machining</b> <b>phase.</b> During walking processes, however, their behaviors are different, and each of them shows interesting features depending on application requiremen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work {{studies the}} {{influence}} of machining parameters, such as cutting speed and forces, feed rate, cutting depth, and tool flank wear, on the generation of surface residual stresses in DIN 100 Cr 6 steel conical bearing rings submitted to a hard turning process. A complete factorial planning was used to perform the tests and projected measurement. Cutting forces were measured by a piezoelectric dynamometer and residual stresses were determined by the hole-drilling method using strain gage. Results showed that after 2000 m of tool <b>machining,</b> <b>phase</b> transformations had been observed on sample surfaces, with white layer formation, and deeper, a dark layer whose thickness varied depending on the severity level of turning and the tool wear (in machined distance). Increase in tool wear generated minor values of compressive residual stresses and the surface roughness presented almost the same values in all experiments, except when the bigger parameters were used...|$|E

40|$|Sculptured surface {{machining}} (SSM) is an operation widely applied to several industrial {{fields such as}} aerospace, automotive and mould/die. The number of the parameters and strategies involved to program such machining operations can be enormously large owing to surface complexity and advanced design features. This study focuses on the examination of machining strategies and related parameters {{for the assessment of}} roughing and finishing stages. A fractional factorial design implementing an L 27 Taguchi orthogonal array (OA) was established to conduct machining experiments {{with the use of a}} computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software. Fractional factorial design specifics involve the statistical elimination of unimportant parameters, thus reducing experimental runs without the loss of useful information. Two scenarios were considered to machine a sculptured part; one involving 3 -axis roughing/ 3 -axis finish machining experiments and the other one involving 3 -axis roughing/ 5 -axis finish machining experiments. Roughing operation was common for both scenarios. The problem was subjected to discrete technological constraints to reflect the actual industrial status. For each <b>machining</b> <b>phase,</b> two quality objectives reflecting productivity and part quality were determined. Roughing experiments were tested to minimise machining time and remaining volume, whilst finishing experiments were subjected to minimise machining time and surface deviation between the designed and the machined 3 D model. Quality characteristics were properly weighted to formulate a single objective criterion for both machining phases. Results indicated that DOE applied to CAM software, enables NC programmers to have a clear understanding about the influence of process parameters for SSM operations, thus generating efficient toolpaths to improve productivity, part quality and process efficiency. Practically the work contributes to machining improvement by through the proposition of machining experimentation methods using safe and useful platforms such as CAM systems; the investigation of approaches to avoid problem oversimplification mainly when large number of machining parameters should be exploited and the evaluation of quality criteria which allow their assessment directly form CAM software...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{is the result}} of my work in the end study’s internship, in order to obtain my DUT Mechanical Engineering at the University of Angers. I made this internship of eleven weeks within society HALGAND, located at Saint Brévin les Pins, next to Saint Nazaire. My mission within this company was to realize work instructions for deburring of robot cells. To explain this mission, first we are going to explain the goal, and then we are going to present the different steps to complete this mission. The goal of this mission is to improve the manufacturing process of parts, and so to improve the production. All of this, by establishing working instructions allowing automated deburring operations on parts. The first thing was to have a provisional repertoire of parts which are machined on robot cell on which I worked. With this list, I determined articles on which I had to make modifications. Indeed, improvements must be made on parts having the largest machining time for month on the robot cell. The second step was to make an inventory of parts previously targeted, to identify different deburring there are to perform during machining. So, I had to analyze computer machining simulations and to discuss with the machine operators to know the different deburring already performed during machining, and those remaining to complete. An inventory of tools for deburring which are presents in the workshop and deburring stations has been also realized. I also had to look for innovative tools in the field of automated deburring, which were not present in the workshop. Then, I formed a work instruction file already ready to be filled to facilitate the creation of work instructions. So I had to implement a suitable format and to choose an interesting and relevant location for work instructions for deburring of robot cells. The choice of location was to be decided with the opinion of machine operators, who are, of course, the first people concerned by these work instruction. And finally, the final work was to realize work instructions of the selected parts, in order to integrate deburring operations during the <b>machining</b> <b>phase.</b> Inside these work instructio...|$|E
40|$|Brittle-hardmaterials like {{ceramics}} and cermets {{are used in}} many challenging applicationsbecause they are characterized by very interesting properties, such as asuperior specific stiffness, a high wear resistance, chemical stability [...] . Their major drawback however lies in their poor machinability. Enabling anaffordable production of smooth and accurate free-form shapes, will create amultitude of new applications. As an example, the fabrication of free-formcermet molds {{can lead to the}} mass fabrication of free-form lenses of opticalquality through replication. This application requires the workpiece to behighly accurate and to have a superb surface quality. ELID-grinding is one ofthe most promising techniques to realize this. Severalpublications have reported on the potential of ELID-grinding. However, onlylittle research has been conducted on the characteristics of the electrolyticdressing principle, which is still not fully understood at this moment. In thepresented research the electrochemical fundamentals of the passivation processhave been studied profoundly and a model has been developed which explains theelectrical behavior of the growth of the passivation layer. This model can beused to monitor and control the state of the passivation layer, in order tomaintain stable grinding conditions. Experiments have been carried out toinvestigate the influences of some of the key parameters on the passivationspeed of a grinding wheel. Additionally,several series of grinding experiments have been performed to analyze theELID-grinding process efficiency, the workpiece precision and the surfacequality of the part. This has been realized for three types of materials: ahardened steel, a cermet and a ceramic. Industrialapplication oriented experiments have been conducted for the grinding of a hardenedsteel. This material is for instance used in bearings and gears which aresubjected to intensive loads. ELID-grinding with metal bonded wheels shows someclear advantages such as high grinding ratios and a good final surface quality. Nonetheless, the traditional way of grinding hardened steels, i. e. by usingvitrified bonded wheels, is more time-efficient because these wheels benefitfrom better truing and dressing properties. In this workELID-grinding has been concluded to be more of interest for machining evenharder materials, such as technical {{ceramics and}} cermets. In the first (rough) <b>machining</b> <b>phase,</b> also called ELID-roughing, the goal is to remove material inan efficient way. ELID-grinding {{has been shown to be}} advantageous compared toconventional grinding methods with resin bonded and metal bonded wheels. Inthis process stage the ELID-dressing is beneficial because it leads to stableand efficient grinding conditions. Traditionally,the finishing steps have to be carried out on dedicated lapping and polishingmachines. This however requires the workpieces to be dismounted andre-installed, leading to a loss in precision and increased processing times. The ELID-dressing principle on the contrary can also be applied to grindingwheels containing very small abrasives. The ELID-finishing stage cantherefore be carried out on the same grinding machine as the one used for therough machining stage. This will enhance the precision of the final workpiece. Moreover, the workpiece surface will show a mirror reflection due to the Raroughness which is in the order of magnitude of 1 nanometer.

40|$|Plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (PHEVs) provide much promise in reducing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and, thus, are a focal point of research and development. Existing on-board charging capacity is effective but {{requires the use of}} several power conversion devices and power converters, which reduce reliability and cost efficiency. This paper presents a novel three-phase switched reluctance (SR) motor drive with integrated charging functions (including internal combustion engine and grid charging). The electrical energy flow within the drivetrain is controlled by a power electronic converter with less power switching devices and magnetic devices. It allows the desired energy conversion between the engine generator, the battery, and the SR motor under different operation modes. Battery-charging techniques are developed to operate under both motor-driving mode and standstill-charging mode. During the magnetization mode, the <b>machine's</b> <b>phase</b> windings are energized by the dc-link voltage. The power converter and the <b>machine</b> <b>phase</b> windings are controlled with a three-phase relay to enable the use of the ac-dc rectifier.

40|$|A four-level {{inverter}} configuration for an {{induction motor}} is proposed in this paper. The drive {{used for this}} scheme is an open-end winding induction motor which {{can be obtained by}} separating the neutral connections of any general threephase induction motor. The proposed scheme uses two three-level inverters, with asymmetric DC link voltage, feeding the induction machine from both sides and can generate voltage space vector locations similar to a conventional seven-level inverter. The four-level scheme is based on the use of only those space vector combinations of the seven-level inverter, which generate zero common mode voltage in the <b>machine</b> <b>phase</b> voltages. The proposed four-level inverter scheme requires only two isolated DC links as compared to the conventional diode-clamped four-level inverter scheme, which needs three isolated power supplies.
