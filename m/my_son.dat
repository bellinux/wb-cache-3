5|$|In 2006, Sevigny {{began her}} five-season {{run in the}} HBO {{television}} series Big Love, about a family of fundamentalist Mormon polygamists. She played Nicolette Grant, the conniving, shopaholic daughter of a cult leader and second wife to a polygamist husband, played by Bill Paxton. Sevigny found even more mainstream success with a role in her first big-budget production as Robert Graysmith's wife Melanie in David Fincher's Zodiac (2007), telling {{the true story of}} San Francisco's infamous Zodiac Killer. In 2009, Sevigny starred in the independent psychological thriller film The Killing Room, and Werner Herzog's <b>My</b> <b>Son,</b> <b>My</b> <b>Son,</b> What Have Ye Done, a crime horror film based on murderer Mark Yavorsky, produced by David Lynch. Sevigny also had a voice part in the independent documentary film, Beautiful Darling (2010), narrating the life of trans woman Warhol superstar Candy Darling through Darling's diaries and personal letters. Throughout 2009, Sevigny continued working on Big Loves fourth season; when filming the series, she spent {{six months of the year}} living outside of Los Angeles near Santa Clarita, away from her home in New York City.|$|E

5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over <b>my</b> <b>son</b> with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E

5|$|The {{first film}} {{screening}} in Turkey was at Yıldız Palace in 1896, {{a year after}} the technology publicly debuted in Paris. Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyoğlu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as İstiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. The Turkish film industry ramped up {{in the second half of}} the century, and with Uzak (2002) and My Father and <b>My</b> <b>Son</b> (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the extant}} temples at <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn,</b> {{such as the}} Isanabhadresvara, {{were built in the}} 10th century AD. Unfortunately, the {{inscriptions}} from this period have not survived, except in fragmentary form. At the beginning of the 10th century, the Cham center of power was at Đồng Dương, not far from <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn.</b> By the end of the century, it had been displaced southward to Bình Định Province on account of military setbacks in wars with the Viet. However, Cham kings continued periodically to renovate the temples at <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn</b> and even to build new foundations. The latest significant Cham record at <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn</b> is a pillar inscription of King Jaya Indravarman V dated 1243 AD. By the early 15th century, the Cham had lost their northernmost lands, including the area of <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn,</b> to the Viet.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the conquest}} of central Vietnam by the Viet and the decline and {{eventual}} fall of Champa, the <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn</b> complex fell into disuse and was largely forgotten. It was rediscovered in 1898 by the Frenchman M. C. Paris. A year later, members of the scholarly society called École française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO) began to study the inscriptions, architecture, and art of <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn.</b> In 1904, they published their initial findings {{in the journal of}} the society called Bulletin de l'École française d'Extrême Orient (BEFEO).
