Much of the album's artwork was shot there.|$|E

In the interview, Allen said, [...] "Knowing <b>my</b> <b>ex-wife,</b> it probably wasn't a moving violation."

5000|$|The Iwaidja {{languages}} are nearly unique among {{the languages of}} the world in using verbs for kin terms. Nouns are used for direct address, but transitive verbs in all other cases. In English something similar is done in special cases: he fathered a child; she mothers him too much. But these do not indicate social relationships in English. For example, he fathered a child says nothing about whether he is the man the child calls [...] "father". An Iwaidja speaker, on the other hand, says I nephew her to mean [...] "she is my aunt". Because these are verbs, they can be inflected for tense. In the case of in-laws, this is equivalent to <b>my</b> <b>ex-wife</b> or the bride-to-be in English. However, with blood relations, past can only mean that the person has died, and future only that they are yet to be born.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the Iowa Source in 2005, Davis said: If you were to do a survey of what causes misery on earth, it would tend to fall into three broad categories. One, we can call systems: the economy, AIDS, terrorism--things that are 'systems' in nature. The second would be a list of everybody to blame: Bush is the cause of my misery, <b>my</b> <b>ex-wife,</b> my boss. The third would be things that come utterly out of left field: a tornado through town, a tsunami, events that are not in our apparent control. What this huge list would have in common--something everybody would agree with — is that the cause of misery are things outside ‘myself’. But the cause of our misery is absolutely, positively not at all what we believe it to be. This is not a new view. Certainly saints and philosophers in every generation have basically argued if you want to change the world, you have to change yourself.|$|E
5000|$|Randers FC had to miss Jonas Borring for {{an unknown}} period, due to some {{personal}} reasons. This was {{announced by the}} club in March 2015 Two days later, he signed a contract extension on two-years. The personal reasons were shortly after being published. The problem was that Borring's wife, Kira Egsgaard Borring, had left him, and had come along with Borring's team-mate, Christian Keller. Borring {{went out to the}} medias and said that he wouldn't play for Randers once again, as long as Keller was on the team: [...] "Directly asked if I want to play with him again, I can clearly answer no. One thing is, that I have lost everything for <b>my</b> <b>ex-wife,</b> especially when we got to children, but another thing is, that I have a captain, who stabbed me in the back and has violated the rules of the locker room, so I’m sad and disappointed, and I’m still in shock." [...] Randers took the captaincy from Keller {{as a result of his}} doing. The other players in the squad supported Borring. On 23 March 2016, Borring left Randers due to the romantic involvement between team-mate Christian Keller and Borring's ex-wife.|$|E
5000|$|The reason I {{changed my}} name was simple. My mother, never a fan of my father's family, had an unfortunate habit of using Levine as a {{stinging}} insult. When displeased with me, she would often say/shriek, [...] "You know what you are? You're a Levine! A no good, rotten Levine!" [...] So, for {{as far back as}} I can remember, every time I heard my last name I would experience acute feelings of low self-esteem. My first wife was the one who suggested I change my name to remedy the situation. In fact, it was she {{who came up with the}} name Lorre, complete with the fancy spelling. I thought it sounded great. Chuck Lorre. Finally a name that did not make me squirm. It didn't occur to me that in England my new name translated into Chuck Truck. But most interestingly, I had completely forgotten that when I was around eight years old my father's business began to fail, forcing my mother to find work in a clothing store called... Lorie's. Pretty creepy, huh? Did I abandon my father's name only to unconsciously name myself after a place associated with my mother's abandonment of me? Or, even creepier, did <b>my</b> <b>ex-wife</b> somehow know all this and propose the name Lorre just to screw with me? Hmmm... I was a no good, rotten husband so I certainly had it coming.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the Two Virgins, John stated in an {{interview}} that he believed the album [...] "can change people", as others [...] "have changed my head, just with their records." [...] He then claimed [...] "thats what Yoko and my singing is, to change it like that". Lennon talked about making the album and Onos influence on him, in an interview in 1980 with Playboys David Sheff: [...] "Well, after Yoko and I met, I didnt realize I was in love with her. I was still thinking it was an artistic collaboration, as it were - producer and artist, right? ... <b>My</b> <b>ex-wife</b> was away ... and Yoko came to visit me. ... instead of making love, we went upstairs and made tapes. I had this room full of different tapes where I would write and make strange loops and things like that for the Beatles stuff. So we made a tape all night. She was doing her funny voices and I was pushing all different buttons on my tape recorder and getting sound effects. And then as the sun rose we made love and that was Two Virgins." [...] This was Johns first recording project that did not feature any help from the other Beatles; parts of the album were reminiscent of later editions of the Beatles Christmas flexi recordings.|$|E

The Department brass and the District Attorney, annoyed with the expense of paying for Kavanaugh's task force and the lack of progress in the case, decide to accept. In a desperate attempt to change the Chief's mind, Kavanaugh inadvertently reveals that destroying Vic has become more important than his job. He angrily protests to Chief Johnson, who gently tells him: [...] "It's over, Jon. Sending Lemansky to jail sends a message and we all move on." [...] Seething with hatred, Kavanaugh snarls:: [...] "Mackey skates clean? This guy is pissing all over us. And we just smile, and lick it up?" [...] Assistant Chief Roy Phillips interrupts him, saying: [...] "That's enough." [...] However, the Chief of Police bristles as Kavanaugh dramatically points to the crime scene photos of Terry Crowley and screams: [...] "Vic Mackey kills cops! He... he deals drugs!

A sample of fathers (n = 109) who had attended a court ordered divorce education program completed mailed surveys assessing various aspects of their co-parenting relationship with their ex-spouse. Co-parenting was measured using two scales consisting of 12 and 14 items respectively designed to measure perceived co-parenting strategies of each parent. Sample items are as follows: "I use our child to get back at my ex-wife," "My ex-wife uses our child to get back at me," and "I deliver messages to <b>my</b> <b>ex-wife</b> through our child rather than say them to her directly. " Results showed that fathers' perceptions of their own co-parenting strategies as well as their perceptions of their ex-wives co-parenting strategies were significantly related to how often the children spent the night at their fathers' homes and to how often fathers visited with their children. Fathers' perceptions of their own co-parenting strategies, but not their perceptions of their ex-wives' co-parenting strategies, was significantly related to how often fathers talked to their child. The fathers' income and amount of child support paid per month were significantly related to all three types of contact (i. e., overnight stays, frequency of talking with child, and frequency of visits). In addition, the length of the father's marriage to his ex-wife was significantly related to how often the child spent the night. These results show the importance of fathers' perceptions of the co-parenting relationship quality on their reported contact with their nonresidential children. Implications will be drawn from this study for parent educators and others who work with divorced parents...|$|E
