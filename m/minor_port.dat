25|$|After a {{stopover}} {{of several}} weeks at the <b>minor</b> <b>port</b> of Nossi-Bé, Madagascar, {{that had been}} reluctantly allowed by neutral France {{in order not to}} jeopardize its relations with its Russian ally, the Russian Baltic fleet proceeded to Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina passing on its way through the Singapore Strait between 7 and 10 April 1905. The fleet finally reached the Sea of Japan in May 1905. The logistics of such an undertaking in the age of coal power was astounding. The squadron required approximately 500,000tons of coal to complete the journey, yet by international law, it was not allowed to coal at neutral ports, forcing the Russian authorities to acquire a large fleet of colliers to supply the fleet at sea. The weight of the ships' stores needed for such a long journey was to be another major problem.|$|E

The <b>minor</b> <b>port</b> city {{of his youth}} had risen to world renown as the booming financial centre of the Victorian gold rush. Horatio, {{now a member of}} the Legislative Assembly in the Victorian Parliament, was living on [...] "Belle Vue", a farm at Point Henry near Geelong, the Wills' family home since 1853. In his first summer back in Melbourne, Wills stayed with his extended family, the Harrisons, at their home on Victoria Parade, and entered a Collins Street law firm to appease his father, but he seems never to have practiced; the few comments he made about law suggest it meant little to him.

[...] However, before 1780 Runcorn could not have been described as even a <b>minor</b> <b>port.</b> [...] The construction of a port of any significance did not start until after the arrival of the Bridgewater Canal. [...] A line of ten locks connected the Runcorn basin of the canal with the Mersey at a position to the west of Runcorn Gap. [...] Close to this point the Duke of Bridgewater built two tidal basins, two warehouses, a dry dock and a house, Bridgewater House, from which to supervise the work. To the west of this area he later built the dock, which opened in 1791.|$|E

6000|$|In {{some ways}} it was disappointing, in others it was a relief, {{not to have the}} {{restraint}} of Lady Peacock's presence during the last days we were to have with the Fordyces. For a fresh loss came upon us. [...] Beachharbour was a fishing-village on the north-western coast, which, within the previous decade, had sprung into importance, on the one hand as a fashionable resort, on the other as a <b>minor</b> <b>port</b> for colliers. The living was wretchedly poor, and had been held for many years by one of the old inferior stamp of clergy, scarcely superior in habits or breeding to the farmers, and only outliving the scandals of his youth to fall into a state of indolent carelessness. It was in the gift of a child, for whom Sir Horace Lester was trustee, and that gentleman had written, about a fortnight before Ellen's death, to consult Mr. Fordyce on its disposal, declaring the great difficulties and deficiencies of the place, which made it impossible to offer it to any one without considerable private means, and also able to attract and improve the utterly demoralised population. He ended, almost in joke, by saying, 'In fact, I know no one who could cope with the situation but yourself; I wish you could find me your own counterpart, or come yourself in earnest. It is just the air that suits my sister-- bracing sea-breezes; the parsonage, though a wretched place, is well situated, and she would be all the stronger; but in poor Ellen's state there is no use in talking of it, and besides I know you are wedded to your fertile fields and Somersetshire clowns.' ...|$|E
