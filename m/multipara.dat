40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of parity on periparturitional behavior by quantitatively comparing the behavior of 10 primiparous and 11 multiparous cynomolgus macaques. We found {{a considerable number of}} significant differences, some of them affirming the outcome of previous descriptive studies. During the prepartus phase, primiparae showed more locomotion and "action postures" and fewer "resting postures" than <b>multiparae.</b> Further, primiparae spent more time straining than <b>multiparae</b> and were straining in a greater variety of postures than <b>multiparae,</b> which were straining predominantly in a squatting posture. In the postpartus phase, primiparae needed more time than <b>multiparae</b> to get their young in ventroventral position. Primiparae licked mainly the newborn;multiparae licked mainly their own bodies. Finally, fewer primiparae than <b>multiparae</b> ate the placenta. The discussion extensively treats theories concerning parity effects. We explain behavioral differences between primiparae and <b>multiparae</b> in terms of novelty of the female's internal state and novelty of the neonate and in terms of learning. We stress that the mechanism behind the so-called parity effect cannot be revealed without paying more attention, next to learning, to age, to experience with pregnancy, and to experience with parturition. Further, we argue that the immediate acceptance of the newborn at birth and the differences between primiparae and <b>multiparae</b> might {{play a crucial role in}} the search for the mechanism behind the onset of maternal behavior...|$|R

40|$|Female mammals invest {{heavily in}} reproduction. Females require food to {{reproduce}} and thus mothers compete for food. In group-living species, females who form strong intrasexual social bonds reproduce more than females who do not. To reproduce successfully, females must meet both nutritional and social needs. Although mothers face certain challenges involving competition and affiliation, not all mothers are the same. One factor, parity, affects females across taxa. Due to inexperience, primiparas, mothers raising their first offspring, face challenges not experienced by <b>multiparas,</b> mothers with multiple offspring. Therefore, primiparas behave differently than <b>multiparas.</b> Chimpanzees {{are an excellent}} species to investigate whether behavior varies with parity. Chimpanzees are long-lived and primiparas live with <b>multiparas</b> in multi-female, multi-male, fission-fusion communities. I investigated the relationship between parity and behavior by conducting a 15 -month study of female chimpanzees living in the community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. During the study, several females gave birth to their first offspring. This produced an ideal situation to compare the behavior of mothers who differed in parity, testing the prediction that primiparas and <b>multiparas</b> behave differently. To determine how females compete with one another, I examined ranging and intrasexual aggression, which influence food access. To examine female social bonds, I analyzed observations of association and grooming. Females at Ngogo utilized small, overlapping ranges within the community territory. Range sizes differed, but parity did not predict this variation. As reported elsewhere, mothers were often aggressive toward adolescent nulliparas. Female aggression varied with parity; primiparas displayed more aggression toward adolescents than did <b>multiparas.</b> Regarding affiliation, mothers mainly associated and groomed with mothers, rather than with adolescent nulliparas. Examining mothers by parity class showed that primiparas groomed with adolescent nulliparas more than did <b>multiparas.</b> These results indicate that behavioral differences existed between primiparous and multiparous female chimpanzees. These differences involved mothers’ social interactions with adolescent nulliparas in competitive and affiliative contexts. These results {{emphasize the importance of}} examining parity because considering mothers as a single category can mask behavioral variation. This indicates the importance of examining the lives of primiparas in order to understand how evolution has influenced the mothers’ behavior...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} {{cumulative}} risk and parity {{on the effectiveness}} of a home based parenting intervention were tested in a randomized controlled trial with 237 families with 1 - to 3 -year-old children screened for high levels of externalizing behavior. The intervention was aimed at enhancing positive parenting and decreasing externalizing behaviors. The results showed that cumulative risk was not associated with either change in child externalizing behaviors or change in positive parenting. When intervention effectiveness was compared for primiparas (i. e., first-time mothers) versus <b>multiparas</b> (i. e., mothers with more than one child), we found that intervention mothers of first-born children displayed an increase in their use of positive discipline strategies as compared to first-time mothers in the control group, whereas a similar effect for <b>multiparas</b> was absent. Among <b>multiparas</b> we found an intervention effect on sensitivity, with control group mothers showing an increase in sensitivity, whereas the intervention group showed a constant level of sensitivity over time. These results suggest that parity may be a moderator of intervention effectiveness. Implications for investigating moderators of intervention effective-ness are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pathological {{changes were}} studied by light and {{electron}} microscopy on term placentas collected in Malawi from 20 P. fakiparum infected women (11 primiparas and 9 <b>multiparas).</b> One placenta from an uninfected term primipara and 4 from <b>multiparas</b> were studied as controls. Changes included {{the presence of}} parasitized erythrocytes and malarial pigment particles in the intervillous space, excessive syncytial knotting, chronic basal villitis, malarial pigment deposits in the trophoblasts, trophoblastic damage with focal necrosis, partial loss of microvilli, and thickening of the trophoblastic basement membrane. Infected erythrocytes were not seen in the fetal circulation. Severity appeared to correlate {{with the level of}} maternal and placental parasitemias, regardless of infant birth weight or placental weight. Differences in the severity of pathological changes between primiparas and <b>multiparas</b> could not be demonstrated. Immunohistochemistry revealed that 45 % of the placentas stained strongly for IgG and 15 % stained for C 3 and for P. fakiparum antigensinthetrophoblasticcytoplasmand basement membrane.

40|$|To {{assess how}} medical staff on {{perinatal}} medicine {{have to work}} for the emotional support for pregnant and puerperal women, we have investigated the sense of motherhood and maternal anxiety. This study was made on 425 pregnant women and 65 puerperal women. The correlation between maternal anxiety and general anxiety was assessed. The primipara and <b>multipara</b> have had great anxiety during the first trimester and puerperium, respectively. The change of the sense of motherhood in primipara was similar to that in <b>multipara</b> from the first trimester to puerperium. It was characteristic of the sense of motherhood in primipara to change dependent on maternal anxiety. This indicates that the emotional support corresponding to the surroundings and the period of the pregnant women is more needed and to tide over a critical situation with regard to motherhood is to promote the development of the sense of motherhood...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} were to {{evaluate}} changes in specific oligoelements in human milk during {{the first four months}} of lactation and to correlate such changes with total antioxidant status (TAS) and other parameters, such as the mother's age, primipara versus <b>multipara,</b> and supplement intake. Milk samples were collected from 31 lactating women following 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after birth. Trace levels of 13 elements were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results obtained for the oligoelements exhibited a decrease in concentration from 7 days to 4 months of breast-feeding, with exceptions. Correlations were found between TAS and Co, V, Rb and Tl. Between primipara and <b>multipara,</b> differences were found for Ni and Rb. Regarding the mother's age, correlation was found for Rb and Ba (increased for mothers older than 30 years). Increased amounts of Rb, Mo and Tl at any lactation period appeared in women who took supplements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Striae gravidarum is a {{physiological}} skin change that many pregnant women experience during pregnancy. The striae are {{often accompanied by}} a reddish purple color during pregnancy, and then lose pigmentation and become atrophic {{in the long term}} after pregnancy. Striae gravidarum seems to be undesirable to many pregnant women. However, the impact of striae gravidarum on pregnant women who experience it has not been clarified. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of striae gravidarum on the generic and dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) of pregnant women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at three private clinics in a typical urban area in Japan. We recruited 447 pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation; One hundred and ninety-nine pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation participated in the study and 179, consisting of 94 primiparae and 85 <b>multiparae,</b> were analyzed. We used and assessed Davey’s score for striae gravidarum, World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment questionnaire for generic QOL, and Skindex- 29 for dermatology-specific QOL. Results The prevalence of striae gravidarum was 39. 1 % (27. 7 % in primiparae, and 51. 8 % in <b>multiparae).</b> Although there were no differences in generic QOL scores between the presence and absence of striae gravidarum and with their severity, the whole group of pregnant women and the <b>multiparae</b> group showed significant differences in scores on emotion of Skindex- 29 between the presence and absence of striae gravidarum (p [*]=[*] 0. 012 and p [*]=[*] 0. 011). Pregnant women with severe striae gravidarum showed significantly higher scores on emotion of Skindex- 29 compared with those with absent or mild striae gravidarum (p [*] p [*]=[*] 0. 005). Conclusions There was no difference in generic QOL of pregnant women between the presence and absence of striae gravidarum, although the occurrence and severity of striae gravidarum influenced their dermatology-specific QOL. <b>Multiparae</b> women were especially impaired by striae gravidarum and it is considered important to prevent or reduce the severity of striae gravidarum of the <b>multiparae</b> group. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: In University Clinical Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology {{is using}} {{reference}} data from 1974 {{developed for the}} infants born in Belgrade (Serbia). It estimates the standards of term infants for neonatal weight, length and head circumference. Aim: This study was create to develop charts for birth weight, lenght and head circumference specific to gestational age, gender and parity for term singleton infants in Tuzla Canton. Methods: The study was conducted at University Clinical Center Tuzla, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a primary obstetrical care facility for residents of Tuzla Canton over the one-year period. During the one year study period, 01. 01. - 31. 12. 2009, there were 4106 infants born at 37 th to 41 th weeks of gestation (GW), 2168 (52. 8 %) males and 1938 (47. 2 %) females. We analysed gestational age, birth weights, body length and head circumference. Results: Females infants of primiparae, born at 40 th gestational week, had the lowest median birth weight, 3500 g, followed by female infants of <b>multiparae,</b> 3640 g, and male infants of primiparae, 3650 g. The greatest median birth weight, 3730 g, had male infants of <b>multiparae.</b> Median birth length value at the 40 th gestational week for male infants of primiparae and <b>multiparae,</b> as well as female infants of <b>multiparae</b> is the same, 55 cm, while is lower in female infants of primiparae (54 cm). There is no difference in median head circumference at the 40 th gestational week between female infants of primiparae and <b>multiparae,</b> and male infants of primiparae (35 cm). Mean birth weight and length of liveborn infants at 37. to 41. gestational week differed significantly between certain parities (F= 8, 723, Df= 2, p&lt; 0, 001; F= 3, 292, Df= 2, p= 0, 037, respectively). No {{significant difference was found}} for head circumference (F= 0, 983, Df= 2, p= 0, 374). Conclusion: The average birth weight of infants within Tuzla Canton is bigger in comparison with the centile that have been used so far...|$|R

Compared with infants of primiparas, infants of <b>multiparas</b> were {{at twice the}} risk for infant and postneonatal death but at no increased risk for neonatal death. They were also at {{two to three times}} the risk for deaths due to accidents, infections, and sudden infant death syndrome. The higher sociodemographic disadvantage and poorer prenatal care of <b>multiparas</b> did not explain the excess infant mortality risk that was concentrated in causes of death that are potentially preventable through primary care and parent education...|$|R
