5|$|It is {{a long-standing}} practice, {{as with many}} Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of any piece of work they do. It stands for the Latin phrase Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam which <b>means</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> Greater Glory of God. At {{the end of a}} piece of work they write L.D.S. in the centre of the page. It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always. These are both {{traditional}} Jesuit mottoes.|$|E
5|$|Law enforcement's corrupt {{attitude}} generally {{was not at}} {{the expense}} of the people. Apart from the economic benefits provided by the Maceos, these bosses provided a high degree of protection to the island's citizens. When serious crimes were committed the local police would sometimes contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with. However, the island was not completely peaceful; threats at the point of a gun were a common <b>means</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Maceo gang to ensure control. Though the average citizen was relatively safe, gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E
5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history.

The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{between the}} Song and Liao {{remained}} tense and hostile: in 986 the Song sent three armies against the Liao {{in an effort}} to take advantage of an infant emperor and recapture the Sixteen Prefectures, but the Liao successfully repulsed all three armies. Following this, diplomatic relations were resumed. Relations between Song and Liao worsened in the 990s. From 993 to 1004, the Liao observed the Song as the latter built a 'Great Ditch' in northern Hebei province from the Taihang Mountains in the west {{all the way to the}} Bohai Sea in the east. This was essentially a series of canals meant to block the advance of Liao cavalry far from the northern border line, although the Liao perceived this engineering project as a <b>means</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Song to dispatch offensive forces more efficiently via new waterways. In 999 the Liao began annual attacks on Song positions, though with no breakthrough victories. The Liao were interested in capturing the Guannan region of northern Hebei, both because the Song general Zhou Shizong had taken it from them and because it contained strategic passes.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} numerous subplots which largely {{serve as}} <b>means</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> player to earn money. For example, the player {{can choose to}} locate and retrieve a stolen icon {{on behalf of a}} religious leader in exchange for a reward. Other methods to earn money include stripping the corpses of slain opponents for marketable items, killing wanted criminals to earn a reward, and attacking other vessels in space to pirate their cargo. Gameplay {{in the early stages of}} the game primarily involves activities of this nature so that the player can accumulate enough money to outfit the party with better weapons and armor and purchase a jump drive capable of propelling the party's spacecraft to other worlds crucial to obtaining the means to stop Kiefer.|$|E
5|$|Between 850 and 1100, the Empire {{developed}} a mixed {{relationship with the}} new state of the Kievan Rus', which had emerged to the north across the Black Sea. This relationship would have long-lasting repercussions {{in the history of}} the East Slavs, and the Empire quickly became the main trading and cultural partner for Kiev. The Rus' launched their first attack against Constantinople in 860, pillaging the suburbs of the city. In 941, they appeared on the Asian shore of the Bosphorus, but this time they were crushed, an indication of the improvements in the Byzantine military position after 907, when only diplomacy had been able to push back the invaders. Basil II could not ignore the emerging power of the Rus', and, following the example of his predecessors, he used religion as a <b>means</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> achievement of political purposes. Rus'–Byzantine relations became closer following the marriage of Anna Porphyrogeneta to Vladimir the Great in 988, and the subsequent Christianisation of the Rus'. Byzantine priests, architects, and artists were invited to work on numerous cathedrals and churches around Rus', expanding Byzantine cultural influence even further, while numerous Rus' served in the Byzantine army as mercenaries, most notably as the famous Varangian Guard.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} by Tim Oliver {{studies the}} theoretical discussions of Brexit, Grexit and other exit scenarios. Oliver starts {{from the fact}} that the UK’s vote to leave the European Union has presented the integration project with an unprecedented challenge. What this could <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> EU has been the subject of increased levels of analysis and speculation, albeit nowhere near as comprehensive as that into what <b>the</b> vote might <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> UK. One concern is that Brexit signals or could begin the unravelling of the EU, eventually leading to its complete collapse and disintegration. To examine whether or not Brexit will lead to European disintegration, this chapter explores some of the analysis into what Brexit could <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> EU and then explores some of the theoretical debates about European disintegration...|$|R
