40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to discuss therapy {{possibilities}} in the management of molar incisor hypomineralization. Molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) is defined as hypomineralization of one or more first permanent molars frequently affecting incisors. Etiology of MIH is not fully clarified and numerous etiological factors have been cited. Hypomineralized molars are more prone to caries, cause severe restorative problems and are frequently extracted due to serious damage and caries complications. Incisors can present demarcated enamel opacities, while enamel breakdown is uncommon. Clinically, affected molars can be sensitive to thermal and chemical irritations even when there is no enamel breakdown. Molars can be sensitive to <b>mechanical</b> <b>irritations</b> making even regular tooth brushing painful. Specific problems related to the treatment of these teeth are sensitivity and occlusion in molars and aesthetics in incisors.

More simply, epulis fissuratum is where excess folds of firm tissue form inside the mouth, {{as a result of}} rubbing on the edge of dentures that do not fit well.

60|$|When the glands on {{the disc}} are excited {{either by the}} {{absorption}} of nitrogenous matter or by <b>mechanical</b> <b>irritation,</b> their secretion increases in quantity and becomes acid. They likewise transmit [page 129] some influence to the glands of the exterior tentacles, causing them to secrete more copiously; and their secretion likewise becomes acid. With animals, according to Schiff,* <b>mechanical</b> <b>irritation</b> excites the glands of the stomach to secrete an acid, but not pepsin. Now, I {{have every reason to}} believe (though the fact is not fully established), that although the glands of Drosera are continually secreting viscid fluid to replace that lost by evaporation, yet they do not secrete the ferment proper for digestion when mechanically irritated, but only after absorbing certain matter, probably of a nitrogenous nature. I infer that this is the case, as the secretion from a large number of leaves which had been irritated by particles of glass placed on their discs did not digest albumen; and more especially from the analogy of Dionaea and Nepenthes. In like manner, the glands of the stomach of animals secrete pepsin, as Schiff asserts, only after they have absorbed certain soluble substances, which he designates as peptogenes. There is, therefore, a remarkable parallelism between the glands of Drosera and those of the stomach in the secretion of their proper acid and ferment.|$|E

A number independent experiments subsequently confirmed the cancer-inducing effect of coal-tar in mice. The importance of Fibiger's work was regarded as conclusive.

60|$|We may {{conclude}} {{that a small}} dose of camphor in solution is a powerful stimulant to Drosera. It not only soon excites the tentacles to bend, but apparently renders the glands sensitive to a touch, which by itself does not cause any movement. Or {{it may be that}} a slight <b>mechanical</b> <b>irritation</b> not enough to cause any inflection yet gives some tendency to movement, and thus reinforces the action of the camphor. This latter view would have appeared to me the more probable one, had it not been shown by M. Vogel that camphor is a stimulant in other ways to various plants and seeds.|$|E
60|$|From the {{foregoing}} cases {{it is certain}} that bits of meat and albumen, if at all damp, excite not only the glands to secrete, but the lobes to close. This movement is widely different from the rapid closure caused by one of the filaments being touched. We shall see its importance when we treat of the manner in which insects are captured. There is a great contrast between Drosera and Dionaea in the effects produced by <b>mechanical</b> <b>irritation</b> on the one hand, and the absorption of animal matter on the other. Particles of glass placed on the glands of the exterior tentacles of Drosera excite movement within nearly the same time, as do particles of meat, the latter being rather the most efficient; but when the glands of the disc have bits of meat given them, they transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles much more quickly than do these glands when bearing inorganic particles, or when irritated by repeated touches. On the other hand, with Dionaea, touching the filaments excites incomparably quicker movement than the absorption of animal matter by the glands. Nevertheless, in [page 299] certain cases, this latter stimulus is the more powerful of the two. On three occasions leaves were found which from some cause were torpid, so that their lobes closed only slightly, however much their filaments were irritated; but on inserting crushed insects between the lobes, they became in a day closely shut.|$|E

40|$|Schwannomas are {{predominantly}} benign nerve sheath neoplasms caused by Nf 2 gene inactivation. Presently, treatment options are mainly limited to surgical tumor resection {{due to the}} lack of effective pharmacological drugs. Although the mechanistic understanding of Nf 2 gene function has advanced, it has so far been primarily restricted to Schwann cell-intrinsic events. Extracellular cues determining Schwann cell behavior with regard to schwannoma development remain unknown. Here we show pro-tumourigenic microenvironmental effects on Schwann cells where an altered axonal microenvironment in cooperation with injury signals contribute to a persistent regenerative Schwann cell response promoting schwannoma development. Specifically in genetically engineered mice following crush injuries on sciatic nerves, we found macroscopic nerve swellings in mice with homozygous nf 2 gene deletion in Schwann cells and in animals with heterozygous nf 2 knockout in both Schwann cells and axons. However, patient-mimicking schwannomas could only be provoked in animals with combined heterozygous nf 2 knockout in Schwann cells and axons. We identified a severe re-myelination defect and sustained macrophage presence in the tumor tissue as major abnormalities. Strikingly, treatment of tumor-developing mice after nerve crush injury with medium-dose aspirin significantly decreased schwannoma progression in this disease model. Our results suggest a multifactorial concept for schwannoma formation-emphasizing axonal factors and <b>mechanical</b> nerve <b>irritation</b> as predilection site for schwannoma development. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the potential efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of schwannomas...|$|R

40|$|After severe {{chemical}} burns, {{the treatment}} of the exposed corneal stroma is generally started with the adhesion of a contact lens. The Histoacryl adhesive used during the surgery often causes unwanted side effects. Vascularisation of the cornea, leukocyte invasion and <b>mechanical</b> <b>irritations</b> and often a premature ablation of the contact lens are well-known side effects. The toxicity of the cyanoacrylate leads to histological alterations. A control of the ocular fundus, though important, can often not be realised as the blue adhesive disperses during the surgery. The most severe complication, however, is the disability of the epithelium to regenerate after the contact lens has been removed. Keratoplastic, which is difficult due to the neutralised immunologic status of the cornea, or a renewed adhesion are the only possible treatments left. Facing the complications, the objective {{of this study was to}} find a possible alternative to the Histoacryl adhesive. In the following, 24 corneas were examined after an incubation of two weeks. After the surfaces had been pre-treated with phosphoric acid, the corneas of group A were treated with Excite and the corneas of group B were additionally treated with a fine hybrid composite. The contact lenses were each time pre-treated with Heliobond. The new Excite system established a bridge between the hydrophilic cornea and the hydrophobic contact lens/Heliobond. The histological results indicate that Excite has a sufficient biocompatibility. The results of group A in particular showed a good compatibility of the adhesive. The cell picture was homogenous, significant changes were not observed. The in vitro adhesion is sufficient as well. Group B, however, showed a swelling of the cornea. The subepithelial stroma and the Bowman's layer were affected in particular. However, the adhesion was considerably better, so the system deserves a clinical relevance as well. Unfortunately, the adhesion became thicker, so the patient might have a foreign body feeling. The outstanding feature of Excite is, however, that it can be used at different humidity levels of the dentin. Excite is less sensitive to humidity. Due to the high water content in the cornea, this is of utmost importance for the realised tests. Furthermore, the handling is easier due to better application systems, and due to the transparency of the material even the inside of the eye can be controlled. A waterproof suture at the edge and an apposition to the conjunctiva might also be proved clinically. A cornea reepithelisation would also be decisive for the success of the system. The presented results have shown that the adhesion between the artificial epithelium and the cornea by means of a dental adhesive might be an alternative to the Histoacryl adhesive. As the summary, however, does only describe morphologic observations, the limits of the systems have to be tested in clinical studies. The mechanic of eye-lids and tear fluid should be considered in particular. Proteolytic enzymes might interfere with the system as well. Clinical experiences will have to show if the complications occurring during the adhesion with the tissue glue Histoacryl can be prevented with Excite...|$|R

The techniques of contact microradiography and microtomography, using the x-ray spectrum filtered out of synchrotron radiation (SR) and conventional staining techniques, are compared {{to each other}} by presenting {{a variety of different}} samples. The relationship between radiation exposure and spatial resolution micro-computed tomography (CT) images of a finger bone is explored. The relevant properties of SR are explained. RESULTS. In CT images, a spatial resolution of 100 [micro]m was obtained. New bone mineral induced by <b>mechanical</b> periosteal <b>irritation</b> in a rabbit tibia was quantified. In one case a microradiogram and a microtomogram of the same slice were taken for comparison. Histologic sections and miroradiograms taken from a specimen of a human femur for comparison are presented. CONCLUSIONS. Microradiography and staining techniques require rather sophisticated sample preparation; quantitative image analysis is more difficult as the resulting image must be digitized. The CT technique requires almost no sample preparation and allows for accurate bone mineral quantification. However, CT images with a resolution of several microns limit the sample size to a few mm. Micro-CT and microradiography can be performed with conventional x-ray sources, but the use of SR is of particular interest in high resolution imaging, because its white spectrum allows for optimum x-ray energy selection and its high intensity for short scan times...|$|R

In the present work, we present an endodontic regeneration method based on the use of a tridimensional (3 D) hyaluronan scaffold and human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) to produce a functional dental pulp-like tissue in vitro. An enriched population of DPSCs was seeded onto hyaluronan-based non-woven meshes in the presence of differentiation factors to induce the commitment of stem cells to neuronal, glial, endothelial and osteogenic phenotypes. In vitro experiments, among which were gene expression profiling and immunofluorescence (IF) staining, proved the commitment of DPSCs to the main components of dental pulp tissue. In particular, the hyaluronan-DPSCs construct showed a dental pulp-like morphology consisting of several specialized cells growing inside the hyaluronan fibers. Furthermore, these constructs were implanted into rat calvarial critical-size defects. Histological analyses an...|$|R

40|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} is {{the most}} common tracheal disease occurring by the miniature dog breeds. This disease is usually found with middle to older aged dogs, but can be found even with the younger dogs. It is likely a congenital disease, athwart can be caused by outer factors or chronical breathing illnesses (repeted infections,alergies,dusty environment [...] .) 	Dogs trachea is the connector between uper and lower airways (connect larynx with bronchi). The trachea is formed by cartilage rings, connected by ligaments. These rings aren't dorsally closed - in this area the cartilage is replaced by a muscle covered in respiratory mucos membrane. 	Tracheal collapse can affect cervical and sternal section of trachea, even the bronchi can be striken. 	The collapse of trachea is caused by tracheal cartilage collapse, witch leads to tapered tracheal gateway. It is histologically proven, that the affected cartilage tissue lacks some compounds, in concrete glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans and chondroitin sulfat, that makes the cartilage mellow. 	This disease displays itself by a variety of clinical symptoms - the first stage brings excitation of airways and coughing when dog is physically active or shows signs of excitement (positive or negative), also can be caused by <b>mechanical</b> tracheal <b>irritation</b> (collar), nurture and fluid intake. Gradual disease worsening causes inspiratory troubles that leads to asphyxiation. There are four known grades of tracheal collapse phased in according to cartilage rings collapse range.

Treatment is addicted to few spects : tracheal disorder ratio, age of the dog, but also owners economical situation. The treatment is strictly individual.

The aim {{of the study was}} to study the activity of alkaline phosphatase, amylase, transaminases (ALT and AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the samples of human colostrum and mature milk obtained by manual squeezing. The study involved 35 women, 18 - 39 years of age, who had given birth at the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics, Faculty of Medicine in Niš, with normal delivery, without any complications reported. The samples of colostrum and milk were collected by mechanical squeezing of milk during three intervals: the first sample of colostrum was obtained immediately after the appearance of the first drops of milk after childbirth; the second sample was obtained after 24 hours, and the third after one month. The samples were collected in the morning, and kept in sterile test tubes in the freezer until the performance of analysis. The activity of these enzymes was reduced (statistically significant for amylase) in the period after one month, which means that it corresponded to the amount of protein. The activity of transaminases (ALT and AST) and alkaline phosphatase activity showed a tendency to fall after a month, but statistically significant difference was obtained with AST. The dynamic of alkaline phosphatase activity showed statistically significant decrease after one month.

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{describe}} two cases of IAN infection-induced paresthesia and to discuss the most appropriate treatment solutions. Methods. For two patients, periapical lesions that induced IAN paresthesia were revealed. In the first case, the tooth was previously endodontically treated, whereas in the second case the lesion was due to pulp necrosis. Results. For the first patient, a progressive healing was observed only after the tooth extraction. In the second patient, the paresthesia had resolved after endodontic treatment. Conclusions. The endodontic-related paresthesia is a rare complication that can be the result of a combination of etiopathogenic mechanisms such as mechanical pressure on the nerve fibers due to the expanding infectious process and the production of microbial toxins. Paresthesia resulting from periapical lesions usually subsides through elimination of infection by root canal treatment. However, if there are no signs of enhancement, the immediate extraction of the tooth is the treatment of choice in order to prevent irreversible paresthesia because it was demonstrated that there is a correlation between the duration of <b>mechanical</b> or chemical <b>irritation</b> and the risk of permanent paresthesia...|$|R
