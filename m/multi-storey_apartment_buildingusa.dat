40|$|A {{need for}} methods to assess fire risks in timber frame {{buildings}} {{lead to the}} development of FRIMMAB, a Fire Risk Index Method for <b>Multi-storey</b> <b>Apartment</b> Buildings. The main objective of this report is to evaluate this method against a different risk analysis method, in this case a standard QRA (quantitative risk analysis) based on an event tree. Four different <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> buildings in the Nordic countries were analysed in this study. The QRA resulted in a certain ranking of the four buildings with respect to fire risk. The Fire Risk Index Method was then used to analyse the same buildings. Three slightly different approaches were used to arrive at a fire risk index for each building. The Index Method results gave exactly the same ranking as the quantitative risk analysis for all three approaches. The conclusion of the analysis is therefore that FRIM-MAB seems to work reasonably well for <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> buildings, but further studies are recommended to confirm this...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} renovating a {{residential}} district of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> houses is analysed. Multi-storey buildings make {{a large percentage}} of all housing facilities. Therefore, renovation is a significant problem for most countries. Germany has great experience in renovating <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> houses, and therefore could be usefully applied under Lithuanian conditions. To increase the efficiency of renovation, a complex approach to this process, including the modernization of the whole residential district, should be used. The present paper considers the strategies of modernizing Hellersdorf district in Berlin embracing the problem of sustainable renovation and building management, the differentiation of dwellings supply in order to maintain a mixed social structure, the development of the city centre as a functional core in the district of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> houses, improvement in life standards and quality, the integration of residential houses into the existing environment, the development of democratic planning and the selection of partners.   Article in Lithuanian </div...|$|R

An in-depth knowledge on this subject area is essential for the architects, as the <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartments</b> have become one of the universally accepted built forms in the urban living environment. In the Sri Lankan context also it has become an efficient mean of fulfilling the requirements of housing in the urban sector. This dissertation intends to find out the viability of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartments</b> within the social, functional and economic parameters prevailing in the city of Colombo. The study starts with a review out the previous housing strategies, their advantages and disadvantages. Then looking at existing examples. by literature reviews and from participatory observation assesses the suitability of multi-storey living for urban poor. One of the major findings of the study is the absence of knowledge and proper education among urban poor category to introduce this type of a new concept. It was found that the people who value our cultural features-and the society as a whole- are not prepared to accept this type of buildings that had been successful in foreign countries.

50|$|The 1969 Lambeth Council was {{controlled}} by the Conservative Party. The Conservatives, at that time, believed that the council should provide homes {{for all those who}} could not afford to buy a house. In inner London, in the 1950s and 1960s, estates with <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> blocks provided the dominant architectural model for council housing. The seminal study Family and Kinship in East London showed that such apartments did not prove as satisfactory a family home as a house with a garden. By the 1970s many councils were returning to building houses, rather than <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> blocks, and Lambeth Council was a leader in this trend.|$|R

5000|$|Its {{design was}} {{inspired}} by the social reformers who advocated, and showed the benefit of providing houses with gardens for those who can only afford to rent. It was a reaction to the failure of council estates of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> blocks to provide a good family homes. Ted Hollamby's innovative design showed how it was possible using low rise dwellings, to achieve the same residential density as estate of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> blocks; and how pedestrianizing the estate allowed much better use of the space between the dwellings, as this space could be used for gardens rather than car parks and access roads. The estate has been a proven success and has enabled a good quality of life for its residents, and {{led to the development of}} a mutually cooperative community. There are however, supposedly insurmountable structural defects on the estate, i.e., problems with the guttering - currently being dealt with through a Lambeth Council programme of [...] "weathertight repairs", and supported by a ten year warranty - and the land drains. These problems have led the Labour controlled Lambeth Council elected in 2010 to propose demolishing the estate, and replacing it with an estate of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> blocks. The majority of the new apartments will be for those can afford to buy. The site is a prime location, and two bedroom apartments could sell for over half a million pounds. This makes re-developing the estate profitable. In July 2015, the residents were granted permission to seek judicial review of the Lambeth Council's decision to demolish the estate and not consider the option of repair and refurbishment. In November 2015, the high court ruled that it was unlawful for Lambeth Council not to consider the option of repair and refurbishment. Lambeth Council [...] "resumed" [...] consultation for 5 weeks in early 2016, and used the results of the sparsely-attended workshops and exhibitions to justify arriving for a second time at a decision to demolish. In August 2016 residents were granted permission to seek judicial review of the second demolition decision. There is also a controversy concerning listed status. An application for listed status was made and rejected. It is suggested by those interested in urban design that Historic England failed to appreciate the importance of Cressingham Gardens as an architectural model for high residential density inner city housing.|$|R
