2500|$|As an AAS, {{methyltestosterone}} is an agonist of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

As such, methyltestosterone has a relatively low ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, with a similar ratio to that of testosterone (close to 1:1), and this makes it among the most androgenic AAS.

40|$|Abstract] Methandienone, methandriol, and oxymetholone, {{which are}} {{anabolic}} steroids possessing 1 7 a-methyl and 171 S-hydroxy groups, were developed as oral formulations for therapeutic purposes. However, {{they have been}} used in racehorses to enhance racing performance. In humans, {{it has been reported that}} structurally related anabolic steroids having the 17 a-methyl and 171 ~hydroxy groups, including 17 a-methyltestosterone, <b>mestanolone,</b> methandienone, methandriol, and oxymetholone, have metabolites in common. In this study, we found that metabolites common to those of 17 a-methyltestosterone and <b>mestanolone</b> were detected in horse urine after the administration of oxymetholone, methandienone, and methandriol. Based on analytical data, we confirmed these to be the common metabolites of five structurally related steroids, 17 o. -methyltestosterone, <b>mestanolone,</b> oxymetholone, methandienone, and methandriol. Furthermore, wedetected hitherto unknown urinary metabolites of methandriol and oxymetholone in horses. The parent steroid itself was detected in horse urine after the administration of methandriol, other than metabolites common to 17 a-methyltestosterone and <b>mestanolone.</b> O the other hand, the major metabolite of oxymetholone was <b>mestanolone,</b> aside from metabolites presumed to be the stereoisomers of 2 -hydroxymethyl- 17 o. -methyl- 5 o. -androstan- 3, 17 l]-diol and 2, 1 7 a-di(hydroxymethyl) - 5 a-androstan- 3, 1 71 ~-diol. The simultaneous detection f common metabolites and other main metabolites would help us narrow down the candidate-administered steroid for the doping tests in racehorses...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{potential}} for misuse {{of a wide range}} of anabolic steroids in horse racing, a screening test to detect multiple compounds, via a common class of metabolites, would be a valuable forensic tool. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to detect 17 a-alkyl anabolic steroid metabolites in equine urine. 16 ߭Hydroxymestanolone (16 ߬ 17 ߭dihydroxy- 17 a-methyl- 5 a-androstan- 3 -one) was synthesised in six steps from commercially available epiandrosterone (3 ߭hydroxy- 5 a-androstan- 17 -one). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in sheep, employing <b>mestanolone</b> (17 ߭hydroxy- 17 a-methyl- 5 a-androstan- 3 -one) or 16 ߭hydroxymestanolone conjugated to human serum albumin, via a 3 -carboxymethyloxime linker, as antigens. Antibody cross-reactivities were determined by assessing the ability of a library of 54 representative steroids to competitively bind the antibodies. Antibodies raised against 16 ߭hydroxymestanolone showed excellent cross-reactivities for all of the 16 ߬ 17 ߭dihydroxy- 17 a-methyl steroids analysed and an ELISA has been developed to detect these steroid metabolites. Using this 16 ߭hydroxymestanolone assay, urine samples from horses administered with stanozolol (17 a-methyl-pyrazolo[4 ', 3 ': 2, 3]- 5 a-androstan- 17 ߭ol), were analysed raw, following ߭glucuronidase hydrolysis, and following solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedures. The suppressed absorbances observed were consistent with detection of the metabolite 16 ߭hydroxystanozolol. Positive screening results were confirmed by comparison with standard LCMS analyses. Antibodies raised against <b>mestanolone</b> were also used to develop an ELISA and this was used to detect metabolites retaining the parent D-ring structure following methandriol (17 a-methylandrost- 5 -ene- 3 ߬ 17 ߭diol) administration. The ELISA methods developed have application as primary screening tools for detection of new and known anabolic steroid metabolites. No Full Tex...|$|E
