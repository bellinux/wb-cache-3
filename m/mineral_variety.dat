2500|$|Minerals are {{classified}} by variety, species, series and group, {{in order of}} increasing generality. The basic level of definition is that of mineral species, {{each of which is}} distinguished from the others by unique chemical and physical properties. For example, quartz is defined by its formula, SiO2, and a specific crystalline structure that distinguishes it from other minerals with the same chemical formula (termed polymorphs). When there exists a range of composition between two minerals species, a mineral series is defined. For example, the biotite series is represented by variable amounts of the endmembers phlogopite, siderophyllite, annite, and eastonite. In contrast, a mineral group is a grouping of mineral species with some common chemical properties that share a crystal structure. The pyroxene group has a common [...] formula of XY(Si,Al)2O6, where X and Y are both cations, with X typically bigger than Y; the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates that crystallize in either the orthorhombic or monoclinic crystal systems. Finally, a <b>mineral</b> <b>variety</b> is a specific type of mineral species that differs by some physical characteristic, such as colour or crystal habit. An example is amethyst, which is a purple variety of quartz.|$|E

40|$|The Pilot Farm Ježevo was {{established}} {{in accordance with the}} Project UNDP for Yugoslavia, with the aim of its future growing into an experimental station for heavy hydromorphic soils, which would have wider, international significance (ILACO, 1972). Pedological investigations under the above title were carried out within the theme „Investigations of complex agrotechnical practices on heavy soils in the Upper Save Valley - the Ježevo locality“. Their purpose was to determine: a) the basic parameters and changes in the consistence, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil, b) potential and actual changes in volume, total porosity and air content in the soil, and c) their significance for the agriotechnical practice and, generally, for the exploitation of hydroarneliorated soils of the Farm. The investigations were carried out on the production plots 8, 19 and 17 with pipe drainage of various intensity (spaces 15, 20 and 25 m, depths 1. 1 and 1. 25 m). According to the marked oder of production plots, they are former: noncalcareous, vertic, humous, amphigley soils, <b>mineral</b> <b>variety</b> of amphigley soils, also noncalcareous and vertic, and - browned meadow soils. Standard methods (JDPZ, 1971) were used in the field and laboratory experiments, as well as more recent experiences of foreign authors (See Literature), The results are presented in Tables 1 - 5 and Graph 1. The lay-out of the Farm is shown in Figure 1. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Heavy vertic soils of the Pilot Farm Ježevo have very unfavourable mechanical properties. In addition to other characteristics of plasticity, this is also confirmed by the unfavourable relation between the lower plasticity limit and the field water capacity (0. 8 - 0. 9). Further more, by the low values of the consistence index (lower than 0. 25 and 0. 25 - 0. 50) with the corresponding liquid state or very soft plasticity in the course of spring (Table 2). 2. In the described conditions to soil consistence, mechanical tillage is practically unfeasible. This is also the main reason for the delayed seedbed preparation and sowing of maize in spring on most arable areas of ahe Farm. 3. Other physical properties of these soils are also unfavourable due to greater changes in the volume, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil. They are characterised by high values of the coefficient of linear extensibility (0. 12 - 0. 22) and swelling (N...|$|E
40|$|Comets formed about 4. 6 {{billion years}} ago from the Pre-Solar Nebula {{and spent most of}} their {{existence}} in the outer and colder regions of the Solar System, beyond the Neptune’s orbit. These small celestial bodies, with masses ranging between 1014 g and 1021 g, could be considered the cosmo-chemical record of the primordial Solar Nebula. Therefore studying comets means investigating the physic-chemical properties of the material that formed the Solar System. With the aim of exploring the nature and the composition of these fascinating objects, several cometary space missions have been realized since the 1980 ’s. The first comet to be observed by a space probe, the NASA/ISEE 3 spacecraft, was comet 21 P/Giacobini-Zimmer in 1985. One year after comet 1 P/Halley was deeply studied by five different space probes: Vega 1 and Vega 2 (Soviet Union), Sakigake and Suisei (Japan), and GIOTTO (ESA). More recently two NASA missions, Deep Space 1 and Stardust, observed comet 19 P/Borrelly and 81 P/Wild 2, respectively, showing a considerable and unexpected mineral diversity in these objects. Despite the improvements provided by all these space missions, our knowledge about cometary nuclei, comae and activity remains rather primitive in many aspects. An incredible opportunity to make a critical step forward in cometary science and more in general in the knowledge of the Solar System origin is represented by the ESA space mission, Rosetta (Chapter 1). Thanks to the encounter with 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67 P/CG), Rosetta will allow an extensive study of the <b>mineral</b> <b>variety</b> present in this Jupiter Family comet. Moreover this mission, for the first time, will undertake a comet long-term monitoring at close quarters along its orbit, allowing the study of the comet behaviour from the moment the cometary activity will start, when it will reach its maximum at perihelion and after it when it will slowly decrease. Among the instruments mounted on-board Rosetta, there is the Grain Impact Analyser and Dust Accumulator (GIADA) developed with the aim of studying the cometary dust environment, the evolution of the dust flow and the dynamics of each single grain as a function of time and position, i. e. at variable distances of the spacecraft from the nucleus and of the comet from the Sun. GIADA is designed as a single instrument composed of three different detection sub-systems: 1 -	Grain Detection System (GDS) : detects each incoming grain, providing its optical equivalent size and measuring its speed, without affecting its dynamical properties. 2 -	Impact Sensor (IS) : measures the momentum released from each grain impacting its sensitive surface. 3 -	Micro-Balances System (MBS) : a network of five Quartz Crystal Microbalances, pointing toward different directions, that measure the cumulative dust deposition in time and monitor the dust flux ejected from the comet. Thanks to its features, described in Chapter 2, GIADA will contribute to the achievement of two of the five Main Goals assigned to the Rosetta space mission: -	Define the physical properties and interrelation of volatiles and refractories in a cometary nucleus; -	Study the development of cometary activity and processes in the surface layer of the nucleus and in the inner coma (dust-gas interaction). Rosetta was launched on the 2 nd March 2004 and will reach, at a distance of 4 AU from the Sun, the comet 67 P/CG on May 2014, after a long trek lasted 10 years around the Sun. In order to limit power and fuel consumption, and to minimise operating costs, Rosetta was put in hibernation on the 8 th of January 2011. The seven years after launch and prior to hibernation are called Cruise Phase. During the Cruise Phase 13 Payload Checkouts (PCs) have been executed in order to verify the instruments functionalities and to perform the maintenance. GIADA detection sub-systems were switched on to monitor their health state and verify their performances. The results of the analysis of the data collected by GIADA during these tests, reported in Chapter 3, show that GIADA functionalities and performances have maintained their nominal behaviour; only the cover mechanism showed a non-nominal behaviour, which had a small impact on the microbalance sub-system: contamination deposited on the QCM because of the cover remained open caused a small decrease of their dynamical range. This will not affect the GIADA measurement capability during the Rosetta comet encounter and escort phase. Rosetta has awakened from hibernation on the 20 th January 2014 and now its payloads are undergoing the post-hibernation commissioning, a phase devoted to the instruments re-activation-maintenance and checkout activities in preparation to the rendez-vous with comet 67 P/CG. GIADA has successfully executed its first post-hibernation commissioning on the 27 th March 2014. In preparation to comet encounter, the GIADA Team planned an extended calibration activity (Chapter 4) devoted to create a database of the sub-systems response to different kind of cometary dust analogue grains (composition, mineralogy, ice and carbon coatings) that will be used to support the analysis of the data that GIADA will collect during the comet phase. This activity was planned taking into account the new knowledge on cometary dust composition reached after the NASA/Stardust space mission. In order to well characterize the instrument responsivity with respect to realistic cometary analogue materials, some dust samples were prepared, taking into account the GIADA sub-systems sensitivities (GDS and IS), in four distinct size classes: 20 μm<Ø< 50 μm, 50 μm<Ø< 100 μm, 100 μm<Ø< 250 μm and 250 μm<Ø< 500 μm. Single grains of these selected materials were shot into the GIADA Proto Flight Model, i. e. the spare of the instrument on board Rosetta operating in a clean room in our laboratory, with velocities in the range 1 - 100 ms- 1. In order to capture, manipulate and shoot these small grains, an innovative Electrostatic Micromanipulator has been developed. The use of this tool resulted to be very useful during the calibration activities. In addition, two new empirical methods were developed with the aim to improve the capability of reconstructing the IS impact position and the GDS crossing position of each single grain entering into GIADA. These are key issues to scale the signal detected by the two sub-systems using the sensitivity maps measured during the pre-launch calibrations. The method developed for the GDS measurements was used during the present calibration activity with cometary dust analogues that led to the assembly of the calibration curves for each different material. The results obtained after the work performed during the three years of PhD represent a significant step forward within the GIADA project that will surely critically contribute to make GIADA performances, data acquisition and reduction a success...|$|E
