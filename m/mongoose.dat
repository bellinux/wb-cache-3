5|$|Kubera {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a dwarf, with complexion of lotus leaves and a big belly. He is described as having three legs, only eight teeth, one eye, and being adorned with jewels. He is sometimes depicted riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry a sheaf of jewels or a <b>mongoose</b> with him. In Tibet, the <b>mongoose</b> is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over Nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a <b>mongoose</b> in Buddhist iconography.|$|E
5|$|Salanoia durrelli has a {{more robust}} {{dentition}} than the brown-tailed mongoose; the teeth have larger surface areas. The first and second upper incisors are smaller than the third, which is separated by a pronounced diastema (gap) from the canine tooth. The canine is more robust than in the brown-tailed <b>mongoose.</b> The first upper premolar is small, but {{the second and third}} are larger; these two teeth are shorter and broader than in the brown-tailed <b>mongoose.</b> The fourth premolar is large, as is the first molar. The second upper molar is less than one-third the size of the first, and is more highly reduced than that of the brown-tailed <b>mongoose,</b> which is about two-thirds the size of the first molar. The first lower incisor is smaller than the other two. The lower canine, premolars, and first molar are well-developed. The second molar is broad, but smaller than in the brown-tailed <b>mongoose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Salanoia durrelli {{has been}} {{recorded}} at Andreba, a marshy area at 750m (2460ft) above sea level on the eastern coast of Lac Alaotra. The nearest occurrence of the brown-tailed <b>mongoose</b> is about 55km (35mi) from Alaotra. The first observed specimen was swimming; it may have fled from human activity on the shore. The two others were caught on mats of floating vegetation. Thus, S.durrelli occurs in a marsh habitat—quite different from the forest-dwelling brown-tailed <b>mongoose.</b> S.durrelli may use its robust dentition to feed on prey with hard parts, such as crustaceans and molluscs, in addition to small vertebrates, rather than the insects that the more gracile-toothed brown-tailed <b>mongoose</b> eats. Indeed, the two specimens of S.durrelli were captured using traps baited with fish and meat. S.durrelli is similar in many respects to the larger mainland African marsh <b>mongoose</b> (Atilax paludinosa), a carnivorous wetland-dweller that also uses mats of vegetation to eat and sleep on.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mongooses</b> are {{a common}} {{spectacle}} at roadside shows in Pakistan. Snake charmers keep <b>mongooses</b> for mock fights with snakes.|$|R
50|$|The second {{incident}} involves <b>mongooses.</b> Small Asian <b>mongooses</b> {{were introduced}} onto {{the island in}} the early 20th century {{in order to reduce}} the venomous snake population (the island was apparently completely overrun). Whilst the <b>mongooses</b> completed this task, they also disposed of pretty much all the birdlife of the island. To this day, the island is notably short of hedgerow birds such as sparrows. <b>Mongooses</b> are a hazard for domestic poultry, and are also known to cause damage in vineyards and orchards.|$|R
5|$|The Amami rabbit {{also faces}} huge threats from the {{invasive}} predators, being {{a major cause}} for the decline in population size. On the island of Amami, the small Indian <b>mongoose</b> (Herpestes javanicus) was released to control the population of a local venomous snake, and its numbers have increased dramatically. This <b>mongoose,</b> along with feral cats and dogs, are outpreying the Amami rabbit.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{generally}} {{resembles that}} of the brown-tailed <b>mongoose,</b> but the rostrum (front part) is broad and deep, the nasal bones are broad and short, and {{the region of the}} palate is broad. The mandible (lower jaw) is robust and shows a high, steeply rising coronoid process (a projection {{at the back of the}} bone). Statistical analysis of measurements of the skulls and teeth strongly separates S.durrelli from specimens of the brown-tailed <b>mongoose.</b>|$|E

40|$|On Pacific islands {{non-native}} {{rats and}} <b>mongooses</b> threaten many native species. In Fiji we compared visitation rates of rats and <b>mongooses</b> at bait stations and measured biomass of leaf-litter invertebrates {{to assess the}} relative predation pressure from these species in forest areas at different distances from the forest edge. Forest areas over 5 km from the forest edge had significantly fewer baits encountered by rats or <b>mongooses</b> than did natural forest areas nearer agricultural and urban habitats. Remote forest areas may function as a last refuge for island species threatened by predation from non-native rats and <b>mongooses.</b> The biomass of leaf-litter invertebrates in remote forest areas was higher, indicating a refuge effect for some taxa targeted by rats and <b>mongooses.</b> Protection {{of the few remaining}} large blocks of natural forests on Pacific islands may be the most cost-effective approach for conserving many island endemics threatened by rats and <b>mongooses.</b> Logging roads can compromise this refuge effect by acting as dispersal routes for rats into natural forests...|$|R

5|$|Diurnal {{birds of}} prey such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) are their most {{significant}} predators. Other documented predators of giant mouse lemurs include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and the narrow-striped <b>mongoose</b> (Mungotictis decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|The small Asian <b>mongoose</b> (Herpestus javanicus) was {{introduced}} to Hawaii {{in order to control}} the rat population. However the <b>mongoose</b> was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.|$|E
5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} mammals {{have been}} introduced {{throughout the history of}} Puerto Rico. Indigenous settlers first introduced dogs and guinea pigs from South or Central America. Afterwards, Taínos introduced hutias as a food source from Hispaniola. When the Spanish colonized the island in the early 16th century, they introduced domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, goats, pigs, cattle, horses, and donkeys. Other species such as black rats (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and house mice (Mus sp.) have been unintentionally introduced as stowaways, possibly since Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1493. More recently, species {{have been introduced}} as a means of biological pest control. For example, the small Asian <b>mongoose</b> (Herpestes javanicus) was introduced in the 19th century to control the damage caused by rats in sugar cane plantations. The introduction was a failure: the <b>mongoose</b> failed to control the rat population and instead contributed to the decline of native fauna such as the yellow-shouldered blackbird and possibly the elfin-woods warbler.|$|E
50|$|The {{carnivore}} house displays all big {{cats and}} many rare small predators, such as ring-tailed <b>mongooses</b> and narrow-striped <b>mongooses</b> from Madagascar. In the basement, visitors {{are invited to}} a view {{into the world of}} nocturnal animals.|$|R
50|$|A mutualistic {{relationship}} has evolved between dwarf <b>mongooses</b> and hornbills, in which hornbills {{seek out the}} <b>mongooses</b> {{in order for the}} two species to forage together, and to warn each other of nearby raptors and other predators.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mongooses</b> {{can carry}} leptospirosis.|$|R
5|$|Predation in {{the wild}} appears to be very rare for ruffed lemurs, {{probably}} because living in the high canopy makes them challenging to catch. Evidence of predation by raptors, such as the Henst's goshawk (Accipiter henstii) suggests it occurs at a low rate. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) could present a potential risk if it found an individual lower in the forest canopy, but no confirmation has been presented to indicate that they prey upon ruffed lemurs. Instead, only re-introduced, captive-bred ruffed lemurs {{have been killed by}} fossa, likely due to their inexperience with predators. Nesting behavior poses the biggest risk of predation, making them susceptible to carnivorous mammals, such as the ring-tailed <b>mongoose</b> (Galidia elegans) and brown-tailed <b>mongoose</b> (Salanoia concolor).|$|E
5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during the mating season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. Mating {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous {{for both males and}} females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the <b>mongoose</b> lemur (E. mongoz), although the <b>mongoose</b> lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during the mating season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E
5|$|Successive World Cup tournaments have {{generated}} increasing media attention as One-Day International cricket {{has become more}} established. The 2003 World Cup in South Africa {{was the first to}} sport a mascot, Dazzler the zebra. An orange <b>mongoose</b> known as Mello was the mascot for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Stumpy, a blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011 World Cup.|$|E
50|$|The {{plantation}} owners, {{desperate to}} rid {{themselves of the}} rats, introduced Asian <b>mongooses</b> to kill the rats. However, they failed to realize that black rats (Rattus rattus) are mainly nocturnal, while the <b>mongooses</b> prefer to hunt during the day. The <b>mongooses</b> preyed heavily on the native ground-nesting birds, frogs, lizards and Antiguan racers. Within sixty years, the snake had vanished completely from Antigua {{and most of its}} offshore islands and many believed that it had become extinct.|$|R

40|$|Susceptibility {{to capture}} and {{possible}} space-use shifts resulting from capture stress were assessed in wild large grey <b>mongooses,</b> <b>Mongooses</b> were captured {{with or without a}} reward (baited or unbaited trap). For up to 50 days after capture, <b>mongooses</b> avoided the area delimited by a ring of loom in radius centred on the trap location when captured without a reward, but no significant space-use differences were observed after capture with baited traps. We found no significant differences between capture on the periphery or in {{the central part of the}} home range. Despite the small influence that capture produced on the pattern of space use by <b>mongooses</b> in our study, it should be considered when radio. tracking carnivores. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|The Carmel Mountain {{has three}} main wadis: Lotem, Amik and Si’ach.

5|$|A small, reddish-brown carnivore, Salanoia durrelli is {{characterized}} by broad feet with prominent pads, reddish- underparts, and broad, robust teeth, among other differences from the brown-tailed <b>mongoose.</b> In the only two weighed specimens, body mass was 600g and 675g (21 and 24oz). It is a marsh-dwelling animal that may feed on crustaceans and mollusks. The Lac Alaotra area is a threatened ecosystem, and S.durrelli may also be endangered by competition with introduced species.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype specimen, a female, {{the head}} and body length was 310mm (12.2in), the tail length was 210mm (8.3in), the {{hindfoot}} length was 66.8mm (2.63in), the ear length was 17.5mm (0.69in), and the body mass was 675g (24oz). In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, {{the head and}} body length was about 330mm (13in), the tail length was about 175mm (6.9in), and the body mass was 600g (21oz). Based on these limited data, S.durrelli may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed <b>mongoose.</b>|$|E
