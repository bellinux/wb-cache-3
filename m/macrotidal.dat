50|$|There {{appears to}} be some general {{requirements}} for formation. Barrier island systems develop most easily on wave-dominated coasts with a small to moderate tidal range. Coasts are classified into three groups based on tidal range: microtidal, 0-2 meter tidal range; mesotidal, 2-4 meter tidal range; and <b>macrotidal,</b> >4 meter tidal range. Barrier islands tend to form primarily along microtidal coasts, where {{they tend to be}} well developed and nearly continuous. They are less frequently formed in mesotidal coasts, where they are typically short with tidal inlets common. Barrier islands are very rare along <b>macrotidal</b> coasts. Along with a small tidal range and a wave-dominated coast, there must be a relatively low gradient shelf. Otherwise, sand accumulation into a sandbar would not occur and instead would be dispersed throughout the shore. An ample sediment supply is also a requirement for barrier island formation. The last major requirement for barrier island formation is a stable sea level. It is especially important for sea level to remain relatively unchanged during barrier island formation and growth. If sea level changes are too drastic, time will be insufficient for wave action to accumulate sand into a dune, which will eventually become a barrier island through aggradation. The formation of barrier islands requires a constant sea level so that waves can concentrate the sand into one location.|$|E

40|$|Tidal {{range is}} a master factor {{governing}} the differences in physico-chemical and biological characteristics between microtidal (2 m) estuaries, which, for convenience, thus include mesotidal estuaries (2 – 4 m). Microtidal estuaries differ from <b>macrotidal</b> estuaries in geomorphology, tidal water movements, salinity regimes, residence times, turbidity, sedimentology and intertidal area. Consequently, their phytoplankton, microphytobenthos and macrophytes communities differ in biomass and production, areal extent, distribution patterns and composition. Mesozooplankton comprise predominantly autochthonous species in microtidal estuaries and allochthonous species in <b>macrotidal</b> estuaries. Meiobenthos in microtidal estuaries have greater densities in subtidal than intertidal areas and species persist along the estuary. Macrobenthos is dominated by small deposit-feeding species in microtidal estuaries, whereas <b>macrotidal</b> estuaries contain some larger species and suspension feeders. Species richness and abundance of estuarine-resident fish species and the contributions of diving piscivorous birds and wading invertebrate-feeding birds are greater in microtidal estuaries. As paradigms regarding estuarine ecology have been based mainly on northern hemisphere <b>macrotidal</b> systems, this review has redressed this imbalance by detailing the extent of differences between microtidal and <b>macrotidal</b> estuaries.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a methodological approach to calculate runup {{from the analysis}} of morphodynamic conditions in a <b>macrotidal</b> environment. The method is based on measurements of the elevation of high-tide deposits and on the analysis of morphological and hydrodynamic changes.

This allowed to assess runup formula effectiveness in a <b>macrotidal</b> environment and to determine the best slope parameters to estimate runup. The results suggest that in <b>macrotidal</b> environments the slope of the active section of the upper beach should be used instead of the entire slope of the foreshore, the latter resulting in an underestimation of runup elevations when used in predictive equations from the literature. Results obtained with widely used equations are relatively well correlated with observed values (r² = 0. 59).

40|$|Lately, across-shore zonation {{has been}} found to be more {{important}} in structuring the nematode community of a tropical <b>macrotidal</b> sandy beach than microhabitat heterogeneity. To evaluate whether this zonation pattern applies to a temperate beach, a <b>macrotidal</b> ridge-and-runnels sandy beach in the North Sea was studied. We investigated whether a similar zonation occurs in sandbar and runnel microhabitats, and whether the runnels harbour a different community from the subtidal. Our results indicate that nematode communities from runnel and sandbar habitats are significantly different. In addition, horizontal zonation patterns for nematode communities differ between both habitats. Nematode assemblages from sandbars are divided to lower, middle and upper beach while upper and middle runnels cluster together. The subtidal and upper runnels showed dissimilar nematode assemblages, although runnels showed the same dominant species (Daptonema normandicum), which increases its abundance towards the upper runnels. This study illustrates the importance of microhabitat heterogeneity, which resulted in different zonation patterns across the sandy beach examined. The divergent zonation between sandbars and runnels in the <b>macrotidal</b> temperate sandy beach, compared with the pattern observed for a subtropical sandy beach with similar morphodynamics, indicates that generalizations about nematode distribution patterns should be made with caution...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of estuarine morphology {{is a process}} of dynamic equilibrium in the short-term (decades to centuries), while estuaries may be regarded as ephemeral in the long-term (millennia). Short-term processes of erosion and deposition are controlled by the estuarine hypsometry, tidal asymmetry, sediment supply and river flow. The Dee estuary, UK, is a <b>macrotidal</b> funnel-shaped estuary, known to have undergone significant infilling over the past two centuries. In <b>macrotidal</b> estuaries (such as the Dee), tidal asymmetry may be the main factor affecting morphological change (Dronkers, 1986; Wang et al., 2002). Tidal asymmetry is a result of higher order harmonic overtides (particularly the M 4 constituent) which are generated by the effects of friction, convergence and continuity (Speer and Aubrey, 1985). While the estuary as a whole may be ebb- or flood-dominated, different processes dominate in the tidal banks and channels.

Lateral transects were also conducted at the borders of each of three hydrologically distinct sections. The pCO₂ displayed considerable spatial-temporal variability. Likewise, net air-water CO₂ fluxes showed high spatial and temporal variability, with a maximum [release] of 271 mmol C m⁻² d⁻¹ during high river flow conditions in fall and minimum [uptake] of − 38 mmol C m⁻² d⁻¹ during wind-driven, high primary productivity conditions in late spring. During high-flow conditions, pCO₂ generally decreased from the river mouth to the Pamlico Sound, similar to patterns seen in well-mixed systems. During warm, low-flow conditions, surface water pCO₂ distributions were spatially variable and dissimilar to those patterns seen in most <b>macrotidal,</b> well-mixed estuaries. The annual air-water CO₂ efflux from the study area was 4. 7 mol C m⁻² yr⁻¹, an order of magnitude less than previously estimated for temperate estuaries.

40|$|National {{efforts to}} reduce energy {{dependency}} on fossil fuels have prompted examination of <b>macrotidal</b> nearshore sites around the United Kingdom (UK) for potential tidal stream resource development. A number of prospective tidal energy sites have been identified, but the local hydrodynamics of these sites are often poorly understood. Tidal energy developers rely on detailed characterisation of tidal energy sites prior to device installation and field trials. Although first-order appraisals may make <b>macrotidal</b> tidal straits appear attractive for development, detailed, site-specific hydrodynamic and bathymetric surveys are important for determining site suitability for tidal stream turbine (TST) installation. Understanding {{the ways in which}} coastal features affect tidal velocities at potential TST development sites will improve identification and analysis of physical constraints on tidal energy development. This paper presents and examines tidal velocity data measured in Ramsey Sound (Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK), an energetic <b>macrotidal</b> strait, which will soon host Wales' first TST demonstration project. While maximum tidal velocities in the strait during peak spring flood exceed 3 m s− 1, the northern portion of Ramsey Sound exhibits a marked flood-dominated tidal asymmetry. Furthermore, local bathymetric features affect flow fields that are spatially heterogeneous in three dimensions, patterns that depth-averaged velocity data (measured and modelled) tend to mask. Depth-averaging can therefore {{have a significant effect on}} power estimations. Analysis of physical and hydrodynamic characteristics in Ramsey Sound, including tidal velocities across the swept area of the pilot TST, variations in the stream flow with depth, estimated power output, water depth and bed slope, suggests that the spatial and temporal variability in the flow field may render much of Ramsey Sound unsuitable for tidal power extraction. Although the resource potential depends on velocity and bathymetric conditions that are fundamentally local, many prospective tidal energy sites are subject to similar physical and hydrodynamic constraints. Results of this study can help inform site selection in these complicated, highly dynamic <b>macrotidal</b> environments. In order to fully characterise the structure of the tidal currents, these data should be supplemented with 3 -D modelling, particularly in areas subject to a highly irregular bathymetry and complicated tidal regime...|$|E

Both were experimentally fertilized for six years with varying levels of N and P. For unfertilized, N and NPK treatments, average yearly CO 2 emissions (which represent only respiration) at the microtidal marsh (13, 19, and 28 mmoles CO 2 m(- 2) hr(- 1), respectively) were higher than at the <b>macrotidal</b> marsh (12, 15, and 19 mmoles m(- 2) hr(- 1), respectively, with a flux under the additional high N/low P treatment of 21 mmoles m(- 2) hr(- 1)).

At the <b>macrotidal</b> marsh average yearly fluxes were 1. 29, 1. 26, and 0. 77 μmol CH 4 m(- 2) hr(- 1) with control, N, and NPK treatments, respectively and 1. 21 μmol m(- 2) hr(- 1) under high N/low P treatment. At the microtidal marsh CH 4 fluxes were 0. 23, 0. 16, and - 0. 24 μmol CH 4 m(- 2) hr(- 1) in control, N, and NPK and treatments, respectively. Fertilization changed soils from sinks to sources of N 2 O.

40|$|In {{a context}} of global climate change, local sea level rise could affect the {{different}} coastal processes as erosion, transport and deposition which are responsible in maintaining the coastline. The study of sediment transport processes {{is one of the}} key for a better understanding of the coastal evolution which is needed for effective design of coastal engineering or to protect anthropogenic activities and population from marine submersion. One of the main processes that control coastal evolution is sediment transport. A number of studies have been focused on this topic, but they were mostly restricted to micro- to mesotidal beaches [1 - 3] and field investigations on sandy <b>macrotidal</b> beaches appear to be more limited, notably because these environments are less common along the worldwide coastline [4]. Only a few studies have been conducted for quantifying sediment flux on <b>macrotidal</b> beaches [5, 6] where sediment transport results from the complex interactions of tidal currents with longshore currents generated by obliquely incident breaking waves, this complexity being further increased by the large variations in water level that induce significant horizontal translations of the surf zone. Although a number of studies were recently conducted on the morphodynamics of the barred <b>macrotidal</b> beaches of Northern France [7 - 12], relatively little effort has been dedicated to measuring longshore sediment transport on these beaches, even though it is largely recognized that they are affected by significant longshore transport that plays a major role in the morphodynamics of the intertidal zone [10, 13].

The {{duration of}} tide ﬂooding directly controls the duration of sediment reworking by waves, and thus the ridge dynamics. Flume modelling was used to investigate the impact of low-frequency tidal cycles on beach ridge evolution and internal architecture. The experiment was performed using natural bioclastic sediment, constant wave parameters and low-frequency variations of the mean water level. The morphological response of the beach ridge to water level ﬂuctuations and the preservation of sedimentary structures were monitored by using side-view and plan-view photographs. Results were compared with the internal architecture of modern bioclastic beach ridges in a <b>macrotidal</b> chenier plain (Mont St. Michel Bay, France) surveyed with ground-penetrating radar. The experimentally obtained morphologies and internal structures matched those observed in the ﬁeld, and the three ridge development stages identiﬁed in ground-penetrating radar proﬁles (early transgressive, late transgressive and progradational) were modelled successfully. Flume experiments indicate that ﬂat bioclastic shapes {{play a key role}} in sediment sorting in the breaker zone, and in sediment layering in the beach and washover fans. Water level controls washover geometry, beach ridge evolution and internal structure. Low water levels allow beach ridge stabilization and sediment accumulation lower on tidal ﬂats. During subsequent water level rise, accumulated sediment becomes available for deposition of new washover units and for bayward extension of the beach ridges. In the ﬁeld, low-frequency water level ﬂuctuations are related to the 4 4 year and 18 6 year tidal cycles.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>macrotidal</b> Seine estuary (France) {{is one of}} {{the most}} man-altered and mercury-contaminated European estuaries. Molecular {{quantification}} by competitive PCR has shown that the highest quantities of Gram-negative merA genes in intertidal freshwater mudflat sediments are located in recent sediment deposits independently of mercury concentrations, suggesting that particle-attached allochtonous mercury-resistant merA bacteria are deposited on mudflat surfaces. To investigate this hypothesis, a microcosm experiment was carried out to evaluate the respective contributions of (i) the input of allochtonous merA bacteria supplied by WWTP-treated effluents and (ii) merA gene abundance corresponding to a response of the sediment's autochthonous bacterial community to mercury contamination. Gram-negative merA gene quantification and T-RFLP analysis of both 16 S rDNA and merA genes demonstrated that deposited allochtonous bacteria did not develop in estuarine sediments, whereas mercury contamination (10 μg g− 1 wet sediment) selected an autochthonous mercury-resistant merA bacterial community. Thus, in mudflats of highly anthropized <b>macrotidal</b> estuaries, i. e. those subjected to intense hydrosedimentary processes and continuously contaminated by mercury and fecal bacteria, inputs of allochtonous merA bacteria are largely responsible for the high quantities of merA genes on the surface of mudflat sediments...|$|E

Large spatial variability occurs in the current and residual patterns, with flood-dominated maximum values occurring within the tidal channels. The tides control residual circulation by modulating stratification through tidal straining and bathymetric constraint on river flow. Tide–stratification–river interaction causes an unsteady pattern of residual circulation and tidal pulses. River-induced pulses are enhanced near low tide–inducing density-driven circulation.

The results of the model are compared with those obtained with classical flux estimation methods which neglect the nonlinearities of the fluid motion {{as well as the}} nonstationary behaviour of solute transport. It is shown that in <b>macrotidal</b> systems, which are generally characterized by fairly long residence times, both contributions are significant.

This result allows one to quantify the error associated with the widely used ‘apparent zero end–member’ (AZE) classical flux estimation methodology.

40|$|International audienceTidal {{asymmetry}} has {{a strong}} impact on estuarine hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. Extensive research has been dedicated to studying tidal dynamics in semi-diurnal <b>macrotidal</b> estuaries, leading to the expression of several generic behaviors. Maximum current velocities and durations of the ebb and flood are often used to characterize the asymmetry encountered in the estuary. The Charente estuary (French Atlantic coast) presents the particularity of being connected to a basin where the oceanic tide is already modified by the interactions with the continental shelf. The interaction between these externally generated overtides and the estuarine dynamics results in a spatially and fortnightly variable tidal asymmetry. The studied estuary is alternatively dominated by the ebb during neap tides and by the flood during spring tides, whereas most <b>macrotidal</b> estuaries subject to a semi-diurnal tidal regime are flood-dominant, without asymmetry inversions. A two-dimensional hydrodynamics model is used to investigate the connection between spring-neap inversions of the tidal asymmetry and the harmonic composition of the tide.

Sand trapping {{took place at}} several locations across the intertidal zone during rising and falling tides {{in order to obtain}} estimates of both longshore and onshore sediment flux from the lower to the upper beach. Results show that intertidal bars are responsible for significant wave energy dissipation leading to a decrease of sand transport towards the upper beach. Sediment transport appeared to be substantially higher on the bars than within the troughs due to wave breaking processes that are responsible for intense sand remobilization. The comparison of onshore sediment transport with longshore transport showed that onshore-directed transport is generally higher than the longshore sediment flux, suggesting that significant amounts of sand are directed shoreward across the bars, contributing to the onshore migration of intertidal bars. Sediment transport rates within the troughs proved to be significant only during runnel drainage when flow channelization was responsible for a local increase in sediment transport, this seaward-directed transport representing a sand recycling mechanism that contributes to the stability of the intertidal bars.

40|$|Preliminary {{analysis}} of data collected at a <b>macrotidal</b> semi-enclosed lagoon (Pagham Harbour, UK) has revealed useful information about long-term patterns of siltation {{and some of the}} related mechanisms. Sediment surface-level measurements made over 2 years at different sites within Pagham Harbour have shown a steady siltation, in common with earlier measurements, which is moderated by seasonal effects due to erosion by locally generated waves. Furthermore, inspection of vertical profiles of salinity and turbidity over individual tidal cycles has revealed that the degree of sediment transport on the flood tide is related to the vertical salinity gradient. Thus, at the Ferry Pool site, which is characterised by episodic pumped discharges from a nearby sewage treatment plant, landward sediment transport is enhanced by the high degree of salinity stratification observed during the flood tide. The mobility of the sediment, and the greater distribution of softer, less-well consolidated sediment deposits, is greater here than at the other significant freshwater inflow at the Salthouse site, where the fresh water flow is instead moderated by a tidal flap gate. Preliminary analyses suggest that the higher the salinity stratification, the greater the landward sediment transport during the flood tide.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the hypothesis that in a nutrient dominated catchment and estuary subject to extreme seasonal variation and large tidal inundations, physical processes play a substantial role in the nutrient status. This investigation also aimed to {{provide insight into the}} impact of high anthropogenic nutrient loads and the effect of runoff events, areas where limited research has been conducted in wet dry tropical, <b>macrotidal</b> systems. Buffalo Creek, Northern Territory, Australia, is a wet dry tropical, <b>macrotidal</b> system that has been subject to substantial anthropogenic nutrient inputs over a 36 year period. Levels of nutrients in the water column exceeded the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council and Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ANZECC/ARMCANZ) guidelines under all seasonal and tidal conditions but high levels of nutrients were not reflected in the sediment. Buffalo Creek is well mixed with stratification only occurring during periods of minimal flow (neap tides). The mixing plots revealed that different suites of nutrient processes occur under different conditions and that although biological transformations are the dominant mechanism for nitrogen on neap tides, physical processes {{play a key role in}} nutrient status during spring tides and wet seasons. The importance of physical processes was supported by high variations in turbidity and the large contribution of particulate nitrogen and phosphorus. The creek frequently experiences scouring by tide and/or flooding and the resuspension and transport of nutrients associated with particulate matter is a key factor in determining the status of nutrients in Buffalo Creek. Interactions between sediment, porewater and overlying water were studied to elucidate key processes occurring in wet dry tropical, <b>macrotidal</b> systems. The first 8 - 10 cm of the porewater profiles were characterised by low nutrient concentrations with the exception of nitrate, slightly acidic pH and oxic redox levels which are associated with resuspension by strong tidal currents, flood inundations during the wet season and bioturbation providing a pathway of diffusion for NH 4 +-N and PO 4 3 [...] P to overlying water. Another potential mechanism for the low nutrient concentrations is the uptake of nutrients by mangrove roots. Nitrification occurred at these depths as the sediment was aerated by mangrove roots, bioturbation and tidal currents supporting these two proposed mechanisms. Low phosphate levels are also attributed to adsorption to Fe and Al oxyhydroxides. Sequential extraction indicated that 80 % of phosphorus was Fe and Al bound phosphate-P and polyphosphates and a statistically significant relationship between total phosphorus and total iron was observed in sediment cores. These results clearly show that at these depths physical processes not only provide a direct mechanism for nutrient release to the overlying water but also influence biological processes by aerating the sediments. Below 8 - 10 cm, NH 4 +-N and PO 4 3 [...] P concentrations rapidly increased. The dominant process for nitrogen at depth was ammonification. Substantial increases in porewater phosphate corresponded to a decline in Eh, associated with the anaerobic conversion of Fe(III) to soluble Fe(II). Experiments were conducted focusing on the influence of salinity and intense mixing on nutrient release from sediments. The mechanisms of nutrient release experienced when the sediment was intensely resuspended in seawater, representative of spring tide inundations, was an initial porewater exchange with the overlying water followed by competition between phosphate and seawater anions for exchange sites, ammonification and nitrification. The major processes occurring in sediment resuspended in oxic freshwater, representative of wet season flooding, included phosphate and ammonium release from porewater, ammonification, nitrification, continued slow release of phosphate for neutral or alkaline sediments and adsorption to iron oxyhydroxides for acidic sediments. The results indicate that mixing and salinity are key factors in the status of nutrients in wet dry tropical, <b>macrotidal</b> systems. Lead- 210 dating was conducted to provide a chronology of the sediment profile, to determine if urbanisation impacted the system and if this dating method is applicable to wet dry tropical, <b>macrotidal</b> systems. Dated sediment cores indicated that the sewage treatment plant and urbanisation have impacted on the creek. The sediment of the creek and floodplain contained a record of this impact despite surface mixing caused by macrotides and wet season inundations and bioturbation to a lesser extent. The results show that it is difficult, but not impossible, to establish a definitive date for sediments subjected to physical and biological mixing. The success of dating in these areas is dependent on careful site selection. Cores should be selected from sites that accumulate sediment regularly and are sheltered from disturbances. These results suggest that although it may not always be possible to achieve yearly resolution because of mixing it may still be possible to show substantial impacts on a decadal scale. Nutrients and PbIR were successfully used as chemostratigraphic markers in this system, despite the potential mobility of nutrients in sediments. These profiles also provide important information about mixing which is a key factor in nutrient status in wet dry tropical, <b>macrotidal</b> systems. The results of this study clearly show that physical processes are of great importance, influencing nutrient status in wet dry tropical, <b>macrotidal</b> environments. The results of these studies have been used to produce a conceptual model for nutrient release in Buffalo Creek under different tidal and seasonal conditions...|$|E
30|$|The two exposed coastal sites {{included}} in this study are euhaline. The rivers Nerbioi and Bidasoa have the highest flows along the Basque coast (26 – 36  m 3  s− 1, annual mean), whereas the river Oiartzun has a much lower annual flow (4.8  m 3  s− 1). The Basque estuaries have semi-diurnal tides, with tidal amplitudes that can vary between 1  m in neap tides, to more than 4.5  m in spring tides (Valencia et al. 2004). As such, although they present some characteristics of <b>macrotidal</b> estuaries, they can be considered as generally mesotidal estuaries (Hayes 1975).|$|E

40|$|Monitoring of {{dune erosion}} and {{accretion}} on the high-energy <b>macrotidal</b> Vougot beach in North Brittany (France) {{over the past}} decade (2004 – 2014) has revealed significant morphological changes. Dune toe erosion/accretion records have been compared with extreme water level measurements, defined as the sum of (i) astronomic tide; (ii) storm surge; and (iii) vertical wave runup. Runup parameterization was conducted using swash limits, beach profiles, and hydrodynamic (Hm 0, Tm 0,– 1, and high tide water level—HTWL) data sets obtained from high frequency field surveys. The aim was to quantify in-situ environmental conditions and dimensional swash parameters for the best calibration of Battjes [1] runup formula. In addition, an empirical equation based on observed tidal water level and offshore wave height was produced to estimate extreme water levels over the whole period of dune morphological change monitoring. A good correlation between this empirical equation (1. 01 Hmoξo) and field runup measurements (Rmax) was obtained (R 2 85 %). The goodness of fit given by the RMSE was about 0. 29 m. A good relationship was noticed between dune erosion and high water levels when the water levels exceeded the dune foot elevation. In contrast, when extreme water levels were below the height of the toe of the dune sediment budget increased, inducing foredune recovery. These erosion and accretion phases {{may be related to the}} North Atlantic Oscillation Index. Keywords: <b>macrotidal</b> beach; runup; storm; dune...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe North Sea {{coast of}} France is a <b>macrotidal,</b> storm-wave coast {{globally}} {{characterized by an}} erosional trend, except for the area of Calais which exhibits a large (approximately 12 km²), actively accreting sand flat formed following the onshore migration, over the twentieth century, of a shoreface sand bank. The sand flat and contiguous beach exhibit large variability in sedimentation, ranging from pure sand to significant fractions of mud, depending on the morphology (multiple intertidal bars and troughs, upper beach platform and foredune). In order to highlight the variability in sedimentation, in situ wave and current measurements, and sedimentary (samples and short cores) and topographic surveys were carried out along a cross-shore profile during three field experiments involving variable wave and tidal conditions and spanning different seasons. The results show an onshore decrease in current speeds and in wave heights compatible with a fining trend, from sand in the lower sand flat, to sand and interbedded mud layers towards the upper flat. Analysis of the sediment textural and spatial patterns over a one-year period show {{an increase in the}} mud fraction in the lower sand flat and the onshore migration of these fine sediments onto the upper sand flat, resulting in significant muddy sedimentation in this latter zone. This pattern shows that an accretionary context on sand-rich, storm-wave dominated <b>macrotidal</b> coasts offers conditions for the significant trapping of mud, with implications for both contemporary management issues and the rock record...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. – Some of the {{striking}} {{results of the}} papers published in the special publication “French Incised valleys, estu-aries and lagoons ” of the Bulletin de la Société géologique de France are presented and compared. The selection of pa-pers within this volume focuses exclusively on the recent progress made on modern French incised valleys, estuaries and lagoons around the coasts of France. Those papers together with abundant papers recently published on modern French incised valleys provide new insights for the knowledge on these sedimentary systems. The large amount of new results obtained is indebted to an extensive exploration within a large variety of estuaries, lagoons and coastal areas, from <b>macrotidal</b> tide-dominated, to microtidal wave-dominated, with also meso- to <b>macrotidal</b> mixed tide- and wave-dominated estuaries. These data allow comparing incised valleys within the same setting of tectonically stable and sediment starved margins, but showing contrasted conditions of hydrodynamics, sediment supply and bedrock control. At a stratigraphic level, sea-level variation is the main parameter controlling incised valley formation and sediment fill. The first-order controlling factor explaining the observed variations in valley fills is hydrodynamics. Three valley-fill categories are highlighted: tide-dominated, mixed tide-and-wave and wave-dominated, that match the classification based on hydrodynamics and morphology of present-day estuaries or lagoons. The second-order controlling factor ex-plaining the observed variations in valley fills is the antecedent morphology of the bedrock, which in turn controls hy-drodynamics and sediment supply. Finally, a promising result is the demonstration of the potential of incised valley fill...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A novel {{numerical}} model (the Imperial College Ocean Model, ICOM) {{is used to}} simulate tidal circulation in shallow epicontinental seas connected to large, open oceans. ICOM is validated using the present-day North Sea and applied to predict tidal range in the late Pennsylvanian Midcontinent Seaway (LPMS) of North America. The model simulates {{the effect of the}} principal tidal constituents (astronomical tides) as well as the tide propagating from the adjacent open ocean (co-oscillating tide). Two ‘‘base-case’ ’ Pennsylvanian paleogeographies were tested: (1) a maximum sea-level highstand and (2) the early stages of a transgression. Sensitivity tests determined the importance of paleo-water depth and coastline uncertainty on the prediction of tidal range. During the highstand, tidal ranges in the craton interior (Midcontinent Shelf, Illinois and Appalachian basins) are consistently predicted as microtidal (, 2 m tidal range). Such low tidal ranges would have inhibited water-body mixing in the LPMS, promoting stratification. This, combined with the influx of oxygen-poor water from the Permian Basin to the west and high organic input from tropical rivers, {{may have contributed to the}} deposition of ‘‘core’ ’ black shales in LPMS cyclothems. Conversely, a mesotidal to <b>macrotidal</b> diurnal (once-daily tide) regime is predicted for the early transgression in a large-scale embayment in eastern Kansas due to resonant amplification of diurnal tidal constituents. Pennsylvanian strata here have been ascribed to a mesotidal to <b>macrotidal</b> setting and include cyclic rhythmites that suggest a strongly diurnal system, as predicted by ICOM...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an analytical model of salt marsh evolution that captures the dynamic response of marshes to perturbations in suspended sediment concentrations, plant productivity, {{and the rate of}} relative sea level rise (RSLR). Sediment‐rich and highly productive marshes will approach a new equilibrium state in response to a step change in the rate of RSLR faster than sediment‐poor or less productive marshes. Microtidal marshes will respond more quickly to a step change in the rate of RSLR than mesotidal or <b>macrotidal</b> marshes. Marshes are more resilient to a decrease rather than to an increase in the rate of RSLR, and they are more resilient to a decrease rather than to an increase in sediment availability. Moreover, <b>macrotidal</b> marshes are more resilient to changes in the rate of RSLR than their microtidal counterparts. Finally, we find that a marsh’s ability to record sea level fluctuations in its stratigraphy is fundamentally related to a timescale we call TFT, or filling timescale, which is equal to the tidal amplitude divided by the maximum possible accretion rate on the marsh (a function of plant productivity, sediment properties, and availability). Marshes with a short‐filling timescale (i. e., marshes with rapid sedimentation or small tidal amplitudes) are best suited to recording high‐frequency fluctuations in RSLR, but our model suggests it is unlikely that marshes will be able to record fluctuations occurring over timescales that are shorter than decadal...|$|E
40|$|The <b>macrotidal</b> intermediate-dissipative {{beaches of}} the {{southwest}} UK display strong seasonality whereby extensive low-tide bar/rip systems form during the spring season. These features reach a state of maximum development during the summer months, when strong rip currents are present at various stages of the tide that switch on/off due to tidal translation. This research investigates {{for the first time}} the circulation and dynamics of <b>macrotidal</b> rip systems from the perspective of the flow dynamics and surf zone circulation. A field experiment was conducted on a macro-tidal (range 6. 3 m) with low-tide bar/rip morphology to quantify the circulation and dynamics of the rip current systems. Measurements of flow velocity, water depth and suspended sediment concentration were collected over the channel and shoal of transverse bar/rip system using an in-situ sensor arry, whilst the surf zone circulation patterns were monitored with post-processed GPS drifter floats. The in-situ data show that currents within the rip system are strongly correlated with the stage of the tide and maximum current speeds are recorded during the 3 -hour period immediately around low water. During this period, wave breaking is maximised on the adjacent shoal resulting in a longshore gradient in wave dissipation. The GPS drifters indicate that an extensive rotational surf zone circulation pattern exists, whereby the offshore flow within the rip channel returns landwards over the intertidal bar from the outer edge of the surf zone...|$|E
