5|$|In 1996, Mugabe was {{appointed}} {{chair of the}} defence arm of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Without consulting parliament, in August 1998 he ordered Zimbabwean troops into the Congo to side with President Laurent Kabila in the Second Congo War. He initially committed 3000 troops to the operation, although this gradually rose to 11,000. He also persuaded Angola and Namibia to commit troops to the conflict. Involvement in the war cost Zimbabwe an approximate US $1 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> contributing to its economic problems. Opinion polls demonstrated that it was unpopular among Zimbabwe's population. However, several Zimbabwean businesses profited, having been given mining and timber concessions and preferential trade terms in minerals from Kabila's government.|$|E
5|$|To {{address this}} concern, a {{considerable}} amount of LIFE's effort was put into the development of simplified target designs and automated construction that would lower their cost. Working with General Atomics, the LIFE team developed a concept using on-site fuel factories that would mass-produce pellets {{at a rate of about}} a <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> It was expected that this would reduce their price to about 25 cents per target, although other references suggest the target price was closer to 50 cents, and LLNL's own estimates range from 20 to 30 cents.|$|E

In 1978 Lê Duẩn and Phạm Văn Đồng signed a 25-year Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Cooperation with the USSR. Under Soviet protection, Vietnam invaded Kampuchea. In reaction China invaded Vietnam. Vietnam leased several bases to the Soviet Union to protect its territory from China. It was rumored that one of China's demands for peace was the ending of Soviet assistance to Vietnam. In Asia Vietnam played a role similar to Cuba's in Latin America: it supported local revolutionary groups and was a headquarters for Soviet-style communism. Vietnam supported the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and received $3 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> in military aid.|$|E

Any major new works should aim to secure adequate supplies for the next thirty or fifty years; these could only be found in the mountains and lakes of northern Lancashire, Westmorland or Cumberland. Only Ullswater, Haweswater and Thirlmere were high enough to supply Manchester by gravity flow; the natural drainage of all three was to the north, but Thirlmere lay immediately below the pass of Dunmail Raise and the engineering to bring its waters south of the watershed would be significantly easier than for (for example) Ullswater. Thirlmere water had been analysed by Professor Roscoe who pronounced it superior even to that of Loch Katrine and thus one of the best waters known.|$|R

With the holiday season coming up, including Christmas for the large Christian community, and Eid ul-Adha on December 27 for the Muslim community, businesses fear losing even more income due to the political crisis. Tourism, {{one of the largest}} sectors of the economy, which had still not fully recovered from the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict, was also adversely impacted from the mounting tensions after the November 21, 2006 assassination of Cabinet Minister Pierre Gemayel.

Seventy-nine acres of Shoulthwaite Moss (north of Thirlmere) were reclaimed as winter pasture to compensate for the loss of acreage around Thirlmere. A third pipe was authorised in 1906,construction began in October 1908, and was completed in 1915: this increased the potential supply from Thirlmere to thirty <b>million</b> gallons <b>a</b> <b>day</b> against <b>an</b> average daily demand which had now reached forty-five million gallons: in the summer of 1911 it had again been necessary to suspend the water supply at night. [...] The lake was then raised to fifty feet above natural; a fourth and final pipeline was completed in 1927, its authorisation having been delayed by the First World War until 1921; as early as 1918 Manchester Corporation had identified the need for a further source of water, and identified Haweswater as that source. At the committee stage of Manchester's 1919 Bill to tap Haweswater, the average daily demand on Manchester's water supply in 1917 was said to have been 51.2 <b>million</b> gallons <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> with the reliable supply from Longendale being no more than 20 <b>million</b> gallons <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and Thirlmere being able to supply 30 <b>million</b> gallons <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> which would rise to 40 <b>million</b> gallons <b>a</b> <b>day</b> when the fourth pipe was laid.
