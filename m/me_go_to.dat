500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Yankovic {{undertook}} the 70-city [...] "Stupid Tour"; this was his biggest tour of the 1980s, and featured [...] "costume changes, carefully designed lighting, and several of Al's videos cleverly integrated into the stage show". Yankovic's on-stage wardrobe changed dramatically during the tour, and he specifically stipulated that every promoter [...] "had to supply one garish Hawaiian shirt" [...] for him to wear. Yankovic eventually acquired [...] "a couple closets full" [...] of them. Yankovic also started wearing exclusively Vans, and joked that [...] "whenever I need some they let <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> their warehouse and take home an armload." ...|$|E
500|$|For Thriller 25, The Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am remixed the {{demo version}} of [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)". The singer commented on Jackson and the project, [...] "You always just dream of meeting him, let alone working with him. I wouldn't have {{believed}} it. I {{grew up in}} the projects in East Los Angeles and Thriller was filmed about two blocks from my house, but my mother was really strict and she wouldn't let <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the factories—she didn't care who was filming a video there; but I'm on the 25th anniversary, 25 years later—that's pretty awesome." [...] Entitled [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) 2008", the remix was well received by Rolling Stone. The publication described the track, along with [...] "The Girl Is Mine 2008", as being one of the best songs on the album. They noted that will.i.am [...] "updates the songs' original sound to make them dancefloor-worthy twenty-five years after their release".|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{admitted}} {{after the}} match that {{the manner of}} his side's victory had stunned him and he stated: [...] "My problem is that I don't have words to express the things that I feel at this moment". Praise for Liverpool also came from outside England, including from Argentine legend Diego Maradona, who said, [...] "Even the Brazil team that won the 1970 World Cup could not have staged a comeback with Milan leading 3–0...The English club proved that miracles really do exist. I've now made Liverpool my English team. They showed that football {{is the most beautiful}} sport of all. You knew they could defend, but the team showed they could play too and wrote a page in the history books. The match will last forever. The Liverpool supporters didn't let <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep the night before. There were 10 of them to every three Milan supporters. They showed their unconditional support at half-time when they were losing 3–0 and still they didn't stop singing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ashby {{promoted}} Michael Chapman, {{his camera}} operator on The Landlord, [...] to director of photography. They {{worked together to}} create a specific look for the film that involved using natural light to create a realistic, documentary-style. Ashby let Nicholson look through the camera's viewfinder as a shot was being set up so he knew the parameters of a given scene and how much freedom he had within the frame. The actor said, [...] "Hal is the first director to let <b>me</b> <b>go,</b> <b>to</b> let me find my own level".|$|E
2500|$|A ten-year {{correspondence}} ensued, ended only by Sheehan's death. In {{a letter}} to the Jesuit Father Herman Heuser, Sheehan's American biographer, Holmes explained: [...] "I was at Doneraile and called every day after luncheon, that time being the best for him. He knew, and I feared, he was dying, though I did not admit it. He bade <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> his library and select a book. On his assurance, I took Francisco Suárez's De Legibus, which I had heard him praise, and it bears his inscription. I wish I could have offered him something besides affection and reverence for his lovely spirit".|$|E
2500|$|Although Knievel never {{attempted}} to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968, following the Caesars Palace crash. [...] During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, [...] "I don't {{care if they}} say, 'Look, kid, you're going to drive that thing {{off the edge of}} the Canyon and die,' I'm going to do it. I want to be the first. If they'd let <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it. I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there." [...] For the next several years, Knievel negotiated with the federal government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump, but the Interior Department denied him airspace over the northern Arizona canyon. Knievel switched his attention in 1971 to the Snake River Canyon in southern Idaho.|$|E
