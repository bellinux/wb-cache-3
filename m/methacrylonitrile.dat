50|$|Inhalation, {{and oral}} and dermal administration, of <b>methacrylonitrile</b> can cause acute deaths in animals, often preceded by convulsions {{and loss of}} consciousness. Signs of the toxic effects of <b>methacrylonitrile</b> in rats after oral {{absorption}} are ataxia, trembling, convulsions, mild diarrhea and irregular breathing. The main cause of toxic effects at lethal (and threshold) levels of MeAN is damage to the central nervous system. This, along with the signs of toxic effects displayed by all tested animals, is consistent with cyanide poisoning. <b>Methacrylonitrile</b> differs herein from acrylonitrile, which does not show cyanide related signs of toxicity.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{different}} metabolizing pathways for <b>methacrylonitrile,</b> that are elaborated here: ...|$|E
5000|$|Lastly, carcinogenic, {{mutagenic}} and genotoxic {{effects have}} been tested but unlike acrylonitrile, <b>methacrylonitrile</b> does not show signs of any such effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meth{{acrylonitrile}}</b> is an acrylonitrile (AN) with {{an additional}} CH3 group on the second carbon. Polymerization {{does not require a}} catalyst and happens rapidly {{in the absence of a}} stabilizer.|$|E
50|$|First of all, <b>methacrylonitrile</b> can be {{directly}} conjugated with GSH, {{which leads to the}} formation of S-(2-cyanopropyl) GSH, which can be metabolized to N-acetyl-S- (2-cyanopropyl) cysteine (NACPC), which can be excreted in the urine.|$|E
50|$|Human {{toxicity}} has {{not been}} well analyzed. Minimum threshold values for odor detections are reported to be at 7 ppm, {{with the majority of}} subjects detecting it at higher concentrations of 14 or 24 ppm. At concentrations of 24 ppm incidences of throat, eye and nose irritation occur. No deaths caused by <b>methacrylonitrile</b> poisoning have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Cyclopropyl cyanide, when {{heated to}} 660-760K and under {{pressure}} of 2-89torr, becomes cis and trans crotonitrile and allyl cyanide molecules, with some presence of <b>methacrylonitrile.</b> This is an isomerization reaction that is homogeneous with rate of first order. The reaction result {{is due to}} the biradical mechanism, involving the formation of carbon radicals as the three carbon ring opens up. The radicals then react to yield carbon carbon double bonds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methacrylonitrile</b> (or 2-Methylprop-2-enenitrile), MeAN in short, is a {{chemical}} compound {{that is an}} unsaturated aliphatic nitrile, widely used {{in the preparation of}} homopolymers, copolymers, elastomers, and plastics and as {{a chemical}} intermediate in the preparation of acids, amides, amines, esters, and other nitriles. MeAN is also used as a replacement for acrylonitrile in the manufacture of an acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene-like polymer. It is a clear and colorless (to slightly yellow) liquid, that has a bitter almond smell.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, <b>methacrylonitrile</b> can be metabolised in {{the liver}} by CYP2E1 (a Cytochrome-P450 enzyme). This is the most {{important}} enzyme for the oxidative metabolism, but also other cytochrome P-450 enzymes may be involved. The oxidative reaction by Cytochrome-P450 enzymes will lead to the formation of an epoxide intermediate, which shows reactivity. This epoxide intermediate is highly unstable and could lead to the formation of cyanide via different transformations. For example via epoxide hydratase (EH) or via interactions with a sulfhydryl compound, which leads to the formation of a cyanohydrin that could rearrange to an aldehyde and thereby can possibly result in cyanide release.The epoxide can also be conjugated with GSH.|$|E
50|$|A {{difference}} in {{resistance to the}} lethal effects of MeAN can be noted between species. For inhalation, a 4 hour exposure period gives a LC50 of 328-700 ppm for rats, 88 ppm for guinea pigs, 37 ppm for rabbits and 36 ppm for mice. In dogs acute lethality by inhalation is also noted, although no LC50 has been determined. Oral administration of MeAN has been tested on rats, mice and gerbils, showing a LD50 of 200 mg/kg for rats, 17 mg/kg for mice and 4 mg/kg for gerbils. Skin administration on rabbits causes death at a LC50 of 268 mg/kg. The NOAEL and LOAEL values for rats are determined at 50 mg/kg for NOAEL and 100 mg/kg for LOAEL. This is based on another sign of <b>methacrylonitrile</b> poisoning; urine retention, with 58% of rats showing bladder distention at an administered dose of 100 mg/kg.|$|E
5000|$|Due to this, {{glutathione}} is depleted {{to certain}} degrees after MeAN exposure. After oral exposure to 100 mg/kg MeAN in rats, the maximum depletion was {{noticed in the}} liver at 39% of control. This depletion, however, is less than found after AN administration. This is likely because MeAN exists in part bound to red blood cells, and is therefore unavailable for GSH conjugation. Studies using radiolabeled carbon {{point out that the}} primary route by which <b>methacrylonitrile</b> left the body is the urine, at 43% of the dose. An additional 18% is excreted in faeces (15%) and exhaled air (2.5%). This means that about 40% of MeAN does not leave the body immediately and is either bound to macromolecules or forms unexcretable conjugates. The red blood cells retained significant amounts of radioactivity: more than 50% of the radioactivity in erythrocytes was detected as covalently bound to hemoglobin and membrane proteins.|$|E
30|$|Modification of {{bleached}} jute fibre {{was carried}} out by graft co-polymerization with the vinyl monomers, acrylonitrile and <b>methacrylonitrile.</b> A K 2 S 2 O 8 /FeSO 4 redox system was used in the presence of air. The graft yield and grafting efficiency increased with the increase of monomer, initiator and reaction time up to certain values, thereafter it decreased. This is due to the increasing rate of homopolymerization, rather than grafting, at the higher monomer concentration. The maximum graft yield with acrylonitrile and <b>methacrylonitrile,</b> under optimized conditions, was 19.78 and 43.15 %, respectively. The graft yield of <b>methacrylonitrile</b> is greater than that of acrylonitrile. This is due to the –CH 3 group present in <b>methacrylonitrile.</b> The inclusion of nitrile monomer onto the treated fibre was identified by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The surface morphology and thermal behavior of the modified fibre was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Thermogravimetric Analysis. Modification of jute fibre improved the thermal stability, breaking strength as well as dyeability of the fiber.|$|E

Bulk copolymer composition is independent of the amount of chain transfer. The efficiency of the addition-fragmentation mechanism in producing specifically end-functionalised co-oligomers was investigated by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Spectral peaks are mostly consistent with the expected end groups for all co-monomer feeds.

Emphasis was directed towards preparing new thickener for printing cotton fabrics with reactive dyes. The grafting parameter was studied with respect to graft yield (G.

On the other hand, the newly prepared poly (MAN) -pregelled starch graft copolymers were used as a thickener for printing cotton fabrics with reactive dyes, to see their suitability as pastes for printing cotton with the latter dyes. Based on the results obtained, appropriate conditions for grafting <b>methacrylonitrile</b> onto pregelled starch was established and the graft yield is higher under the following conditions: using 0. 004 mmol L - 1 potassium monopersulphate as initiator, 0. 005 mmol L - 1 ferrous ion concentration, 0. 002 mmol L - 1, sulphuric acid; 50 % <b>methacrylonitrile</b> concentration (based on weight of substrate), material to liquor ratio, 1 : 2. 5, reaction time, 60 min and polymerization temperature, 40 �C.

40|$|Detailed {{experimental}} {{information on}} the motion of a nuclear packet on a complex (resonant) anion potential surface is obtained by measuring 2 -dimensional (2 D) electron energy loss spectra. The cross section is plotted {{as a function of}} incident electron energy, which determines which resonant anion state is populated, i. e., along which normal coordinate the wave packet is launched, and of the electron energy loss, which reveals into which final states each specific resonant state decays. The 2 D spectra are presented for acrylonitrile and <b>methacrylonitrile,</b> at the incident energy range 0. 095 - 1. 0 [*]eV, where the incoming electron is temporarily captured in the lowest π ∗ orbital. The 2 D spectra reveal selectivity patterns with respect to which vibrations are excited in the attachment and de-excited in the detachment. Further insight is gained by recording 1 D spectra measured along horizontal, vertical, and diagonal cuts of the 2 D spectrum. The methyl group in <b>methacrylonitrile</b> increases the resonance width 7 times.
