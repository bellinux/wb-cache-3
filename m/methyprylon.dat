Essig of the Addiction Research Center of the National Institute of Mental Health {{stated that}} meprobamate, glutethimide, ethinamate, ethchlorvynol, <b>methyprylon</b> and {{chlordiazepoxide}} as drugs whose usefulness {{can hardly be}} questioned. However, Essig labeled these newer products as drugs of addiction, like barbiturates, whose habit-forming qualities were more widely known. He mentioned a 90-day study of chlordiazepoxide, which concluded that the automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal. Participants' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams.|$|E
50|$|Piperidione (trade name Sedulon) is a {{sedative}} drug, structurally {{related to}} <b>methyprylon</b> and pyrithyldione.It {{used to be}} marketed by Roche as a cough medicine available in liquid form.|$|E
50|$|A {{case report}} found that the {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>methyprylon</b> were not concentration dependent in an overdose case; explanations included saturation or inhibition of metabolic pathways. The generally accepted half-life for a therapeutic dose was not found appropriate in intoxicated patients and would underestimate {{the time required to}} reach a safe concentration of the drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methyprylon</b> (Noludar) is a {{sedative}} of the piperidinedione derivative family {{developed by}} Hoffmann-La Roche.This medicine {{was used for}} treating insomnia, but is now rarely used {{as it has been}} replaced by newer drugs with fewer side effects, such as benzodiazepines.Methyprylon was withdrawn from the US market in June 1989 and the Canadian market in September 1990.Some other trade names are Noctan and Dimerin.|$|E

5000|$|Glutethimide is a CYP2D6 enzyme inducer. When {{taken with}} codeine,"hits", [...] "cibas and codeine [...] ", it enables {{the body to}} convert higher amounts of the codeine (higher than the average 5 - 10%) to morphine. The general {{sedative}} effect also adds {{to the effect of}} the combination. It produces an intense euphoria similar to IV heroin use. The effect was also used clinically, including some research in the 1970s in various countries of using it under carefully monitored circumstances as a form of oral opioid agonist substitution therapy, e.g. as a Substitutionmittel that may be a useful alternative to methadone. The demand for this combination in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, NYC, Boston, Baltimore, and surrounding areas of other states and perhaps elsewhere, has led to small-scale clandestine synthesis of glutethimide since 1984, a process that is, like methaqualone (Quaalude) synthesis, somewhat difficult and fraught with potential bad outcomes when less-than-gifted chemists are doing the deed with industrial-grade precursors without adequate quality control. The fact that the simpler clandestine synthesis of other extinct pharmaceutical depressants like ethchlorvynol, <b>methyprylon,</b> or the oldest barbiturates is not reported would seem to point to a high level of motivation surrounding a unique drug, again much like methaqualone. Doriden was discontinued in the US by manufacturers in 1993. Analysis of confiscated glutethimide seems to invariably show the drug or the results of attempted synthesis, whereas purported methaqualone is in a significant minority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines.|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} study {{designed to}} evaluate the hypnotic potentiality of <b>methyprylon</b> (300 mg.), glutethimide (500 mg.) and chloral hydrate (1000 mg.) was carried out on 50 in-patients experiencing long-standing insomina. The patients {{ranged in age from}} 21 to 60 years, the sexes were equally represented and the clinical diagnoses were psychoneurosis, reactive depression, or anxiety reaction. An interesting feature of the experimental design allowed for the exclusion of placebo reactors before the initiation of the main trials. No difference in effectiveness of maintaining sleep could be established among the three hypnotic agents, indicating that at the usual levels of statistical significance, all three agents were equally effective as hypnotics. However, a significant trend (P =. 05) was found for <b>methyprylon</b> (Noludar) to be the most effective and chloral hydrate to be the least effective of the three drugs in maintaining sleep. <b>Methyprylon</b> was found statistically (P =. 05) to be the fastest sleep-inducing agent, whereas glutethimide (Doriden) proved to be the slowest of the three hypnotics with respect to sleep induction time...|$|E
40|$|Six {{hypnotic}} {{drugs and}} a placebo were coded and administered at random, one dose at 8 p. m., to 20 {{patients in a}} Toronto hospital. A special evaluation scale was used, studying average duration of sleep, time of onset of sleep, quality of sleep and side effects. Secobarbital sodium and <b>methyprylon</b> were statistically significantly {{more effective than the}} placebo. The other drugs, glutethimide and three quinozolinone derivatives, were not statistically different from the placebo in their effects. The placebo effect itself was studied. A particular feature of this report is the detailed statistical treatment of the data collected...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a simple liquid-chromatographic system for simultaneously measuring bronchodilators, anticonvulsants, hypnotics, and chioramphenicol. Use in therapeutic drug monitoring includes determination of theophylline, caffeine, chioramphenicol, ethosuximide, primidone, phenobarbital, phenacemide, phenytoin, mephenytoin, nirvanol, and carba-mazepine and its bioactive metabolites within 13 mm. In the “toxicology mode ” theophylline, caffeine, barbital, butabar-bital, pentobarbital, amobarbital, secobarbital, primidone, phenobarbital, <b>methyprylon,</b> glutethtmide, methaqualone, phenytoin, mephenytoin, nirvanol, and carbamazepine and its bioactive metabolites are resolved within 17 mm. A reversed-phase C 8 column (5 -pm particles) is used, with acetonitnle/water (20 / 80 by vol) as mobile phase. The drugs are extracted from 50 pL of serum {{with use of}} a Chromosor...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{simultaneously}} determining 12 hypnotics and sedatives (primidone, <b>methyprylon,</b> phe-nobarbital, butabarbital, butalbital,ethchlorvynol, pento-barbital, amobarbital, phenytoin, glutethimide,secobarbital and methaqualone) in 200 tl of serum. Serum proteins are precipitated with an acetonitrile solution containing 5 -(4 -methylphenyl) - 5 -phenylhydantoin, the internalstandard. The drugs are eluted from a reversed-phase column with a mobile phase consisting of an acetonitrile/phosphate buffer, at a flow rate of 3. 0 mI/mm. The eluted drugs are detected by their absorption at 195 nm; their quantities are estimated from theirpeak heights. Each analysis requires no longer than 30 mm at the optimum column temperature of 50 #{ 176 }C. The lower limit of detection {{for all of these}} drugs is less than 10 ng/sample for drug standard.

40|$|Mice {{selectively}} bred {{for resistance}} (HOT) and sensitivity (COLD) to the hypothermic effect of an acute dose of ethanol were tested twice {{during the course}} of genetic selection for their hypothermic response to other alcohols and sedative hypnotics. The drugs administered were ethanol, propanol, n-butanol, t-butanol, pen-tanol, diazepam, phenobarbital, pentobarbital, <b>methyprylon</b> and ethchlorvynol, all of which have sedative effects on the central nervous system, and hydralazine, a peripheral vasodilator. All drugs decreased body temperature of both HOT and COLD mice. In mice selected for seven to nine generations, COLD mice were more sensitive than HOT mice to all sedative drugs. The longer-chain alcohols were more potent than ethanol in inducing hypothermia, but the magnitude of the response difference be-tween HOT and COLD mice appeared to be smaller. The differ...|$|E
40|$|The {{microcapsule}} {{artificial kidney}} {{was used in}} the treatment of three patients with acute drug intoxication. The apparatus contains 300 g. of microencapsulated activated charcoal with a total membrane area available for diffusion of more than 2 m. 2 The membrane thickness is only 500 A. These properties make possible a compact artificial kidney whose efficiency for the removal of uremic metabolites and drugs is much higher than standard hemodialysis apparatus. The microcapsules are made blood-compatible by coating with human albumin. A roller pump was used to propel the blood through the microcapsule artificial kidney at a flow rate of 300 ml. /min. for two to three hours. The clearance values for glutethimide, <b>methyprylon</b> and methaqualone were much higher than those achieved by standard hemodialysis. Hemoperfusion quickly lowered the drug level in the blood with resulting clinical improvement...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} trial of four hypnotic drugs was carried out: Ro 4 - 5360, 10 mg. (Mogadon), <b>methyprylon,</b> 200 mg. (Noludar), Ro 4 - 5360, 5 mg. (Mogadon), secobarbital sodium, 100 mg. (Seconal), and a placebo. The study {{was on the}} usual double-blind basis, and all observations were made by a full-time nurse. Capsules were given at 10 p. m. for five successive nights, with two nights free from medication or observation. There were five such periods. The nurse carried out her observations right through the night, determining whether the patients were awake or asleep. Each of these drugs was statistically {{significantly different from the}} placebo, in terms of length of sleep. Differences between the individual drugs were not significant. The length of action of the various drugs appeared to be similar, with a somewhat longer period of activity for the Mogadon in both dosages. The major side effect was some drowsiness: this was more marked with Mogadon 10 mg. With the hypnotics, the patients had, on the average, about one hour more sleep than on the placebo...|$|E
40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} to peck the center key (lighted white) of three {{response}} keys {{to turn off the}} center keylight and to light one of the side keys with a red keylight and the other side key with a green keylight. Five responses (fixed-ratio component) on either side key relighted the center key. Food was delivered following 10 fixed-ratio components on the red key if 1. 5 mg/kg phencyclidine had been given before the session. The position of the red and green keylights on the side keys varied randomly each time they were lighted by a peck on the center key. Subsequently, increasing doses of phencyclidine, barbital, amobarbital, phenobarbital, methaqualone, <b>methyprylon,</b> diazepam, oxazepam, and d-amphetamine were substituted for the training dose of phencyclidine, using a cumulative dosing procedure. At low doses of the sedative hypnotics, birds pecked the keylight color associated with saline. At higher doses, birds pecked both key colors. At the highest doses of pentobarbital and amobarbital, some birds responded almost exclusively On he color associated with phencyclidine. When responding on keys of both colors occurred following administration of phencyclidine or other sedative hypnotics, this responding was controlled by key position rather than by key color...|$|E
40|$|The term {{addictive}} as used by {{the popular}} press frequently confuses the more precise concepts of acute and chronic tolerance, physical dependence and withdrawal, and psychologic dependence. Serious physical dependence on psychoactive drugs is rare and is easily managed. In contrast, psychologic dependence, {{the most important reason}} for persistent drug use, is much more common and is difficult to treat. Some tactics are available — for example, confrontation and discussion with the patient about how a drug {{is not going to be}} effective over long periods. Treating the symptom of a complex problem should, of course, not be expected to solve the problem. The most important tactic is to prescribe dependence-associated drugs only when clearly indicated, when the problem is responsive to drug therapy and for the shortest period necessary, without the option for renewing the prescription. Many problems related to drug use long after the period of expected benefit is past can be avoided by far more restrictive drug prescribing. Barbiturates and nonbarbiturate sedative hypnotics (e. g., ethchlorvynol, glutethimide, meprobamate, methaqualone and <b>methyprylon)</b> should not be prescribed for insomnia, acute reactive anxiety, chronic anxiety neurosis or depressive illnesses, since the safer and equally effective benzodiazepines, which are less associated with dependence, are available...|$|E
