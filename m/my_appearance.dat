But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about <b>my</b> <b>appearance</b> on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing.|$|E

I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, [...] "Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' Please do not pass judgement without seeing my show.|$|E
2500|$|Geneviève Forget, a {{video game}} streamer, states in a Kotaku {{interview}} that [...] "Harassment does happen in my stream chat {{from time to time}} that people start discussing <b>my</b> <b>appearance</b> but it really isn't the focus on my stream. I'd like to think people come back to watch it because it is quite entertaining and I try to interact with the chat as much as possible." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2005 he [...] "cemented" [...] {{his hands}} outside the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin. He {{made a speech}} saying, [...] "It will be a proud day for me. <b>My</b> <b>appearances</b> on the Gaiety stage are without doubt the {{highlights}} of my career and I am honoured to {{have been asked to}} give my prints." ...|$|R

2500|$|Carson {{discovered}} {{a book about}} himself in the Apache camp. This {{was the first time}} that he found himself in print. He was the hero of adventure stories. He was sorry for the rest of his life that Mrs. White had been killed. He wrote in his Memoirs: [...] "In camp was found a book, the first of the kind I had ever seen, in which I was made a great hero, slaying Indians by the hundreds ... I have often thought that Mrs. White read the same ... for <b>my</b> <b>appearance</b> that she might be saved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blanchett {{has spoken}} about {{feminism}} and politics, telling Sky News in 2013 {{that she was}} concerned that [...] "a wave of conservatism sweeping the globe" [...] was threatening women's role in society. She has also commented on the pressures women in Hollywood face now: [...] "Honestly, I think about <b>my</b> <b>appearance</b> less than I did ten years ago. People talk about {{the golden age of}} Hollywood because of how women were lit then. You could be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and work well into your 50s, because you were lit and made into a goddess. Now, with everything being sort of gritty, women have this sense of their use-by date." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011 Bachmann {{published}} her autobiography, Core of Conviction, {{in which}} she outlines the events {{and people who have}} shaped her values and beliefs including her parents' divorce {{when she was in the}} ninth grade. She describes the financial struggles her mother suffered as a single parent in trying to provide for her family and the work ethic she developed as a result of it. She writes of that time, [...] "I took every baby sitting job I could get, because by ninth grade, I was growing conscious of <b>my</b> <b>appearance.</b> In those days, girls had to wear dresses to public school, and if I wanted pretty dresses, I had to buy them, because mom couldn't afford them for me; she couldn't afford lunch money." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{great deal}} of {{attention}} was paid to Palin's physical appearance during the 2008 elections. [...] According to Vogue magazine, [...] "Besides being telegenic, [...] had a tough-girl Alaskan résumé that most politicians could only dream of—the protein her family eats comes from fish she has pulled out of the ocean with her own hands and caribou she has shot." [...] Others were quick to point out striking resemblances of Palin to actress Tina Fey, who would impersonate her on Saturday Night Live, and Peggy Hill, a character on Fox Network's cartoon series King of the Hill. [...] Regarding her appearance, Palin has said, [...] "I've been taken aback by the nasty criticism about <b>my</b> <b>appearance.</b> [...] I wish they'd stick with the issues instead of discussing my black go-go boots. [...] A reporter once asked me about it during the campaign, and I assured him I was trying to be as frumpy as I could by wearing my hair on top of my head and these schoolmarm glasses." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{garden was}} the place where <b>my</b> <b>appearance</b> as a cyclist at the Vélodrome d’Hiver was thought up. Gleizes and Villon claimed that I wouldn’t be able to cycle 100 {{kilometres}} without putting a foot on the ground. I bet them that I could {{for the price of}} a lunch. It’s actually a pretty hard thing to do to keep going over 100 kilometres on country roads. Neither of my opponents had a car and they didn’t want to chase after me on one of those velocipedes. A journalist from our circle of friends suggested cycling in a velodrome which is actually just as tiring, especially for someone who is not used to it. But I agreed. A few days later, one morning at ten, I began my laps in the Vélodrome d’Hiver. An hour went by and then another. The spectators, Fernand Léger was among them, cheered me on with increasing enthusiasm until quite unexpectedly the sound of a gong brought me to a halt. I had won my meal by my honourable average speed. (Metzinger) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why? Tell me why?" [...] asked Mr. May anxiously. [...] "Is it <b>my</b> <b>appearance</b> {{you laugh}} at, {{or is it}} only me? If it's me I don't mind. But if it's <b>my</b> <b>appearance,</b> tell me so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah,' I said quietly, 'I thought so; and {{you talk}} of my getting all right!' I {{did not like to}} let them see how shocked I really was at <b>my</b> own <b>appearance.</b> <b>My</b> grizzled stubby hair was turned snow-white, and my yellow face was shrunk like an aged woman's and had two deep purple rings painted beneath the eyes.|$|R
60|$|When I {{went home}} to my grandmother, she was greatly {{surprised}} to see me, and I lost no time in explaining <b>my</b> unexpected <b>appearance.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} obliged {{to make a}} slight {{alteration}} in <b>my</b> personal <b>appearance,</b> ma'am," [...] I said. [...] "But I am still Frank Softly." ...|$|R

5000|$|In late 1999, {{after the}} movie The Hurricane came out {{starring}} Denzel Washington as Rubin Carter, Sarokin told the Newark Star-Ledger in an article that appeared on February 10, 2000, that [...] "after reviewing the record 1985, I had my doubts that Carter and John Artis were guilty. That's been confirmed by <b>my</b> <b>appearances</b> with Carter. If he is guilty, he's the greatest actor {{in the world and}} should win an Academy Award, not Denzel Washington," [...] Sarokin told the paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "But this is {{not only}} silly, but cruel to others. I owe you an {{explanation}} of <b>my</b> unexpected <b>appearance,</b> and perhaps, also, of my extraordinary attire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have put}} in <b>my</b> last <b>appearance</b> at the old chamber in Lincoln's Inn Fields," [...] said Mr. Grey, on {{arriving}} home one day early in June.|$|R
60|$|I {{examined}} myself. My hat was on straight, {{and there}} was nothing at all alarming about <b>my</b> <b>appearance.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yus," [...] she {{answered}} shortly, <b>my</b> <b>appearance</b> possibly not approximating {{the standard of}} affluence required by her house.|$|E
60|$|When I made <b>my</b> <b>appearance</b> in {{the hallway}} I met the little man, who {{immediately}} burst into a roar of laughter.|$|E

60|$|It was a noble speech, and <b>my</b> <b>appearance</b> gave {{force to}} my words. For the moment I was a heroic figure.|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is, Miss Dunning, had I not promised {{faithfully}} to come, I {{should not}} have made <b>my</b> <b>appearance</b> at all to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with you all here?" [...] Hunterleys demanded, irritably. [...] "Is there {{anything}} wrong with <b>my</b> <b>appearance?</b> Has anything happened?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} considering, Filippo,' he said, 'that it behoves me on <b>my</b> first <b>appearance</b> before {{the eyes of}} my {{numerous}} lady loves to cut the best figure I can.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allow me to hint to you, Archer, that if {{you could}} get some food and drink for these ladies, instead of {{discussing}} <b>my</b> personal <b>appearance,</b> it would be much more practical." ...|$|R
