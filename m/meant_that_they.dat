5|$|The {{reception}} {{given by}} footplate crews {{was such that}} more of the class were constructed for {{other parts of the}} network, although the electrification of the Southern's Eastern Section <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were dispersed from their original stamping grounds.|$|E
5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were even more}} prone to wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train. Once underway they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff Blues {{had been}} the only team to finish the pool stage of the Heineken Cup unbeaten during the 2008–09 season, which saw them given top seeding for the quarter-finals. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would have a home quarter-final against the second-best runners-up from the pool stage, Toulouse. Cardiff won the quarter-final 9–6.|$|E
5000|$|The Q1's route {{availability}} <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> although <b>they</b> were primarily freight locomotives they also frequently deputised on secondary passenger services. However, the class {{gained a reputation}} for poor braking on unfitted freight trains due to the light construction of the tender braking system.|$|R
25|$|This battle {{demonstrated}} that the convoy escorts had {{mastered the art of}} convoy protection; the weapons and expertise at their disposal <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> henceforth <b>they</b> would be able not only to protect their charges and repel attack, but also to inflict significant losses on the attacker.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "I saw them; {{and perhaps}} {{we can make it}} out that those rites are, in reality, the worship of images; but they are not <b>meant</b> for <b>that.</b> <b>They</b> are <b>meant</b> for the worship of God." ...|$|R
5|$|His {{successor}} at Ipswich was {{his assistant}} manager Bobby Ferguson. Under Ferguson, Town finished mid-table twice, but worsening performances <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> began to {{struggle in the}} top division. The recent construction of an expensive new stand at Portman Road had limited the club's budget, despite the money gaining from sales of key players including Frans Thijssen and John Wark.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool though had {{weathered}} {{the worst and}} kept their heads to close out the game. They won their first European trophy {{as a result of}} a 3–2 aggregate victory. Liverpool's victory <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> became the first English team to win a European trophy and league championship in the same season.|$|E
5|$|MLS clubs {{were first}} {{included}} in the U.S. Open Cup tournament in 1996. D.C. United won the tournament that year, and repeated their success in 2008. In 2009, the club began its title defense in the MLS qualification rounds. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had to win six games instead of the four needed to obtain the cup in 2008.|$|E
50|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, Tuckman {{said that one of}} the hurdles to playing in Vancouver was that most international players had single-entrance visas, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> left the United States to play a game in Canada, they could not return to the U.S.|$|R
60|$|I {{understood}} what <b>that</b> <b>meant.</b> <b>They</b> {{were afraid to}} tell me the truth. I insisted on the truth.|$|R
5000|$|GE's design {{modified}} this layout by {{arranging the}} electron guns in a side-by-side line (the [...] "in-line gun") {{instead of a}} triangle (the [...] "delta gun"). This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> after <b>they</b> passed through the mask they separated horizontally only, hitting phosphors that were also arranged side-by-side. Otherwise, the GE design retained the round dot structure.|$|R
5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{students}} then received the Holy Ghost. By this is <b>meant,</b> <b>that</b> by all <b>they</b> had witnessed and suffered they were roused to an enlarged understanding of Divine Science, {{even to the}} spiritual interpretation.. ... of His teachings," [...] etc.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the club}} is based in Fife, their close {{geographical}} location to Dundee and Angus <b>meant</b> <b>that,</b> when <b>they</b> became a junior club, they chose to join the Tayside League rather than the Fife League. They had phenomenal success in the 1990s and early-2000s, winning the league they were competing in every season since 1990-91, bar four times when they managed to finish as runners-up.|$|R
50|$|The companions thought <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> after <b>they</b> {{defeated}} {{all four}} Sisters the Shadow Lord might {{give up on}} trying to rule all of Deltora.|$|R
5|$|Canada had {{originally}} planned to send two ski jumpers, Nels Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie. Nelsen held world {{record for the}} longest ski jump. However, lack of funding <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> planned for work for their fare on a freighter. These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation, who organized the Canadian team and who felt working for their fare was inappropriate and not fitting for the team, and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain's archery squad for the Games {{included}} twelve athletes. In all, four archery medals, two gold, one {{silver and}} one bronze, were won by British archers, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{finished second in}} the archery medal table. John Stubbs, a former England disabled cricketer, set a new world record score of 691 in the ranking round on the route to victory in the men's individual compound open. In the equivalet women's event Danielle Brown beat compatriot, and eventual bronze medallist, Mel Clarke before going on to win the gold.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001–02 season, Given {{played in}} every Premier League match as Newcastle's {{previously}} unexpected title challenge {{ended in a}} fourth-place finish in the league. A highlight of the season was Given saving a Fabrizio Ravanelli penalty in a 1–0 win over Derby County on 24 November 2001. Given was selected in the PFA Team of the Year and Newcastle's league position <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would enter the qualifying stages of the UEFA Champions League the following season.|$|E
25|$|On 14 January 2014, the Democratic Coalition {{and four}} other groups founded Unity, a {{political}} alliance {{with the aim of}} defeating Fidesz at the elections in the spring. The alliance made it into the Parliament, but only as opposition. DK won only four seats, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> since <b>they</b> were below the minimum requirements of forming a parliamentary group (five seats), its MPs (including Gyurcsány) officially count as independent politicians.|$|R
5000|$|These sequestrated clergy were {{described}} as [...] "scandalous", which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> either <b>they</b> supported the Royalist cause, or their theological attitudes were high Anglican, or both. Often the two went hand in hand because, in a religious age, some of the political differences about how the country should be governed were over the laws on how church affairs should be organised and {{the details of how}} services should be conducted.|$|R
50|$|<b>That</b> {{these men}} <b>meant</b> all <b>that</b> <b>they</b> said and promised is {{evidenced}} {{in the fact}} that, with very few exceptions, their names are found enrolled upon the following lists of militia maintained during the War of the Revolution. Some of the names are those of persons then residing outside the bounds of the town, {{but there is no}} record distinguishing them from residents of Lansingburgh.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} round, Juventus were drawn against Swiss team Grasshopper. Juventus {{won the first}} leg 2–0 in Italy, and {{achieved}} a 4–2 victory in the second leg in Switzerland, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> won the tie 6–2 on aggregate. Juventus' opponents in the quarter-finals were Sparta Prague of Czechoslovakia. Goals from Marco Tardelli, Paolo Rossi and Massimo Briaschi ensured a 3–0 victory for Juventus in the first leg in Italy. They lost the second leg at Sparta's home ground, Letná stadium 1–0, but progressed to the semi-finals due to a 3–1 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{had won the}} 1975–76 Football League {{between the}} first and second legs of the UEFA Cup Final; a 3–1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers on the final day of the league season ensured they became champions. As a result of their league success, Liverpool {{qualified}} for the 1976–77 European Cup as English champions. Brugge had won the 1975–76 Belgian First Division; they won the competition by four points from second-place Anderlecht. Their success <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would also be competing in next season's European Cup as Belgian champions.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, pre-dreadnoughts {{continued}} in active service and saw significant combat use even when obsolete. Dreadnoughts and battlecruisers were believed vital for the decisive naval battles {{which at the}} time all nations expected, hence they were jealously guarded against the risk of damage by mines or submarine attack, and kept close to home as much as possible. The obsolescence and consequent expendability of the pre-dreadnoughts <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be deployed into more dangerous situations and more far-flung areas.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so; {{though there}} has been a good deal said about the {{necessity}} of Mr. Warren's removing, and giving up St. Andrew's, since he preached against covetousness. All the anti-renters say, I hear, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> know he <b>meant</b> them, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> won't put up with it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Perpetual in {{the title}} <b>meant</b> <b>that,</b> once licensed, <b>they</b> could not be removed by their nominating patron; and could only be {{deprived}} by their diocesan bishop through the ecclesiastical courts. Curate meant they were licensed by the diocesan bishop to provide [...] "cure of souls" [...] {{for the people of}} a district or parish.|$|R
50|$|The Metro Radio Group {{itself was}} bought out by EMAP in 1996 and {{ownership}} rules {{at the time}} <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> as <b>they</b> already owned neighbouring Radio Aire in Leeds {{something had to be}} sold on, and that was The Pulse and its sister station Classic Gold which were purchased in a management buyout from senior staff and ex-Metro Group executives. The new company was called The Radio Partnership, it was at this time that the station moved to number one position in the West Yorkshire radio market {{for the first time in}} its history.|$|R
5|$|The French ironclad Invincible was {{the second}} of the three wooden-hulled s built for the French Navy in 1858–62. The ships of the Gloire class were {{classified}} as armoured frigates because they only had a single gun deck and their traditional disposition of guns arrayed {{along the length of the}} hull also <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were broadside ironclads. Invincible had an uneventful career and was deployed in North American waters during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The unseasoned timber of her hull rotted quickly and she was condemned in 1872 and scrapped in 1876.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene grey parakeet was grey, {{had a long}} tail, and {{was larger}} than other species of the Psittacula genus, which are usually green. The grey parrots {{were said to be}} easy to hunt, as the capture of one would result in its calling out to summon the whole flock. They were also {{considered}} to be crop pests and being such easy prey <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were extensively hunted. Coupled with deforestation, this pushed them into extinction. This had happened by the 1730s on Réunion and by the 1760s on Mauritius.|$|E
5|$|Their {{purchase}} by the Admiralty was organised by the London firm of Antony Gibbs & Sons, {{a partnership}} run by Alban Gibbs {{and his younger}} brother Vicary Gibbs. Both were Members of Parliament (MPs), and their role in the transaction <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were disqualified from the House of Commons, under an old law which debarred MPs from accepting contracts from the Crown. This triggered two by-elections, in which Alban was re-elected unopposed, but Vicary lost his seat.|$|E
50|$|The concept re-appeared {{with the}} North American XF-108 Rapier project, a {{long-range}} interceptor intended to launch from the continental United States and intercept Soviet bombers {{while still in}} the far Arctic. This long range <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> were launched from forward bases in Europe, Turkey or Alaska, the F-108 {{would be able to}} travel a fair distance over the USSR and help disrupt the defences for the following North American XB-70 bombers. The F-108 was ultimately cancelled in budget cuts, and its short-lived replacement, the Lockheed YF-12, was not considered in this role.|$|R
5000|$|The ramparts, or Bàrri {{were built}} in the 9th century. Historically they were pierced by two gates: to the north Calendrale or Saracen gate and to the south the Séquier gate. There were also two water gates: to the west the Pujade postern and to the east the Pousterle postern. The ramparts were embellished and {{enhanced}} in the 14th century together with the construction of the Anglica Tower. Their peculiarities of [...] "hollow walls" [...] <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> once <b>they</b> had ceased military use, they were immediately converted into houses. They are still very visible today.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the {{one thing}} I can't very well {{make up my mind}} to speak to her about. I don't know what she would do." [...] He did not say, [...] "If she lost Jackson," [...] but Cynthia knew he <b>meant</b> <b>that,</b> and <b>they</b> were both silent. [...] "Of course," [...] he went on, [...] "I know that she places a great deal of {{dependence}} upon you, but Jackson's her main stay. He's a good man, and he's a good son. I wish I'd always been half as good." ...|$|R
