5|$|In 1942 Ernst Lubitsch {{directed}} a motion picture titled To Be or Not To Be. The {{story is a}} comedy about a troupe of Polish actors in the Nazi era. A key plot point revolves around the famous soliloquy. The story was remade in 1983 in a film starring (and produced by) <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The three films Wilder {{appeared}} in following The Producers were box office failures: Start the Revolution and Quackser seemed to audiences poor copies of <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> films, while Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory {{was not a}} commercial success, although it later gained a cult following and an Oscar nomination for Best Score, {{as well as a}} Golden Globe award nomination for Wilder.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{also met}} Stuart Cornfeld during this time. Cornfeld had enjoyed Eraserhead and was {{interested}} in producing Ronnie Rocket; Cornfeld was working for <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> and Brooksfilms at the time, and when the two realized that Ronnie Rocket was unlikely to find sufficient financing to be produced, Lynch asked to see some already-written scripts to work from for his next film instead. Cornfeld found four scripts he felt Lynch would be interested in, but on hearing {{the name of the}} first, the director decided his next project would be The Elephant Man.|$|E
5|$|The main cast {{consisted}} of Dan Castellaneta (Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, among others), Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson, Patty and Selma Bouvier), Nancy Cartwright (Bart Simpson, Ralph Wiggum, Nelson Muntz, among others), Yeardley Smith (Lisa Simpson), Hank Azaria (Moe Szyslak, Apu, Chief Wiggum, among others) and Harry Shearer (Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, Principal Skinner, among others).

5|$|Wilder {{began his}} career on stage, and made his screen debut in an episode of the TV series The Play of the Week in 1961. Although his first film role was portraying a hostage in the 1967 motion picture Bonnie and Clyde, Wilder's first major role was as Leopold Bloom in the 1968 film The Producers {{for which he was}} {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This was {{the first in a series}} of collaborations with writer/director <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks,</b> including 1974's Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, which Wilder co-wrote, garnering the pair an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Wilder is known for his portrayal of Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) and for his four films with Richard Pryor: Silver Streak (1976), Stir Crazy (1980), See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989), and Another You (1991). Wilder directed and wrote several of his own films, including The Woman in Red (1984).|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Wilder {{was cast}} in {{a leading role in}} Mother Courage and Her Children, a {{production}} starring Anne Bancroft, who introduced Wilder to her boyfriend (and later husband) <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks.</b> A few months later, Brooks mentioned that he was working on a screenplay called Springtime for Hitler, for which he thought Wilder would be perfect in the role of Leo Bloom. Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments. Months went by, and Wilder toured the country with different theatre productions, participated in a televised CBS presentation of Death of a Salesman, and was cast for his first role in a film—a minor role in Arthur Penn's 1967 Bonnie and Clyde. After three years of not hearing from Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1968's The Producers.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} was {{for most of}} the filming a closed set, with great measures taken to maintain the secrecy of the plot. Scripts were numbered and lists kept of who received each copy. The press was told nothing about the story and only a few production stills were allowed to be published. During construction one young visitor to a soundstage stole a copy of blueprints for the bridge set and sold duplicates of them to any fans who would pay him $75; Paramount reported the matter to the FBI, who turned the case over to the Los Angeles Police Department. The police arrested, convicted, and fined the culprit $750; it was later discovered that the stolen plans were not the final copies. Visitor's badges were created to keep track of guests, and due to the limited number were constantly checked out; among the visitors included friends of the cast and crew, the press, fan leaders, and actors such as Clint Eastwood, Tony Curtis, Robin Williams, and <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks.</b> Security swept cars leaving the lots for stolen items; even the principal actors were not spared from this inconvenience.|$|E

25|$|Pryor co-wrote Blazing Saddles (1974), {{directed}} by <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> and starring Gene Wilder. Pryor {{was to play}} the lead role of Bart, but the film's production studio would not insure him, and <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> chose Cleavon Little, instead. Before his horribly damaging 1980 freebasing incident, Pryor {{was about to start}} filming Mel Brooks' History of the World, Part I (1981), but was replaced at the last minute by Gregory Hines. Pryor was also originally considered for the role of Billy Ray Valentine on Trading Places (1983), before Eddie Murphy won the part.|$|E

25|$|The 1974 <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> classic Blazing Saddles gives viewer a brief glance {{behind the}} scenes as they {{literally}} break the fourth wall onto an adjacent stage, and through the Warner Bros. commissary before spilling out of the main studio gates and onto Olive Avenue.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> and Gene Wilder comedy Young Frankenstein (1974) borrows {{heavily from}} the first three Universal Frankenstein films, {{especially}} Son of Frankenstein. The production used many of James Whale's original laboratory set pieces and employed the technical contributions of their original creator, Kenneth Strickfaden. Wilder portrays Dr. Frankenstein's American grandson, Frederick, while Peter Boyle plays the monster. A Turkish remake, Sevimli Frankestayn was released in 1975. Brooks later adapted his film for musical theater. The musical Young Frankenstein opened on Broadway in November 2007.|$|E
25|$|David Geffen persuaded <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> to {{turn his}} movie into a stage musical. When Brooks met with Jerry Herman to discuss their working together, Herman declined, telling Brooks that he should do the job himself, as {{he was a good}} songwriter. Brooks then asked Thomas Meehan to join him in writing the book for the stage. Brooks persuaded Mike Ockrent and his wife Susan Stroman to join the {{creative}} team as director and choreographer. After Ockrent's death in 1999, Stroman agreed to continue as both director and choreographer.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} legal battles {{and changes in}} ownership, further {{development}} on the island was finally started in the 1980s, with architecture matching the original 1920s Spanish style mansions. Although no longer a one-family island, in 2005, Fisher Island still remains somewhat inaccessible {{to the public and}} uninvited guests, and is as exclusive by modern standards {{as it was in the}} days of the Vanderbilts, providing similar refuge and retreat for its residents. The island contains mansions, a hotel, several apartment buildings, an observatory, and a private marina. Boris Becker, Oprah Winfrey, and <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> are among the celebrities with homes on the island.|$|E
25|$|Although David {{maintains}} an office, he leads a semiretired {{life in the}} series and is rarely shown working regularly, other than in season two, {{when he tries to}} create a failed pilot for Jason Alexander and later Julia Louis-Dreyfus, season four, which centered on his being cast as the lead in the <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> musical The Producers, and in season seven, writing a Seinfeld reunion show. Most of the series revolves around David's interactions with his friends and acquaintances, with David often at odds with the other characters, usually to his detriment. Despite this, the characters do not seem to harbor ill feelings toward each other for any extended period, and the cast has stayed stable throughout the show.|$|E
25|$|Celebrities, {{including}} actors, comedians, authors, {{musicians and}} athletes, often make guest appearances on the show, {{with a large}} portion of them playing themselves, or fictional versions thereof. Some of these guest stars are Mary Steenburgen, <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> and Anne Bancroft, Michael York, Martin Scorsese, Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor, Martin Short, Jimmy Kimmel, Lucy Lawless, David Schwimmer, Shaquille O'Neal, Rosie O'Donnell, Ricky Gervais, Michael J. Fox, Hugh Hefner, Alanis Morissette, Bill Buckner, Mookie Wilson, and the main cast of Seinfeld – Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander and Michael Richards.

25|$|On February 25, 1950, Caesar {{appeared}} in the first episode of Your Show of Shows, initially {{the second half of}} the two-hour umbrella show, Saturday Night Review; at the end of the 1950–51 season, Your Show of Shows became its own, 90-minute program. Burgess Meredith hosted the first two shows, and the premiere featured musical guests Gertrude Lawrence, Lily Pons and Robert Merrill. The show was a mix of sketch comedy, movie and television satires, Caesar's monologues, musical guests, and large production numbers. Guests included: Jackie Cooper, Robert Preston, Rex Harrison, Eddie Albert, Michael Redgrave, Basil Rathbone, Charlton Heston, Geraldine Page, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Pearl Bailey, Fred Allen, Benny Goodman, Lena Horne and many other stars of the time.

Sid Caesar won his first Emmy in 1952. In 1951 and 1952, he was voted the United States' Best Comedian in Motion Picture Dailys TV poll. The show ended after almost 160 episodes on June 5, 1954.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the film}} was titled The Greatest Muppet Movie of All Time!!!, and an early leak of the script {{suggested}} that it would feature celebrity cameos by Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau, Christian Bale, Ben Stiller, Steve Carell, George Clooney, Jack Black, Jean-Claude Van Damme, <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks,</b> Matt Damon, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, Rachael Ray, Bob Saget, Lisa Lampanelli, Jeff Ross, and Charles Grodin. Another former title of {{the film was}} The Cheapest Muppet Movie Ever Made!, after an unused script written by Jerry Juhl back in 1985. Although early reports indicated that Stoller would direct the film, in January 2010 {{it was announced that}} James Bobin would direct the movie. In February 2010, additional details about the plot surfaced, indicating that the film would be about a villain that wanted to drill for oil underneath the old Muppet Theater, and {{that the only way to}} stop him would be to put on a show that draws ten million viewers. Reports from the summer of 2010 revealed that the production team had met with the creative heads at Pixar Animation Studios to fine tune the script. During the summer of 2010, it was announced that the film would be released on Christmas 2011, but in December 2010, the release date was moved to Thanksgiving 2011.|$|E
500|$|The Producers {{eventually}} became a cult comedy classic, with <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> winning an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Wilder being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

500|$|Inside the {{gatefold}} cover, {{around the}} edges of a tinted photo of Harrison and comedian Peter Sellers walking beside a Friar Park lake, text asks the [...] "Wanderer through this Garden's ways" [...] to [...] "Be kindly" [...] and refrain from casting [...] "Revengeful stones" [...] if [...] "perchance an Imperfection thou hast found", the reason being: [...] "The Gardener toiled to make his Garden fair, Most for thy Pleasure." [...] A speech balloon over the photograph contains the words [...] "Well, Leo! What say we promenade through the park?" [...] This line was taken from the <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> movie The Producers, a favourite of Sellers and Harrison.|$|E
500|$|Sarandon {{had wanted}} to guest star on The Simpsons because her {{children}} were fans of the show; she made a later appearance in the series in the episode [...] "Bart Has Two Mommies" [...] {{as the voice of}} a computer. <b>Mel</b> <b>Brooks</b> also makes an appearance in [...] "Homer vs. Patty and Selma", and had previously accompanied his wife Anne Bancroft to the recording studio when she had a role in the episode [...] "Fear of Flying". The episode's script was written by Brent Forrester, and it was his first writing credit on the series. The episode was directed by Mark Kirkland, with David Mirkin serving as executive producer.|$|E
