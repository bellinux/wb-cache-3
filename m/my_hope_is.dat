Hawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character's [...] "subjective reality", it would not have to address any connections to the films straight away, noting that his series Fargo, which is connected to the 1996 film of the same name, at first [...] "had to stand on its own feet" [...] before exploring those connections more; [...] "We have to earn the right {{to be part of this}} universe. <b>My</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio call and say they would be foolish enough not to connect these things." [...] He did state that [...] "you can't tell this story without" [...] acknowledging that Legion is the son of Charles Xavier, who appears in the films. This acknowledgement comes in [...] "Chapter 7", with the appearance of Xavier's signature wheelchair in one of Haller's memories. Hawley explained that Haller would look to learn more of his father in future seasons, with Xavier potentially making a physical appearance in the series at that point.|$|E

500|$|The {{ceremony}} was opened by Dobriansky {{followed by a}} rendition of the U.S. national anthem, [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". [...] Senyshyn then read the invocation in English and Ukrainian and Roman Smal-Stocki, president of the memorial committee, spoke {{about the significance of}} the monument.

[...] He also said the statue represented [...] "millions of oppressed" [...] in Eastern Europe and [...] "gives them constant encouragement to struggle forever against Communist tyranny, until, one day final victory is achieved, as it most surely will be."
