40|$|Making {{plastics}} {{more sustainable}} by valorizing waste CO 2 as a cheap, inexhaustible and renewable feedstock {{is an early}} stage technology with strong innovation potential that imposes itself as a strategic driver for developing future low carbon footprint materials and technologies. With a global production estimated to 18 million tons for 2016, polyurethane (PU) {{is one of the}} most important polymers in our everyday life applications (automotive, building and construction, coatings, etc.). Industrially, PU is produced by step-growth polymerization between di- or polyisocyanates and di- or polyols. However, isocyanates are toxic and drastic changes in the REACH regulations limiting/banning the use of isocyanates are expected. There is a need today to develop new greener and safer alternatives to produce PU. Valorizing CO 2 as C 1 feedstock for producing precursors entering in the synthesis of polyurethanes by a non-isocyanate route (NIPU) is a promising strategy to solve this challenge. In this talk, we will focus on the synthesis and characterization of novel NIPUs foams for thermal insulation, and NIPUs coatings for <b>metal</b> <b>protection.</b> Our research highlights benefit of merging bio-resources (such as vegetable oils) with carbon dioxide transformation.

The mechanism of the activation of the reaction will be discussed, and scaling up of the technology will be demonstrated (15 kg scale).

40|$|Graphene(G) -based polymer nanocomposites have {{attracted}} great interest owing to their superior physicochemical properties over polymers. However, {{the tendency of}} graphene sheets to aggregate {{makes it difficult to}} achieve homogenous dispersion in polymer matrix. Herein, by utilization of poly(2 -butylaniline) (P 2 BA) as a dispersing agent, stable dispersion of graphene in organic solvents was achieved via non-covalent pi-pi interactions between P 2 BA and graphene nanosheets. The exfoliated graphene nanosheets were then integrated with coating matrix by curing reaction of epoxy resin with P 2 BA functionalized graphene (P 2 BA-G) and amine hardener. Embedding a small percentage of well-dispersed graphene nanosheets (P 2 BA(0. 5 %) -G(0. 5 %)) in epoxy coating remarkably improved anticorrosion performance and wear resistance properties, which was attributed to the synergistic effects of the redox catalytic capability of P 2 BA, high mechanical and barrier properties of well-dispersed graphene nanosheets in the epoxy matrix.

Unfortunately, classical <b>metal</b> <b>protection</b> methods used for example in industry, can in most of cases not be used in the context of the conservation of cultural heritage because artefacts must not be aesthetically modified and any protection treatment must be potentially removable without any damage to the artefact. For that reason, to set up efficient conservation strategies, it is necessary to understand and model the long term corrosion mechanisms. In addition to environmental monitoring and empirical approaches, the fine understanding of the corrosion systems, based on the use of multiscale character-isation techniques and methodologies is a key issue to understand the mechanisms and evaluate the degradation rates. This chapter reviews the cases for which investigations at nano scales are necessary to understand and model in a reliable way the corrosion behaviour of different metals (ferrous alloys and bronzes).

40|$|Abstract: Lifetime {{evaluation}} of metallic components {{is one of}} the main subjects for many industries due to its importance for development of <b>metal</b> <b>protection</b> and conservation methods. Looking forward this information, several electrochemical techniques have been applied by practitioners. One of the most important is the so called Electrochemical Noise Study, which makes possible to measure potential or real fluctuations produced by kinetic variations along the corrosion process. This technique makes necessary to apply signal processing methods, including low frequency trend removal. Many statistical methods have been proposed to do so. In order to assess each method performance, it is a must to know exactly both trend and noise for a particular signal. Then, a statistical comparison can be carried out between noise extracted with different methods and real noise. With this purpose, sometimes signal is simulated by computer data generation. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for trend removal, using artificial intelligence techniques instead of statistical methods. With this purpose, we combined an interval signal processing with backpropagation neural networks. Data pre-processing, used topologies, optimizations and training process are exposed in detail.
