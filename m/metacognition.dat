25|$|There are {{generally}} two components of metacognition: knowledge about cognition, and regulation of cognition. Writings on <b>metacognition</b> {{can be traced}} back {{at least as far as}} De Anima and the Parva Naturalia of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Metacognologists believe that the ability to consciously think about thinking is unique to sapient species and indeed is one of the definitions of sapience. There is evidence that rhesus monkeys and apes can make accurate judgments about the strengths of their memories of fact and monitor their own uncertainty, while attempts to demonstrate <b>metacognition</b> in birds have been inconclusive. A 2007 study provided some evidence for <b>metacognition</b> in rats, but further analysis suggested that they may have been following simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E
40|$|This study {{focussed}} on {{the role}} of alcohol related <b>metacognitions</b> on craving in individuals who were misusing alcohol. Specifically it focussed on discovering whether alcohol related <b>metacognitions</b> have a stronger role in the perseveration of craving for alcohol than more general <b>metacognitions.</b> The results partially predicted the hypotheses. Alcohol related <b>metacognitions</b> are better predictors of craving in individuals misusing alcohol than general <b>metacognitions.</b> More specifically, negative alcohol related <b>metacognitions</b> relating to the belief that ones thoughts about alcohol are uncontrollable were uniquely associated with craving in individuals misusing alcohol after controlling for other alcohol related negative <b>metacognitions,</b> such as those relating to harm, positive alcohol related <b>metacognitions,</b> and <b>metacognitions</b> in general. Therefore, treating negative alcohol related <b>metacognitions</b> regarding uncontrollability from a metacognitive framework may be a valuable step forward in reducing craving in individuals who misuse alcoho...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Fibromyalgia is {{a chronic}} {{condition}} of unknown aetiology, characterised by widespread pain, sleep disturbances, and fatigue. In this paper {{we examined the}} relationship <b>metacognitions</b> {{and the impact of}} Fibromyalgia in a German sample, detailing the translation and validation of a self-report metacognitive instrument. METHODS: The <b>Metacognitions</b> about Symptoms Control Scale (MaSCS) was translated into German using the back-forward translation process. A total of 348 patients (316 female and 26 male) with Fibromyalgia contributed data to the study to test the structure and psychometric properties of the MaSCS. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses, informed by modification indices, resulted in a 16 -item scale consisting of two factors pertaining to positive and negative <b>metacognitions</b> about symptoms control. Further analyses revealed that both factors had good internal consistency. Correlation analyses established convergent validity, indicating that both factors were significantly associated with: (1) established positive and negative <b>metacognitions</b> scales; and (2) with symptoms severity in Fibromyalgia. Regression analyses revealed that positive <b>metacognitions</b> about symptoms control significantly predicted impairment in physical functioning while negative <b>metacognitions</b> about symptoms control significantly predicted the overall Fibromyalgia impact value, when controlling for stress, anxiety, and depression and a general <b>metacognitions.</b> CONCLUSION: The findings support the potential relevance of <b>metacognitions,</b> and utility of the German version of MaSCS, in examining the role of <b>metacognitions</b> in Fibromyalgia and other chronic health conditions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Problematic Internet Use (PIU), broadly {{conceptualized}} as {{an inability to}} control one’s use of the Internet leading to negative consequences in daily life, is fast becoming a matter of significant concern in our society, particularly in adolescents. In the present study we aimed to assess a model in which <b>metacognitions</b> and emotion regulation independently predicted PIU. Method: A total of 380 adolescent students from a secondary school in Italy voluntarily participated in the study. Students completed a set of online self-report scales assessing PIU, <b>metacognitions,</b> and emotion regulation. Results: <b>Metacognitions,</b> {{with the exception of}} cognitive self-consciousness, were positively correlated with PIU. Moreover, emotion regulation negatively correlated with PIU. The model tested indicated that both <b>metacognitions</b> and emotion regulation had direct effects (positive and negative respectively) on PIU and that the relationship between <b>metacognitions</b> and emotion regulation was not significant. Conclusions: Both <b>metacognitions</b> and emotion regulation appear to be relevant to PIU among adolescents. We discuss the implications of these findings. ...|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{research}} has implicated <b>metacognitions</b> and attentional control in procrastination and self-regulatory failure. This study tested several hypotheses: (1) that <b>metacognitions</b> would be {{positively correlated with}} decisional procrastination; (2) that attentional control would be negatively correlated with decisional procrastination; (3) that <b>metacognitions</b> would be negatively correlated with attentional control; and (4) that <b>metacognitions</b> and attentional control would predict decisional procrastination when controlling for negative affect. One hundred and twenty-nine participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21, the Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire 30, the Attentional Control Scale, and the Decisional Procrastination Scale. Significant relationships were found between all three attentional control factors (focusing, shifting, and flexible control of thought) and two <b>metacognitions</b> factors (negative beliefs concerning thoughts about uncontrollability and danger, and cognitive confidence). Results also revealed that decisional procrastination {{was significantly associated with}} negative affect, all measured <b>metacognitions</b> factors, and all attentional control factors. In the final step of a hierarchical regression analysis only stress, cognitive confidence, and attention shifting were independent predictors of decisional procrastination. Overall these findings support the hypotheses and are consistent with the Self-Regulatory Executive Function model of psychological dysfunction. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Parental overprotection {{may have}} a direct effect on worry through {{hindering}} children's exploration experiences and preventing the learning of action-oriented coping strategies (Cheron, Ehrenreich and Pincus, 2009; Nolen-Hoeksema, Wolfson, Mumme and Guskin, 1995) and an indirect effect through fostering the development of maladaptive <b>metacognitions</b> {{that are associated with}} the activation of worry and the escalation of anxiety (Wells, 2000). Aim: The aim was to investigate the relative contribution of recalled parental overprotection in childhood and <b>metacognitions</b> in predicting current levels of worry. Method: A community sample (n = 301) was administered four self-report instruments to assess parental overprotection, <b>metacognitions,</b> anxiety and worry. Results: <b>Metacognitions</b> were found to predict levels of worry independently of gender, anxiety and parental overprotection. They were also found to predict anxiety independently of gender, worry and parental overprotection. Conclusions: The combination of a family environment perceived to be characterized by overprotection and high levels of maladaptive <b>metacognitions</b> are a risk factor for the development of worry...|$|R

25|$|A third gain in {{cognitive}} ability involves thinking about thinking itself, a process {{referred to as}} <b>metacognition.</b> It often involves monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process. Adolescents' improvements in knowledge of their own thinking patterns lead to better self-control and more effective studying. It is also relevant in social cognition, resulting in increased introspection, self-consciousness, and intellectualization (in the sense of thought about one's own thoughts, rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism). Adolescents are much better able than children to understand that {{people do not have}} complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism, which results in two distinct problems in thinking: the imaginary audience and the personal fable. These likely peak at age fifteen, along with self-consciousness in general.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aims of {{the study}} were to compare {{patients}} with eating disorders to healthy controls on a self-report measure of <b>metacognitions,</b> and to investigate the relationship between <b>metacognitions</b> and eating disorder pathology in the clinical group. Method: Female patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN) or Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) (N = 48) completed the <b>Metacognitions</b> Questionnaire – 30 and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire 6. 0. The control group consisted of university females completing the MCQ- 30 (N = 244). Results: A two-tailed independent samples t-test showed the group with eating disorders scored significantly higher on dysfunctional <b>metacognitions</b> than the healthy controls, with especially large differences on the metacognitive subfactors “positive beliefs about worry”, “beliefs about uncontrollability of thought and danger”, and “need for control thoughts”. The level of eating disorder pathology was positively correlated with level of dysfunctional <b>metacognitions</b> for the clinical group as shown by a Pearson’s product moment correlations. A hierarchical regression analysis showed “need for control thoughts” as the only metacognitive subfactor significantly predicting unique variance in eating disorder symptoms. Conclusion: Metacognitive beliefs are central in understanding eating disorders, and metacognitive treatment strategies could be a promising new approach. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this study, our {{principal}} {{aim was to}} investigate whether <b>metacognitions</b> about desire thinking predict the severity of binge eating in women and, if so, whether this relationship is independent of age, self-reported body mass index (BMI), negative affect, irrational food beliefs and craving. One hundred and four women, consisting of 32 consecutive patients with binge eating disorder undergoing initial assessment for cognitive therapy for eating disorders, 39 moderate binge eaters, and 33 non-binge eaters (both from the general population), completed the following measures: Self-reported BMI, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Irrational Food Beliefs Scale, General Craving Scale, <b>Metacognitions</b> about Desire Thinking Questionnaire, and Binge Eating Scale. A series of Spearman's rho correlation analyses revealed that self-reported BMI, anxiety, depression, irrational food beliefs, craving, and all three factors of the <b>metacognitions</b> about desire thinking questionnaire {{were significantly associated with}} the severity of binge eating. A stepwise regression analysis identified self-reported BMI, craving, and negative <b>metacognitions</b> about desire thinking as significant predictors of the severity of binge eating. These results, taken together, highlight the possible role of <b>metacognitions</b> about desire thinking in predicting the severity of binge eating. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Some {{effects may}} include a general {{alteration}} of conscious perception, euphoria, feelings of well-being, relaxation or stress reduction, increased {{appreciation of the}} arts, including humor and music (especially discerning its various components/instruments), joviality, <b>metacognition</b> and introspection, enhanced recollection (episodic memory), increased sensuality, increased awareness of sensation, increased libido, and creativity. Abstract or philosophical thinking, disruption of linear memory and paranoia or anxiety are also typical. Anxiety is the most commonly reported side effect of smoking marijuana. Between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis, however, some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time. Inexperience and use in an unfamiliar environment are major contributing factors to this anxiety. Cannabidiol (CBD), another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts, {{has been shown to}} ameliorate the adverse effects of THC, including anxiety, that some consumers experience.|$|E
25|$|Involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM) {{retrieval}} occurs spontaneously as {{the result}} of sensory cues as well as internal cues, such as thought or intention. These cues influence us in our day-to-day lives by constantly and automatically activating unconscious memories through priming. It has been demonstrated in many studies that our specific goals and intentions will most frequently result in the retrieval of related IAM, while the second most frequent IAM retrievals result from physical cues in the surrounding context. Autobiographical memories that are unrelated to any specific cues, whether internal or external, are the least frequent to occur. It has been suggested that in this case, an error in self-regulation of memory has occurred that results in an unrelated autobiographical memory reaching the conscious mind. These findings are consistent with <b>metacognition</b> as the third type of experience is often identified as the most salient one.|$|E

40|$|Dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs (“metacognitions”) and {{executive}} control are {{important factors in}} mental disorders such as depression and anxiety, but {{the relationship between these}} concepts has not been studied systematically. We examined whether there is an association between <b>metacognitions</b> {{and executive}} control and hypothesized that decreased executive control statistically predicts increased levels of <b>metacognitions.</b> Two hundred and ninety-nine individuals recruited from the general population and outpatient psychiatric clinics completed the <b>Metacognitions</b> Questionnaire- 30 and three subtests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery corresponding to the three-component model of executive functions. Controlling for current depression and anxiety symptoms, decreased ability to shift between mental sets was associated with increased negative beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry and beliefs about the need to control thoughts. The results suggest a basic association between <b>metacognitions</b> and executive control. Individual differences in executive control could prove important in the personalization of metacognitive therapy...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{has been}} {{described}} as a state of cognitive efficiency and intrinsic enjoyment, whereby a person feels at one with the activity. The existence of an autotelic personality’, an inter-individual difference dimension characterised by the propensity with which a person experiences flow, has been proposed, but the construct has proven to be relatively elusive. The overall aim of this PhD dissertation was to advance flow theory, and in particular enhance the knowledge of individual differences in flow experiences by the investigation of a new construct, flow <b>metacognitions.</b> Flow <b>metacognitions</b> were defined as people’s metacognitive knowledge and beliefs on flow as a state of optimal cognitive functioning. Building upon the concepts of adaptive and maladaptive <b>metacognitions</b> (Beer & Moneta, 2010; Wells, 2000) that were found to impact self-regulation efforts during demanding situations, it was postulated that people would also hold <b>metacognitions</b> on flow, a cognitive state of deep absorption usually elicited by a demanding activity. However, to date, flow <b>metacognitions</b> had not been defined, measured, or tested for their relevance in the context of flow experiences (or in other contexts of optimal experience). This dissertation presents four studies that were conducted to identify flow <b>metacognitions,</b> comprising the development and validation of a self-report questionnaire to measure them validly and reliably, as well as the examination of the scientific relevance of the operationalised constructs. Preliminary instances of potential flow <b>metacognitions</b> were identified in qualitative analyses, whereby the qualitative content of Flow Questionnaires (FQ, Csikszentmihalyi & Csikszentmihalyi, 1988) administered to a sample of 371 workers was analysed. In addition, semi-structured interviews with 12 workers were held about their experiences of flow in work (Study 1, Chapter 2). From these analyses, two broad <b>metacognitions</b> emerged: people’s beliefs in the ‘usefulness’ of being in flow, and individual differences in their beliefs and confidence in the self-regulation of flow experiences. Based on the metacognitive constructs identified in the qualitative analyses, a 53 -item pilot Flow <b>Metacognitions</b> Questionnaire (FMQ) was developed and tested on a sample of 204 UK students. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a two-component solution, with item reduction procedures leading to a 12 -item scale. Subsequent principal component analysis on the same sample confirmed that the 12 items loaded onto two main components: Beliefs that Flow Fosters Achievement (FMQ- 1) and Confidence in Ability to Self-Regulate Flow (FMQ- 2). The subscales explained a total of 52. 4...|$|R
40|$|Problem-solving <b>metacognitions,</b> {{including}} {{responsibility to}} continue {{to think about a}} problem and a low confidence in problem-solving, have been hypothesized to be associated with pathological worry; however, these metacognitive variables have received surprisingly little attention in the research literature. As a result, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the psychometric properties of the Problem-Solving Related <b>Metacognitions</b> Questionnaire (PSRMCQ), translated to English from Japanese. A sample of 241 non-referred college students completed the PSRMCQ, along with a measure of worry symptoms and a measure of other commonly examined <b>metacognitions.</b> The PSRMCQ measure was found to exhibit strong internal consistency. Further, the PSRMCQ was found to be associated with worry symptoms. Adequate incremental validity was also found, as the PSRMCQ was found to predict worry symptoms after controlling for other commonly examined metacognitive variables. Overall, these findings provide support for the association of the problem-solving <b>metacognitions</b> and worry, and the findings have the potential to inform cognitive treatments for pathological worry and generalized anxiety disorder...|$|R

Both monitoring and control processes occur in acquisition, retention, and retrieval. Examples of control processes are allocating study time and selecting search strategies, and examples of monitoring processes are ease-of-learning (EOL) judgments and FOK judgments.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Both {{positive}} smoking outcome expectancies and <b>metacognitions</b> about smoking {{have been}} found to be positively associated with cigarette use and nicotine dependence. The goal of this study was to test a model including nicotine dependence and number of daily cigarettes as dependent variables, anxiety and depression as independent variables, and smoking outcome expectancies and <b>metacognitions</b> about smoking as mediators between the independents and dependents. METHODS: The sample consisted of 524 self-declared smokers who scored 3 or above on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND: Uysal et al., 2004). RESULTS: Anxiety was not associated with either cigarette use or nicotine dependence but was positively associated with all mediators with the exception of stimulation state enhancement and social facilitation. Depression, on the other hand, was found to be positively associated with nicotine dependence (and very weakly to cigarette use) but was not associated with either smoking outcome expectancies or <b>metacognitions</b> about smoking. Only one smoking outcome expectancy (negative affect reduction) was found to be positively associated with nicotine dependence but not cigarette use. Furthermore one smoking outcome expectancy (negative social impression) was found to be positively associated with cigarette use (but not to nicotine dependence). All <b>metacognitions</b> about smoking were found to be positively associated with nicotine dependence. Moreover, negative <b>metacognitions</b> about uncontrollability were found to be positively associated with cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Metacognitions</b> about smoking appear to be a stronger mediator than smoking outcome expectancies in the relationship between negative affect and cigarette use/nicotine dependence. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Metacognitions</b> {{concerning}} worrying {{and cognitive}} avoidance are important psychopathological constructs, conceptualized {{within the scope}} of worrying and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Both constructs are considered crucial for the development and/or maintenance of persistent recurring and intrusive thoughts across the lifespan. Unfortunately, adequate instruments for the assessment of <b>metacognitions</b> in children and cognitive avoidance in adults in German are missing. Also, research is needed further evaluating both constructs across the lifespan for a better understanding of their role in exacerbating pathological worrying and other symptoms of GAD. Aims: The aim of the two presented studies was to evaluate the factor structure and psychometric properties of the newly developed German <b>Metacognitions</b> Questionnaire for children (MKF-K, study one) and the translated German Cognitive Avoidance Questionnaire (CAQ-D, study two) for adults. Further, the objective was to evaluate the relevance of both constructs for pathological worrying and other psychopathologically relevant conditions. Methods: The factor structure of both instruments was examined using explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses. Construct validity was assessed by correlation coefficients with related constructs and hierarchical regression analyses predicting worry and anxiety in a children’s sample (study one) and positive and negative <b>metacognitions,</b> as well as worry and depressive symptoms in an adult sample (study two). In addition to psychometric analyses, age effects of <b>metacognitions</b> and the transdiagnostic value of cognitive avoidance were considered. Results: The fit indices of the factor structure of both measures indicate moderate to good model fits. Results confirm good psychometric properties in general. Both constructs contributed significantly to the prediction of worrying and anxiety independent of the developmental status (study one), and negative <b>metacognitions,</b> worrying, and depressive symptoms (study two), even after controlling for demographic variables and related constructs. Discussion: The German MKF-K serves as reliable and valid instruments for the assessment of different metacognitive believes in childhood and the CAQ-D for cognitive avoidance strategies in adulthood. <b>Metacognitions</b> and cognitive avoidance are relevant constructs to at least two highly relevant psychopathological conditions (anxiety and depression) across the lifespan. The studies provide further support for the validity of both constructs for persistent recurring and intrusive thoughts. Furthermore, <b>metacognitions</b> and cognitive avoidance are important transdiagnostic risk factors across the lifespan and likely contribute substantially to the exacerbation of anxiety in GAD...|$|R

Results: Correlation analyses were used to identify potential mediators of the relationship between gender identity and anxiety. A mediation model indicated that beliefs about thoughts concerning uncontrollability and danger entirely mediated the relationship between gender identity and anxiety (b= 2. 00, BCa CI [0. 68, 3. 49]).

40|$|<b>Metacognitions</b> play {{a crucial}} role in the {{development}} and maintenance of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Its function in anorexia nervosa (AN), however, has been neglected. Examining the role of <b>metacognitions</b> in AN may prove useful for developing the AN conceptualization currently lacking. Additionally, it may provide a desperately needed new route for AN treatment, as no efficacious treatment for adult AN is available to date. This study aimed to build on preliminary findings suggesting that individuals with AN are characterized by the cognitive attentional syndrome (CAS), the vital component in the Self-regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model underlying metacognitive processes. Hence, quantitative and qualitative measures of individuals with AN, dieting, and non-dieting adult women were examined to ascertain whether these groups embodied differences in their metacognitive frequency and nature. ANOVA, bivariate correlation, and ANCOVA were used for data analysis. Findings showed that the AN sample experienced higher overall metacognitions; particularly negative <b>metacognitions</b> and <b>metacognitions</b> around control. When anxiety and depression were controlled for, however, the association became non-significant. Nonetheless, anxious and depressive symptoms are greatly intertwined with eating symptoms and increased <b>metacognitions</b> in the AN sample are still highly plausible. Metacognitive themes endorsed by the AN sample were around sociability and control. Thought control strategies were found to be the same in all groups; however, the AN sample endorsed a higher utilization of punishment and a lower utilization of distraction. Several limitations including small AN sample size and no psychiatric control group should be taken into account. Overall, however, findings suggested that, because the AN sample was characteristic of the CAS and the S-REF model, dysfunctional <b>metacognitions</b> may be worth targeting in AN treatment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} validation of the Flow <b>Metacognitions</b> Questionnaire (FMQ) for measuring <b>metacognitions</b> of flow. Flow {{is a state of}} deep cognitive absorption that makes a person feel fully immersed in an activity. Flow <b>metacognitions</b> had been defined as people’s awareness of and beliefs on the flow state, its consequences, and strategies for achieving and maintaining flow (Wilson & Moneta, 2012). Exploratory factor analysis of the pilot FMQ yielded a two-component solution, based on a sample of 204 UK university students. The two FMQ sub-scales were labelled ‘Beliefs that Flow Fosters Achievement’ (FMQ- 1) and ‘Confidence in Ability to Self-Regulate Flow’ (FMQ- 2). Confirmatory factor analysis on a convenience sample of 159 international workers confirmed the two sub-scales of the final 12 -item FMQ. The FMQ’s predictive validity was supported in a series of hierarchical regression analyses. Confidence in Ability to Self-Regulate Flow predicted the intensity of flow in work better than measures of maladaptive and adaptive <b>metacognitions.</b> It also predicted the frequency and percentage of time spent in flow in work above and beyond established measures of flow, highlighting the usefulness of the FMQ as a research tool...|$|R

A secondary aim of the study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the recently developed <b>Metacognitions</b> Questionnaire for Children (MCQ-C). The sample consisted of 83 children (60. 2 % female; Oceanian 71. 1 %), comprising 49 children with anxiety disorders and 34 nonclinical children. All children completed self-report measures of anxiety, emotional difficulties, and <b>metacognitions.</b> A subsample of 7 - to 8 -year-old participants was used to explore whether young children could wholly comprehend all items on the MCQ-C. Positive and negative metacognitive beliefs and cognitive monitoring were significantly correlated with anxiety and emotional difficulties. Clinical children endorsed significantly more negative and more positive metacognitive beliefs than nonclinical children. Each subscale of the MCQ-C had poor internal consistency. Support for the criterion and convergent validity of the MCQ-C was found. The results suggest that certain <b>metacognitions</b> play a role in clinical anxiety in children but that psychometrically and developmentally validated measures of these concepts in younger individuals are needed. 13 page(s...|$|R
