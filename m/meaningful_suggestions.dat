40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the Japanese context of {{evaluation}} in citizenship education, we {{will focus on the}} thoughts of four educational researchers at the post WW 2 Japan: Shuichi Katsuta, Toshio Nakauchi, Kaoru Ueda, and Minoru Murai. Section 1 will argue the potentiality and limitation of educational theory of ability, achievement, and assessment in Katsuta’s and Nakauchi’s thought. Their arguments aimed at a criticism against meritocracy, and at this point their argument would be a <b>meaningful</b> <b>suggestion</b> even for our age. There is, however, the limitation of their theory and we will refer to a criticism against their argument after 1980 s. Section 2 will refer to Kaoru Ueda’s thought on evaluation. For Ueda, evaluation in education is a start point of teaching. He puts importance on the individual. Ueda says that if you cannot conceive the differences [Zure], students’ changes appeared after teaching, you are not apt at teaching students any more. However, it needs very highquality teachers, {{and it would be a}} weak point of his thought. Section 3 will introduce Minoru Murai’s theory on evaluation in education. What is an educational problem for Murai? It is goodness. For Murai education is making individuals better. Therefore we should or need to ask what education is for. By this approach, educational bad condition would be reconstructed and get better. At this point, Murai’s thought resembles Biesta’s arguments. 【 2014 年度若手研究者育成プロジェクト（Young Scholars Training Program）Joint International Symposium with Stockholm University “Education in the Era of Globalization”】プロジェクト採択者ワーキングペーパー（高度化センターHP に掲載のものを再掲...|$|R

40|$|How {{political}} opinions are spread {{on social media}} {{has been the subject}} of many academic researches recently, and rightly so. Social platforms give researchers a unique opportunity to understand how public discourses are perceived, owned and instrumentalized by the general public. This paper is instead focussing on the political discourses themselves, and how a specific machine learning technique - vector space models (VSMs) -, can be used to make systematic and more objective discourse analysis. Political footprints are vector-based representation of a political discourse in which each vector represents a word, they are produced thanks to the training of the English lexicon on large corpora of text. This paper describes a simple implementation of political footprints, some heuristics on how to use them, and their application to four cases: the U. N.

40|$|Query {{suggestion}} {{plays an}} important role in improving the usability of search engines. Although some recently pro-posed methods can make <b>meaningful</b> query <b>suggestions</b> by mining query patterns from search logs, none of them are context-aware – they do not take into account the immedi-ately preceding queries as context in query suggestion. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware query sugges-tion approach which is in two steps. In the offline model-learning step, to address data sparseness, queries are sum-marized into concepts by clustering a click-through bipar-tite. Then, from session data a concept sequence suffix tree is constructed as the query suggestion model. In the online query suggestion step, a user’s search context is captured by mapping the query sequence submitted by the user to a sequence of concepts. By looking up the context in the con-cept sequence suffix tree, our approach suggests queries to the user in a context-aware manner. We test our approach on a large-scale search log of a commercial search engine containing 1. 8 billion search queries, 2. 6 billion clicks, and 840 million query sessions.

This method comes with the ?cold start? problem, such that a system does not have enough data on a new user to generate <b>meaningful</b> <b>suggestions.</b> A solution to this problem is a content-based method, utilizing the structure and features of the music itself to determine similar songs rather than user-based data. By using audio analysis tools and performing wavelet analy- sis on songs to extract relevant acoustic features (chord progression), we will define a new measure of similarity between songs. We show that using similarity of chord structure as a basis for content-based music recommendation is a quality metric that can be introduced into existing music recommendation applications...|$|E

40|$|Autocompletion is a {{commonly}} used interface feature in diverse applications. Semantic Web data has, {{on the one}} hand, the potential to provide new functionality by exploiting the semantics in the data used for generating autocompletion suggestions. Semantic Web applications, on the other hand, typically pose extra requirements on the semantic properties of the suggestions given. When the number of syntactic matches becomes too large, some means of selecting a semantically <b>meaningful</b> subset of <b>suggestions</b> to {{be presented to the}} user is needed. In this paper we identify a number of key design dimensions of autocompletion interface components. Our hypothesis is that a one-size-fits-all solution to autocompletion interface components does not exist, because different tasks and different data sets require interfaces corresponding to different points in our design space. We present a fully configurable architecture, which can be used to configure autocompletion components to the desired point in this design space. The architecture has been implemented as an open source software component that can be plugged into a variety of applications. We report on the results of a user evaluation that confirms this hypothesis, and describe the need to evaluate semantic autocompletion in a task and application-specific context...|$|R

He finds out that generally, jobs are located in suburban areas whereas low-income housing, where most poor residents stay, is always located in the inner core of the city. The transport costs are also a deterrent for the poor. He writes that the redistribution of real income has technological fixes, but in the long term one will have to engage with political processes to avert “moving towards a state of greater inequality and greater injustice (94).” ...|$|R

40|$|In {{parallel}} with the rise to prominence of the OO paradigm has come the acceptance that conventional software metrics are not adequate to measure objectoriented systems.

40|$|Cracks in ships {{have been}} of great concern to the {{maritime}} industry {{for a very long}} time. The problem is controlled by improving design, minimizing operating stresses and through regular inspections and repairs. The big trade-off which designers and owners have to face in {{the construction of a new}} ship is whether to invest in a fatigue resistant design, or to keep the construction cost low and incur the repair costs as cracks emerge later in the ship's life. This choice has to be made for hundreds of components throughout the ship's hull. A procedure was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of fatigue design improvements in ships. It is based on comparing the additional cost of a proposed design (over the current design) with the present value of all the projected crack repair costs of the corresponding location. The present value of the repair costs has to be determined for the various locations in order to serve as a guideline when evaluating new fatigue resistant designs that promise to reduce the number of cracks and future repair costs. A general model was developed and then several assumptions were made to give a simplified version. The assumptions and limitations of the model are discussed as well as the ways in which it should be used to address various problems and produce <b>meaningful</b> results. <b>Suggestions</b> are also made for avoiding problems in each stage. A large database of cracks is required to run the model and a location coding system in order to process and analyze it [...] (cont.) The difficulties of collecting and processing the data are discussed as well as potential adjustments that have to be made to accommodate irregularities among ships and ship compartments. A literature review was carried out of the various statistical surveys that have been conducted over the past 50 years relating to cracks and damages in ships. Differences in the results of surveys regarding the distribution of cracks lead to the conclusion that cracks follow different patterns than other damages and that the various kinds of ships exhibit different cracking behaviors. This emphasizes the importance of using a large data sample that is specific to a particular type of damage and ship type and size range when applying this proposed model and procedure. by Nicholas Hadjiyiannis.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} in the caregiving literature that caregivers do not utilize services that may aid {{in their ability to}} provide care and help maintain their own well-being. There have been several barriers identified that may deter caregivers from seeking services, especially in rural areas. However, there is less known about how caregivers work to overcome those barriers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to increase understanding about how rural caregivers overcome barriers to service utilization. The research was designed to be exploratory, rather than of a confirmatory nature. It is hoped that having rural caregivers identify ways to overcome the barriers themselves will ultimately be more <b>meaningful</b> as their <b>suggestions</b> might then be used to change how services market and deliver services to rural caregivers. This study was a qualitative investigation of what rural caregivers identify as barriers to seeking services and how to overcome those barriers. Eight rural caregivers were interviewed over the phone. Through the interview process, caregivers identified barriers and shared their personal experiences of how to overcome barriers or offered suggestion about how others may overcome barriers. Grounded theory (Strauss 2 ̆ 6 Corbin, 1998; Corbin 2 ̆ 6 Strauss, 2008) was used to analyze the qualitative data. The core phenomenon of this study, often referred to as a storyline, revolved around the concept of caregivers not seeing a need for services. Caregivers 2 ̆ 7 cultural beliefs of staying independent and taking care of others because it is their familial responsibility were prevalent throughout the interviews. The findings from this study ultimately illustrate how caregivers do not seek services because they do not see a need to or chose not to need services. Although barriers to service utilization have previously been identified in the caregiving literature, the greatest barrier for each of the caregivers in this study was their inability to see a need for help or services. This emerged as a higher-order barrier. Although caregivers were able to offer suggestions to overcome some of the other barriers, none were able to offer suggestions on how to help caregivers perceive a need as they themselves had attitudes and/or beliefs that contributed to their not believing they needed services. Awareness of this higher-order barrier or core belief may translate into agencies and services changing the way they market to rural caregivers...|$|R

Based on studies and sample surveys conducted, the Government has the pivot role of framing health policies and programmes specific to the requirement of each country. However, over the years the health sector has witnessed a demand supply mismatch attributed to a couple of factors. The private sector has served as a catalyst to deliver these services to the people by ways of greater efficiency, better management skills and focused strategies and stronger resource base whether in terms of monetary resources or human resources. This paper aims to give an overview of the evolution of the Public Private Partnership. At the Global Level, it discusses the examples of popular Public Private Partnerships especially in Asian and African states and evaluates its success. Coming down to the National Level, it gives a summary of the existing PPP models in India and further takes up a detailed study of the Chiranjeevi Yojana Scheme in Gujarat. The positives and negatives of the scheme are highlighted. Finally the challenges of PPP in the health sector are assessed putting forth some <b>meaningful</b> <b>suggestions...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper unveils {{the strong}} {{competition}} in container cargo between Hong Kong Port {{which has been}} emerging as an international maritime center since the 1970 s and Shenzhen Port which has recently gained remarkable achievements in the Pearl River Delta region. Among various competing strategies, the study focuses on the long-term one in which two ports will decide to compete by investing in capacity. The purpose {{of this research is}} to examine their decision making process and to suggest future strategic actions in the current situation. Within its scope, only economic profit brought back from the investment is considered. For this reason, an uncertain payoff two-person game model is developed where an uncertain factor of demand is involved. In applying Uncertainty theory (Liu, 2013), the two methods to solve the game are introduced, including uncertain statistics and the expected Nash Equilibrium strategy. The results obtained from this research generate <b>meaningful</b> <b>suggestions</b> for future competition plan for the two selected ports, which conclude that Shenzhen is the dominant port in this long-term strategy. Compared to existing works on the same topic, the paper shows its distinctiveness by studying the latest competitive situation with regard to the uncertain demand in the game model...|$|E
