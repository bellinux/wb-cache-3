According to Leto, these artists were commercially viable but also respected for their statements and contributions.

40|$|I {{was born}} in Tasmania, Australia’s island state, and that {{geographical}} reality is the primary feature of my art work and my dyeing. Although I have also {{lived and worked in}} Britain, and in Africa, the natural world around me has colored my aesthetic sense. Dye research and conference participation, and dye workshops I have taught and attended in Canada, the USA, Japan, India, and elsewhere, have helped me integrate my artistic ideas with the ecology of the natural environment which sustains the organisms I use for dyeing. That environment also sustains and supports me, as a fiber artist, physically, emotionally, and intellectually. Long fascinated with the African mud cloth, Bogolan Fini, this paper discusses how I have adapted the mud and soil of Australia to create <b>my</b> <b>own</b> fiber paints. Professionally trained as a graphic designer, I re-discovered my passion for paints and pigments, and for fiber, after attending a workshop taught by a Canadian dyer who came to Australia. Her innovative techniques made me realize I could re-invent <b>my</b> <b>own</b> approach to color. In the process, I rediscovered <b>my</b> <b>own</b> artistic <b>voice.</b> Mud colors are bold. They reflect climate and geography and they also demonstrate the impact of color on how we see ourselves as artists, and how others see the colors we create and respond to the art work accordingly. This paper is about the adventure that is my daily life: making color that mirrors the pristine region of the world where I live and work. This work ties me to centuries of women who also made color. Their story is also mine...|$|R

My goal is to make a lasting legacy as a gift to try to make the world a better place and show its beauty. [ [...] . ] The overall composition of my body of art can be described as a multi-studio artist with a focus on spiritual positive encouraging works. As an older student I have had formal training in Art, history drawing, design, and stain glass sculpting, sculpting glass, and painting glass on glass. For my career here at Pacific University I concentrated my focus on photography. I began seeing beauty in photographing nature in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> backyard beauty in seeing art in the landscapes. It began out of coping with and separate the destruction left on the land by capturing lighter beautiful living subjects. It helped that I had some past photographic relationships on the land where I live. Photographing wilderness landscapes and portraits were something entirely new to me. So I studied the subject and my mentors shared their knowledge. I was willing to learn from making mistakes in once-in-a-lifetime shots.

40|$|The Curious Moaning of Kenfig Burrows (2017) {{consists}} of photography, moving image and a 3500 word text, {{inspired by the}} life and work of the Victorian photographer Thereza Dillwyn Llewelyn. Taking Thereza’s papers, now held in the British Library, as a starting point, the detailed primary research involved in working with this original, handwritten material is corrupted by <b>my</b> <b>own</b> subjective <b>voice,</b> as I insert <b>my</b> <b>own</b> associations and memories into the context of Thereza’s ‘original’. Moving between different geographical locations, points in time, and subjective positions, the text operates both {{as a source of}} information about Thereza and her life as well as a distraction away from it; tangents, interruptions and other forms of aside function as a conceptual device through which a distracted and restless, yet pre-eminently embodied self constructs a non-chronological version of events much of its own making. Visually, the project combines photographs taken by me at locations associated with Thereza’s life with film stills also made on location, and images sourced from internet searches; photographic representation oscillating between abstraction, pictorialism and illustrative literalism. The Curious Moaning of Kenfig Burrows explores the relationship between landscape and photography, particularly the mobilization of each as an aesthetic resource as well a physical one, and the various cultural, political and practical uses to which they can be put. Focusing on a moment in the history of photography, both as a technical process, but also as a visual language, the project explores and expands the dialogue between individuals, institutions and other canonical orthodoxies that are asserted in contemporary life, and normalized through notions of custodianship, conservation and care...|$|R

Written in 2004 during my first year as an undergraduate music student, it pulled my musical knowledge from before college and combined it with my new heightened passion and higher understanding of music to create a piece that would become a jumping off point for my compositional style as an undergraduate student. The piece itself was composed with the memory of family road trips ingrained in my head from my childhood. This piece is meant to evoke the type of introspective thoughts that would go through my head while peering out through the car window at the countryside passing by while driving on the interstate.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to facilitate the voices being heard of two young people at secondary school bearing an autistic spectrum diagnosis using a narrative approach. By definition this diagnosis suggested impaired communication and social interaction skills that should have made the open questioning style recommended for narrative interviewing difficult to access. However, insightful descriptions generated by autistic 'insiders', <b>my</b> <b>own</b> professional encounters and my experience as a mother of a child with a diagnosis inclined me towards more optimistic constructions of the autistic spectrum. Adopting a psychosocial, constructionist approach, I hoped to use narratives to illustrate the complexity of social constructs like the autistic spectrum and to facilitate the potential for agency: emancipation from thin, 'problem saturated' discourses. I was keen to coconstruct thicker narratives as a form of action research that might generate 'unique outcomes' for my subjects as co-researchers. I used free-association narrative interviewing to facilitate the coconstruction of narratives with the two young people. I hoped to explore meanings the experience of their diagnosis might generate for these young people against the context of a range of other narratives being told around them. I reflected upon and analysed each narrative to identify wider discourses, interpretative repertoires and identity scripts that might be interacting with the voices of the two young people. I realised that <b>my</b> <b>own</b> powerful <b>voice</b> as adult co-researcher also required interrogation. The 'storying' of their experiences suggested to me there was potential for agency for these young people. Externalising autism as a functional repertoire could position it as a strength within their experience. However, I sensed competition between complex, powerful and inter-woven narratives. Some, like the discourse of normalcy, introduced ambiguous meanings. I concluded that meaning-making through language was interactive and inevitably subjective, but could also be unique, generative and optimistic...|$|R
50|$|GD: The {{original}} Greek Anthology {{is made up}} {{of sixteen}} books of short poems attributed to many different authors, ranging from the seventh century BC to the tenth century AD. The poems are amatory, religious, dedicatory, humorous, sepulchral, hortatory, declamatory, and satirical. <b>My</b> <b>own</b> book, The Greek Anthology, Book XVII adds a modern fictional book to the original sixteen and is similar in its range of tone and variety of subject matter. The poets of this book are fictional creations based often on myself. All the poems were written out of myself, my preoccupations over ten years or so—later, where possible, I put the names of other poets, family, friends and acquaintances—for fun, for a laugh really. My poems are for all those who are close to me and for whom poetry is important. You will recognize among these imaginary authors variants on the names of well known poets of our day such as Heanius who dedicated a poem in his own most recent book, Human Chain, to one Gregory of Corkus another poet in The Greek Anthology, Book XVII. These poets and poems give a sense of having already existed in another tradition and another language, a kind of parallel universe of our past and present and future. It may also have allowed me to talk about things or approach thingsthat would have been more difficult or impossible in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> direct <b>voice,</b> say like the political poem ‘New Ostia’, or the erotic love poems.
