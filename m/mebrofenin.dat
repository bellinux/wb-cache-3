50|$|<b>Mebrofenin</b> is a chelate {{composed}} of two molecules of an iminodiacetic acid that is a lidocaine analogue, attached to a technetium-99m ion.

Patients fasting for the normal requirement of 4 hours and have normal gallbladder function, the gallbladder is usually visualized within 60 minutes. If the gallbladder is not visualized in 60 minutes, the study can continue for up to 4 hours. To shorten the study, morphine sulfate (MS) can be injected into the patient to increase uptake of 99mTc <b>mebrofenin</b> into the gallbladder. If after 30 minutes of MS administration, the gallbladder is still not visualized, acute cholecystitis can be assumed with greater than 93% specificity.|$|E
50|$|The two useful {{parameters}} {{gathered from}} hepatic uptake of 99mTc <b>mebrofenin,</b> {{to aid in}} determining severity of liver disease, is the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) and excretion half-life. HEF is calculated by initial hepatocyte uptake divided by peak vascular uptake. HEF is 100% in normal individuals, in most patients remains close to 100% with partial common bile duct obstruction and in patients with sclerosing cholangitis, but is severely decreased in patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis. Excretion half-life directly correlates with the degree of liver abnormality and can be a predictor of cirrhotic stage.|$|E

Quantification of biliary excretion in healthy human volunteers is logistically challenging and is rarely defined during drug development. The current study uses a novel oroenteric tube coupled with a specialized clinical protocol to examine the pharmacokinetics of 99 mTechnetium (Tc- 99 m) <b>mebrofenin,</b> a compound that undergoes rapid hepatic uptake and extensive biliary excretion. A custommade multilumen oroenteric tube was positioned in the duodenum of healthy human volunteers. Subjects were positioned under a gamma camera and 2. 5 mCi of Tc- 99 m <b>mebrofenin</b> was administered intravenously. Duodenal aspirates, blood samples, and urine were collected periodically for 3 hours. Two hours after Tc- 99 m <b>mebrofenin</b> administration, the gallbladder was contracted with an intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin- 8. Gamma scintigraphy {{was used to determine}} the gallbladder ejection fraction in each subject. Total systemic clearance of Tc- 99 m <b>mebrofenin</b> approximated liver blood flow (Cltotal 17. 3 ± 1. 7 mL/min/kg), and 35 % to 84 % of the Tc- 99 m <b>mebrofenin</b> dose was recovered in bile. However, when the data were corrected for the gallbladder ejection fraction, 71 % to 92 % of theexcreted Tc- 99 m <b>mebrofenin</b> dose was recovered.

However, {{recent studies have}} reported impaired postoperative recovery of patients with mild steatosis. This study evaluated the recovery of hepatic functional reserve during regeneration in a rat model of mild steatosis and liver resection. Methods: Male Wistar rats had a standard methione- and choline-deficient diet to induce mild steatosis before 70 per cent liver resection. Evaluation of hepatobiliary function was by Tc- 99 m-labelled <b>mebrofenin</b> scintigraphy. <b>Mebrofenin</b> uptake rate, the time for maximum uptake (T peak) and the time required for peak activity to decrease by 50 per cent (T- 1 / 2 peak) were assessed 1, 2, 3 and 7 days after liver resection, along with regeneration of the remnant liver, hepatocellular and sinusoidal damage, and hepatic adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) levels. Results: Liver regeneration and proliferative response in mild steatotic rats were no different from those in controls. However, the <b>mebrofenin</b> uptake rate was lower (P < 0. 050) and the recovery of hepatic ATP impaired (P < 0. 050) in animals with mild steatosis. Hepatocellular damage was increased (P < 0. 050) but sinusoidal endothelial cell function was not affected after liver resection in mildly steatotic rats.

40|$|PURPOSE: The acute porphyrias are a {{group of}} rare {{metabolic}} disorders of the heme biosynthetic pathway. Carriers of the acute porphyria gene are prone to potentially fatal acute attacks, which can be precipitated by drug exposure. It is therefore important to know whether a drug is safe for carriers of the acute porphyria gene. In this study, radiopharmaceuticals were assessed on their porphyrogenicity (ie, the potential of a drug to induce an attack). METHODS: The assessment was conducted by classifying the drugs according to the Thunell model. FINDINGS: From 41 radiopharmaceuticals assessed, I- 131 norcholesterol, Tc- 99 m <b>mebrofenin,</b> Tc- 99 m phytate, Tc- 99 m sestamibi, and Tl- 201 chloride were classified as possibly porphyrogenic. IMPLICATIONS: I- 131 norcholesterol, Tc- 99 m <b>mebrofenin,</b> Tc- 99 m phytate, Tc- 99 m sestamibi, and Tl- 201 chloride should not be prescribed for patients experiencing acute porphyria unless an urgent indication is present and no safer alternative is available.

40|$|Background: Preoperative {{portal vein}} {{embolization}} (PVE) is performed {{in patients with}} insufficient future remnant liver (FRL) to allow safe resection. Althoughmany studies have demonstrated an increase in FRL volume after PVE, {{little is known about}} the increase in FRL function. This study evaluated the increase in FRL function after PVE using (99) mTc-labelled <b>mebrofenin</b> hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and compared this with the increase in FRL volume. Methods: In 24 patients, computed tomography volumetry and (99) mTc-labelled <b>mebrofenin</b> HBS with SPECT were performed before and 3 - 4 weeks after PVE to measure FRL volume, standardized FRL and FRL function. A hypothetical model was used to assess safe resectability after PVE. The limit for safe resection for FRL function was set at an uptake of 2. 69 per cent per min per m(2). For FRL volume and standardized FRL, 25 or 40 per cent of total liver volume was used, depending on the presence of underlying liver disease. Results: After PVE, FRL function increased significantly more than FRL volume. The correlation between the increase in FRL volume and FRL function was poor. Using the hypothetical model, seven patients did not achieve a sufficient increase in FRL function to allow safe resection 3 - 4 weeks after PVE, compared with 12 and nine patients based on FRL volume and standardized FRL respectively. Conclusion: The increase in FRL function after PVE is more pronounced than the increase in FRL volume, suggesting that the necessary waiting time until resection may be shorter than indicated by volumetric parameter...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} {{the utility of}} non-invasive assessment of hepatobiliary function by 99 mTc-mebrofenin cholescintigraphy in a rat model of diet-induced steatosis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (250 - 300 g) were fed a standard methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for up to 5 weeks, thereby inducing hepatic fat accumulation, progressive inflammation and fibrogenesis corresponding with clinical steatosis. 99 mTc-mebrofenin pinhole scintigraphy {{was used to evaluate}} the hepatocyte <b>mebrofenin</b> uptake rate, the time of maximum hepatic uptake (T(peak)) and the time required for peak activity to decrease by 50 % (T(1 / 2 peak)). Scintigraphic parameters were correlated with biochemical and serological parameters and with liver histopathology. RESULTS: MCD diet induced mild steatosis after 1 week and severe steatosis with prominent inflammation after 5 weeks. T(peak), T(1 / 2 peak) prolonged and the uptake rate decreased significantly, while the severity of steatosis increased (p < 0. 05). There was a strong, significant correlation between the severity of steatosis (histopathology, hepatic triglyceride content) and the 99 mTc-mebrofenin uptake rate (r 2 = 0. 83, p < 0. 0001 and r 2 = 0. 82, p < 0. 0001, respectively). In addition, the uptake rate correlated significantly with the increased inflammation (plasma and hepatic TNF-alpha, r 2 = 0. 72, p < 0. 0001 and r 2 = 0. 52, p= 0. 001, respectively). The correlation of the uptake rate with hepatocellular damage was weak (AST and ALT, r 2 = 0. 29 and 0. 32, respectively), but correlation with synthetic function was strong (prothrombin time, r 2 = 0. 70, p < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Hepatobiliary function assessed by 99 mTc-mebrofenin scintigraphy correlates with the extent and progression of steatosis. These results suggest a potential role for <b>mebrofenin</b> scintigraphy as a non-invasive functional follow-up method for disease progression in steatotic patient...|$|E

40|$|With {{hepatobiliary}} scintigraphy and sonography, we prospectively {{studied the}} occurrence of new hepatobiliary abnormalities in 18 patients before, and from 1 to 103 days after, bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Prior to BMT, all patients had normal hepatic uptake and visualization of the gallbladder by 60 min on scintigraphy, and no sludge, stones, or other abnormalities on sonography. After BMT, 16 patients (89 %) developed new scintigraphic and/or sonographic hepatobiliary abnormalities. Fifteen patients had impaired liver uptake of <b>mebrofenin,</b> while 11 developed gallbladder sludge and/or stones, and 10 had gallbladder nonvisualization at 60 min. Nevertheless, no patient developed clinical or laboratory evidence of acute cholecystitis. New hepatobiliary abnormalities are more common during the first months post-BMT than clinically suspected, probably reflecting the combined effects of hepatotoxic chemoradiation therapy, graft-versus-host disease, and prolonged administration of parenteral alimentation.

40|$|Abstract: To {{understand}} the transport function of drugs across the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, {{it would be}} important to measure concentrations in hepatocytes and bile. However, these concentration gradients are rarely provided. The aim of the study is then to measure these concentrations and define parameters to quantify the canalicular transport of drugs through the multiple resistance associated-protein 2 (Mrp 2) in entire rat livers. Besides drug bile excretion rates, we measured additional parameters to better define transport function across Mrp 2 : (1) Concentration gradients between hepatocyte and bile concentrations over time; and (2) a unique parameter (canalicular concentration ratio) that represents the slope of the non-linear regression curve between hepatocyte and bile concentrations. This information was obtained in isolated rat livers perfused with gadobenate dimeglumine (BOPTA) and <b>mebrofenin</b> (MEB), two hepatobiliary drugs used in clinical liver imaging.

METHODS: The total splanchnic blood flow (SBF) and oxygen uptake (SO 2 U) were measured in 20 healthy volunteers (10 women) and 29 patients with suspected chronic intestinal ischemia (15 women), age 40 - 85 years, prior to and after a standard meal. The method {{is based on the}} Fick principle using the continuous infusion of an indicator (99 mTechnetium-labelled <b>mebrofenin)</b> and catheterization of an artery and the hepatic vein.

RESULTS: Angiography revealed no atherosclerotic lesions in the intestinal arteries. The mean baseline SBF was 1087 mL/min (731 - 1390), and this value increased significantly to 1787 mL/min after the meal in healthy volunteers (P < 0. 001). The baseline SBF in patients was 1080 mL/min, which increased to 1718 mL/min postprandially (P < 0. 001). The baseline SBF was independent of age, sex, lean body mass and percentage of body fat.

Between November 2007 and February 2016, 131 patients underwent hepatobiliary scintigraphy after having liver surgery. 39 patients with 42 scans after LTX (n= 13) or hepatic resection (n= 26) were evaluated in the study; 27 were male, with mean age 60 years. The subjects underwent hepatobiliary scintigraphy with Tc- 99 m labeled <b>Mebrofenin.</b> The results were compared to ERCP as gold standard performed within one month after HBS. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. We compared LTX patients to patients with other liver surgeries. Furthermore the influence of hyperbilirubinemia on HBS scans was evaluated. Results. HBS always provided the correct diagnosis in cases of bile leak in the liver-resected group (14 / 14). Overall diagnostic accuracy was 76 % (19 / 25) in this group and 54 % (7 / 13) in the LTX group. False negative (FN) diagnoses occurred more often among LTX patients (p= 0. 011). Hyperbilirubinemia (> 5 mg/dL) significantly influenced the excretion function of the liver, prolonging HBS’s time-activity-curve (p= 0. 001). Conclusions.

40|$|Background. Biliobronchial fistula (BBF) {{is a rare}} {{complication}} in {{the natural}} history of liver hydatid disease by Echinococcus granulosus. We present a case of BBF after resection of a giant liver hydatid cyst in a 72 -year-old woman. Case Report. A total cystpericystectomy was done, leaving the left lateral section of the liver that was fixed to the diaphragm. Postoperatively, the patient developed obstructive jaundice. An ERCP showed an obstruction at the junction of the left biliary duct and the main biliary duct and contrast leak. At reoperation, the main duct was ischemic, likely due to torsion along its longitudinal axis. A hepatotomy was done at the hilar plate, and the biliary duct was dissected and anastomosed to a Roux-en-Y jejunal loop. She was discharged without complications. Five months later, the patient developed cholangitis and was successfully treated with antibiotics. However, she suffered repeated respiratory infections, and four months later she was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, bilioptysis, and right lower lobe pneumonia.

40|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} is a speciality which uses trace amounts of short-lived radionuclides (radiotracers) for diagnosing and treating diseases. The {{majority of its}} clinical applications involve diagnostic imaging. Radionuclides (emitting soft gamma rays) coupled with organ or tissue specific compounds (radiopharmaceuticals) are introduced into the body through an intravenous or oral route; and later the target organ is imaged using a special instrument known as “Gamma camera”. Nuclear {{medicine is}} a functional imaging modality evaluating organ function and metabolism at a cellular level. With the onset of disease, it is the functional derangement which occurs well before structural abnormalities take place. Thus, nuclear medicine, being functional imaging, has the inherent advantage of detecting a disease process well in advance before it is clinically apparent or detected by a test or other anatomical imaging modalities like ultrasonography (USG), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1. Nuclear medicine techniques are generally noninvasive and require little or no preparation. Contrary to belief, nuclear medicine scans give minimal radiation exposure in comparison to commonly performed radiological procedures. Radiopharmaceuticals have no systemic pharmacological effects and do not cause any allergic reactions 2.

40|$|Preoperative {{portal vein}} {{embolization}} (PVE) {{is used to}} increase the future remnant liver (FRL) in patients requiring extensive liver resection. Computed tomography (CT) volumetry, performed not earlier than 3 - 6 weeks after PVE, is commonly employed to assess hypertrophy of the FRL following PVE. Early parameters to predict effective hypertrophy are therefore desirable. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess plasma bile salt levels, triglycerides (TG), and apoA-V in the prediction of the hypertrophy response during liver regeneration. Serum bile salt, TG, and apoA-V levels were determined in 20 patients with colorectal metastases before PVE, and 5 h, 1, and 21 days after PVE, as well as prior to and after (day 1 - 7, and day 21) subsequent liver resection. These parameters were correlated with liver volume as measured by CT volumetry (%FRL-V), and liver function was determined by technetium-labeled <b>mebrofenin</b> hepatobiliary scintigraphy using single photon emission computed tomography. Triglyceride levels at baseline correlate with volume increase of the future remnant liver (FRL-V) post-PVE. Also, bile salts and TG 5 h after PVE positively correlated with the increase in FRL volume (r = 0. 672, p = 0. 024; r = 0. 620, p = 0. 042, resp.) and liver function after 3 weeks (for bile salts r = 0. 640, p = 0. 046). Following liver surgery, TG levels at 5 h and 1 day after resection were associated with liver remnant volume after 3 months (r = 0. 921, p = 0. 026 and r = 0. 981, p = 0. 019, resp). Plasma apoA-V was increased during liver regeneration. Bile salt and TG levels at 5 h after PVE/resection are significant early predictors of liver volume and functional increase.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of omega- 3 FAs on regeneration of steatotic liver. Steatosis was induced in rats by a 3 -week methionine/choline-deficient diet, which was continued for an additional 2 weeks in conjunction with oral administration of omega- 3 FAs or saline solution. Steatosis was graded histologically and quantified by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) before and after the diet/treatment. Liver function was determined by (99 m) Tc-labelled <b>mebrofenin</b> hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS). In separate experiments, the hepatic regenerative capacity and functional recovery of omega- 3 FA-treated, saline-treated or non-steatotic (control) rats were investigated 1, 2, 3 and 5 days after partial (70 per cent) liver resection by measurement of liver weight change and hepatocyte proliferation (Ki- 67) and HBS. Severe steatosis (over 66 per cent) in the saline group was reduced by omega- 3 FAs to mild steatosis (less than 33 per cent), and hepatic fat content as assessed by (1) H-MRS decreased 2 · 2 -fold. (99 m) Tc-mebrofenin uptake in the saline group was more than 50 per cent lower than in the control group, confirming the functional effects of steatosis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a potent FXR agonist (obeticholic acid, OCA) on liver growth following portal vein embolization (PVE). Rabbits were allocated to receive daily oral gavage with OCA (10 [*]mg/kg) or vehicle (control group) starting 7 [*]days before PVE (n[*]=[*] 18 per group), and continued until 7 [*]days after PVE. PVE of the cranial liver lobes was performed using polyvinyl alcohol particles and coils on day 0. Caudal liver volume (CLV) was analysed by CT volumetry on days - 7, - 1, + 3 and + 7. Liver function was determined by measuring <b>mebrofenin</b> uptake using hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Additional parameters analysed were plasma aminotransferase levels, and histological scoring of haematoxylin and eosin- and Ki- 67 -stained liver sections. Three days after PVE of the cranial lobes, the increase in CLV was 2 · 2 -fold greater in the OCA group than in controls (mean(s. d.) 56 · 1 (20 · 3) versus 26 · 1 (15 · 4) per cent respectively; P[*] <[*] 0 · 001). This increase remained greater 7 [*]days after PVE (+ 1 · 5 -fold; P[*]=[*] 0 · 020). The increase in caudal liver function at day + 3 was greater in OCA-treated animals (+ 1 · 2 -fold; P[*]=[*] 0 · 017). The number of Ki- 67 -positive hepatocytes was 1 · 6 -fold higher in OCA-treated animals 3 [*]days after PVE (P[*]=[*] 0 · 045). Plasma aminotransferase levels and histology did not differ significantly between groups. OCA accelerated liver regeneration after PVE in a rabbit model. OCA treatment might increase the efficacy of PVE and, thereby, resectability. Surgical relevance Liver failure is the most feared complication after liver surgery, with no effective treatment options. Liver regeneration is essential to avoid liver failure, and recently bile acid signalling was implicated in the initiation of liver regeneration through the nuclear bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In this study, the potent FXR agonist obeticholic acid accelerated liver regeneration following portal vein embolization in a rabbit model, in terms of liver volume, liver function and proliferation. Obeticholic acid treatment could enhance the efficacy of portal vein embolization, thereby increasing resectability, and could reduce the interval to surgery.
