40|$|The melting {{behaviour}} of calcium monoxide, {{a very common}} geological compound produced whenever lime-based minerals are heated to high temperature in contact with air or CO 2, has been revisited by quasi-containerless laser heating under controlled atmosphere. This is an experimental technique recently developed and applied to other refractory materials. This approach allowed a direct observation of the <b>melting</b> / <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> dependence on {{the environment in which}} samples were heated across the fusion /solidification transition. The current results prove that the large discrepancy existing in the literature data for the melting temperature of CaO is most probably attributable to the influence of the environmental oxidising / reducing conditions on the {{melting behaviour}} itself. The CaO <b>melting</b> / <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> measured in this work is (3222 ± 25) K in an oxidising environment, in agreement with previous research carried out under similar conditions and the JANAF table recommendation. The fusion /solidification transition in a reducing atmosphere occurs at a slightly, but systematically lower, more poorly reproducible temperature, with an average value of (3192  40) K. In the latter case, a more abundant formation of colour centres was noticed, corresponding to a higher concentration of oxygen defects in the refrozen and quenched CaO samples. The present study shows that the melting behaviour of calcia is dependent on the experimental atmosphere and the creation of oxygen defects in the re-solidified material. In the light of such conclusions, it is suggested that also pseudo-binary phase diagrams including CaO as one end member should be reassessed by taking into account possible deviations from the exact O/M stoichiometry in mixed oxides susceptible to the creation of oxygen defects at temperatures close to melting.

We sampled the adults monthly in the field during the cold season 2008 - 2009 and found active thermal hysteresis factors (THFs) in hemolymph of winter-sampled adults. The hysteresis between the equilibrium <b>melting</b> and <b>freezing</b> <b>points</b> ranged from 0. 18 °C to 0. 30 °C.

Two amino acids, Pro and α-Ala most significantly contributed to the seasonal increase, while Gln showed themost dramatic seasonal decrease. Moderate levels of amino acid accumulation in overwintering P. apterus suggest that they are by-products of protein degradation and pentose pathway activity during the state of metabolic suppression imposed by diapause and low body temperature. Potential colligative effects of accumulated amino acids, extending the supercooling capacity of overwintering P. apterus, are negligible. Non-colligative effects require further study...|$|R

Although all previously described TH-producing biomolecules are proteins, most thermal hysteresis factors (THFs) have not yet been structurally characterized, and none have been characterized from a freeze-tolerant animal. We isolated a highly active THF from the freeze-tolerant beetle, Upis ceramboides, by means of ice affinity. Amino acid chromatographic analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and NMR spectroscopy indicated that the THF contained little or no protein, yet it produced 3. 7 ± 0. 3 °C of TH at 5 mg/ml, comparable to that of the most active insect antifreeze proteins. Compositional and structural analyses indicated that this antifreeze contains a β-mannopyranosyl-(1 → 4) β-xylopyranose backbone and a fatty acid component, although the lipid may not be covalently linked to the saccharide. Consistent with the proposed structure, treatment with endo-β-(1 → 4) xylanase ablated TH activity.

40|$|Thermoporosimetry is a calorimetric {{method that}} allows the {{measurement}} of the pore size distribution (PSD). The method measures the <b>melting</b> or <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> depression of a liquid trapped in a pore. Then, this melting/freezing point depression is correlated to the pore size by the Gibbs-Thomson coefficient. Thermoporosimetry has several advantages. For example, {{it does not require}} toxic chemicals. Compared to other methods, the sample preparation is relatively simple. Moreover, samples analysis occurs in wet-state. However, the application of thermoporosimetry to cellulosic materials presents some critical limitations. Instead of using pulp fibers, the Gibbs-Thomson coefficients are calculated from materials with a different porosity, such as, silica or controlled porous glass material. This might provide misleading pore information. Thus, the primary aim of this work was to overcome this limitation. By combining cyclohexane thermoporosimetry and Hg-porosimetry, a system for determining an alternative Gibbs- Thomson coefficient was presented for a set of five types of pulps. These included bleached/unbleached, hardwood/softwood, and dried/never dried fibers. Additionally, by combining thermoporosimetry and centrifugation method, a novel platform was developed to estimate the amount of true macropores in fiber cell wall. In conclusion, a framework for calculating ‘corrected’ Gibbs-Thomson coefficient for thermoporosimetry-based PSD determination in cellulose-cyclohexane system was demonstrated in this study.

The purpose of this work is to employ molecular simulation to further extend the understanding of theories of melting with respect to defects.

Constant stress-constant temperature ensemble with atmospheric pressures is employed. Various properties like average volume, density, potential energy and total energy are obtained as a function of temperature for each system.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the nanoplasmonic sensing {{technique}} {{was used to}} study kinetics of (i) the oxidation of Al nanoparticles in air and water and (ii) the solid-liquid phase transition in Sn nanoparticles. The nanoplasmonic sensing technique detects changes of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in metal nanoparticles. When light shines on metal nanoparticles, at some wavelength the conduction electrons oscillate in resonance with the light. This resonance is called LSPR. It depends on the electronic structure, size, {{and shape of the}} nanoparticle as well as the optical properties of its nanoenvironment. (i) LSPRs in Al nanoparticles were characterized in detail: Extinction, scattering, and absorption efficiencies were determined experimentally for several different nanodisk sizes in the UV-vis-NIR spectral range. The experimental values were shown to be in good agreement with calculations based on the modified long wavelength approximation (MLWA). The oxidation in air of these Al particles was followed for long time periods. The results showed that nanoplasmonic sensing has potential for oxidation studies of metallic nanoparticles. In a more elaborate study, using both the nanoplasmonic sensing technique and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), highly resolved oxidation kinetics were measured for oxidation in water. MLWA model calculations of the LSPR facilitated interpretation of the results. Oxidation of Al nanoparticles in water was found to proceed in several stages, as reported for bulk Al, forming presumably pseudoboehmite (Al 2 O 3 ·H 2 O) in the process.

The intend of this present work is to address this achievement. Concrete blocks (both regular and autoclaved), the widely used construction material, were selected as ideal candidate for the experimental evaluation. Followed by previous laboratory work, both Butyl Stearate (BS) and Paraffin (PAR) were selected as PCM {{due to the fact}} that they are representing the lower and higher melting temperature ranges. The weight percentages vary with different PCMs and the types of block; furthermore, the adopted incorporating technique is by immersing. The experimental studies were conducted in a thermally insulated wooden box. Twelve identical blocks were laid contiguously to allow continuous air flow through the tunnels formed by their hollow cores. In addition, their temperatures were recorded by digital data logger. Heating and cooling cycle were provided by two sets of microcomputer controlled air conditioning systems. Three different heating and cooling temperature ranges were applied on different combinations. The mean air flow velocities were also set between 2 to 3 m/s.

5000|$|The {{technique}} {{is closely related}} to using gas adsorption to measure pore sizes, but uses the Gibbs-Thomson equation rather than the Kelvin equation. They are both particular cases of the Gibbs Equations of Josiah Willard Gibbs: the Kelvin equation is the constant temperature case, and the Gibbs-Thomson equation is the constant pressure case.This behaviour {{is closely related to}} the capillary effect and both are due to the change in bulk free energy caused by the curvature of an interfacial surface under tension.The original equation only applies to isolated particles, but with the addition of surface interaction terms (usually expressed in terms of the contact wetting angle) can be modified to apply to liquids and their crystals in porous media. As such it has given rise to various related techniques for measuring pore size distributions. (See Thermoporometry and Cryoporometry.)The Gibbs-Thomson effect lowers both <b>melting</b> and <b>freezing</b> <b>point,</b> and also raises boiling point. However, simple cooling of an all-liquid sample usually leads to a state of non-equilibrium super cooling and only eventual non-equilibrium freezing. To obtain a measurement of the equilibrium freezing event, it is necessary to first cool enough to freeze a sample with excess liquid outside the pores, then warm the sample until the liquid in the pores is all melted, but the bulk material is still frozen. Then, on re-cooling the equilibrium freezing event can be measured, as the external ice will then grow into the pores.This is in effect an [...] "ice intrusion" [...] measurement (cf. mercury intrusion), and as such in part may provide information on pore throat properties.

40|$|Antifreeze {{proteins}} (AFPs) from polar and cold-tolerant {{organisms are}} able to control ice growth {{as a result of}} their adsorption on the ice crystal surface. The proteins bind to selected crystallographic planes, which are characteristic for each kind of AFP. As a consequence of the adsorption, the <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> of the solution is locally lowered below the melting point, following the Gibbs-Thomson equation. Within the difference between the <b>melting</b> and the <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> (hysteresis gap), the macroscopic growth of the crystals is arrested. Below the <b>freezing</b> <b>point,</b> crystals grow with a burst of determined shapes. Their habit is dominated by the crystallographic planes inhibited by the proteins, due to the geometric adsorption selectivity as well as to the adsorption rate of the proteins. Most of the well-studied fish AFPs do not bind to the basal plane, therefore crystals burst as needles parallel to the c-axis. At strong supercoolings the protein adsorption rate is not fast enough to balance radial growth due to heat dissipation, and crystals develop dendrites. However, data about the shape of the crystals after the burst, and well below the <b>freezing</b> <b>point,</b> are still scarce, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the growth inhibition mechanisms by the different AFP types. Here we present ice growth experiments in the presence of AFPs from the polar diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus, a dominant microalga in sea ice assemblages. The protein was recombinantely expressed and purified from E. coli. Ice grain habit was observed at light microscopy in a dish, from the hysteresis gap until growth into a solid sample of polycrystalline ice. Crystals grew with an expansion of the basal plane area, but a suppressed development parallel to the c-axis compared to negative controls, resulting in thin ice “sheets”. A slow three- dimensional growth was revealed by the formation of characteristic features as pits and groves. Dendritic growth was limited, presumably among others an effect of the rapid heat dissipation through the thin sheet. The effect of the AFPs was still evident hours after the initial burst, as shown by analyses of the fully frozen polycrystalline block. Microtomed ice observed through crossed polarizers revealed marked microstructural features, which confirm a freezing history as a process of sheet after sheet freezing. Our results suggest that proteins bind, among others, to the basal plane of crystals, as also proposed in previous studies. Analyses of the habit showed a crystal shape relatively stable over time, and explain the microstructural features in the polycrystalline sample. Furthermore, the studies about this kind of AFP contribute to complete the puzzle of growth inhibition by AFPs. ...|$|R

Average milk <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> is – 0. 540 oHortvet (H). If the <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> estimate is>- 0. 530 oH in a milk sample a warning is provided to the producer. At a <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> test>- 0. 525 oH a financial penalty is imposed on the producer. High milk <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> (penalty level) is widely recognized to be caused in almost all cases by freezing of the milk during cooling, or water added to the milk due to rinse water going into the tank or water added to the tank. An unbalanced ration, including factors such as low energy or lack of grain, and lack of salt or minerals are frequently cited as other possible causes of high milk <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> when problem cases are investigated. Little research has {{been published in the}} past 20 – 30 years on the effect of feeding on milk <b>freezing</b> <b>point.</b> Reviews of older published research (3 and 6) indicate that nutrition can have a statistically significant effect on milk <b>freezing</b> <b>point.</b> Whether the effects of feeding on milk <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> can be large enough to cause a milk freezing poin...|$|R
