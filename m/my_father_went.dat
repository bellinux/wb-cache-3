500|$|In 1952, Elliott {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} at the University of Iowa under its head coach, Forest Evashevski, another former All-American at the University of Michigan. [...] On being hired at Iowa, Elliott said, [...] "I should feel at home back in the Big Ten. [...] I grew up in Bloomington – 40 miles from Illinois. [...] I played at Purdue and Michigan and coached at Michigan. [...] <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> to Iowa and Northwestern and now I’m coaching at Iowa." [...] He stayed at Iowa until 1957. [...] Elliott was with the Hawkeyes in 1956 when they went 9–1, won the Big Ten championship, and defeated his former team, Oregon State, 35–19, in the 1957 Rose Bowl game.|$|E
2500|$|Castéra and Johnson both drew even numbers, {{which meant}} they {{went off in}} the first group, 30 minutes before the odd numbers. My father drew number 187. When the signal was given for the second group to move off, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> right {{to the front and}} was soon on his own. It was raining, and it {{remained}} wet all day. Right down the Avénue de la Grande Armée and the Avénue de Neuilly, over the bridges of the Seine, and on towards the first control at St Germain-en-Laye. As he pedalled hard up the steep hill near the town, he passed a group of stragglers from the first group who were pushing their machines. My father had gained 30 minutes on them in 12 miles! ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{were few}} {{black people in}} Lowell, so the young Kerouac did not {{encounter}} the sort of racism that was common {{in other parts of}} the United States. Kerouac once told Ted Berrigan, in an interview for The Paris Review, of an incident in the 1940s in which his mother and father were walking together in a Jewish neighborhood on the Lower East Side of New York. He recalled [...] "a whole bunch of rabbis walking arm in arm... teedah- teedah – teedah... and they wouldn't part for this Christian man and his wife, so <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> POOM! and knocked a rabbi right in the gutter." [...] Leo, after the death of his child, also treated a priest with similar contempt, angrily throwing him out of the house despite his invitation from Gabrielle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold?" [...] exclaimed Lothaire. [...] "No one {{commands}} {{here but}} I and <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> <b>Go</b> on Charlot--where is the bird? Keep her fast, Giles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] Roland said hesitatingly, [...] "it {{seems too}} absurd, but I cannot but think {{it a little}} strange that Mr. Johnstone should let <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>go</b> off like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you've got {{anything}} {{to tell me}} about <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>go</b> right ahead. You'll be the only man I've ever met who has said a word about him. Who the deuce was he, anyway?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{could not}} fetch her sooner,' said Robert, 'for <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> to sleep, {{and no one}} chose {{to be at the}} pains of {{entertaining}} Crabbe.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Three, at least,' said Robert, yawning; 'six by my feelings. I {{could not}} get away, for Mr. Crabbe stayed to dinner; Mervyn absented himself, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> to sleep.' ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. BARLOW. All my {{children}} have {{the artist in}} them. They get it from my family. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> mad in Rome. My family is born with a black fate--they all inherit it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I? Then I {{appear to}} be what I am not. I'm {{a native of the}} Granite State, in North America. <b>My</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>went</b> to that region in times long gone by to uphold their {{religious}} idees. The whole country thereabouts sets onaccountable store by their religious privileges." ...|$|R
6000|$|Young Granton smiled again. [...] "You're a {{financier}}, Sir Charles," [...] he answered. [...] "I wonder, at {{your time}} of life, you should pause to ask another financier whether he's {{trying to fill}} his own pocket--or his <b>father's.</b> Whatever is <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>goes</b> to his eldest son--and I am his youngest." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Mr. Rigby {{is not in}} town. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> for Mr. Rigby {{this morning}} before Mr. Coningsby came, and he found that Mr. Rigby was not in town. That is why I know it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} that fall I had when the cage broke," [...] <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> on. [...] "Andrews, as you know, feared {{from the first}} it might lead to that. But I always laughed at him." ...|$|E
60|$|Here was {{the best}} excuse that I could desire for keeping out of Miss Jillgall's way. I cheerfully set {{to work on the}} {{restoration}} of the letters, while <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> on with his writing.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high, [...] I {{fear not}} wave nor wind; Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I [...] Am sorrowful in mind; For I have from <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>gone,</b> [...] A mother whom I love, And have no friend, save these alone, [...] But thee--and One above.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{rejoined the}} boy. [...] "I wished {{to have a}} seat on the banquette, so that I could see; but the seats were all engaged before <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> to the office; so we are going in the coupé; but I don't like it half so well." ...|$|E
60|$|To-day in Glasgow <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> off on some business, and {{my mother}} and I wandered about for two hours. We had lunch together, and were very merry over what the people at the {{restaurant}} would think of us--mother and son they could not suppose us to be.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a quarter}} past ten o'clock by the parlour {{timepiece}} when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> {{off to his}} room, and left Esther and myself together.

60|$|When {{the time}} came <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> down by the night mail to Portsmouth.

Besides, there might be some explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... "One morning <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> out, {{leaving me}} in the surgery, as was his wont. I was deeply {{immersed}} in a book on anatomy, when I heard a tremendous double rap--as if made {{with the head of}} a stick--at the outer door, and immediately after the question put in the gruff bass voice of an Irishman, `Is the dactur within?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I say, I {{was very}} sick," [...] Lone Chief went on. [...] "And when my father, the Otter, brought the girl Kasaan before me, I said rather should {{they make me}} ready for burial than for marriage.

60|$|The {{next morning}} we sold our pelts. And though the mare was tired, we pushed southward, I behind the saddle. I had much to think about, {{wondering}} {{what was to become}} of me while <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> to skin Cameron. I had not the least doubt that he would do it. The world is a storybook to a lad of nine, and the thought of Charlestown filled me with a delight unspeakable. Perchance he would leave me in Charlestown.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>went</b> {{away the}} king promised {{to pay him}} a visit on board of his ship next day, which he did, sure enough; and my father took care to {{let it be known}} that he was coming, so there was no lack of the {{principal}} people thereabouts.

6000|$|Out of ten of {{him that}} try the narrow path, nine of him {{come back to the}} broad road, and, when they pass the next gap in the hedge, they say: [...] "No, no, my friend, I found you {{pleasant}} for a while, but after that-ah! after that!
