40|$|One {{emerging}} {{application of}} Parallel Kinematic Mechanisms (PKM) {{is in the}} computerized numerical control (CNC) machine tools and, recently, several prototypes of such CNC machines have been developed. In Cartesian machine tools, motion properties like velocity and acceleration of the individual drives are directly transferred to the tool center point (TCP). With PKM, the axes motions are transformed by nonlinear transfer functions as a general rule. The goal {{of the present study}} is to study the transformation of dynamic properties in PKM based machine tools. Transformation of tracking error and velocity gain from <b>machine</b> <b>coordinates</b> to Cartesian coordinates in workspace is, initially, investigated by a one axis mechanism (Monopod). In this study, the PKM behavior is simplified to a single degree of freedom (DOF) motion system with a nonlinear transformation of dynamic properties like position and velocity. The test bench of Monopod is calibrated by a neural network (NN) method and the model is simulated in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The results of transformation illustrate the relative velocity gain between TCP and drive axis, and are developed to multi axis PKM such as Bipod and Tripod. The effect on trace accuracy is discussed in light of these mechanisms. In the simulation phase, models are performed with constant length of strut, and the mechanical effects like inertia, flexibility, friction and backlash are neglected. This ensures to study uncoupled closed loop controller effects. A contour error algorithm is developed and verified by the Bipod and the Tripod to predict the contour error of a generalized machine tool by the Jacobian matrix and estimated tracking errors in the drives. The experimental results are obtained using a method for star contouring test that consists of straight lines in the workspace with varying orientations and the double ball bar in circular trajectory. An accurate trajectory control is a fundamental requirement for CNC machine tools. To eliminate the contour error, a compensated path method is introduced that generates a setpoint path, with a programmed deviation equal in amount but negative in direction to the calculated contour error. The real transfer function can be identified by the NN approach...|$|E
40|$|Although &# 64258;at-end {{multi-axis}} milling {{has been}} proven to be more efficient than ball-end machining {{for more than twenty}} years, dedicated tool path generation and planning algorithms have been seriously suffering from insufficient intelligence because they originate from ball-end algorithms and do not consider issues attributed to the &# 64258;at-end shape of tools. This research work describes {{the development and implementation of}} new algorithms designed for tool path planning and generation aiming taking machine kinematics into account. The developed components are founded on prototype software that can handle STL geometry for robust computation of tool path tracks and interference-free tool postures. This STL kernel was also extended with support of facet machining status to enable machining simulation. In addition to the kernel, three different components were developed to facilitate optimization of tool inclination, material removal simulation, and tool path planning. First, two tool path optimization methods were elaborated to perform minimization of machine tool rotations in reasonable computation time. Second, a novel material removal simulation based on accurate estimation of swept sections has been introduced. Third, tool path planning algorithms integrating the developed material removal simulation allow efficient tool path generation with reduced machining strip overlaps and dynamic step-over between adjacent tool path tracks. This integration has also given an opportunity to introduce two strategies. First strategy implements the cutting plane approach to slice STL surfaces and generate zig-zag-like tool paths with intelligent selection of tool path tracks directions. Second strategy generates contour-like tool paths, going inwards from a workpiece outside, resulting in machined surfaces with predictable scallop height. This research highlighted and resolved several &# 64258;aws in existing algorithms. First, estimations of machining strip widths derived from a single posture are almost surely incorrect in a case of &# 64257;ve-axis machining. Therefore, a new approach taking several postures into account has been developed and implemented. Second, regardless of the dramatic in&# 64258;uence of machine tool kinematics and CNC behavior onto the actual shape of a machined surface, machine tool characteristics are not considered by the existing material removal simulation algorithms. Thus, in this research, tool motion has been interpolated in <b>machine</b> <b>coordinates.</b> The developed methods can be smoothly integrated with themselves and other CAM software. Eventually, these methods are believed to assist CAM programmers in generating efficient tool paths in an automated manner. nrpages: 158 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|International audienceConformal {{radiotherapy}} (CRT) {{results in}} high-precision tumor volume irradiation. In fractioned radiotherapy (FRT), lesions are irradiated in several sessions so that healthy neighbouring tissues are better preserved than when treatment {{is carried out}} in one fraction. In the case of intracranial tumors, classical methods of patient positioning in the irradiation <b>machine</b> <b>coordinate</b> system are invasive and only allow for CRT in one irradiation session. This contribution presents a noninvasive positioning method representing a first step towards the combination of CRT and FRT. The 3 D data used for the positioning is point clouds spread over the patient's head (CT-data usually acquired during treatment) and points distributed over the patient's face which are acquired with a structured light sensor fixed in the therapy room. The geometrical transformation linking the coordinate systems of the diagnosis device (CT-modality) and the 3 D sensor of the therapy room (visible light modality) is obtained by registering the surfaces represented by the two 3 D point sets. The geometrical relationship between the coordinate systems of the 3 D sensor and the irradiation machine is given by a calibration of the sensor position in the therapy room.

However, it is no longer the normal way of building most petrol engines and diesel engines, because for any given engine configuration, there are more efficient ways of designing for manufacture (and also for maintenance and repair). These generally involve integrating multiple machine elements into one discrete part, and doing the making (such as casting, stamping, and machining) for multiple elements in one setup with one <b>machine</b> <b>coordinate</b> system (of a machine tool or other piece of manufacturing machinery). This yields lower unit cost of production (and/or maintenance and repair).|$|R

However, the smoothness of the tool orientation in the part coordinate system cannot assure the smooth motions of the rotary axes of a five-axis machine tool because the conversion of tool posture from the part coordinate system to the <b>machine</b> <b>coordinate</b> system is nonlinear. To generate a tool path with smooth rotary motions of the five-axis machine tool, the tool path in this paper is represented with three spline curves: the cutter location curve and the two trajectory curves of the rotary axes of the machine tool, so that the rotary axes’ motions can be simultaneously smoothed. For a flank milling tool path, the geometric deviations between the envelope surface of the tool movement and the design surface should be respected while smoothing the tool path. The point-to-surface distance is adopted to calculate the geometric deviations, and then a smoothness optimization model is developed to smooth the rotary axes’ motions using the weighted least squares method. A numerical example of five-axis flank milling of a S-shape surface is given to confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach...|$|R
