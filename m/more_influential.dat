As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become <b>more</b> <b>influential</b> as time progresses.

I note that while More and these early architects of physico-theology employ similar arguments against ‘atheism' and the Cartesian banishment of final causes from nature, there is a salient difference between More and Boyle – if not Ray in the 'Wisdom of God' – concerning whether God may have realised his ends in nature via panmechanism. I suggest that {{the difference between the two}} men is probably best understood in terms of different intuitions about divine creative action...|$|R

5|$|Generally {{regarded}} as the greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, the right-handed Bradman played in all five Tests as captain at No. 3. Bradman was <b>more</b> <b>influential</b> than other Australian captains because he {{was also one of the}} three selectors who had a hand in choosing the squad. He was also a member of the Australian Board of Control while still playing, a privilege that no other person has held. At the age of 40, Bradman was by far the oldest player on the team; three-quarters of his team were at least eight years younger, and some viewed him as a father figure. Coupled with his status as a national hero, cricketing ability and influence as an administrator, this associated the team more closely to him than other teams to their respective captains. Bradman's iconic stature as a cricketer also led to record-breaking public interest and attendances at the matches on tour.|$|E

The FN was arguably <b>more</b> <b>influential</b> now {{than it had been in}} 1986 with its 35 seats. While Bruno Mégret and Bruno Gollnisch, in an unusual display of dissent, favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre-right following the left's victory, Le Pen rejected any such compromise. In the tenth FN national congress in 1997, Mégret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen. Le Pen however refused to designate Mégret as his successor-elect, and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, German tank theory was pioneered by two figures: General Oswald Lutz and {{his chief of}} staff, Lieutenant Colonel Heinz Guderian. Guderian became the <b>more</b> <b>influential</b> of the two and his ideas were widely publicized. Like his contemporary, Sir Percy Hobart, Guderian {{initially}} envisioned an armored corps (panzerkorps) composed of several types of tanks. This included a slow infantry tank, armed with a small-caliber cannon and several machine guns. The infantry tank, according to Guderian, was to be heavily armored to defend against enemy anti-tank guns and artillery. He also envisioned a fast breakthrough tank, similar to the British cruiser tank, {{which was to be}} armoured against enemy anti-tank weapons and have a large, 75-millimeter (2.95in) main gun. Lastly, Germany needed a heavy tank, armed with a 150-millimeter (5.9in) cannon to defeat enemy fortifications, and even stronger armor. Such a tank required a weight of 70 to 100tonnes and was completely impractical given the manufacturing capabilities of the day.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{increasingly}} {{recognized the importance}} of figures other than John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli in the early formation of the Reformed tradition. Richard Muller, a chief authority on the development of this movement, has argued that Vermigli, Wolfgang Musculus, and Heinrich Bullinger were as influential if not <b>more</b> <b>influential</b> than Calvin on the development of Reformed theology in the sixteenth century. Vermigli was a transitional figure between the Reformation period and the period known as Reformed orthodoxy. In the Reformed orthodox period, the theology first articulated by Reformation figures was codified and systematized. Theologians increasingly resorted to the methods of scholastic theology and the tradition of Aristotelianism. Vermigli {{was the first of the}} Reformed scholastic theologians, and he influenced later scholastics Theodore Beza and Girolamo Zanchi.|$|E
5|$|This {{meets the}} birds' high energy requirements, the most {{important}} determinants of flower choice. In Mimulus, an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of pollination by bees as opposed to hummingbirds; while greater flower surface area increases bee pollination. Therefore, red pigments in the flowers of Mimulus cardinalis may function primarily to discourage bee visitation. In Penstemon, flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be <b>more</b> <b>influential</b> on the flowers' evolutionary change than 'pro-bird' adaptations, but adaptation 'towards' birds and 'away' from bees can happen simultaneously. However, some flowers such as Heliconia angusta appear not to be as specifically ornithophilous as had been supposed: the species is occasionally (151 visits in 120 hours of observation) visited by Trigona stingless bees. These bees are largely pollen robbers in this case, but may also serve as pollinators.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli had a {{profound}} influence on the English Reformation through his relationship with Thomas Cranmer. Before his contact with Vermigli, Cranmer held Lutheran Eucharistic views. Vermigli seems to have convinced Cranmer to adopt a Reformed view, which {{changed the course of}} the English Reformation since Cranmer was primarily responsible for revisions to the Book of Common Prayer and writing the Forty-two Articles. Vermigli had a direct role in the modifications of the Book of Common Prayer of 1552. He is also believed to have contributed to, if not written, the article on predestination found in the Forty-two Articles of Religion of 1553. In Elizabethan Oxford and Cambridge, Vermigli's theology was arguably <b>more</b> <b>influential</b> than that of Calvin. His political theology in particular shaped the Elizabethan religious settlement and his authority was constantly invoked in the controversies of this period.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 20th century Janáček {{composed}} choral church music including Otčenáš (Our Father, 1901), Constitutes (1903) and Ave Maria (1904). In 1901 the first part of his piano cycle On an Overgrown Path was published, and gradually became one of his most frequently performed works. In 1902 Janáček visited Russia twice. On the first occasion he took his daughter Olga to St.Petersburg, where she stayed to study Russian. Only three months later, he returned to St. Petersburg with his wife because Olga had become very ill. They took her back to Brno, but her health worsened. Janáček expressed his painful feelings for his daughter in a new work, his opera Jenůfa, in which the suffering of his daughter had transfigured into Jenůfa's. When Olga died in February 1903, Janáček dedicated Jenůfa to her memory. The opera was performed in Brno in 1904, with reasonable success, but Janáček felt this was no more than a provincial achievement. He aspired to recognition by the <b>more</b> <b>influential</b> Prague opera, but Jenůfa was refused there (twelve years passed before its first performance in Prague). Dejected and emotionally exhausted, Janáček went to Luhačovice spa to recover. There he met Kamila Urválková, whose love story supplied the theme for his next opera, Osud (Destiny).|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} of Arsène Wenger as Arsenal manager in September 1996 marked {{a turning point}} in Bergkamp's career. Wenger, who had moderate success coaching in France and Japan, recognised Bergkamp's talent and wanted to use him as a fulcrum of the team's forward play. Both were advocates of a continental style of attacking football, and Wenger's decision to impose a strict fitness and health regimen pleased Bergkamp. Despite making fewer appearances in the 1996–97 season, Bergkamp was <b>more</b> <b>influential</b> in the first team, creating 13 assists. Against Tottenham Hotspur in November 1996, he set up an 88th-minute winner for captain Tony Adams to volley in using his left foot. He then scored in injury time, controlling a high ball with his left foot and evading his marker Stephen Carr in a tight area to set up his shot. Bergkamp received his first red card against Sunderland in January 1997 for a high tackle on midfielder Paul Bracewell in the 26th minute. Arsenal went on to lose the match 1–0, but a run of 8 wins in their final 16 matches gave the club a third-place finish, missing out on a spot in the UEFA Champions League via goal difference.|$|E

There are proportionately <b>more</b> <b>Influentials</b> and Rebels in the United States and more Submissives in Germany. In both countries greater education and affiliation with Protestant churches {{are associated with a}} sense of appropriate influence, while submissive attitudes are encouraged by less education and Catholicism.

In Germany but not in the United States, Rebels are more likely to follow their parents political tradition than are Influentials, a phenomenon interpreted as possibly reflecting adult guilt over youthful rebellion,Lane Robert E.
