40|$|Remote sensing {{technology}} {{that uses the}} observation from satellite sensor {{is necessary for the}} global estimation of forest biomass. However, a wide range of ground based measurements (e. g., diameter at breast height (DBH), crown height, crown width, tree height) is required for the algorithm development and verification of satellite based estimation of biomass. These ground based measurements are time consuming, laborious and costly as well. Ground based laser scanning method which can provide various measurements and structural analysis of the forest can be an alternative method to traditional ground based measurements. However, some problems exist on ground based laser scanner. For example, it is impossible to estimate the shape of invisible tree where ground based laser cannot reach. In this case, high density laser scanned data can be acquired by overlapping the scanning data by measuring from multi-observational points. As a result, the problem of invisible area in the forest could be solved. However, it is also problem to take more <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> than the optimum observational points because the requirements of labor, time increase with the increase in observational points. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the <b>multi</b> <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> of the ground based laser scanning system in a forest. The meaning of optimization is to sufficiently observe the targeted area without any invisible area with the lowest possible <b>observation</b> <b>points.</b> In this idea of optimization, arrangement of observational points which can overlap the observed area by reducing the invisible are is important. This paper presents the method and result of overlapping the laser scanning area with optimization of <b>multi</b> <b>observation</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R

Mainly <b>multi</b> <b>point</b> injection engines fitted with an after sales single point injection autogas system are sensitive to hunting. A problem with these systems {{is the use of}} control signals of the original <b>multi</b> <b>point</b> injection system to control a single point injection system. In earlier research, a model of a <b>multi</b> <b>point</b> engine with a single point autogas system was made and the stability of the linearized form of this model was analyzed.

The aim of this report is the investigation of the stability of the nonlinear model of the engine, using analysis of the phase plane. In the phase plane, trajectories of the state variables are analyzed. These state variables are the manifold air pressure and the number of revolutions of the crank shaft. In the phase plane the effect of <b>multi</b> <b>point</b> injection and parameter influ-ences are investigated.

40|$|The {{velocity}} of short duration high-amplitude shock waves and high-speed motion created by {{sources such as}} explosives, high energy plasmas and other rapid-acceleration devices are difficult to measure due to their fast reaction times. One measurement tool frequently used is VISAR (Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector). VISAR is an optical-based system that utilizes Doppler interferometry techniques to measure the complete time-history of the motion of a surface. This technique is gaining worldwide acceptance as the tool of choice for measurement of shock phenomena. However, one limitation of the single point VISAR is that it measures only one point on a surface. The new <b>Multi</b> <b>Point</b> VISAR remedies the single point VISAR's limitation by using multiple fiber optics and sensors to send and receive information. Upcoming programs that need analysis of large diameter flyers prompted the concept and design of a single cavity-multiple fiber optic <b>Multi</b> <b>Point</b> VISAR (MPV). Preliminary designs and the testing of a single cavity prototype in 1996 supported the theory of compact fiber optic bundle systems for development into the <b>Multi</b> <b>Point</b> VISAR.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{numerical}} method for {{the solution of}} state-constrained optimal control problems is presented. The method is derived from an infinite dimensional analogue of sequential quadratic programming. The main purpose of the paper is to present some theoretical aspects of the method. An experimental numerical implementation of the method is also discussed. An analogue to finite dimensional sequential quadratic programming is developed in Banach spaces. Application to state-constrained control problems follows similar lines as in case of deriving the minimum principle from the abstract necessary conditions for optimality. In the setting of optimal control problems, the analogue to the inversion of the Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian is the solution of a linear <b>multi</b> <b>point</b> boundary value problem. Each iteration of the method involves mainly the solution a linear <b>multi</b> <b>point</b> boundary value problem. Numerically, a collocation method based on collocation with piecewise polynomial functions is proposed for {{the solution of the}} linear <b>multi</b> <b>point</b> boundary value problems.
