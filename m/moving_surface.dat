2500|$|The {{financial}} {{restrictions were}} not long-lasting, and on 10 July 1958 {{it was announced}} that the work would resume. It progressed without further major difficulties and a formal opening by the Lord Mayor of London took place on 27 September 1960, coming into public use immediately. There were two parallel travolators, each with a <b>moving</b> <b>surface</b> having 488 platform sections each the whole length is [...] on an inclination of 1in7. There was a moving handrail. In the morning peak both travolators would operate upwards, with arriving passengers being required to walk down the original ramps; at other times one travolator operated in each direction. The original Otis Trav-O-Lators have since been replaced by CNIM machines.|$|E
2500|$|On August 27, 2013, Lockheed {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} test of the LRASM, launched from a B-1. Halfway to its target, the missile switched from following a planned route to autonomous guidance. [...] It autonomously detected its moving target, a 260ft unmanned ship out of three in the target area, and hit it in the desired location with an inert warhead. [...] The purpose of the test was to stress the sensor suite, which detected all the targets and only engaged the one it was told to. [...] Two more flight tests were planned the year, involving different altitudes, ranges, and geometries in the target area. [...] Two launches from vertical launch systems were planned for summer 2014. The missile had a sensor designed by BAE Systems. [...] The sensor is designed to enable targeted attacks within a group of enemy ships protected by sophisticated air defense systems. [...] It autonomously located and targeted the <b>moving</b> <b>surface</b> ship. [...] The sensor uses advanced electronic technologies to detect targets within a complex signal environment, and then calculates precise target locations for the missile control unit.|$|E

Doors and <b>moving</b> <b>surfaces</b> created open gaps in the heat protection system {{that had to be}} protected from heat.

Two versions of the technology are considered: one has the <b>moving</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{on the bottom of}} the air chambers whereas the other has the <b>moving</b> <b>surfaces</b> on the top. We developed numerical models in the frequency domain, thereby enabling the power absorption of the two versions of the device to be assessed. It is observed that the <b>moving</b> <b>surfaces</b> on the top allow for easier tuning of the natural period of the system. Taking into account stroke limitations, the design is optimized. Results indicate that the pressure-differential wave energy converter is a highly efficient technology both with respect to energy absorption and selected economic performance indicators...|$|R

2500|$|Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) (1999) is {{a single}} work {{composed}} of fifteen photographic offset lithographs, each 30 1/2 x 41 1/2". It is {{in the collection of}} the Museum of Modern Art [...] It was commissioned around 1998, and Horn has noted that it came about at the same time as the end of a long love relationship. Each of the 15 lithographs features a photograph of the surface of the River Thames that has been annotated with many small white numerals that correspond to a bar of footnotes that runs along the lower border of each image. In one footnote, Horn puts a fine point on the lens through which this project looks at the river, [...] "(41) The Thames has the highest rate of suicides of any urban river. Maybe it's not the highest but it's close. It doesn't really matter because even if it doesn't, it looks like it does." [...] Horn describes these annotations as footnoting [...] "whatever I was thinking of at the time, what the river provoked in me, and what was in the river itself." [...] The result is a mixture of poetic fragments, reports culled from interviews and newspaper clippings about deaths (primarily planned suicides) by drowning in the Thames, references to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, questions about identity and consideration of the subject of water from many different perspectives. In most cases, the photographs were taken with such exactitude that the <b>moving</b> <b>surface</b> of the water is stopped in highly detailed topographies, so that the substance of water is shown in more sculptural views than can usually be observed by the naked eye.|$|E

No, it was too dignified a luminary for that, but its rays went straight at a small looking-glass which was suspended on the wall opposite to the window, and this being hung so as to slope forward, projected the rays obliquely into a tub of water which was destined for family washing purposes; and from its gently <b>moving</b> <b>surface</b> they were transmitted to the ceiling, where, as aforesaid, they danced, to the immense delight of Maggot junior.|$|E

And whilst she swooned, his face bent nearer to her, her head was leaned on his shoulder, she felt his warm breath on her face.

50|$|Moving {{surfaces}} cause amplitude, Doppler frequency, {{and pulse}} modulation of the return. The amplitude modulation comes from <b>moving</b> <b>surfaces</b> of different reflectivity and angle of reflection.

60|$|By leaving Santa Marina {{early in}} the morning, driving twenty miles and riding eight, the party, which was {{composed}} finally of six English people, reached the river-side as the night fell. They came cantering through the trees--Mr. and Mrs. Flushing, Helen Ambrose, Rachel, Terence, and St. John. The tired little horses then stopped automatically, and the English dismounted. Mrs. Flushing strode to the river-bank in high spirits. The day had been long and hot, but she had enjoyed the speed and the open air; {{she had left the}} hotel which she hated, and she found the company to her liking. The river was swirling past in the darkness; they could just distinguish the smooth <b>moving</b> <b>surface</b> of the water, and the air was full of the sound of it. They stood in an empty space in the midst of great tree-trunks, and out there a little green light moving slightly up and down showed them where the steamer lay in which they were to embark.|$|E
60|$|Of this scene, so chillingly in {{accordance}} with the past, Duncan stood for many minutes a rapt observer. His eyes wandered from the bosom of the mound, where the foresters were seated around their glimmering fire, to the fainter light which still lingered in the skies, and then rested long and anxiously on the embodied gloom, which lay like a dreary void on that side of him where the dead reposed. He soon fancied that inexplicable sounds arose from the place, though so indistinct and stolen, as to render not only their nature but even their existence uncertain. Ashamed of his apprehensions, the young man turned towards the water, and strove to divert his attentions to the mimic stars that dimly glimmered on its <b>moving</b> <b>surface.</b> Still, his too conscious ears performed their ungrateful duty, as if to warn him of some lurking danger. At length a swift trampling seemed quite audibly to rush athwart the darkness. Unable any longer to quiet his uneasiness, Duncan spoke in a low voice to the scout, requesting him to ascend the mound to the place where he stood. Hawkeye threw his rifle across an arm, and complied, but with an air so unmoved and calm, as to prove how much he counted on the security of their position.|$|E
6000|$|For {{two days}} they {{continued}} upon their perilous way. Already the cliffs loomed high and forbidding close ahead without sign of break to encourage hope that somewhere {{they might be}} scaled. Late in the afternoon the party crossed a small stream of warm water upon the sluggishly <b>moving</b> <b>surface</b> of which floated countless millions of tiny green eggs surrounded by a light scum of the same color, though of a darker shade. Their past experience of Caspak had taught them that they might expect to come upon a stagnant pool of warm water if they followed the stream to its source; but there they were almost certain to find some of Caspak's grotesque, manlike creatures. Already since they had disembarked from the U-33 after its perilous trip through the subterranean channel beneath the barrier cliffs had brought them into the inland sea of Caspak, had they encountered what had appeared to be three distinct types of these creatures. There had been the pure apes--huge, gorillalike beasts--and those who walked, a trifle more erect and had features with just a shade more of the human cast about them. Then there were men like Ahm, whom they had captured and confined at the fort--Ahm, the club-man. [...] "Well-known club-man," [...] Tyler had called him. Ahm and his people had knowledge of a speech. They had a language, {{in which they were}} unlike the race just inferior to them, and they walked much more erect and were less hairy: but it was principally the fact that they possessed a spoken language and carried a weapon that differentiated them from the others.|$|E

In an effort to eliminate the need to compute the quadrupole contribution, the FW-H has also been utilized on permeable surfaces surrounding all physical noise sources.

60|$|When, by {{a smiling}} chance, I {{fell into the}} right hands and was borne to the Cotton Exchange I did not fail of a due sense of the {{important}} scene, I hope.

I would not, if I could, have repressed a thrill of pride in seeing our national colors and emblems equalled with those of Great Britain {{at one end of}} the room, but these were the only things American in the impression left. We made our way through the momently thickening groups on the floor, and in the guidance of a member of the exchange found a favorable point of observation in the gallery. From this the vast space below showed first a <b>moving</b> <b>surface</b> of hats, with few silk toppers among them, but a multitude of panamas and other straws. The marketing was not carried on with anything like the wild, rangy movement of our Stock Exchange, and the floor sent up no such hell-roaring (there is no other phrase for it) tumult as rises from the mad but not malign demons of that most dramatic representation of perdition. The merchants, alike staid, whether old or young, congregated in groups which, dealing in a common type of goods, kept the same places till, toward three o'clock, they were lost in the mass which covered the floor. Even then there was no uproar, no rush or push, no sharp cries or frenzied shouting; but from the crowd, which was largely made up of elderly men, there rose a sort of surd, rich hum, deepening ever, and never breaking into a shriek of torment or derision. It was not histrionic, and yet for its commercial importance it was one of the most moving spectacles which could offer itself to the eye in the whole world.|$|E
