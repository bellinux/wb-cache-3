2500|$|Many {{years later}} Haile Selassie I would {{comment on the}} efforts: [...] "We can never forget the help Ethiopia {{received}} from Negro Americans during the crisis. ... It moved <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Americans of African descent did not abandon their embattled brothers, but stood by us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2015, in an {{interview}} with MTV News, T.I. said: [...] "This is a perfect time to be able to call myself what I've always been known as [...] Being called T.I. is very weird. It's kinda awkward to be famous for a name that you've never been called before in your life. If you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you don't know me, call me T.I. It's the weirdest most awkward thing." [...] During the interview he also spoke on the benefit of not having to deal with a major label and how he couldn't have released Da' Nic if he wasn't independent.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1941, Hellman and Ernest Hemingway co-hosted {{a dinner}} {{to raise money}} for anti-Nazi activists imprisoned in France. New York Governor Herbert Lehman agreed to participate, but withdrew because some of the {{sponsoring}} organizations, he wrote, [...] "have long been connected with Communist activities." [...] Hellman replied: [...] "I do not and I did not ask the politics of any members of the committee and there is nobody who can with honesty vouch for anybody but themselves." [...] She assured him the funds raised would be used as promised and later provided him with a detailed accounting. The next month she wrote him: [...] "I am sure it will make you sad and ashamed as it did <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> of the seven resignations out of 147 sponsors, five were Jews. Of all the peoples in the world, I think, we should be the last to hold back help, on any grounds, from those who fought for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, sir," [...] said Mr. Delaplaine, [...] "in {{what you}} say of the wild conduct of my {{brother-in-law}} Bonnet. It pleases <b>me,</b> sir, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you condemn it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the same}} time it gives <b>me</b> courage <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I have {{something}} with which to defend myself," [...] Jacob said, with a laugh which had in it nothing of mirth.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am truly {{obliged to}} you," [...] Captain Davenant said. [...] "It will make <b>me</b> {{comfortable}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> whatsoever may befall me, {{they will have}} a friend in these stormy times." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} {{explained the}} incident, saying, [...] "Justin {{was supposed to}} pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed." [...] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said [...] "My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [...] the NFL {{had no knowledge of}} this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention". Jackson later commented, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident" [...] when the statement was replayed in the media. A written statement read, [...] "The decision to have a costume reveal {{at the end of my}} halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand." [...] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, [...] "Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. He {{sent me a}} message. He wasn't {{satisfied}} with doing a dirty trick. He wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he'd done it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} do so," [...] the lawyer said, firmly. [...] "It {{will be a}} relief to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I have at least made a full confession." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{nothing would}} {{take such a}} load off <b>me</b> as <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{she was going to}} be well married. But as she don't like the young man well enough, I won't have her hardly used." ...|$|R
6000|$|The old {{sergeant}} as {{he entered}} ran up to him. [...] "Well done, my lad, well done! 'Tis a delight <b>to</b> <b>me</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you have so grandly made your way, and already won the rank of colonel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you all," [...] {{he said at}} last, in a choking voice, [...] "it is a {{consolation}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my {{old friends}} still believe in me; but, till my innocence is proved, I shall {{never be able to}} look the world in the face again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did not say}} so, sir. How can I {{answer for}} her? Only it was so {{pleasant}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you would approve if it should come off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} your meaning, June," [...] she then said; [...] "you wish <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> some one has treacherously told your people {{where and how}} to find the island?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, goodbye, Mr. Lindsay! Even {{if nothing}} comes of all this, {{it will be}} {{pleasant}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> at least, I have one faithful friend who was true to me, in my deepest adversity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{impossible}} to do the one without the other," [...] returned Enfield. [...] "And by the way, what an ass you must have thought <b>me,</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll's! It was partly your own fault that I found it out, even when I did." ...|$|R
60|$|LEXY. Yes. I {{passed him}} in the park, arguing with somebody. He gave me good day and asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> let you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he was coming.|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Percival came to Sir Percydes {{and he put}} his arm {{about him}} and kissed him upon either cheek, and he said: [...] "Should I obtain the kind regard of <b>that</b> lady, I <b>know</b> nothing <b>that</b> would more rejoice <b>me</b> than <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> thou art her brother. For, indeed, I {{entertain}} a great deal of love for thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{must confess}} frankly that I have not {{reflected}} on my motives,” I said. “It {{is enough for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they are not dishonourable and that anybody can see {{they are not the}} motives of an adventurer seeking some sordid advantage.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{but because}} they are {{weaknesses}} I don't have. I have others, but not those, and it is sweet to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you are weak in some matters in which I am strong. It makes me feel that I can be of use to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{he wanted}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> {{and he wanted}} me to know also that the {{knowledge}} had come to me from my bishop. I should have thought evil of any one who had sent me the vile ribaldry. But coming from him, it fills me with despair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not as {{she says}} it. She says he's full of attention, {{perfectly}} devoted--looks after her all the while. She seems <b>to</b> want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> it, so <b>that</b> I may commend him for it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{brother has}} just arrived," [...] he announced. [...] "I {{think that he}} has motored down from London. He wished <b>me</b> <b>to</b> let you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he was here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you {{are going}} <b>to</b> {{misunderstand}} <b>me!</b> Of course, {{you are not a}} trouble <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I love you better than anything in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} use wishing, Jervoise. We {{have heard}} enough here, of what the troops have been {{suffering}} through the winter, for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> if I had had my wish and gone with you, my bones would now be lying somewhere under the soil of Livonia." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] Julian said earnestly. [...] "It may {{not come}} for a long time, {{but it will be}} {{something}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> some day or other my name will be cleared of this horrible accusation; but I would rather have gone and faced it out now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle, I do {{not deserve}} {{a word from}} you, but it desolates <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I have grieved the little angel who is too dear to me. For her sake, pardon that I spoke my heart in spite of prudence, and permit me to send her this." ...|$|E
6000|$|The slaves {{went away}} well contented, {{and the boy}} and Cap'n Joe now came forward to greet their visitors. [...] "We're on our way home," [...] {{explained}} Cap'n Bill, [...] "an' we don't expec' to travel this way again. But it pleases <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> Joe, <b>that</b> you're the king o' such a fine castle, an' I'll rest easier now that you're well pervided for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} has been some fault; but Flo, dearest, listen <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I would ask you to do nothing from which a woman should shrink." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted the}} men of Helium <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> and <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> their beloved princess was here, too, for I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> this {{knowledge}} would inspire them to even greater deeds of valor than they had performed in the past, though great indeed must have been those which won for them a way into the almost impregnable palace of the tyrant of the north.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{look after}} him if {{anything}} does happen, won't you?" [...] The woman's eyes were pleading with her. They {{seemed to have}} grown larger. [...] "You know what I mean, dear, don't you?" [...] she continued. [...] "It will be such a comfort to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it's all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have heard, Mr. Elliot, {{that which}} makes me tremble for you, and for those whose life, I know, is bound up in you; and, tell me, were it well or {{friendly}} in <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> such things were said, that such danger existed, and not to warn you of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were always}} famous for your memory. There is no {{necessity}} for my repeating the words {{you spoke to}} your friend, and the words your friend spoke to you, hardly an hour since. When you read these lines, you will know, as well as I know, what those words told me. I ask for no particulars; I will take all your reasons and all your excuses for granted. It is enough for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you and Mr. Pendril have been searching for me again, and that Norah is in the conspiracy this time, to reclaim me in spite of myself. It is enough for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my letter to my sister {{has been turned into}} a trap to catch me, and that Mrs. Lecount's revenge has accomplished its object by means of information received from Norah's lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "God {{bless you}} for {{promising}} to come," [...] cried our client. [...] "It gives <b>me</b> fresh life <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> something is being done. By the way, I {{have had a}} letter from Lord Holdhurst." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To all thy severe {{opinions}} of sobriety and dignity of conduct, wouldst thou but feel sufficient interest in <b>me</b> <b>to</b> let <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my acts can give thee either pain or pleasure." ...|$|R
60|$|Later in the day, {{as the sun}} {{was going}} down in a welter of gold and crimson, she came out again and in its splendor I chose to read the promise of a noble future for Mary Isabel. It gave <b>me</b> joy <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she had taken up her life beneath the same roof and almost in the same room in which Isabel Garland had laid her burden down.|$|R
