25|$|On 20 July 1990 a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA {{exploded}} in the men's toilets behind the visitors' gallery. The area had already been evacuated and nobody was injured. About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49a.m., a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> {{he was a member}} of the IRA told Reuters that a bomb had been placed at the exchange and was about to explode. Police officials said that if there had been no warning, the human toll would have been very high. The explosion ripped a hole in the 23-story building on Threadneedle Street and sent a shower of glass and concrete onto the street. The long term trend towards electronic trading had been reducing the Exchange's status as a visitor attraction and, although the gallery reopened, it was closed permanently in 1992.|$|E
500|$|John Calvin Coolidge Jr. ( [...] ; July 4, 1872 – January 5, 1933) was the 30th President of the United States (1923–29). A Republican {{lawyer from}} Vermont, Coolidge {{worked his way}} up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, {{eventually}} becoming governor of that state. His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action. Soon after, he was elected as the 29th vice president in 1920 and succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923. Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a reputation as a small-government conservative, and also as a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> very little, although having a rather dry sense of humor.|$|E

500|$|Grant often poked fun {{at himself}} with {{statements}} such as, [...] "Everyone {{wants to be}} Cary Grant—even I want to be Cary Grant", and in ad-lib lines—such as in the film His Girl Friday (1940), saying, [...] "Listen, the last <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that to me was Archie Leach, just a week before he cut his throat." [...] In Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), a gravestone is seen bearing the name Archie Leach. According to a famous story now believed to be fictional, after seeing a telegram from a magazine editor to his agent asking, [...] "How old Cary Grant?", Grant reportedly responded, [...] "Old Cary Grant fine. How you?" [...] Despite his strong comedic qualities, Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was also very effective in playing darker roles, with a mysterious, dangerous quality, remarking that [...] "there is a frightening side to Cary {{that no one can}} quite put their finger on". Wansell notes that this darker, mysterious side extended to his personal life, which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} was headed by Detective Superintendent John Porter of Southampton Criminal Investigation Department (C.I.D.) In the 12months after the murder, police [...] "interviewed 30,000 people, took 2,500 statements and traced 500 {{people who were}} in the area {{on the night of the}} murder. At one point the list of possible suspects totalled 300 men." [...] Despite DeSimone's possessions being taken, police did not believe that robbery had been the motive; they were convinced that this was a red herring and that she was the victim of a [...] "vicious rape by a brutal and merciless killer". Police received two anonymous letters, postmarked 12 and 27 December in Southampton which gave information regarding the location of the killer. The writer was never identified, and the eventual arrest of Hodgson led police to dismiss them as a hoax at the time of Hodgson's trial. Nine months after the murder, while Hodgson was already in custody for an unrelated offence, two anonymous telephone calls were made to the police in which the caller confessed to killing DeSimone. Porter released a statement to the Southern Daily Echo at the time in which he said: [...] "The calls came from a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that he had committed the murder. He gave the impression that he was under severe strain and was asking for help and advice. From the nature of his conversation we think there is a possibility that the calls could be genuine." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening song, [...] "And It Stoned Me", {{was written}} about {{feelings}} of ecstasy received from witnessing and experiencing nature, in a narrative describing a rural setting with a county fair and mountain stream. Morrison said he based it on a quasi-mystical experience he {{had as a}} 12 year old fishing in the Comber village of Ballystockart, where he once asked for water from an old <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> he had retrieved it from a stream. [...] "We drank some and everything seemed to stop for me", the singer recalled, adding that it induced a momentary feeling of quietude in him. According to Hinton, these childhood images foreshadowed both spiritual redemption and—in Morrison's reference to [...] "" [...] in the chorus—sexual pleasure. AllMusic's Tom Maginnis argued that the singer was instead likening the experience to the first time hearing jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. The largely acoustic title track featured piano, guitar, saxophone, electric bass, and a flute over-dub backing Morrison, who sang of an adult romance set in Autumn and imitated a saxophone with his voice near the song's conclusion. [...] "This is a rock musician singing jazz, not a jazz singer, though the music itself has a jazz swing", Hinton remarked, noting how its rhythm is played in triplets rather than rock's archetypical quadruple time signature. [...] "Crazy Love" [...] was recorded with Morrison's voice {{so close to the}} microphone that it captured the click of Morrison's tongue hitting the roof of his mouth as he sang. He sings in falsetto, producing what Hinton felt was a sense of intense intimacy, backed by a female chorus.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 1965 {{supporters}} of the philosophy began an effort to have press and media report on the change from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism. [...] In 1971 <b>men</b> (including Kranz) <b>who</b> <b>said</b> they changed through Aesthetic Realism were interviewed on New York City’s WNET Channel 13 Free Time show [...] and the David Susskind Show, which had a national syndication. The book The H Persuasion, published that year, contained writing by Siegel detailing his premise about the cause of homosexuality, transcripts of Aesthetic Realism lessons, and narratives by <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> they changed, describing both why they changed and how. In response to requests from men and women wanting to study Aesthetic Realism, Siegel designated four consultation trios, one of which, Consultation With Three, was {{for the purpose of}} teaching <b>men</b> <b>who</b> wanted to change from homosexuality. In 1983, five other <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> they had changed from homosexuality were interviewed on the David Susskind Show.

500|$|The Celtics were {{ahead by}} nine points with five minutes remaining; in addition, West was heavily limping after a Game 5 thigh injury and Chamberlain {{had left the}} game with an injured leg. West then hit one basket after the other and cut the lead to one, and Chamberlain asked {{to return to the}} game. However, Lakers coach Bill van Breda Kolff kept Chamberlain on the bench {{until the end of the}} game, saying later that he wanted to stay with the lineup {{responsible}} for the comeback. The Celtics held on for a 108–106 victory, and Russell claimed his eleventh championship in 13 years. At age 35, Russell contributed 21 rebounds in his last NBA game. After the game, Russell went over to the distraught West (who had scored 42 points and was named the only NBA Finals MVP in history from the losing team), clasped his hand and tried to soothe him. Days later, 30,000 enthusiastic Celtics fans cheered their returning heroes, but Russell was not there: the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> he owed the public nothing ended his career and cut all ties to the Celtics. It came as so surprising that even Red Auerbach was blindsided, and as a consequence, he made the [...] "mistake" [...] of drafting guard Jo Jo White instead of a center. Although White became a standout Celtics player, the Celtics lacked an All-Star center, went just 34–48 in the next season and failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 1950. In Boston, both fans and journalists felt betrayed, because Russell left the Celtics without a coach and a center and sold his retirement story for $10,000 to Sports Illustrated. Russell was accused of selling out the future of the franchise for a month of his salary.|$|E

2500|$|Late in 1986, before commencing {{work on a}} new INXS {{album and}} while {{supposedly}} taking an eight-month break, their management decided to stage the Australian Made tour {{as a series of}} major outdoor concerts across the country.

To promote the tour, Hutchence and Barnes shared vocals on: The Easybeats cover [...] "Good Times" [...] and [...] "Laying Down the Law" [...] which Barnes cowrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly. [...] "Good Times" [...] was used as the theme for the concert series of 1986–1987.

[...] Matthews reports that [...] "there were a class of men among us who would rob the dead... men who did not entertain the thought of taking the shoes off the dead themselves, but who were in need of shoes {{and did not know}} where they could get any, would pay from $10 to $25 for a pair of second-hand shoes to the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>said,</b> usually, that he had bought them and that they did not fit." [...] Some became so desperate by 1863 that they resorted to scrounging old shoes from abandoned campsites that had been exposed to the elements for six months or more.

Ratzinger returned to the Gymnasium in Traunstein. During this period in the seminary, following his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was enrolled in the Hitler Youth, as membership was legally required in effect beginning 25 March 1939. Following the seminary closure he continued required attendance with the Hitler Youth to avoid financial penalties in the Gymnasium tuition fees. The financial penalty (which theoretically required documentation of attendance at Hitler Youth activities) was overlooked when a sympathetic mathematics professor allowed him not to attend any meetings. In Ratzinger's book Salt of the Earth, Ratzinger says the following [...] "... Thank goodness, {{there was a very}} understanding mathematics teacher. He himself was a Nazi but an honest <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> to me, 'Just go once and get the document so [...] that we have it' ...

2500|$|Soon afterward, {{along with}} the stories about Hammett, another series of news reports start {{to appear in the}} press which hint at various sex scandals {{regarding}} Ferrier's wife, Dagmar. They paint a picture of her as wanton and cavorting at clubs with a South American gigolo. These stories appear in The X-Ray News, which is sued for libel by Mrs Ferrier. The prosecution provides their first witness – the Bishop of Northumbria – who swears that Mrs Ferrier was at his palace recovering on doctor's orders on the dates mentioned by the newspaper. The second witness is a lady called Thelma Anderson who states that she was approached by a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> he worked for The X-Ray News and employed her to impersonate Mrs Ferrier. She was then photographed in various compromising situations. Mrs Ferrier wins her libel case easily and in doing so makes the public assume the rumours about Hammett were also fabricated. Poirot reveals to an astonished Ferrier that the idea to use Thelma Anderson was his and that Dagmar was in on the plan. The idea came from Dumas's book, The Queen's Necklace, but the real inspiration was [...] "The Augean Stables" [...] when Hercules uses a force of nature – in his case a river – to clean the stables out. Poirot used sex as the force of nature, first blackening Mrs Ferrier's name and then clearing her in a public fashion, resulting in a wave of sympathy which also reflected well on her father and destroyed The X-Ray News.|$|E
