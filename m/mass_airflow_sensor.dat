25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow off valve). Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The primary factor used in {{determining}} the amount of fuel required by the engine is the amount (by weight) of air that is being taken in by the engine for use in combustion. Modern systems use a <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> to send this information to the engine control unit.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} where a <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAF) is used and is located {{upstream}} from the blowoff valve, the engine control unit (ECU) will inject excess fuel because the atmospherically vented air is not subtracted from the intake charge measurements. The engine then briefly operates with a fuel-rich mixture after each valve actuation.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two common}} types of <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensors</b> in use on {{automotive}} engines. These are the vane meter {{and the hot}} wire. Neither design employs technology that measures air mass directly. However, with additional sensors and inputs, an engine's ECU can determine the mass flowrate of intake air.|$|R

50|$|Velocity air {{meters from}} Bosch have been {{commonly}} used on {{systems such as}} older Bosch L-Jetronic and {{as a part of}} many factory systems, though they now have mostly been superseded by <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensors</b> which have many advantages and are less damaging to engine volumetric efficiency (VE). Velocity air meters can be rather restrictive, particularly when engines have been modified for significantly greater airflow than stock (e.g. by fitting turbochargers or superchargers). Velocity air meters have the additional disadvantage that, once the door is fully open, there is no way for the sensor to measure further increases in airflow.|$|R
50|$|A {{compressor}} {{bypass valve}} (CBV), {{also known as}} a pressure relief valve or diverter valve, is a manifold vacuum-actuated valve designed to release pressure in the intake system of a turbocharged vehicle when the throttle is lifted or closed. This air pressure is re-circulated back into the non-pressurized end of the intake (before the turbo) but after the <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E
50|$|In fuel {{injected}} engines, the throttle body {{is the part}} of the air intake system that controls the amount of air flowing into the engine, in response to driver accelerator pedal input in the main. The throttle body is usually located between the air filter box and the intake manifold, and it is usually attached to, or near, the <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{hot wire}} <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> determines {{the mass of}} air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of the hot wire <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is similar to that}} of the hot wire anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over the wire or a constant current through the wire. The wire's electrical resistance increases as the wire’s temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past the wire, the wire cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire’s temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently, {{there has}} been a growing demand for flow-temperature sensors for industrial, automotive, {{domestic}} and medical applications. A quick response and low power consumption. Hot Wire <b>Mass</b> <b>Airflow</b> <b>Sensors</b> are used in automotive industry to measure the mass air flow intake into the internal combustion engine according to heat transfer principles. As the heat transfer process is sensitive both to the velocity and temperature of the air, any changes in temperature must be compensated for in order to achieve accurate mass flow measurements. In this paper, the development of a Fuzzy Temperature Compensation Scheme (FTCS) for Hot Wire <b>Mass</b> <b>Airflow</b> (MAF) <b>Sensor</b> is presented. This FTCS used to compensate the measurement error occurred by using Sugeno type FIS for temperature of 60 ¡C- 100 ¡C. In order to verify the performance of the proposed Hot Wire MAF Sensor temperature compensation scheme, first a simulation model is developed using Matlab/Simulink. Then, the algorithm for FTCS has been developed using Programming C Language and been implemented in hardware based real-time using Digital Signal Controllers, (dsPIC). The effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy compensation scheme is verified with the estimation error within only ± 1 % over full-scale value...|$|R
5000|$|The 2004-2011 Police Interceptor {{is rated}} for [...] mostly {{due to the}} {{addition}} of a new better flowing air intake system.

This allows for much more precise flow calibration and reduces the chances of air leakage. The P71 zip tube (the flexible rubber hose between the throttle body and MAF outlet) is also used to reduce NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) as well as transfer air from the airbox to the throttle body with minimal flow resistance. From 2005 on, the throttle body is no longer manually operated via cable but an electronic Drive-By-Wire (DBW) set up.|$|R

50|$|In many late model automobiles, a <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAF sensor) {{is used to}} {{accurately}} determine the mass flowrate of intake air used in the internal combustion engine. Many such mass flow sensors use a heated element and a downstream temperature sensor to indicate the air flowrate. Other sensors use a spring-loaded vane. In either case, the vehicle's electronic control unit interprets the sensor signals as a real time indication of an engine's fuel requirement.|$|E

50|$|Engines {{that use}} a MAP sensor are {{typically}} fuel injected. The {{manifold absolute pressure}} sensor provides instantaneous manifold pressure information to the engine's electronic control unit (ECU). The data is used to calculate air density and determine the engine's air mass flow rate, which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion (see stoichiometry) and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing. A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAF sensor) to detect the intake airflow. A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a MAF sensor on the intake tract pre-turbo and a MAP sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body.|$|E
50|$|In a dry nitrous system, extra fuel {{required}} is introduced through the fuel injectors, keeping the manifold dry of fuel. This property {{is what gives}} the dry system its name. Fuel flow can be increased either by increasing the pressure in the fuel injection system, or by modifying the vehicle's computer to increase the time the fuel injectors remain open during the engine cycle. This is typically done by spraying nitrous past the <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAF), which then sends {{a signal to the}} vehicle's computer telling it that it sees colder denser air, and that more fuel is needed. This is typically not an exact method of adding fuel. Once additional fuel has been introduced, it can burn with the extra oxygen provided by the nitrous, providing additional power.|$|E

The connections between <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> meter and ECU are simplified. Three variants of LE-Jetronic exist: LE1, the initial version. LE2 (1984-), featured cold start functionality integrated in the ECU, {{which does not}} require the cold start injector and thermo time switch used by older systems.

50|$|The AFR sensor {{operation}} {{can be thought}} of as being similar to the hot wire <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAF). But, instead of an MAF hot wire, the ECM tries to keep a perfectly stoichiometric air/fuel ratio inside the monitoring chamber by varying the pump cell circuit current. The sensing part at the tip of the sensor, is always held at a constant voltage (depending on manufacturer). If the mixture goes rich, the ECM will adjust the current flowing through the sensing tip or pump cell circuit until the constant operating voltage level is achieved again. The voltage change happens very fast. The current through the pump circuit also pushes along the oxygen atoms either into, or out of, the diffusion chamber (monitoring chamber) which restores the monitoring chamber’s air/fuel ratio to stoichiometry. Although the ECM varies the current, it tries to maintain the pump circuit at a constant voltage potential.|$|E
50|$|There {{is still}} some open debate on this issue, but some believe that a problem with short ram air intakes is that the air {{entering}} the intake is at a higher temperature due to {{the proximity of the}} engine, which may reduce some power. This may be partially offset by an increase in the volume of air entering the engine. To counter intake heat problems, many short ram intakes include some form of heat shield. Moving the intake inlet port further away from the engine block will also help to alleviate the problem and some users use a cold air intake where the inlet air is at or close to ambient temperature. However, others claim that Short Ram Intakes (SRIs) or similar Warm Air Intakes (WAIs) offer benefits over Cold Air Intakes (CAIs) which include better MPG due to a more complete burning of fuel. Users with forced induction engines often opt for short ram intakes because compressors adjacent to the engine, especially turbochargers, heat the incoming air and negate much of the benefits of a cold air intake. Additional problems can result from using a short ram intake in cars utilizing a <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> though most of today's sensors automatically adjust without issue. Turbulence in the intake airflow produced by the filter or piping, or a change in intake diameter {{at the point where the}} airflow is measured can produce inaccurate airflow readings. The error in airflow then translates to an error in the amount of added fuel. In the worst case, the air/fuel ratio can run lean, causing detonation and possibly engine failure although the airflow sensor will generally detect and correct the throttle to compensate for the warmer air. This can also be solved by modifying/elongating the intake piping, replacing the airflow meter, or by replacing/remapping the engine control computer to provide the correct amount of fuel for the intake airflow at all engine speeds.|$|E
40|$|In July 1995, National Science Foundation Award # 9551869 {{funded the}} {{development}} of a new inter-disciplinary microfabrication course under the primary leadership of Dr. Kevin Walsh at the University of Louisville. Along with this award, the completed construction of a new building in 1996 that contained a class 1000 / 100 cleanroom laboratory facilitated {{the development of}} the course. Moreover, curricula had to be completed to provide students with practical, hands-on experience in building Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices using processes and methodologies introduced in the course. Dr. Walsh wanted to include a <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> in his portfolio of total possible devices students could build in the cleanroom lab for the course. This document describes the design of a bulk-micromachined, monolithic, <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> with a thermally-isolated, thin-film, dielectric, microbridge/diaphragm design. In addition, several fabrication methodologies were explored, as well as a means to test and evaluate the sensors for this undergraduate class laboratory. The <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> architecture chosen was based upon a closed-loop-control,microelectronic thermal (hot-wire) anemometer design, which was first developed and presented by Johnson, Higashi, et. al. at Honeywell in the mid 1980 s [2]. Two separate photomask sets were developed using L-Edit™ software (by Tanner Research), with each set including multiple geometric variations of a dual/triple microbridge/cantilever flow sensor structure to be suspended over a precision, anisotropically-etched pit, integrated onto a (100) silicon substrate. Four primary structural fabrication strategies were explored to produce the thin-film material for the flow sensors: (1) RF planar magnetron sputter-deposited 1 m m -thick silicon nitride microbridges/cantilevers; (2) anodically-bonded-and-machined 20 - 30 m m -thick borosilicate glass diaphragms; (3) spin-on-glass microbridges/cantilevers; and (4) low-stress, 0. 5 m m -thick, LPCVD silicon nitride microbridges/cantilevers. Four resistor metallizations were separately evaluated: permalloy (Ni 81 Fe 19), chromium, titanium, and platinum. A process was developed and documented to successfully fabricate flow sensors with low stress LPCVD silicon nitride microbridges/cantilevers. DC planar magnetron sputterdeposited platinum thin-film resistors (with a ~ 120 nm-thick RF planar magnetron sputterdeposited chromium adhesion layer), with nominal thicknesses of ~ 56 – 70 nm, were delineated by photolithographic imaging techniques. The resistors had measured Temperature Coefficients of Resistance (TCR) in the range of 1. 93 – 2. 25 x 10 - 3 W /W /°C at 25 - 125 °C. Anisotropic KOH etching of the (100) -oriented silicon substrate was utilized to release the flow sensor microbridge/cantilever microstructures. After designing and building a flow sensor test machine capable of controlled volumetric air flow rates of up to ~ 15 SLPM (0. 54 m/s), nominal sensor sensitivities (SV) of up to 0. 67 mV/SLPM (20. 4 mV/(m/s)) were measured. The sensitivities varied somewhat depending upon resistor values set in the flow sensor heater-driver circuit and the insertion depth of the devices within the flow channel...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} design and {{operation}} of residential houses, indoor humidity is often left unregulated because, unlike temperature, {{it is more difficult}} to sense, quantify, and control. High indoor RH may increase the risk of respiratory problems such as rhinitis and asthma, reduce perceived air quality, propitiate mold growth, and cause building damages. Low indoor RH may cause discomfort due to dryness of nose, eyes and skin. Indoor humidity in each room of multizone buildings depends on the moisture generation by sources, moisture transport by air leakage and ventilation, moisture buffering by indoor finishing materials and furniture, moisture transport through the envelope, and moisture transport between rooms due to interzonal airflows. Most of these aspects have been extensively studied, but the moisture transport due to interzonal airflows through doorways or staircase openings has received less attention. The aim of this investigation is to study the interzonal air and moisture transport through a large horizontal opening in a full-scale two-story test-hut involving buoyancy-driven flows (due to temperature differences only) and combined buoyancy and forced airflows (due to mechanical ventilation). To accomplish this objective, experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed. The main parameters tested are the temperature difference between the lower and the upper rooms, ventilation strategies, ventilation rates and locations of the moisture source. Interzonal moisture exchange and interzonal airflows are analyzed based on two quantities that represent both phenomena, the difference between the average humidity ratios of the two rooms and the interzonal <b>mass</b> <b>airflows,</b> respectively. Experimental and CFD simulation results show that higher interzonal <b>mass</b> <b>airflows</b> and moisture exchanges through the horizontal opening are found when the upper room is colder than the lower room, while lower interzonal <b>mass</b> <b>airflows</b> and moisture exchanges occur when the upper room is warmer. Also, it is shown that the mechanical ventilation significantly restricts interzonal <b>mass</b> <b>airflows</b> in comparison with cases without ventilation.
