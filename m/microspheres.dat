5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive <b>microspheres</b> are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E

40|$|We {{focus on}} {{physically}} analyzing {{the origins of}} the numerical aperture (NA) and the spherical aberration of the <b>microsphere</b> with wavelength scale radius. We demonstrate that the <b>microsphere</b> naturally has negligible spherical aberration and high NA when the refractive index contrast (RIC) between the <b>microsphere</b> and its surrounding medium is about from 1. 5 to 1. 75. The reason is due to the spherical aberration compensation arising from the positive spherical aberration caused by the surface shape of the <b>microsphere</b> and the RIC and the negative spherical aberration caused by the focal shifts due to the wavelength scale dimension of the <b>microsphere.</b> We show that, only within the approximate region of 1. 5 <= RIC <= 1. 75 with the proper radius r of <b>microsphere,</b> the <b>microsphere</b> can generate a near-field focal spot with lateral resolution slightly beyond gamma/ 2 n(s) which is also the lateral resolution limit of the dielectric <b>microsphere.</b> The r for each RIC can be obtained by optimizing r from 1. 125 lambda/n(o) to 1. 275 lambda/n(o) Here lambda, n(s) and n(o) are the wavelength in vacuum and the refractive indices of <b>microsphere</b> and its surrounding medium, respectively.

In the present study, we evaluated the systemic augmentation of the antifungal activity of amphotericin B loaded in fibrin <b>microsphere</b> (AMB-fibrin <b>microsphere)</b> against cryptococcosis in Swiss albino mice. Mice infected with Cryptococcus neoformans were treated with 0. 5  mg/kg AMB-fibrin <b>microsphere</b> that was given alternately for 7 days.

25|$|Uterine artery {{embolization}} (UAE) is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure for treatment of uterine fibroids. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the femoral artery at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine arterty. A mass of <b>microspheres</b> or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) material (an embolus) is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block {{the flow of blood}} through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy bleeding tendency. The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE did not find any major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.|$|E

25|$|Selective {{internal}} radiation therapy (SIRT) {{can be used}} to destroy the tumor from within (thus minimizing exposure to healthy tissue). Similar to TACE, this is a procedure in which an interventional radiologist selectively injects the artery or arteries supplying the tumor with a chemotherapeutic agent. The agent is typically Yttrium-90 (Y-90) incorporated into embolic <b>microspheres</b> that lodge in the tumor vasculature causing ischemia and delivering their radiation dose directly to the lesion. This technique allows for a higher, local dose of radiation to be delivered directly to the tumor while sparing normal healthy tissue. While not curative, patients have increased survival. No studies have been done to compare whether SIRT is superior to TACE in terms of survival outcomes, although retrospective studies suggest similar efficacy. There are currently two products available, SIR-Spheres and TheraSphere. The latter is an FDA approved treatment for primary liver cancer (HCC) which has been shown in clinical trials to increase the survival rate of low-risk patients. SIR-Spheres are FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer but outside the US SIR-Spheres are approved for the treatment of any non-resectable liver cancer including primary liver cancer.|$|E
