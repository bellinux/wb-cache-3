5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic success {{can not be measured}} only by goods or gross domestic product, but <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> measured by human well-being. Aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E
5|$|The game {{development}} suite Unity {{can be used}} {{to create}} official Wii games; however, the developer must be authorized by Nintendo to develop games for the console. Games <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> accepted by Nintendo to be sold.|$|E

5|$|Age of Empires {{requires}} the player {{to develop a}} civilization {{from a handful of}} hunter-gatherers to an expansive Iron Age Empire. To assure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technology. Resources <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, for example, trees that are cut down will not grow back.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is photosensitive, and {{containers}} {{are often}} covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it. Doxorubicin {{is also available}} in liposome-encapsulated forms as Doxil (pegylated form), Myocet (nonpegylated form), and Caelyx, although these forms <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> given by intravenous injection.|$|E

5000|$|In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito {{stated that}} the wording {{of one of the}} clauses of the Act [...] "adds a further {{requirement}} of equal treatment irrespective of intent."

5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E
5|$|IQ classifications from IQ testing are not {{the last}} word on how a test-taker will do in life, nor are they the only {{information}} to be considered for placement in school or job-training programs. There is still a dearth of information about how behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores. For placement in school programs, for medical diagnosis, and for career advising, factors other than IQ <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> part of an individual assessment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{holders of}} C (hunting) license may too {{transport}} their firearms only {{to and from}} the areas designated for hunting in a manner that excludes their immediate use.

5|$|National {{consistency}} of governance. In 1978 the Northern Territory achieved self-government. The ACT {{was the only}} other mainland territory, with a population greater than that of the Northern Territory that was growing faster, so it was suggested that if self-government was appropriate for the Northern Territory, then it <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> appropriate for the ACT.|$|E
5|$|The double bottoms {{are also}} subject to design constraints. The primary {{concern is that}} they be high enough to allow the passage of pipes and cables. These areas <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> roomy enough to allow people safe access to perform surveys and maintenance. On the other hand, {{concerns}} of excess weight and wasted volume keep the double bottoms very tight spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> considered within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities {{that need to}} remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It {{is also important to}} keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E
50|$|Recent work {{suggests}} that the area outside the South Ireland End Moraine was inundated by Irish Ice {{during and after the}} LGM. At the same time parts of the area outside the South Wales End Moraine <b>must</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> inundated by ice.|$|R

5|$|There is no {{minimum age}} requirement, but {{passengers}} {{must meet the}} miniumum height requirement of 52inches and a maximum of 78inches to ride. Some persons over a certain weight/waist size will {{not be permitted to}} ride if the seat and lapbar harness cannot accommodate them. Passengers on Maverick may not bring any loose articles onto the train and will be required to wear shirts and footwear. Headphones must be removed before boarding. Glasses <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> secured by an athletic strap.|$|E
5|$|To be {{a member}} of the university, all students, and most {{academic}} staff, <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> a member of a college or hall. There are 38 colleges of the University of Oxford and six Permanent Private Halls, each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities. Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} the equilibrium constant for this reaction, {{in which the}} ligand loses a proton, the pKa of the protonated ligand must be known. In practice, the ligand may be polyprotic; for example EDTA4− can accept four protons; in that case, all pKa values must be known. In addition, the metal ion is subject to hydrolysis, that is, it behaves as a weak acid, so the pK values for the hydrolysis reactions <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> known.|$|E

5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> a member of that set), it must be associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.|$|E
5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E
