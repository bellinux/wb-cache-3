5000|$|The meteogram, {{also known}} as the <b>meteorogram,</b> is one {{application}} of the time-series graph. [...] Climate and weather are ideally suited for display using time-series techniques {{because of the way the}} variables change with time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{meteorograph}} {{recording of}} weather variables [...] "as they happen" [...] is simply another application of time-series. Examples are the barograph, wind, or thermograph traces, and early upper air soundings. [...] The mechanical meteorograph, {{which was used}} {{to take the first}} atmospheric soundings above the surface, traced the data in a series of lines similar to the seismograph, became known as a <b>meteorogram</b> of the sounding data.|$|E
50|$|Saucier {{described}} {{the use of}} <b>meteorogram</b> charts to analyze surface weather data with respect to time. It is a simple extension to project these variables into the future {{using data from the}} forecast models and produce the modern meteogram. So, meteograms have evolved to mean any group of meteorological variables graphed with respect to time, whether observed or forecast, usually confined to surface variables, though some include time-height charts. Meteogram use increased in the 1990s with the growth of computing power. Now meteograms are created from various models and made available to forecasters through the Internet. In addition, researchers and operational forecasters have the capability to make meteograms for their local use on their local computing systems.|$|E
40|$|Two cold fronts {{passed through}} central Oklahoma in late 2006, one on 29 November {{and the other}} on 7 December. <b>Meteorograms</b> for Norman, OK, show the two frontal {{passages}} had very different characteristics. The late November event was a textbook example, with the windshift and rapid temperature drop very close together in time. On the other hand, the early December event was unusual, showing a temperature rise after cold frontal passage. The reasons for this behavior in the December case are shown {{to be associated with the}} time of day and the ambient conditions in the planetary boundary layer at the time of the frontal passage. Shear-induced turbulence within the nocturnal boundary layer is likely responsible for the seemingly paradoxical initial temperature rise following passage of the cold front...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} this {{simultaneous}} {{study of the}} weather and the rapid centralization of meteorological observations by radio there is obtained a complete survey of the weat,her from one extreme of the Republic to the other. Each clay at noon the Oficina Meteorol 6 gica de la Avia. ci 6 n issues through the radio station El Bosque a <b>meteorogram</b> witfh information of the wea,ther, a,nd forecasts, for each zone of the country. The weather dat,a. are noted on blackboards and bulletin boards near the nieteorological maps. In addition to this regular service there is given to every pilot on request a <b>meteorogram</b> setting forbh the state of the atmosphere along the proposed route at the time. If a pilot must depart from Arica he collects informatio...|$|E
