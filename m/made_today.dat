5|$|Yankovic {{desired to}} release the song on a record label, {{although}} no label wanted to sign him at the time. Thus, Yankovic borrowed some money from Dr. Demento and pressed up one thousand copies of the four-track EP by himself. Yankovic then distributed the EP to various record stores, selling them through consignment deals. Yankovic released the record under Placebo Records, a one-off label founded by Yankovic {{for the sole purpose}} of distributing the EPs. Due to the underground success of the record, Yankovic was eventually able to secure a short-lived record deal with TK Records, who released the title song as a single. Due to the fact that only one thousand copies of the Another One Rides the Bus EP were <b>made,</b> <b>today</b> it is considered a very rare record to locate.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{origins of}} bitters {{can be traced}} back as far as the ancient Egyptians, who may have infused medicinal herbs in jars of wine. This practice was further developed during the Middle Ages, where the availability of distilled alcohol coincided with a renaissance in pharmacognosy, which made possible far more concentrated herbal bitters and tonic preparations.

25|$|Cauim is a {{traditional}} alcoholic beverage of the Native American populations of Brazil since pre-Columbian times. It is still <b>made</b> <b>today</b> in remote areas throughout Panama and South America. Cauim {{is very similar to}} chicha and it is also made by fermenting manioc or maize, sometimes flavored with fruit juices. The Kuna Indians of Panama use plantains. A characteristic feature of the beverage is that the starting material is cooked, chewed, and re-cooked prior to fermentation. As in the making of chicha, enzymes from the saliva of the cauim maker breakdown the starches into fermentable sugars.|$|E
25|$|Yup'ik women roles {{included}} child rearing, {{food preparation}} and sewing. Skin sewing is artistic {{arena in which}} Yup'ik women and a few younger men excel. Everyday functional items like skin mittens, mukluks, and jackets are commonly <b>made</b> <b>today,</b> but the elegant fancy parkas of traditional times are now rare. The proper sewing of skins requires considerable and varied traditional knowledge and an intact extended family whose members help in hunting gathering, and processing the various components in addition to sewing. Women's tools include ulu, scraper, scraping board, needle, needle case, thimble, and pattern. There are many regional differences {{in the design and}} function of these tools.|$|E

25|$|Bird skin parka (tamacenaq in Yup'ik) {{made from}} skins of birds of the Alcidae, Anatidae, Gaviidae, and Laridae families. Bird skins make {{very good and}} warm parkas. Thick bird skin parkas were ideal winter wear but were also used during cold weather in summer. Yupik (Yup'ik, Siberian Yupik, Sugpiaq ~ Alutiiq) and Inuit (Inupiaq) Eskimo seamstresses had {{regional}} variations in bird skin preparation techniques and bird skin parka styles and bird skin clothing-production techniques. Bird skin parkas are rarely <b>made</b> <b>today</b> and the skill is quickly disappearing among skin sewers in their region. During the 19th century, many Yup'iks along the coast between the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers wore bird skins. Every year, one could afford to make a bird skin parka because birds returned in such abundance. A plump Yup'ik baby trussed up in eider skin smiled from a warm, dry, cushioned world.|$|E
25|$|The {{hand loom}} with the witch {{is typical of}} many {{that were used in}} the mills by cloth {{designers}} to develop new fabric designs and patterns. They are still used in the textile departments of universities and colleges for training students in weaving and the designing of fabrics. The shafts are lifted by a witch, an early form of dobby, with weights underneath to pull the shafts down, and can work up to 50 shafts to produce very complicated patterns. The weft is put in by hand using the flying shuttle method invented in 1733 by John Kay, and up to four colours can be woven in the weft using Robert Kay's (son of John Kay) 1760 invention of the multiple shuttle box. On this simple-to-operate loom the designer is able to explore the application of new design ideas before beginning production trials on a wider loom. Many of the designs for woven fabrics <b>made</b> <b>today</b> were developed and created long ago on similar narrow-width pattern looms.|$|E
25|$|Universal Disk Format (UDF) version 1.50 {{and above}} has {{facilities}} to support rewritable discs like sparing tables and virtual allocation tables, spreading usage {{over the entire}} surface of a disc and maximising life, but many older operating systems do not support this format. Packet-writing utilities such as DirectCD and InCD are available but produce discs that are not universally readable (although based on the UDF standard). The Mount Rainier standard addresses this shortcoming in CD-RW media by running the older file systems {{on top of it}} and performing defect management for those standards, but it requires support from both the CD/DVD burner and the operating system. Many drives <b>made</b> <b>today</b> do not support Mount Rainier, and many older operating systems such as Windows XP and below, and Linux kernels older than 2.6.2, do not support it (later versions do). Essentially CDs/DVDs are a good way to record {{a great deal of information}} cheaply and have the advantage of being readable by most standalone players, but they are poor at making ongoing small changes to a large collection of information. Flash drives' ability to do this is their major advantage over optical media.|$|E

Both MRP and MRPII are still widely used, independently and as modules of more comprehensive ERP systems, but the original vision of integrated information systems {{as we know them}} today began with the development of MRP and MRPII in manufacturing.|$|R
25|$|The {{traditional}} clothing system {{developed and}} used by the Eskimo peoples {{is the most effective}} cold weather clothing developed to date. Yup’ik clothing tended to fit relatively loosely. Skin sewing is artistic arena in which Yup'ik women and a few younger men excel. Yup'ik women made clothes and footwear from animal skins (especially hide and fur of marine and land mammals for fur clothing, sometimes birds, also fish), sewn together using needles made from animal bones, walrus ivory, and bird bones such as front part of a crane's foot and threads made from other animal products, such as sinew. The semilunar woman's knife ulu is used to process and cut skins for clothing and footwear. Women made most clothing of caribou (wild caribou Rangifer tarandus granti and domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus tarandus) and sealskin. The English words kuspuk (parka cover or overshirt) and mukluk (skin boot) which is derived from the Yup'ik word qaspeq and maklak. Before the arrival of the Russian fur traders (promyshlennikis), caribou and beaver skins were used for traditional clothing but subsequently, the Eskimos were persuaded to sell most furs and substitute manufactured materials. Everyday functional items like skin mittens, mukluks, and jackets are commonly <b>made</b> <b>today,</b> but the elegant fancy parkas (atkupiaq) of traditional times are now rare. Today, many Yup'ik have adopted western-style clothing.|$|E

Originally produced as a tougher, stronger and more improved version of the Winchester 1893, itself an improvement on the early Spencer pump gun, the 1897 was identical to its forerunner, except that the receiver was thicker and allowed for use of smokeless powder shells, which were not common at the time. [...] The 1897 introduced a [...] "take down" [...] design, where the barrel could be taken off – a standard in pump shotguns <b>made</b> <b>today,</b> like the Remington 870 and Mossberg 500 series.
