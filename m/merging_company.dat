5000|$|An {{acquisition}} or takeover is {{the purchase}} of one business or company by another company or other business entity. Specific acquisition targets can be identified through a myriad of avenues including market research, trade expos, or sent up from internal business units, among others. Such purchase may be of 100%, or nearly 100%, of the assets or ownership equity of the acquired entity. Consolidation occurs when two companies combine {{to form a new}} enterprise altogether, and neither of the previous companies remains independently. Acquisitions are divided into [...] "private" [...] and [...] "public" [...] acquisitions, depending on whether the acquiree or <b>merging</b> <b>company</b> (also termed a target) is or is not listed on a public stock market. Some public companies rely on acquisitions as an important value creation strategy. [...] An additional dimension or categorization consists of whether an acquisition is friendly or hostile.|$|E

50|$|Sociedade Central de Cervejas was {{established}} in 1934, {{with the aim of}} selling the beers produced by the former breweries, Companhia Produtora de Malte e Cerveja Portugália, Companhia de Cervejas Estrela, Companhia de Cervejas Coimbra and Companhia da Fábrica de Cerveja Jansen. In 1935, and after 99 years of activity, Fábrica de Cervejas Trindade was integrated by Sociedade Central de Cervejas (SCC). Centralcer - Central de Cervejas, E.P. is incorporated in 1977 {{as a result of the}} merger of Sociedade Central de Cervejas, S.A.R.L. (incorporated in 1934) with Cergal - Cervejas de Portugal, S.A.R.L. (incorporated in 1972). Centralcer - Central de Cervejas, S.A. was therefore created as a result of the above-mentioned company’s conversion into a joint stock company, regulated according to Decree-Law no. 300/90 of 24 September. The Company’s total share capital is privatised in 1990, and it is the first operation of this kind to be undertaken in Portugal. The Bavaria Group purchases a shareholding in Centralcer - Central de Cervejas, S.A., and becomes one of its main shareholders. In 2000, there is a further alteration to the company’s shareholding structure, as a result of its sale to VTR-SGPS, S.A., a group of Portuguese investors (Parfil, BES, Fundação Byssaia Barreto, Olinveste and Fundação Oriente), amongst whom are the inheritors of SCC’s founding shareholders. In its turn and in the summer of the same year, this group assigned a 49% share to the international brewing group Scottish & Newcastle. In terms of the Group’s organisation restructuring, the merger of Centralcer - Central de Cervejas, S.A. in Centralcontrol S.G.P.S., S.A. (<b>merging</b> <b>company)</b> was concluded in December 2001. The new merged entity changed its corporate denomination to SCC - Sociedade Central de Cervejas, S.A., as well as its head office, which is now located at the factory premises. In 2003, Scottish & Newcastle purchases Parfil’s total shareholding, assuming total control of Sociedade Central de Cervejas and Sociedade da Água de Luso. In December 2004, the Company became known as SCC - Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas, S.A., a name that reflects in a better way, the scope of its activity, which not only includes beer, but also other drinks, such as water and soft drinks. In 2007, after a consortium was set up between Carlsberg and Heineken a takeover bid was made for the acquisition of the Scottish & Newcastle Group. As a result of the negotiations, the acquisition was accomplished, with Heineken taking over the control of Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (SCC) on 29 April 2008, following the conclusion of the Consortium’s acquisition of Scottish & Newcastle (S&N). This consortium was dissolved after the deal was completed and the traditional healthy relationship between both groups remained untouched.|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Law and awarded by Brunel University. Across six Chapters, this thesis examines the legal effects of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) on the employees, Board of Directors and shareholders of companies {{with the objective of}} gaining in-depth understanding of this area. The thesis then develops legal and practical solutions for the problems and negative effects associated with M&As, specifically regarding employees, Boards of Directors and shareholder companies involved in such operations. This research determines to answer the following question: How do mergers and acquisitions (M&As) affect employees, management and shareholders rights and obligations? And what the legal basis for transferring their rights and liabilities between companies involved in M&As? Despite the importance of M&As as a means of economic concentration and emergence in terms of major commercial or industrial projects, the laws of both the UAE and Qatar do not sufficiently address the issue of mergers or their goals and conditions. They also fail to regulate acquisitions or to otherwise specify when acquisitions become necessary for companies. Furthermore, the laws do not specify the rights of workers regarding their knowledge of or participation in M&As or developed adequate solutions for the negative impacts on companies workers in such processes. These laws do not provide the right for the Board of Directors of the transferor company to merge with the Board of Directors of the transferee company. Additionally, they also unsuccessfully address the minority shareholders right (those not interested in the merger) to exit the merged company and recover the value of their shares. Moreover, the UAE and Qatar have not developed appropriate solutions for the exchange of shares between companies involved in mergers in the case of dissimilarity between the actual values of the shares of both companies. This has notably led to jurisprudence and judiciary confusion between the concept of M&As, their legal nature and the legal basis or theory for the transfer of the rights and liabilities of employees, management and shareholders between companies involved in M&A operations. In accordance with legal texts, the above discussion, M&A legal theory and the theory of the agency contract between a company and its Board of Directors, the thesis argues that M&As should not lead to cutting labour contracts or negatively affect employee rights as long as corporate ventures remain in place and M&A operations do not lead to the liquidation of merged or acquired companies. Also, the thesis shows that a company is linked with its Board of Directors through a special form of agency contract, which justifies the transfer of the rights of the Board of Directors of the merged company with regards to the merging or new company management. The thesis also develops solutions and processes for the exchange of shares between merged companies when there are differences between the actual values of their shares, through the shareholders of the merged company buying shares from the <b>merging</b> <b>company</b> or by selling their shares to the <b>merging</b> <b>company</b> and recovering the value of their shares in cash. The study also recommends taking a set of procedural measures during M&As, modifying some of the relevant legal texts of the UAE and Qatar, which would mitigate the negative effects of mergers and acquisitions. Furthermore, this research suggests ways to improve such laws to reach the level of those of developed countries, in order to encourage mergers and acquisitions in the region...|$|E
40|$|Pesquisas foram {{realizadas}} em alguns países procurando-se verificar impactos causados no valor gerado para os acionistas de empresas adquirentes advindos de processos de aquisições no setor bancário. Neste contexto, o problema desta pesquisa é analisar se aquisições ocorridas entre 1995 e 2004 de bancos comerciais e bancos múltiplos, atuantes no Brasil, ocasionaram um retorno anormal nas ações dos respectivos bancos adquirentes, também atuantes no país. Em termos de metodologia científica utiliza-se a metodologia de estudo de evento. Nesta abordagem, utilizou-se um modelo de mercado para o cálculo dos retornos esperados e o teste de Corrado (1989) para verificar a significância dos retornos anormais. Para as aquisições de bancos comerciais e múltiplos ora analisadas, não se constatou nenhum movimento anormal por parte dos investidores, ou seja, os retornos das ações destes bancos não apresentaram retornos anormais estatisticamente significativos. Isto não significa que estes processos de aquisições não geraram valor para os acionistas, mas que, dentro do universo então investigado, se constatou que, no momento da aquisição, a percepção do mercado acionário não foi positiva nem negativa, considerando-se as respectivas aquisições como um todo. Researches {{were carried}} out in some countries trying to check impacts caused in the value to the shareholder from the <b>merging</b> <b>company</b> deriving from acquisitions process in the bank sector. In this context, the problem {{of this research is}} analyze if the acquisitions that happened between 1995 and 2004 from commercial and multiple banks, operating in Brazil, caused an abnormal return in the shares from the respective buyer banks, also operating in Brazil. In terms of scientific methodology, an event study methodology is used. In this approach of event study, a market model for the calculation of the waited returns was used and the test of Corrado (1989) was used to verify the significance of those abnormal returns. For the acquisitions of commercial and multiple banks analyzed, no abnormal movement {{on the part of the}} investors was evidenced, or either, the returns of the shares of these banks had not presented significant statistics abnormal returns. It doesnt mean that these processes of acquisitions had not generated value for the shareholders, but that, inside of the investigated universe, we could evidence that, at the moment of the acquisition, the perception of the shareholding market was not positive and nor negative, considering the respective acquisitions as a whol...|$|E

40|$|Although {{there are}} many methods to {{accomplish}} reorganisations, and these methods {{may be used in}} combination, there are broadly speaking two categories of such transactions. First, two or more companies may merge. At least one of the merging companies is dissolved and both of the undertakings form part either of a newly formed company, or of the <b>merging</b> <b>company,</b> which does not cease to exist. Second, an undertaking may be purchased. There are two methods to achieve this: control over a company can be established by a takeover of its undertaking ('asset deal') or by obtaining enough shares in a company to control it in general meeting ('share deal'). Unlike share deals and mergers, asset deals do not remodel or vary membership rights. When referring to an 'undertaking' my intention is to refer to the company's enterprise as such in all its components. As of today there are no comprehensive provisions in the South African Companies Act ('CA') 1 that regulate the transfer of assets and liabilities in a pure asset deal. The only provision referring to asset deals is s 228 CA. Said section is mainly concerned with the authority of directors to dispose of assets or part of an undertaking where such transactions are of a certain size. Further, s 197 of the Labour Relations Act 2 and s 34 of the Insolvency Act 3 may apply if a company alienates business assets. With the coming into effect of the Swiss Merger Act ('SMA') 4 on July 1 2004, a new mechanism for 'the transfer of assets and liabilities' respectively the transfer of a company's undertakings was created. It applies to any entity or person registered in the Commercial Registry. 5 The major advantage of this new instrument is that all assets and liabilities are transferred to the transferee by operation of law upon registration of said transaction with the I will conclude with a comparison of the transfer of assets and liabilities under the SMA and under s 313 CA. The latter provision deals with reconstructions and amalgamations and involves rearrangement of membership rights as such it {{is beyond the scope of}} pure asset deals. Nevertheless, the comparison is an interesting one, especially as the prospective Companies Bill, 20078 seems to adopt a similar model to implement pure asset deals...|$|E
