40|$|BACKGROUND Finding {{the right}} balance between tibial {{coverage}} and minimal implant overhang {{is an important factor}} in TKA. Another significant cause of failure is component malrotation. METHODS An average <b>master</b> <b>shape</b> of the proximal tibia at TKA resection level was calculated using fine slice computed tomographies of 117 cadaveric knees. To find out whether alternate implant contours would be necessary depending on the patient's body size, we established five subgroups to compare. CAD-Analysis was performed to simulate the overhang produced after ± 4 °/± 7 °/± 10 ° rotation. RESULTS A <b>master</b> <b>shape</b> for the tibial resection cut (with a 5 ° posterior slope, 7 mm under lateral joint line) could be determined. Neither left vs. right knee joint, nor male vs. female nor the size subdivision appears to alter the calculated <b>master</b> <b>shape</b> significantly. The optimized shape allowing for ± 4 ° of rotational freedom was found to be the best variant. CONCLUSIONS Valid methods have been obtained to design a two-dimensional average shape of the tibial plateau. The modifications described in this study might come in useful, when designing future implant designs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE An optimized fit at the tibial plateau and lower rates of component malrotation may result in better outcomes after TKA...|$|E

In this paper, inspired by Minimum Description Length (MDL), {{we developed a}} novel algorithm for automatic landmark building using an Entropy-based cost-function. The results are tested on four different datasets (metacarpal bones, heads of femur, silhouettes of facial profiles, and hand outlines), and compared with the original MDL constructed using the “one fixed <b>master</b> <b>shape</b> ” model approach. It {{can be seen from}} our preliminary results that, the new Minimum Entropy Model (MEM) conveys better than the MDL technique on the measures of Generalization Ability, Specificity and Similar Compactness. It also shows good potential in solving the so-called “run away” problem in MDL...|$|E

40|$|Folding of RNA {{sequences}} into secondary structures {{is viewed}} as a map that assigns a uniquely defined base pairing pattern to every sequence. This mapping is non-invertible since many sequences fold into the same (secondary) structure or shape. The preimages of the map, called neutral networks, are uniquely associated with the shapes and vice versa. Random graph theory is used to construct networks in sequence space which are appropriate models for neutral networks as they share most of the evolutionarily relevant properties with them. The theory of molecular quasispecies (in its simplest version) has been applied to replication and mutation on single-peak fitness landscapes. This concept is extended here by considering evolution on degenerate multi-peak landscapes which originate from neutral networks by assuming that one particular shape is fitter than all others. On such a single-shape landscape the superior fitness value is assigned to all sequences belonging to the <b>master</b> <b>shape</b> [...] ...|$|E

The technique is based on the standard lithographic process commonly used for pattern transfer onto a flat substrate. The essence of the technology presented here is the lithographic fabrication of a planar grating structure on top of a flexible membrane on a glass or silicon wafer and the subsequent deformation of the membrane using a <b>master</b> <b>shape.</b> For the validation of the proposed technology we fabricated several reflection concave diffraction gratings with the f-numbers varying from 2 to 3. 8 and a diameter in the 4 – 7 mm range. A glass wafer with circular holes was laminated by dry-film resist to form the membranes. Subsequently, standard planar lithography was applied to the top part of the membranes for realizing grating structures. Finally the membranes were deformed using plano-convex lenses {{in such a way that}} precise lens alignment is not required. A permanent non-planar structure remains after curing. The imaging properties of the fabricated gratings were tested in a three-component spectrograph setup in which the cleaved tip of an optical fiber served as an input slit and a CCD camera was used as a detector. This simple spectrograph demonstrated subnanometer spectral resolution in the 580 – 720 nm range. Electronic Instrumentation LaboratoryElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

Then, their photocatalytic activity in aqueous and gaseous phase was characterized using several models pollutant (formic acid, phenol and toluene). Some efficiency was correlatedto the electronic properties using Time Resolved Microwave Conductivity (TRMC) [2].

We highlight that similar distribution is obtained whatever the pollutant type and the studied phase (air or water).

This balance of capitalism and democracy, however, became unhinged in the seventies with the advent of supercapitalism, Reich’s term for the capitalistic system where companies have become more competitive, global, and innovative seeking the highest profits for investors and offering the lowest prices for consumers. Advances in communication, technology, transportation, and the concentrated power of innovative buying systems have created a far more competitive business environment. In this environment, corporations have become increasingly involved in politics and are now fighting in the political arena hiring “platoons of lobbyists, lawyers, experts and public-relations specialists” to shape government regulations to their advantage or the disadvantage of their competition. Their public relations <b>masters</b> <b>shape</b> the debates, while their money fuels the political process. In this relentless fight about economic gains investors and consumers profit. On the other side, however, the needs of the citizenry with an interest in social stability and the common good are neglected. Their voice is lost and their political impact marginalized. Reich supports his analysis with many examples. Reich indicates that our own dual nature being both investor/consumer and citizen is the problem; we look for a bargain, but close our eyes to the reality of its economic base, we may drive an SUV but deplore climate change, we look for high investment returns but fail to invest with a long term vision and moral insight.|$|R

It has been experimentally proved that the <b>master</b> curve <b>shape</b> does not depend on the loading rate. The relationship between reference temperature T 0 (or the shift of T 0 with respect to quasi-static loading rate) and loading rate can be described with linear dependence if logarithmic scale of temporal change of stress intensity factor is considered. For experimental establishing of the dependence of reference temperature on loading rates only two T 0 values as determined at different loading rates are sufficient. However,it is useful to achieve the comparable accuracy of both T 0 determinations that may demand larger number of specimens for the measurement of T 0 at the higher loading rate.
