In situ <b>metal,</b> <b>acid</b> and metal-acid (bifunctional) catalytic active functions were prepared following partial reduction by hydrogen of MoO 3 deposited on TiO 2 at temperatures between 623 K and 673 K. The bifunctional structure is obtained following the reduction of MoO 3 to MoO 2. The metallic properties of MoO 2 are attributed to the delocalized electrons above the Mo atoms place along the C-axis of the deformed rutile structure of this phase and observed as a density of states at the Fermi level. Hydrogen dissociation by this metallic function and bonding of the produced H atoms to sur-face oxygen atoms results {{in the formation of}} Brønsted acid Mo-OH function(s). Accordingly, a bifunctional (metal-acid) MoO 2 −x(OH) y structure is formed on the TiO 2 support. The bifunctional properties enabled to perform isomerization reactions of light naphtha hydrocarbons into branched species of higher octane number. This catalyst is proposed as a possible replacement of the commercially used Pt deposited on chlorinated alumina catalysts in which toxic chlorine is employed and benzene is produced as a byproduct of n-hexane isomerization. The acid function in this bifunctional Mo system is quenched following the addition of controlled amount of sodium. The presence of only the metallic function in this modified NaMoTi system is monitored via the hydrogenation of olefins and enabled to define the bifunctional mechanism of the hydrocarbon isomerization process performed by MoO 2 −x(OH) y structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} upgrading {{of crude}} bio-oils obtained through the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass remarkably improves {{the properties of}} the final bio-oil. It has been demonstrated that the impregnation of hierarchically structured ZSM- 5 zeolites with metal cations (Sn, Cu, Ni or Mg) promotes oxygen removal. Remarkably, the Mg-loaded hierarchical zeolite has led to the best fuel characteristics, achieving the greatest reduction in the oxygen-content and the lowest acidity. The promotion of ketonization reactions of acids with aldehydes to produce ketones seems to be favored over the Lewis acid sites created after incorporation of Mg cations at the ion exchange sites. A slightly lower deoxygenation rate is obtained for Cu-loaded hierarchical ZSM- 5 zeolite. However, some subtle differences are identified. The most significant feature is the remarkable amount of evolved CO observed in the gas fraction. Thus, it could be assumed that decarbonylation of acids to aldehydes at Cu cations incorporated at ion exchange positions seems to be the prevalent deoxygenation reaction for this solid. Similarly, the preferential mechanism for O-removal using hierarchically structured Ni and Sn-ZSM- 5 zeolites derived catalysts seems to proceed through decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions at the <b>metal</b> <b>acid</b> Lewis sites. Although a prevalent reaction mechanism could not be identified, lower cation incorporation at ion exchange positions could explain the inferior deoxygenation rate. In all the cation-loaded hierarchical zeolites, the incorporation of metallic species at the ion exchange sites decreases the production of desired aromatics and this is linked with a lower amount of Brønsted acid sites.

Those removed heavy metals can be also be recovered and reused, saving raw materials and cost. However, the wastewater sometimes contains a mixture of different metal species which proves to be challenging in recovering individual metals. There is also more interest in heavy metal recovery from solid waste, especially electronic waste, {{which is one of the}} fastest growing waste in the world today and a high portion of it is made of <b>metal.</b> <b>Acid</b> leaching or bioleaching can solubilize metals, however this process often releases a mixture of metals into the solution, therefore selective adsorption could play an important role in the development of downstream process in metal recovery. Chelating resin-Suqing, Chitosan and NH 2 MCM 41 have been selected to study their selectivity in metal adsorption, each representing a different category of adsorbents. copper sulfate, nickel sulfate and zinc sulfate were selected as the metal species to relate this study of recovering metals from bioleaching solution of Printed Circuit Boards using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, furthermore sulfuric acid is a well-known industrial leaching agent so it is worth investigating the metal sulfate adsorption system. Binary component adsorption system of different metal combinations was tested. It was found that copper was the most preferred metal to be adsorbed in all 3 adsorbents. NH 2 MCM 41 is able to separate all 3 metals completely whereas Suqing and Chitosan adsorbed Ni and Zn at 1 : 1 ratio. Suqing has selectivity in the order of Cu>Ni>Zn but in the case of NH 2 MCM 41 and Chitosan, it is Cu>Zn>Ni.

40|$|The {{global demand}} for energy, fuels and chemicals, {{along with the}} decline in fossil fuel {{resources}} has significantly led {{to the rise of}} renewable energy sources. In this regard, biomass represents one of the most promising, alternative resources for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. Biodiesel derived from plant biomass is a renewable fuel produced on a large scale over the past decade by the transesterification of oils. Glycerol {{is considered to be a}} promising three carbon feedstock, obtained in large quantities as a by-product during biodiesel production. Since glycerol can be obtained from renewable sources, it clearly emerged as a versatile feedstock instead of petroleum based chemicals. This generated a lot of interest in developing new valorisation technologies to produce high value tonnage chemicals from glycerol by sustainable processes. One such attractive application is the catalytic hydrogenolysis of glycerol to value-added chemicals such as propanediols and propanols. Due to the broad applications of these compounds, glycerol hydrogenolysis has been extensively studied in the past decade, both in liquid phase and in vapour phase, for which various metal-based catalysts have been explored, including supported Rh, Ni, Ru, Pt and Cu. Present research work is mainly focussed on the selective production of 1, 3 -propanediol and propanols through glycerol hydrogenolysis over platinum-based catalysts in vapour phase at moderate reaction temperatures and atmospheric pressure. In this work, various supported platinum catalysts have been synthesised by wet impregnation method. The supports used in the study include zirconia, sulphated zirconia, gamma alumina, aluminium phosphate, activated carbon, Y-zeolite, H-mordenite and SBA- 15. In addition, <b>metal</b> <b>acid</b> bifunctional catalysts such as Pt-HPAs/ZrO 2 and Pt-WO 3 /SBA- 15 have been synthesized via sequential and co-impregnation methods. The prepared catalysts were well characterized by various spectro-analytical techniques and the catalytic properties were evaluated for selective hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1, 3 -propanediol and propanols in vapour phase under atmospheric pressure. A detailed study investigated the influence of metal loading, reaction temperature, reduction temperature, glycerol concentration, hydrogen flow rate, feed flow rate, catalyst amount and time on stream studies. In addition, structural aspects of spent catalysts were also evaluated to study possible catalyst deactivation. The investigated catalysts exhibited moderate to high activity towards glycerol hydrogenolysis with optimal conversion and selectivity. Metal dispersion and acidity of the catalysts were found to be the key parameters for the catalytic performance of various supported platinum catalysts in glycerol hydrogenolysis as evidenced by the results obtained from various characterization techniques. It is proposed that glycerol hydrogenolysis proceeds via a two-step mechanism involving the dehydration of glycerol to 3 -hydroxy propionaldehyde over acidic sites and further hydrogenation into 1, 3 -propanediol over metal sites. The sequential hydrogenolysis of propanediols over strong acidic sites leads to the formation of lower alcohols such as 1 -propanol and 2 -propanol. The present study was successful in providing a sustainable and economically viable methodology to convert biomass-derived glycerol into value-added chemicals, such as 1, 3 -propanediol and propanols. The supported platinum catalysts were proven to be highly efficient catalysts for selective glycerol hydrogenolysis with excellent conversions and selectivities towards the desired products...|$|E
30|$|Inadequate {{wastewater}} management has resulted continuous discharge of heavy metals in the aquatic system. The heavy metals released in excess have significant adverse environmental impacts. These are toxic to many organ systems including the heart, bone, intestine, kidney, reproductive and nervous system, in varying degrees. Consequently, significant research attention {{has recently been}} focused on the environmental behavior of heavy metals. The heavy metals are easily concentrated by the food chain, which threatens human health. The heavy metals have entered into the atmosphere, water and soil through mining, electroplating, dyeing, tanning and metal processing industries in large scale [1, 2, 3, 4]. In drinking water, the authorized limit set by WHO for the three metals is chromium (0.05  mg/dm 3), nickel (0.07  mg/dm 3) and zinc (3.0  mg/dm 3). Therefore, it is necessary to remove heavy metals from the wastewaters before they are discharged into the natural water system. Various materials, such as (MnO 2 /CNT) nanocomposite, fertilizer waste activated carbon, waste materials, MWCNT/TiO 2 composite, alumina-coated CNT, orange peel/Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticle composite and agriculture waste, have been used to remove hazardous wastes from water [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Several other techniques have also been developed for the treatment of undesired waste containing heavy metals and dyes [3, 17, 18]. Among these, ion exchange technique is the most common and effective method for the treatment and identification of industrial wastes [19, 20]. The inorganic ion exchange materials are more stable to high temperatures and ionizing radiation than organic exchangers. For this purpose, first inorganic ion exchangers and later on organic resins have been used [21]. However, inorganic ion exchange materials have their own limitations, e.g., these materials in general are reported to be not much reproducible in behavior and fabrication of fine powder of it in rigid-type media suitable for column operations is quite difficult. Organic–inorganic hybrid composite materials, due to its exceptional chemical, mechanical and thermal properties as compared to pure inorganic and organic materials, have attracted a great attention in scientific community. Converting the organic and inorganic materials into an organic–inorganic hybrid composite with better properties is an economic method which has been a hot topic [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. The organic–inorganic hybrid composite minimizes the limitations of organic and inorganic materials by modifying individual properties of each of the organic and inorganic materials. These materials have been obtained by incorporating the organic polymers into the matrix of inorganic precipitates of multivalent <b>metal</b> <b>acid</b> salts [39]. Recently, use of organic–inorganic hybrid composite to separate metal ions has been discussed widely [24, 37, 40]. Therefore, organic–inorganic hybrid composite, cellulose acetate–tin (IV) phosphate, has been preferred to synthesize and use in heavy metal decontamination. This material has better granulometric properties, good ion exchange capacity, reproducibility and possesses good selectivity for heavy metals [21]. However, to our knowledge, {{there is little or no}} information about the preparation of cellulose acetate–tin (IV) phosphate composites (CA/TPC) and their use in separation and removal of heavy metals from electroplating wastewater. Thus, this study was aimed at developing a simple and efficient laboratory-scale adsorption technique to remove heavy metals such as chromium, nickel and zinc from synthetic and electroplating wastewater using cellulose acetate–tin (IV) phosphate composite (CA/TPC) material. The material was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. The adsorption mechanism was evaluated from kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics.|$|E
