40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} the extent of {{financial}} ratio communication from an agency theory perspective. Design/methodology/approach – An empirical positivist approach is utilised to explore the predictors of disclosure within the 2007 annual reports of 300 Australian listed companies. Findings – Overall, the extent of financial ratio disclosures is very low (5. 3 per cent) with more extensive disclosures within the sub-categories of share market measure, profitability and capital structure. A far lower liquidity and cash flow ratio information is reported. Larger firms with more dispersed share ownership provide more extensive financial ratio information than the others. Further, profit-making firms and Big 4 clients exhibit more extensive financial ratio disclosures. Resources firms present significantly lower incidents of financial ratio than the financials and services sector. Corporate governance and capital management initiatives do not have predictive properties. Originality/value – Financial ratio disclosure, although important, is under-researched. A comprehensive set of predictors are investigated. The findings highlight the need for Australian regulators to consider more explicit guidelines or mandatory requirements.

40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a new index called traffic incident <b>management</b> <b>ratio</b> (TIMR) for identifying appropriate roads {{to be installed}} with traffic incident management system. The TIMR {{is defined as the}} ratio between the expected total travel costs of the degradable transport network without and with traffic incident management programme (TIMP). The traffic flow pattern under the degradation network without TIMP is assumed to follow User Equilibrium (UE) condition, whereas the system optimum (SO) assignment is used to characterise the degradable network condition controlled by TIMP. The main function of TIMP considered in this paper is re-routing of traffic after the Incident. An optimisation programme Is then proposed for identifying critical roads in the network for an installation of TIMP. The critical roads for TIMP is identified by maximising the TIMR which implies that incidents on these critical roads can significantly increase the total network travel time without TIMP in which the installation of TIMP on these links can decrease the impacts significantly. The proposed model can also quantify the critical level of link capacity degradation. The model and algorithm are tested with a network to illustrate the application of the proposed model.

40|$|Abstract Background Job {{satisfaction}} in the hospital is an important predictor for many significant <b>management</b> <b>ratios.</b> Acceptance in professional life or high workload are known as important predictors for job satisfaction. The influence of social capital in hospitals on job satisfaction within the health care system, however, remains to be determined. Thus, this article aimed at analysing the relationship between overall job satisfaction of physicians and social capital in hospitals. Methods The {{results of this study}} are based upon questionnaires sent by mail to 454 physicians working in the field of patient care in 4 different German hospitals in 2002. 277 clinicians responded to the poll, for a response rate of 61 %. Analysis was performed using three linear regression models with physician overall job satisfaction as the dependent variable and age, gender, professional experience, workload, and social capital as independent variables. Results The first regression model explained nearly 9 % of the variance of job satisfaction. Whereas job {{satisfaction in}}creased slightly with age, gender and professional experience were not identified as significant factors to explain the variance. Setting up a second model with the addition of subjectively-perceived workload to the analysis, the explained variance increased to 18 % and job satisfaction decreased significantly with increasing workload. The third model including social capital in hospital explained 36 % of the variance with social capital, professional experience and workload as significant factors. Conclusion This analysis demonstrated that the social capital of an organisation, in addition to professional experience and workload, represents a significant predictor of overall job satisfaction of physicians working in the field of patient care. Trust, mutual understanding, shared aims, and ethical values are qualities of social capital that unify members of social networks and communities and enable them to act cooperatively. </p...|$|E
