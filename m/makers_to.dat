In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser <b>makers</b> <b>to</b> fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E

5|$|Movies {{were popular}} in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, with admissions of over {{a billion people}} in 1942, 1943 and 1944. By 1934, German {{regulations}} restricting currency exports {{made it impossible for}} American film <b>makers</b> <b>to</b> take their profits back to America, so the major film studios closed their German branches. Exports of German films plummeted, as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. The two largest film companies, Universum Film AG and Tobis, were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films. The productions were not always overtly propagandistic, but generally had a political subtext and followed party lines regarding themes and content. Scripts were pre-censored.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{developed}} during a {{growth in the}} Italian film industry which allowed for the market to expand beyond a local Italian audience, and would allow Italian film <b>makers</b> <b>to</b> explore new genres of filmmaking. Freda {{made a deal with}} producers at the Italian film studio Titanus to create a low budget horror film by writing a story in one day and filming it in two weeks. The producers agreed and Freda began filming. On the final day of shooting, Freda left the set which led to the cinematographer Mario Bava to direct the rest of the film, which changed various plot points and added the inclusion of stock footage.|$|E

On the other hand, the video showcased the recording of the song by Shreya Ghoshal. The video too received positive response. A still featuring Chaitanya and Samantha in an intimate sequence from the flashback was re-tweeted many times by the fans and Telugu film websites. A short teaser, 31 seconds long, was unveiled on 13 May 2014, in which Samantha was seen speaking about Nageshwar continuously at a doctors' check up and the montage of the film's male leads being played side by side.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s were {{challenging}} for Holden and the Australian automotive industry. The Australian Government tried {{to revive the}} industry with the Button car plan, which encouraged car <b>makers</b> <b>to</b> focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars. The decade opened with the shut-down of the Pagewood, New South Wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial Rodeo, sourced from Isuzu in Japan. The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive chassis cab models {{with a choice of}} petrol and diesel powerplants. The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the Isuzu TF. Other cars sourced from Isuzu during the 1980s were the four-wheel drive Jackaroo (1981), the Shuttle (1982) van and the Piazza (1986) three-door sports hatchback. The second generation Holden Gemini from 1985 was also based on an Isuzu design, although, its manufacture was undertaken in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{house in}} Lower Broadheath where Elgar was born {{is now the}} Elgar Birthplace Museum, devoted to his life and work. Elgar's daughter, Carice, helped to found the museum in 1936 and bequeathed to it much of her {{collection}} of Elgar's letters and documents on her death in 1970. Carice left Elgar manuscripts to musical colleges: The Black Knight to Trinity College of Music; King Olaf to the Royal Academy of Music; The Music <b>Makers</b> <b>to</b> Birmingham University; the Cello Concerto to the Royal College of Music; The Kingdom to the Bodleian Library; and other manuscripts to the British Museum.

5|$|Thiomersal (also spelled thimerosal, {{especially}} in the United States) is an organomercury compound used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Following a mandated review of mercury-containing food and drugs in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) asked vaccine <b>makers</b> <b>to</b> remove thiomersal from vaccines {{as quickly as possible}} as a precautionary measure, and it was rapidly phased out of most U.S. and European vaccines. It is still used in all multi-dose vials of flu vaccines in the U.S. In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the preservative caused autism.|$|E
