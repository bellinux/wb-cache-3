40|$|Reliability {{degradation}} {{analysis is}} {{the analysis of}} the occurrences of degradations and the times of maintenance to determine their reliability and risk implications. A program is presented for applying reliability degradation analyses to <b>maintenance</b> <b>data</b> collected at nuclear power plants. As a specific part of the program, time trending of <b>maintenance</b> <b>data</b> is illustrated. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>data</b> on residual heat removal (RHR) pumps and service water (SW) pumps at selected boiling water reactor (BWR) plants are evaluated to show how trends in <b>maintenance</b> <b>data,</b> which generally do not involve failures, can be used to understand effectiveness of maintenance. These trends also are translated to specific impacts on pump unavailability and on core-damage frequency (assuming that the trends in failure rate are the same as those observed for degradation rate). The second application shows the use of reliability degradation analysis to quantitatively evaluate the effect of maintenance, i. e., the quantitative change in component unavailability when no maintenance is performed. Assessment of these impacts are important since they measure the reliability and risk impacts of maintenance and can be fed back to the maintenance program to improve its effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} maintenance information management systems for maintenance decision support by industry has facilitated {{the collection of}} large volumes of <b>maintenance</b> <b>data.</b> Apart from enhancing maintenance decision support in aspects such as task planning or resource allocation, the data could assist decision makers identify the focal root causes of recurrent equipment failures. In this way, more effective strategies may be formulated and targeted at these focal causes. Despite the increased adoption of maintenance information systems and as such, availability of <b>maintenance</b> <b>data,</b> few techniques so far developed leverage on the <b>maintenance</b> <b>data</b> for decision support in root cause analysis. A particular focus in this regard relates to application of techniques for data mining such as association rule mining. In particular, association rule mining is attractive {{in the sense of}} analyzing failure associations embedded in the <b>maintenance</b> <b>data.</b> Thus, this study proposes a methodology for enhancing decision support for root cause analysis in maintenance decision making. The methodology leverages on two association rule mining algorithms - Apriori and Predictive Apriori. Moreover, the methodology incorporates a data standardization step, whereof standard terms and vocabulary are adopted from the ISO 14224 and used for standardizing the equipment failure descriptions. Thereafter, the standardized descriptions are applied as input to an association rule mining framework from which important failure associations are extracted and validated by experts for relevancy. After which, the extracted failure associations are used to generate causal maps, and from the maps, the focal root causes of the equipment failure are identified. The added value of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in the application case of thermal power plant <b>maintenance</b> <b>data.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
