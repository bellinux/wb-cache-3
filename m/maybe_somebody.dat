In the United States, it premiered on June 23, 2003, on VH1. Madonna had long {{been a fan of}} the work of French fashion photographer Guy Bourdin since about a decade ago, commenting on his photographs as [...] "They're so sick and interesting. These girls, you have to see the look on their faces — they're really bizarre." [...] Arianne Phillips created the costumes for the video and she described Madonna's looks as an homage to old Hollywood glamour, while trying to be literal as well as conceptual. She paid tributes to stars like Ginger Rogers, Jean Harlow and Mae West. According to Mondino's own words, the concept of the video was:"Some kind of artifice that Hollywood can provide, that is so wide and has a graphic story-line about it as well as some humor about it, and to show the beauty, the scariness, the sexiness and the loneliness that one's success can be, 'cause everybody's dreaming about Hollywood, no matter what.

It also includes her dripping in twenty million dollars worth of vintage jewels and gowns in several transformations, including an original 25 carat ring and bracelet that was worn by West in the 1933 film, She Done Him Wrong. A real doctor (Dr. David Kish) was hired by Madonna to administer the fake shots, since she wanted to make the scenes appear real. The first day of shooting took place on June 2, 2003, and the scenes shot included the wall-of-mirrors, the massage, the botox injection and the ballet dancing sequences. The next day started with the French maid, the motel TV, the telephone conversation and the glamour shot scenes. Henry Keazor, {{one of the authors of}} Rewind, Play, Fast Forward: The Past, Present and Future of the Music Video, noted that Madonna exposed herself during the interventions portrayed in the video, by playing with the rumors and the stereotypes surrounding her.|$|R

Gosh I wanted to be with you Easter Sunday. To be able to spend a whole day with you would be wonderful. It’s awful honey, I {{want to be with you}} so much and yet I want to get through with this training so I can get over there and get back as quick as possible. Honey don’t try to talk me out of wanting to go overseas because you can’t. It may seem strange to you but I’m going to do my damndest [sic] to get over there so I can get back here quicker and we can start some sort of a normal life together. So far it’s been pretty abnormal, a little too much so I think. Honey, we’re not even leading a normal abnormal life together; - we’re not even together. And now if they don’t send us home until Sunday after telling us we’d go home Saturday for sure, that will top it off. God damn it I’m P. O. ’d. I’d like to get stinkin’ tonight. Well anyhow my gunnery has been better. I got 177 hits today, the best score in the squadron. I just hope it’s not luck and I can keep it up. We’re firing for record sometime this week and that’s the score that goes on my form 5, (the one they look at when it comes to handing out nice juicey [sic] assignments.) I wish they’d take our highest score ‘cause 177 hits, the way they score us, is about 185 % and all we need to qualify is 30 % or about 27 hits. Well keep your fingers crossed baby and wish me luck, you sure have given it to me so far. I haven’t heard from Steve he doesn’t know when I am. I’m going to drop him a line though. I think he’s in a pool at Moody Field. Tom’s not worried about his glasses. He’s glad you didn’t send them since the mail situation is so screwed up. Honey that regulation you told me about doesn’t apply to us while we’re students at T. T. U. But all the married ones live off the post anyhow, it’s o. k. as long as we pay for our room in the B. O. Q. I mean they just don’t say anything about it. I don’t see how those fellows are going to have their wifes down here, we’re restricted all the time we’re here, <b>maybe</b> they know <b>somebody.</b> Even if I could have gotten off the post every night there’d be no way to get to you, there’s no transportation here at all. I’m glad you like the Officer’s Club, it’s pretty dumpy compared to some of the ones I’ve seen though. The one at Spence was terrific, decorated just like Astor Bar. It was really nice, I was there once with my instructor. Are you going to move to the front room? We can oil the bed, or maybe sleep on the floor. I’ll get you a footlocker at Craig if they have any. Why don’t you get one at the P. X. ? I’m glad you sent for your radio, I was going to ask you to. I mailed you the letter you Mom mailed to us. I hope you didn’t mind me opening it. I hope I can be back by Saturday, and early enough to go to the dance at the club. That sounds swell to me honey. Stop dreaming about having babies will you? Those are bad dreams for the time being anyhow, the “time being” meaning the duration. I’ll call you Friday around five baby, Gosh I hope we leave Saturday. I love you angel, with all my heart. Take care of yourself and don’t gain too much weight. I love you. I’ll love you always- Yours devotedly Judd P. S. - Please excuse this scrawl, I’m writing on my sack. I love you.

40|$|Making {{a profit}} from credit Cue: A private credit {{offering}} institution, like the Malawi Rural Finance Company, will soon {{go out of}} business if borrowers fail to keep up their repayments. Such companies need effective ways of maximising repayments, while also deciding how they will respond to natural disasters such as drought, which can greatly effect people?s ability to pay off their loans. Many institutions have realised that lending to groups rather than individuals can improve rates of repayment. The Malawi Rural Finance Company has also taken this approach, and supports the groups who borrow from it with a variety of training packages. Excello Zidana spoke to Charles Nangwale, Credit Officer of the Northern Region Branch, and asked him what mechanisms the company was using both to support the farmers who borrow from it, and to keep itself in business. IN:		?We know people are different? OUT:		?to improve their life standard. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 56 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Charles Nangwale explaining how the Malawi Rural Finance Company balances its goals, both supporting farmers and staying in business. Transcript Nangwale	We know people are different, we are born with different characters and we want these {{people to be able to}} work together. So the first thing is, we train them on group dynamics. And after that we train them on the particular farming activity or business they want to carry out. Then we teach them our credit procedures so that they understand how we want them to run the businesses, how we want them to repay our loans. Zidana	In any society there might be some people who are definitely not honest. If they fail to honour their loans what do you do? Nangwale	We are working to assist the people but at a profit. So we have tried to be a bit clever. During the training we teach those people to draw a constitution which is supposed to govern, you know, their group. So in that constitution they are supposed to outline what are they going to do should somebody fail to repay their loan or should <b>somebody</b> <b>maybe</b> passes away, what is going to happen? The first thing is those people themselves are going to take an action against whoever has failed to repay the loan. But then if the group has failed to do that, then we come in and that?s why, you know, we have things like loan agreements so that we know we can act on these people without any legal problems. Zidana		Now during the times of natural disasters like drought what do you do? Nangwale	Drought is unpredictable and you cannot prevent drought. We know this is a problem, it is not the customer?s making, it?s something that has just happened to him. So we give those people an opportunity to reschedule their loan so that they can repay it maybe in the next two years, should there be no drought that is again. Zidana	I understand that most lending institutions before they give out loans, they think of sureties. What does your company do in this regard? Nangwale	Yes we also require these people to give us what we call collateral. Of course we don?t require collateral for all the loans because Rural Finance has targeted everybody so we know there are people out there in the villages who cannot raise collateral. So for those people we give them loans which don?t require collateral. But for those people who want loans that require collateral, we require two types of collateral, cash collateral and material collateral. In cash collateral we require our customers to pay 20 % cash deposit of the loan they are looking for. And material collateral is supposed to be 150 % of the loan they are looking for. Zidana	But as you said that your main focus is on the poor of the poorest farmers. So when we go around you see people in the villages, they are still very poor and some even complain that your company tends to take other items as part of the whole strategy of loan recovery. Is this act aimed at helping farmers? Nangwale	Yes if you remember what I said, I said Rural Finance is a company which is there to assist the farmers and the general public as a whole. But then we are supposed to do that at a profit, because if we don?t make profit then we won?t survive. When somebody has failed to pay us back there must be a way of getting back our money you see because we are in business. Much as we want to assist the farmers they shouldn?t just take that as a grant, they should actually work to pay off the loan and to improve their life standard. End of tape.

50|$|The trial {{opened with}} the {{testimony}} of Elizabeth Ward, a well-known prostitute who described when and where the events started. Following her own account, in the evening on 6 October 1769, between nine and ten, she was sitting down on a step together with another woman in the Haymarket, when the other woman approached Baretti, who was passing through there, and Ward said she thought the other woman had touched him. Ward then accused him of having struck her. She said in that moment there was nobody around, but when she cried out three men arrived, namely Evan Morgan, Thomas Patman and John Clark. One of them asked Baretti how he could strike a woman and then a scuffle followed, Baretti ending up on the ground. Ward saw Baretti take out his knife, {{but she did not}} see him using it. She also said that then Baretti ran away and they ran after him. She saw him going into a shop in Panton Street. In cross-examination she was asked to give more information about the woman who was with her and Ward said she did not know her, but could only describe her physically. She was asked also more and more details, for example where the other woman put her hands when grabbing Baretti, and she answered she put them towards his private parts. This was possible because eighteen century breeches had some slits on the side, and prostitute often tried to slip a hand as a way of attracting a possible client.She added she did not know the three men who arrived, but that she remembered having kissed one of them (namely Clark) the night before. The court asked if Baretti had been insulted, she firstly denied, then seemed to be unsure, and added at the end that <b>maybe</b> <b>somebody</b> called him bad names, but she did not know who.|$|E

Elders, who were bearing grievances against other members of the community had to reveal them. Otherwise, there would be no peace in the village and the following sacrifices would remain void. After every elder had spoken out his problems, an oracle concerning the destiny of the village was performed. For this purpose, a fowl’s head was cut off, after it has been fed. The fowl did not die immediately: it still moved around headless for some time. The side, on which the fowl comes to lie at the end of its struggle indicates the future of the village. Does the fowl fall on the wrong side, foreseeing war, the village members continue to negotiate. <b>Maybe</b> <b>somebody</b> still has a grievance on his heart?

40|$|If {{you have}} a restless intellect, {{it is very likely}} that you have played at some point with the idea of {{investigating}} the meaning and conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics. It is also probable (albeit not certain) that your intentions have been stopped on their tracks by an encounter with some version of the "Shut up and calculate" command. You may have heard that everything is already understood. That understanding is not your job. Or, if it is, it is either impossible or very difficult. <b>Maybe</b> <b>somebody</b> explained to you that physics is concerned with "hows" and not with "whys"; that whys are the business of "philosophy" [...] -you know, that dirty word. That what you call "understanding" is just being Newtonian; which of course you cannot ask quantum mechanics to be. Perhaps they also added some norms: The important thing a theory must do is predict; a theory must only talk about measurable quantities. It may also be the case that you almost asked "OK, and why is that?", but you finally bit your tongue. If you persisted in your intentions and the debate got a little heated up, it is even possible that it was suggested that you suffered of some type of moral or epistemic weakness that tend to disappear as you grow up. Maybe you received some job advice such as "Don't work in that if you ever want to own a house". I have certainly met all these objections in my short career, and I think that they are all just wrong. In this somewhat personal document, I try to defend that making sense of quantum mechanics is an exciting, challenging, important and open scientific endeavor. I do this by compulsively quoting Feynman (and others), and I provide some arguments that you might want to use the next time you confront the mentioned "opinions". By analogy with the anti-rationalistic Copenhagen command, all the arguments are subsumed in a standard answer to it: "Shut up and let me think"Comment: Added footnote in p. 2, two paragraphs at the end of sec. 2. 1 and some names in the acknowledgements, corrected some typos, added a mention to collapse model...|$|E
