5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>systems,</b> {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of Jacob Bekenstein who had suggested that black holes have a well defined entropy. At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict {{one of the main}} postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. Intuitively, the unitarity postulate says that quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>systems</b> do not destroy information as they evolve from one state to another. For this reason, the apparent contradiction {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E

5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running due to very high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural <b>mechanical</b> <b>systems</b> to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would have probably shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding may mean that running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E

The New London Railroad Company, fronted by historian Barbara Timken and local businessman Todd O'Donnell, bought the station from the city as the New London Railroad Company in 2002. The pair organized a second full restoration of the station, including a new slate roof, restored brickwork, and restoration of the waiting room to its original configuration. The mezzanine level and basement atrium created in the 1976 renovation were removed. Additionally, <b>mechanical</b> <b>systems</b> were upgraded and various accessibility concerns addressed.
