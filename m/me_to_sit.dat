500|$|Wilkinson, by then Leeds United manager, {{returned}} to his former club in July 1991 to sign two young centre-backs, Jon Newsome first and Wetherall a few days later, for a combined fee of £275,000. The 20-year-old Wetherall's first season at Leeds was {{the final year of}} his degree course, so he played for the reserves while training part-time. He made a brief debut in the First Division, on 3 September 1991 at Elland Road as a late substitute against Arsenal; Leeds {{went on to win the}} 1991–92 league title. He remembers it as [...] "With 20 minutes to go, we were 2–1 down and I was on the touchline ready to go on, then Lee Chapman scored and the gaffer (Howard Wilkinson) told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down again. But he threw me on for the last two minutes. I always tell people that made the difference in winning the title!" [...] As his teammates took the league trophy on a celebratory open top bus tour, Wetherall chose to revise for his examinations, a decision he came to regret, because [...] "those experiences don't come around that often". Though the revision bore fruit: he graduated with first-class honours.|$|E
500|$|Gaga was {{the most}} {{nominated}} artist at 2010's Video Music Awards with a record thirteen nominations, including two nods for Video of the Year (the first female artist to achieve this feat). She arrived in an Alexander McQueen dress and changed into a Giorgio Armani number before donning her third and final outfit of the evening: a dress, hat, boots, and purse made of raw meat. Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for [...] "Bad Romance"; as she accepted the award from presenter Cher, she joked, [...] "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to hold my meat purse." [...] Gaga continued to wear the dress after the awards show for press photos and an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Gaga explained her interpretation of the dress to DeGeneres, stating, [...] "If we don’t {{stand up for what}} we believe in and if we don’t fight for our rights pretty soon we’re going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones." [...] "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really difficult for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," [...] DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote. [...] "But it did make me ask myself, what's the difference between her outfit and an outfit made of leather?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Carey {{signed a}} new record deal with Island Records and in 2005 she {{released}} her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi. It became the best-selling album of 2005 the United States, and the second best-seller around the world, with over 12 million units sold. It earned a myriad of music industry awards, and brought Carey {{back to the top}} of pop music following her commercial decline in 2001. After completing The Adventures of Mimi Tour, she began working on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC². E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the most}} anticipated albums of 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. Carey began writing and producing the music she saw fit, and not anything to please record executives. Throughout 2007, Carey recorded the album in a studio built into her private villa in Anguilla, in the Caribbean. She describe E=MC² as one of her most expressive albums, and one that she felt free on, and able to express herself through her music. In an interview with The Bryan Times, Carey spoke of her sentiments on the album [...] "It's hard for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> here and talk about it without sounding like if I'm bragging if I'm in love with it, but I am I love with this album. I think that having the success with the last record allowed me to have more [...] freedom...and just make records that I like. Its kind of a really fun record.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24 Scates {{moved from}} player to coach. When the UCLA volleyball coach took a sabbatical, he offered Scates the job. Scates was {{surprised}} but accepted. He then went to meet with Athletic Director Wilbur Johns. [...] "He didn't even tell <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down," [...] Scates recalled. [...] "I told him that I cannot accept a salary for coaching volleyball because I {{wanted to be in}} the Olympics in 1964, and at that time if you coached a sport for money or played for money you were not considered an amateur and couldn't participate in the Olympics. [...] "When he heard that he jumped up, shook my hand, and said, 'Congratulations, son, you're hired.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was through}} Lord Raneleigh [...] and the painter Frank Miles that I was first {{introduced}} to London society... I went to London and was brought out by my friends. Among the most enthusiastic of these was Mr Frank Miles, the artist. I learned afterwards that he saw me one evening at the theatre, and {{tried in vain to}} discover who I was. He went to his clubs and among his artist friends declaring he had seen a beauty, and he described me to everybody he knew, until one day one of his friends met me and he was duly introduced. Then Mr Miles came and begged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> for my portrait. I consented, and when the portrait was finished he sold it to Prince Leopold. From that time I was invited everywhere and made a great deal of by many {{members of the royal family}} and nobility. After Frank Miles I sat for portraits to Millais and Burne-Jones and now Frith is putting my face in one of his great pictures." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY CICILY. Oh, don't ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> doing nothing. It bores me so.|$|E
60|$|Duen. You seem thoughtful, sir. Let <b>me</b> persuade you <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down.|$|R
60|$|SURFACE. Sir--I beg {{you will}} do <b>me</b> the honour <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down-- I entreat you Sir.|$|R
60|$|I {{found myself}} {{suddenly}} {{on my feet}} and saying with the utmost politeness that I had to beg her permission to leave her alone as I had an engagement; but she motioned <b>me</b> simply <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down—and I sat down again.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a great}} relief, not to say a {{probable}} necessity, for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down just then.|$|E
60|$|I {{got up to}} go. With an ironical {{gesture of}} remonstrance, she signed to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, kind sir,' {{said the}} portly dame, much flattered by the proposal; 'it {{is not for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> with gentles like yourselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep us a'!" [...] she exclaimed; [...] "the lassie thinks her and <b>me</b> is <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down wi' the minister! We're no to gang that length, Babbie; we're just {{to stand}} and serve him, and syne we'll sit down when he has risen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said Marion. [...] "It will be {{pleasure}} enough <b>to</b> <b>me</b> just <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{here and}} look around me." [...] Then Hampstead knelt down between them, pretending to doctor up the fire, which certainly required no doctoring. They were standing, one {{on one side and}} the other on the other, looking down upon him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{makes the}} tenth,' said he, {{scrambling}} out and clambering into his saddle once more. 'My father used <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> a horse too closely. [...] "A gentle rise and fall," [...] {{said the old}} man. Egad, there is more fall than rise, and it is anything but gentle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was kept}} here for Grandfather and <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in together," [...] said little Alice, [...] "and for Grandfather {{to tell stories}} about." ...|$|E
60|$|She left <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{a little}} longer by the screen, and I {{heard the sound of}} her feet die out along the gallery above.|$|E
6000|$|THE FLOWER GIRL. Well, if you was a gentleman, {{you might}} ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down, I think. Don't I tell you I'm {{bringing}} you business? ...|$|E
60|$|As for <b>me,</b> I {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> there, very wet and weary, and a {{good deal}} anxious as to what should happen next, but greatly exulting in my success.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Monsieur," [...] he says, [...] "I {{beg your}} pardon as {{sincerely}} as I envy the noble Huron your loyalty. Do <b>me</b> the honour <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down while I explain." ...|$|R
60|$|SUNDAY.--It is {{up there}} yet. Resting, apparently. But that is a subterfuge: Sunday isn't the day of rest; Saturday is {{appointed}} for that. It looks <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like a creature that {{is more interested in}} resting than in anything else. It would tire <b>me</b> <b>to</b> rest so much. It tires <b>me</b> just <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> around and watch the tree. I do wonder what it is for; I never see it do anything.|$|R
60|$|My limb now allows <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in some peace: to walk I {{have yet}} no {{prospect}} of, as I can't mark {{it to the}} ground.|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been ten days after this that he stopped me {{in one of my}} eternal {{listless}} promenades and invited <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> beside him again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, most pertinent. Did you not ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in {{judgment}} upon this matter? And unless you confess to me, how am I to absolve you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Broadcaster and {{classical}} music critic John Amis (19222013), husband of Olive Zorian 194855, recalled {{of the first}} rehearsals: BenBritten and <b>me</b> had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{on the floor in}} me and my wife’s flat following the score of his second string quartet in rehearsals because me and my wife only had four chairs and the quartet had to use them.|$|R
60|$|LUBIN. I {{confess that}} had not {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> [he <b>sits</b> down abruptly, evidently very unfavorably affected by this new light].|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't believe that," [...] said Tom, [...] "you can't expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{here and}} {{look at you and}} believe that. How long has he known you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Colonel Fitzmaurice," [...] was the courteous reply. [...] "You {{will allow}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down? I have the {{pleasure}} of conversing, I believe, with Mr. Sydney Barnes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know exactly}} {{how you feel about}} it, Mr. Hathaway," [...] he said, [...] "and I sympathize with you most earnestly. Will you allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down awhile? Thank you." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{regards to}} the album's {{political}} and social themes, Kevin said that [...] "I was always very abstractly political. I listened to punk rock records and thought I could punch my time card. And then all this shit in the world made <b>me</b> have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up and pay attention - and that’s a good thing. It’s a scary time, so why ignore it?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, again!" [...] said I, {{stopping}} before Herbert, with my open hands held out, {{as if they}} {{contained the}} desperation of the case. [...] "I know nothing of his life. It has almost made <b>me</b> mad <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> here of a night and see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so unknown <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that a {{parchment}} three-penny {{might give}} <b>me</b> a right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down at yonder table!" [...] said Robin, with a sigh.
