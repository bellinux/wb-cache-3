40|$|The {{characterization}} of impurities present in <b>micronomicin</b> sulfate injection by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) is described. A reversed phase (RP) -LC method using a C(18) column resistant to an alkaline (pH 11) aqueous mobile phase {{was developed and}} coupled to MS with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in the positive ion mode which provides MS(n) capability. A total of thirty six impurities were detected in commercial samples: five impurities were identified by comparison of their fragmentation patterns with those of available related substances, eleven of them were identified in accordance with relevant literature, while the other twenty impurities were newly identified using the MS/MS spectra of the available related reference substances as interpretative templates combined {{with knowledge of the}} nature of functional group fragmentation behaviors. This work was applied to evaluate the quality of <b>micronomicin</b> sulfate injection from different manufacturers. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{prolonged}} outbreak (December 1980 to July 1982) of nosocomial {{urinary tract}} infections {{appeared to be}} due to strains of Serratia marcescens that were resistant to currently available antibiotics. The serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility patterns suggested a few endemic strains of serotypes O 13, O 2 / 3, O 12 / 14, and nontypable strains. These strains were isolated from the urine samples of inpatients with urinary tract infections in the urology ward and in other wards. The strains of O 12 / 14 (gentamicin susceptible) were replaced with those of O 2 / 3 (gentamicin resistant) between June and September 1981, whereas the other serotypes were isolated continuously. They were resistant to sulbenicillin, cefmetazole, gentamicin, and amikacin, and susceptible to <b>micronomicin</b> and of loxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic. Most of them were also resistant to the disinfectant chlorhexidine, which had been used widely for hand washing in the hospital...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a patient in whom {{intractable}} infectious keratitis and subsequent lamellar flap necrosis necessitating flap amputation after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). A 34 -year-old woman undergoing LASIK complained of blurred vision and pain in the left eye. The best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was 0. 01, and slit-lamp examination showed a marked presence of stromal infiltrates involving the flap and the underlying stroma in that eye. The patient was treated topically with hourly instillation of <b>micronomicin,</b> levofloxacin, and cefmenoxime, together with systemic administration of imipenem, but the left eye developed corneal flap necrosis. We performed surgical debridement of the diseased stroma and excised the lamellar flap. Since nontuberculous mycobacterium was detected on the surgical instruments, we then added oral clarithromycin, and substituted systemic administration of amikacin with that of imipenem. At {{one month after the}} flap removal, the visual acuity gradually improved to 0. 7, but the stromal opacity of the central cornea and hyperopic shift of + 3. 0 diopters remained. LASIK can cause intractable keratitis, resulting in significant visual disturbance that presumably results from insufficient antisepsis of the medical instruments used for this surgery, supporting the importance of strict sterilization of these instruments...|$|E
