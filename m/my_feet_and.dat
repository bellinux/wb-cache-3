500|$|Renée, who conceals {{her true}} self {{to conform to}} the lowly image of typical concierges, {{introduces}} herself as [...] "a widow, short, ugly, chubby", with [...] "bunions on <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and,</b> on certain difficult mornings, it seems, the breath of a mammoth". Her outward appearance is summarized by The Guardian reviewer Ian Samson as [...] "prickly and bunioned". When Paloma eventually discovers Renée's identity, she describes the latter in her journal as having the [...] "elegance of the hedgehog"—although like the spines of the hedgehog, she is covered in quills and prickly, within, she has {{in the words of the}} English translation of the book quoted by Viv Groskop [...] "the same simple refinement as the hedgehog: a deceptively indolent little creature, fiercely solitary—and terribly elegant".|$|E
2500|$|The School Badge {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time on the cover of the June Magazine in 1902, and was designed by architect, Robin Dods. The central figure represents Wisdom, standing upon or emerging from, the open book, representing Knowledge. In her hand is a lamp, representing Truth. The school motto Honour before Honours can be found at the base of the badge. [...] The illustration is also a clear reference to the famous verse from Psalm 119:105 [...] "Your word is a lamp to <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> a light to my path." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{interview}} with People, she revealed she draws her musical inspirations from humming a melody off the note of a whirring fan or tapping her {{foot to the}} rhythm of the bathtub dripping; stating she can hear melodies from natural sounds like birds chirping or the taxis and construction in Manhattan. Occasionally, however, Harrison wishes she could stop the music. [...] "In the middle of a conversation, I'll start humming or moving <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> my friends will say, 'You can't be serious, she says. [...] "It's such a reflex that I'm totally unaware I look like an idiot." [...] Most of her songs are helmed from personal experiences in her life as well as friends' experiences.|$|E

[...] Lombardi was asked by Pat Peppler what play Starr would call, to which Lombardi replied, [...] "Damned if I know." [...] Starr returned to the huddle and called a Brown right 31 Wedge, a play intended for the fullback, but did not tell his teammates he was keeping the ball.

2500|$|The {{investigators}} {{began to}} use force on me, a sick 65-year-old man. I was made to lie face down and beaten on the soles of <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> my spine with a rubber strap ... For the next few days, when those parts of my legs were covered with extensive internal hemorrhaging, they again beat the red-blue-and-yellow bruises with the strap and the pain was so intense that {{it felt as if}} boiling water was being poured on these sensitive areas. I howled and wept from the pain. I incriminated myself in the hope that by telling them lies I could end the ordeal. When I lay down on the cot and fell asleep, after 18 hours of interrogation, in order to go back in an hour's time for more, I was woken up by my own groaning and because I was jerking about like a patient in the last stages of typhoid fever.|$|E
2500|$|Graeme - [...] "I'd got {{in touch}} with the {{professor}} of electronics at Sussex University, Brian Groves. We worked up an electronic drum kit, a marvellous idea. I had the control panel in front of me, it's old hat now but we were the first to do it. There were pieces of rubber with silver paper on the back with a silver coil that moved up and down inside a magnet that produced a signal, so it was touch sensitive. I had 5 snares across the top and then ten tom-toms and then a whole octave of bass drums underneath <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> then four lots of 16 sequencers, two on each side. There was a gap — to play a space — a tambourine, ebony stick, snare and three tom-toms. This was pre-chip days, back then you did it all with transistors. So it had something like 500 transistors. The electronic drums inside looked something like spaghetti. When it worked it was superb, but it was before its day, because it was so sensitive..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another Midrash {{taught that}} {{the words of the}} Torah give light to those who study them, but those who do not occupy {{themselves}} with the Torah stumble. The Midrash compared this to those who stand in the dark; as soon as they start walking, they stumble, fall, and knock their face on the ground – all because they have no lamp in their hand. It is the same with those who have no Torah; they strike against sin, stumble, and die. The Midrash further taught that those who study the Torah give forth light wherever they may be. Quoting [...] "Your word is a lamp to <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> a light to my path," [...] and [...] "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord," [...] the Midrash taught that God offers people to let God's lamp (the Torah) be in their hand and their lamp (their souls) be in God's hand. The lamp of God is the Torah, as [...] says, [...] "For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light." [...] The commandment is [...] "a lamp" [...] because those who perform a commandment kindle a light before God and revive their souls, as [...] says, [...] "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis co-wrote [...] "Here I Am" [...] with Walter Afanasieff and Brett James in LA. Lewis {{wanted to}} be {{involved}} in the writing process, and said that Cowell allowed her to do so as it was [...] "her album". She noted [...] "I've not been given a formula to follow. I had the time to find <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> co-write a lot of material. I've learned a lot and Simon and Clive really listen to me." [...] In Atlanta, Georgia, Lewis worked with producers Alonzo [...] "Novel" [...] Stevenson and Dallas Austin on the song [...] "Whatever It Takes", which Lewis co-wrote together with Novel and Tony Reyes. In Miami, Florida, Lewis worked with Salaam Remi, and [...] "Forgiveness" [...] was recorded. It was written by Lewis, Remi and Kara DioGuardi. [...] Lewis's debut single, a cover of Kelly Clarkson's [...] "A Moment Like This", is included as a bonus track on releases in the UK, Ireland and Japan. Two new songs were recorded in 2008 to help the album appeal more to an American audience: [...] "Forgive Me", which was written and produced by Akon, and [...] "Misses Glass" [...] written by Mad Scientist and RockCity. In an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis explained [...] "I wanted to do something a bit different and the chance to work with Akon came about. I'm really pleased with how it's turned out and it's great that it's different, rather than what I always do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1689 he undertook, in a {{primitive}} pirogue, a daring journey of over 6,000 kilometers down the Amazon to Pará, {{where he went}} for medical treatment, probably for malaria. [...] "I fell sick {{of the most violent}} attacks of fever and dropsy that began in <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>and</b> other complaints," [...] he later wrote in an account of his journey. Fritz set off downstream [...] "in the hope of getting some remedy for my sufferings," [...] reaching the mouth of the Rio Negro after three weeks.There he met a group of Tupinambarana warriors who escorted him to the Mercedarian mission, where he was treated with bloodletting and therapeutic fumigation, [...] "but instead of being benefitted, I was made worse than before." [...] Fritz was taken by some Portuguese missionaries to the Jesuit College in the city of Pará, but when he felt well enough to return to his mission, he was detained and imprisoned for eighteen months by , the Governor of the State of Maranhão, on the accusation of being a Spanish spy. In fact, the Portuguese were concerned that Spanish missions on the Upper Solimões River would lead indigenous communities to support Spain against Portugal. Fritz made use of this time to prepare a map of the river. In 1691, after a complaint was made before the Council of the Indies, his release was authorized by the King of Portugal, who also reprimanded and dismissed the governor. Fritz was accompanied for part of his return journey by a contingent of Portuguese soldiers, with whom he visited fortresses at Gurupá and Tapajós. After leaving Fritz {{at the mouth of the}} Coari River in October 1691, the soldiers [...] "cruelly killed very many people and took the rest away as slaves," [...] as Fritz later learned.|$|E
