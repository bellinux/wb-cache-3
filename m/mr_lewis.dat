25|$|With the {{increase}} of interstate travel in the United States a freeway was planned in 1953 for Colorado Springs which J.H. Lewis estimated would run through the Memorial Plant site. Although the freeway eventually was planned to avoid destroying the historic pottery, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Lewis</b> nonetheless put into action plans to relocate the pottery to a higher-traffic area of Colorado Springs. In 1955, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Lewis</b> and Clem Hull brought a new facility on line at a renovated railroad roundhouse on Midland Road. The new facility, known as the Midland Plant, had a smaller capacity but enjoyed quick success due to its location on the main highway to the Garden of the Gods and other tourist locations.|$|E

25|$|The commissioners, {{from the}} PSC, adopted {{plans for the}} line on March 10, 1908, and {{proposed}} contracts for the line. On March 20, 1908, {{at a meeting of}} the Board of Estimate, Controller Metz sent the plan to a committee within the Board for study, angering five hundred supporters of the line at the meeting. Coler, the Brooklyn Borough President, objected to the committee, citing that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Lewis,</b> the Chief Engineer, was against the construction of the project. This resolution was defeated, and the main resolution failed to get a two-thirds majority. Afterwards, Metz procured an injunction that restrained the Board from acting until the debt limit was established: this blocked any immediate action. After hearings, General Tracy announced that the project was $150,000,000 within the debt limit, and Mayor George McClellan and Controller Metz joined with their colleagues to vote unanimously in favor of the Fourth Avenue subway line on March 27, 1908.|$|E
25|$|Sam Guthrie {{was born}} in Cumberland, Kentucky. As a young boy, he {{attempted}} to help out his family by working in the coal mine in which his father had worked before he died. One day, Sam finds himself trapped in a collapsing mine shaft. While trying to rescue his fellow worker, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Lewis,</b> {{a friend of his}} father's who had introduced him to the job, Sam unconsciously activates his mutant ability and uses it to save himself and Lewis from the collapsing mine. This incident leads Donald Pierce to find Sam and hire him as a mercenary for the Hellfire Club, to use him in a plot to attack the New Mutants. However, when Pierce orders him to kill the defeated New Mutants, Sam rebels against him. Professor Charles Xavier sees the good qualities inside Sam and, after saving him from Pierce, asks him to join his New Mutants. Cannonball leaves his large farming family in Kentucky to join the team.|$|E
2500|$|After Lewis became {{chairman}} of the defense appropriations subcommittee in 1999, earmarks in defense bills exploded. [...] "We {{used to think that}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Lewis</b> would be a champion for smart spending," [...] said Keith Ashdown of the watchdog group [...] [...] "But he brought us the biggest increase in defense earmarking in history." [...] A study by that group found that Lowery's clients have had a remarkable success rate before Lewis' committee.

2500|$|In 2003 and 2004, Lewis, then {{chairman}} of the defense appropriations subcommittee, was in a fierce competition for the chairmanship. [...] The Republican leadership had begun assigning chairmanships in part based on how much campaign money a member had raised for other members. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Lewis</b> and his rivals for the post, Representatives Ralph Regula of Ohio and Harold Rogers of Kentucky, each began a fund-raising blitz. And each concentrated on the industry that had benefited from spending appropriated by their subcommittee, which in Mr. Lewis's case was defense.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis' {{statement}} is {{backed up by}} internal emails subpoenaed by Republican lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee. [...] In one of the emails, Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker threatened that if the acquisition did not go through, and later Bank of America were forced to request federal assistance, the management of Bank of America would be [...] "gone". Other emails, read by Congressman Dennis Kucinich {{during the course of}} Lewis' testimony, state that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Lewis</b> had foreseen the outrage from his shareholders that the purchase of Merrill would cause, and asked government regulators to issue a letter stating that the government had ordered him to complete the deal to acquire Merrill. Lewis, for his part, states he didn't recall requesting such a letter.|$|E
2500|$|After briefly {{touring the}} British provinces, {{he made his}} first stage {{appearance}} in London at the Royalty Theatre as old Colonel Hardy in Paul Pry in 1878. He was soon engaged by Kate Santley at the Royalty, where he played the title role in <b>Mr</b> <b>Lewis.</b> At the same theatre in 1879, he played the part of Po-Hi opposite Santley in Tita in Thibet, a two-act comedy musical by Frank Desprez. [...] He next played Agamemnon (under the name of [...] "Mr Leslie") in La belle Hélène by Jacques Offenbach. [...] His vocal quality suited him to play the comic baritone roles in French operettas. He soon appeared in operettas such as Madame Favart, La fille du tambour-major (1880) and Olivette; and he played Faust in Mefistofele (1880) with Constance Loseby as Marguerite and Lionel Brough as Valentine. In addition, he played some leading roles in musical theatre pieces under the management of Selina Dolaro at the Folly Theatre and at the Alhambra Theatre in The Bronze Horse (1891) La petite mademoiselle and Les manteaux noirs, among others.|$|E
