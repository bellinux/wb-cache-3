A fixed insertion mirror is placed off-axis near one of the curved mirrors, and a mobile pickup mirror is similarly placed near the other curved mirror. A flat linear stage with one pickup mirror is used in case of flat mirrors and a rotational stage with two mirrors is used for the Herriott-type delay line.|$|E

The development of advanced, predictive models of this hazard requires detailed knowledge of the transient chemical structure and soot distributions within real-scale fires.

As part of a Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project to develop such an experimental capability, near-infrared tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) has been identified as the most promising diagnostic technique for making these measurements.

The ambient air stream travels through the detection chamber with a velocity of greater than 100 m sec(exp - 1) in a narrow stream, constrained {{by the addition of}} an inert gas flow (0. 4 torr).

However, conversion efficiency corresponding to monochromatic phase-matched beams can be recovered provided that the instantaneous Propagation vectors are phase matched at all times. This is achieved by imposing angular spectral dispersion (ASD) on the input beam via a diffraction grating, with a dispersion such that the phase mismatch for each frequency is zero.

50|$|Generally {{the goal}} of this type of sample cell is to improve {{detection}} sensitivity by increasing the total optical path length that travels through a small, constant sample volume. In principle, a longer path length results in greater detection sensitivity. Focusing mirrors must be used to redirect the beam at each reflection point, resulting in the beam being restricted to a predefined space along a controlled path until it exits the optical cavity. The output of the cell is the input of an optical detector (a specialized type of transducer), which senses specific changes in the properties of the beam that occur during interaction with the test sample. For instance, the sample may absorb energy from the beam, resulting in an attenuation of the output that is detectable by the transducer.

Especially the new satellite instruments like MIPAS and SCIAMACHY on Envisat, TES and MLS on AURA, IASI on METOP and the instruments for CO 2 measurements on OCO and GOSAT require accuracies of line intensities in the percent range, {{the latter two}} even in the sub-percent range. Whereas the accuracy of line positions is often sufficient, that of linestrength, broadening and shifts is often not. In case of larger molecules where absorption cross sections are used the accuracy is often not sufficient, too. The reason are numerous error sources associated with intensity measurements which are sometimes hard to quantify. In case of high resolution Fourier-transform spectrometers, which are most commonly used for measurements of the spectrocopic database, problems are related to detector non-linearities, channeling, thermal radiation, phase errors, thermal drifts, microphonics, <b>multipassing,</b> and instrumental lineshape error. The knowledge of sample column amount, {{the stability of the}} sample over the measurement time, and the temperature knowledge and homogeneity are potential error sources. Furthermore, the line model and line parameter retrieval can cause errors. In order to provide a spectroscopic database suitable for remote sensing adequate sample cells, including multi-pass cells for sufficient absorption path, with sufficient temperature range and homogeneity as well as alignment stability are mandatory. Furthermore, procedures and infrastructure for generating defined gas mixtures as well as flow reactors for unstable species are needed. A sound measurement strategy including sufficient measurements with redundancy is necessary. Quality assessment procedures can provide an important tool for identifying hidden error sources and validating accuracy. In only very few cases reported uncertainties for database entries include a complete error analysis with quality assessment. Often measurements reported from different laboratories show differences outside stated uncertainties. As an example for the generation of a spectrocopic database with well defined uncertainties new FT-measurements of ν 2 water line parameters carried out with the Bruker IFS 120 HR at DLR will be presented. ...|$|R

According codes and standard there is a limitation that imposes the maximum interpass temperature at 150 ÂC for welding using nickel alloys.
