5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and {{can be useful in}} the treatment of <b>muscle</b> <b>spasms,</b> although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects.

5|$|The most {{frequent}} symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and <b>muscle</b> <b>spasms.</b> The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens. Severe symptoms usually {{occur as a}} result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E

At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E
40|$|For centuries, man has {{appreciated}} the beneficial effects of heat in relieving pain, and {{various forms of}} heat {{have been widely used}} in physiotherapy techniques to ease pain and facilitate movement. However, the results in relief of <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> have not been uniformly good In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of cold to relieve <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> and pain. J. Travell (1949, 1952) reported on the use of cold in the relief of painful <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> and regarded “trigger” points as of major importance. M.

5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, <b>muscle</b> <b>spasms,</b> or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Previous {{studies have}} shown that cortical-evoked {{potentials}} on magnetic stimulation of muscles are influenced by muscle contraction, vibration, and <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm.</b> This study was carried out to determine whether these potentials correlate with palpatory <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm,</b> patient symptoms, and disability in patients with low back pain. Methods: A prospective observational study was performed on 13 subjects with a history of low back pain visiting an orthopedic hospital-based clinic. Patients were screened for serious pathologic conditions by an orthopedic surgeon. The patients were then evaluated for the presence of <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> by one of the investigators who was blinded to the results of the evoked potential studies. Patients were asked to complete a low back pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and a Roland-Morris Activity Scale (RMAS). Cortical-evoked potentials were recorded with a magnetic stimulator placed over the lumbar paraspinal muscles with the patient in the prone position. The palpatory examination, VAS, RMAS, and the cortical potentials were repeated after 2 weeks of therapy commonly used to reduce <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm.</b> Results: The patients demonstrated a significant decrease in low back pain VAS and RMAS scores after treatment compared with before treatment. There was a reduction in the amount of palpatory <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> in 11 of 13 cases. The cortical potentials before treatment were attenuated compared with previously reported controls and showed a significant increase before and after treatment in the amplitude of these potentials with multivariate analysis of variance. There was significant correlation between the changes in cortical potentials after treatment and the changes noted in paraspinal <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> and VAS and RMAS scores. Conclusions: This study confirms the previous report that the amplitude of cerebral-evoked potentials on magnetic stimulation of paraspinal muscles is depressed in the presence of palpable <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm.</b> The close correlation among these potentials, paraspinal <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm,</b> and clinical symptoms suggests that the measurement of muscle activity may be more important in the assessment of low back pain than is commonly accepted. © 2000 JMPT...|$|R

In our study we aim to discuss the effectiveness of BTX-A in the treatment of the chronic pain that was refractory to traditional therapeutic options. Our patient had developed disciitis after the operation of lumbar disc herniation (L 4 -L 5) and resultant <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> had been observed 20 days after the operation. He complained of severe back pain with a Visual Analog Scale score of 100 millimeter and Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire score of 50. Intravenous antibiotherapy, analgesics and anti-inflammatory medication, and hyperbaric oxygen treatment were applied, and upon persistence of the complaints BTX-A treatment was planned for univertebral <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> and resultant pain. A total of 140 units of BTX-A (Botox) accompanied by EMG was injected due to the <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> severity, between thoracal 1 and lumbar 5 vertebras where paravertebral <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> was observed. The patient was visited at 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks and at 2, 4, and 6 months.

The reduction of pain before the disappearance of the <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> suggests that BTX-A is effective in the treatment of chronic pain refractory to the other therapeutic options...|$|R
40|$|Acute <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> In a CMAJ {{research}} letter, NormanEpstein described 8 {{patients with}} acute <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm.</b> 1 The diagnosis ap-pears {{to have been}} based on subjective measurements of range of motion and pain; Epstein did not state how range of motion and tenderness were measured.

This proof-of-principle study explored whether OTC doses of guaifenesin can provide relief from acute upper back, neck, or shoulder <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> and pain. Methods: This multicenter, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose, parallel study randomly assigned adults experiencing acute pain and <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> in their upper back, neck, or shoulder to guaifenesin 600 or 1200  mg or matched placebo twice daily (BID) in a 2 : 2 : 1 : 1 ratio for 7  days. The primary end point was {{the change from}} baseline in <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> relief, measured using an 11 -point numeric rating scale (0 = not present to 10 = unbearable) recorded twice daily and averaged over the 7 -day treatment period. Analyses were performed using a linear mixed model that included treatment as a fixed effect and site as a random effect. Results: A total of 77 subjects {{were included in the}} 4 treatment groups. Least squares mean <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> score over 7  days was 1. 77 with guaifenesin 1200  mg, 1. 42 with its matched placebo, 1. 53 with guaifenesin 600  mg, and 1. 74 with its matched placebo. Treatment with guaifenesin 1200  mg BID provided 25 % greater reduction in mean <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> over its matched placebo and 16 % greater reduction than guaifenesin 600  mg BID. These differences were not statistically significant. Based on comparisons of absolute mean values, a consistent directional change in effect was observed, suggesting some benefit from placebo to lower-to-upper doses of guaifenesin with regard to <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm,</b> tension, pain, discomfort, and relaxation. No severe or serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Results suggest the potential for OTC dose of guaifenesin 1200  mg BID to provide symptomatic relief of upper back musculoskeletal pain and spasm. Confirmation of this preliminary result in a larger, adequately powered study is needed.
