As part of a cross-sectional multi-city survey, IDUs were interviewed and HIV-tested by the ELISA technique. IDUs were categorized according to knowledge of their own HIV status as either aware or unaware. Means, averages, and proportions were compared between the groups using bi- and multivariate analyses. Of 857 IDUs interviewed, 34. 2 % were unaware of their HIV serostatus. Those who were unaware were more likely: to have been recruited at sites where the HIV prevalence rate was considered medium (> 10 to 50 %; odds ratio = 8. 0) or high (> 50 %; 4. 0); to be illiterate (OR = 4. 54); to have no prior HIV test (OR = 2. 22); to be male (OR = 1. 81); and to have been enrolled more recently in syringe-exchange programs (OR = 1. 69). HIV prevention programs should target both individuals at risk and HIV-positive individuals. Programs to expand access to HIV testing are pivotal and should be tailored to specific contexts and populations...|$|E

40|$|The Maltese Islands {{are almost}} entirely {{made up of}} {{sedimentary}} rock deposited in a marine environment during the Oligo-Miocene period. These limestones and clays form a series of stratigraphic layers of varying composition and hardness. In a few localised places, these are uncomformably overlain by sparse Quaternary terrestrial and raised beach deposits, {{most of which are}} of high palaeontological importance. Igneous, intrusive, extrusive or metamorphic rocks do not exist. The stratigraphy of the Maltese Islands is comprised of the following limestone formations. The Upper Coralline Limestone (UCL) formation is largely crystalline or semi-crystalline and is the youngest of the rock layers. This formation is sub-divided into four layers and it characteristically forms the mesa-type plateaux and boulder screes. The Greensand formation found underneath the UCL is a very thin layer with a maximum thickness of 12 <b>m</b> in <b>Malta</b> and 16 <b>m</b> in Gozo, but often as little as 30 cm. Its exposures are often buried under the talus deposits of the UCL. The next formation is the Blue Clay which forms an impermeable base (aquiclude) to the water-bearing Greensand and Upper Coralline Limestone (aquifers) above. They hold rainwater that manages to percolate through the roc...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{determines the}} {{cropland}} use {{associated with the}} dietary patterns of 16 European countries and investigates sources of variation in land use between and within these countries. The analysis combines food availability data at the household level with country-specific land use data for food items. The household food availability data is obtained from a standardized and post-harmonized databank, developed in the Data Food Networking Project (DAFNE). The results show large differences between the land use of the 16 European countries, ranging from ± 1500 m 2 (Ireland) to ± 3000 <b>m</b> 2 (<b>Malta)</b> to supply an average person’s food demand. Major reasons for this divergence include disparities in total caloric food availability and in national yields. The composition of the diet is only a minor source of variation. Using food consumption data at the household level makes it also possible to look for sources of variation within countries. This paper investigates sources of variation within countries by examining the influence of education of the household head on land use associated with food consumption. The analysis shows that diets of people with only elementary education need on average 20 % more land than diets of people with a higher education (2302 m 2 and 1948 m 2, respectively). The basis of this difference is the higher caloric availability for people with only an elementary education; the influence of differences {{in the composition of}} the diet is negligible. Variation in land use between countries is thus caused by the different agricultural productivities and caloric availabilities, and the major source of variation within countries is the caloric availability. The composition of the diet is only a minor source of variation, both between and within countries. The results implicate that highly educated people have a lower demand for land...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study for abundance, biomass and diversity {{was carried out}} for the prokaryote, meiofauna and macrofauna communities at three depth stations (1200, 1800 and 2100 <b>m)</b> along the <b>Malta</b> Escarpment (Mediterranean Sea). Our investigation showed a two-fold increase with depth in prokaryote abundance; the contribution of prokaryote biomass to the total benthic biomass was predominant at all depths. Bacteria were the dominant prokaryote component and Archaea formed a considerable fraction (20 %- 30 %) of the prokaryote assemblages. The meio- and macrofauna abundances and meiofauna biomass did not decrease significantly with depth but macrofauna biomass did. The a diversity did not follow a clear bathymetric trend for both nematode and macrofauna species. Probably {{because of the large}} number of eurybathic nematode genera, nor did the turnover diversity in nematode composition change down the depth gradient. Conversely, for the macrofauna there was a perceptible change in community composition between the shallowest station and the two deeper stations. Food availability affected only the macrobenthic component. The increase in the prokaryote organisms with depth and the dominance of nematodes and macrofauna deposit feeders suggest active grazing by the two benthic components on microbes. This would transfer energy to the higher trophic levels through the microbial compartment...|$|R
40|$|I modelli di edifici esistenti o progettati, comuni nello sviluppo dell’architettura sia come mezzo di studio sia come medium di rappresentazione, sono piuttosto rari nella pre- e protostoria. In ogni caso essi raramente sono definiti tanto da poter dedurre le effettive caratteristiche dell’edificio rappresentato. Il modello reperito tra il 1923 e il 1926 nello scavo archeologico del complesso templare preistorico megalitico di Ta Hagrat (IV <b>m.)</b> nell’Isola di <b>Malta,</b> scolpito in Calcare a Globigerine e ora conservato nel Museo archeologico di Malta, consente invece, nonostante le piccolissime dimensioni (4, 5 x 3, 7 x 2, 5 cm c.), una lettura puntuale delle caratteristiche architettoniche, cioè materiche, formali, tecnico-costruttive e strutturali. Notissimo e molto citato, il reperto non è mai stato oggetto di studi sistematici. Escusse le tesi di altri Autori che lo hanno menzionato, l’autore espone i risultati conseguiti con le proprie analisi per le quali ha usato i metodi della storia dell’architettura e dell’ingegneria strutturale (rilievo {{laser scanner}} 3 D, FEM ecc.). Esso rappresenta un edificio di forma ellittica di c. 6, 5 x 4, 5 x 2, 70 m realizzato con grandi blocchi lapidei, quindi megalitico, posti in verticale, con alternanza di elementi ortostatici ed elementi diatonici collegati a secco; è coperto con 5 “travi” accostate(le più antiche rappresentate), cioè elementi lapidei posti di taglio della lunghezza presumibile di 5 m (il più lungo), resi stabili da lastre poste di piatto alle due estremità del sistema di travi. Il modello, che ha valori architettonici autonomi ma con alcune soluzioni originali avanzate, conferma i modi costruttivi dell’architettura dei templi megalitici maltesi ad esso contemporanei soprattutto per quanto concerne, per tali edifici, la presenza di copertura litica, che ancora è oggetto di discussione nell’ambiente accademico. Si tratta probabilmente di un modello di studio progettuale realizzato di propria mano da un costruttore di architetture megaliti. The models of {{existing}} or designed buildings, to be usually {{found in the}} development of the architecture, both as study means and as representation medium, are rather rare in pre- and proto-history. In any case they rarely are so defined to allow of a full deduction of the characteristics of the building they represent. The model, found between 1923 and 1926 in the archaeological excavation of the prehistoric megalithic templar complex of Ta Hagrat (IV <b>m.)</b> in the <b>Malta</b> Island, carved in Globigerina Limestone, now conserved in the Maltese Archaeological Museum,on the contrary allows, in spite of its very small (4, 5 x 3, 7 x 2, 5 cm c.), of an accurate interpretation of its architectural characteristics, say material, formal, technical-constructive,structural. Well-known and frequently mentioned, the find has never been the object of systematic studies. Examined the theses of other Scholars who cited it, the author proposes the results of his analysis made with the instruments of the history of architecture and structural engineering (Laser scanner 3 D survey, FEM etc.). It represents a building of elliptic shape of about 6, 5 x 4, 5 x 2, 70 made with large stone blocks, thus a megalithic one, vertically placed, with alternation of orthostatic and diatonic elements, connected without mortar; it is covered by 5 adjacent “beams”(the most ancient ever represented), i. e. lithic elements rectangular in section, placed on edge, of the supposed length of 5 m c. (the longest one); the beam system is stabilized by a couple of slabs at each end of it, placed flat on the walls. The model, that belongs autonomous architectural values with a few original and advanced solutions, is the confirmation of the building techniques of the coeval architecture of the prehistoric megalithic Maltese temples mainly as regards, in the temples, the presence of a lithic covering that still is a matter of discussion in the academic setting. It is probably the embodiment of the development of architectural intuition by a builder of megalithic architectures, made by his own hands...|$|R
