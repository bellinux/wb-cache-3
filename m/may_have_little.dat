Such structures <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> or no {{function in a}} current species, yet have a clear function in ancestral species, or other closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes, the non-functional remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish, wings in flightless birds, the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes, and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction. Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the coccyx, the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes.|$|E

25|$|In most Catarrhini (Old World {{monkeys and}} apes—primates {{closely related to}} humans) there are three types of color receptors (known as cone cells), {{resulting}} in trichromatic color vision. These primates, like humans, are known as trichromats. Many other primates (including New World monkeys) and other mammals are dichromats, which is the general color vision state for mammals that are active during the day (i.e., felines, canines, ungulates). Nocturnal mammals <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> or no color vision. Trichromat non-primate mammals are rare.|$|E
25|$|Some clinicians {{believe that}} {{psychological}} characteristics alone determine mental disorders.

What may break one person <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> to no effect on another. Psychological stressors, which can trigger mental illness, are as follows: emotional, physical or sexual abuse, loss of a significant loved one, neglect and being unable to relate to others.|$|E

25|$|The {{state of}} the art in sensory {{intelligence}} for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably {{be a long time before}} robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E

Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research. Fruit flies, nematode worms, mice and rats together account for the vast majority, though small numbers of other species are used, ranging from sea slugs through to armadillos. Examples of the types of animals and experiments used in basic research include: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{severity}} {{ranges from}} mild to deadly: small contusions <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> or {{no impact on}} the patient's health, yet pulmonary contusion is {{the most common type of}} potentially lethal chest trauma. It occurs in 30–75% of severe chest injuries. [...] With an estimated mortality rate of 14–40%, pulmonary contusion plays a key role in determining whether an individual will die or suffer serious ill effects as the result of trauma. Pulmonary contusion is usually accompanied by other injuries. [...] Although associated injuries are often the cause of death, pulmonary contusion is thought to cause death directly in a quarter to half of cases. Children are at especially high risk for the injury because the relative flexibility of their bones prevents the chest wall from absorbing force from an impact, causing it to be transmitted instead to the lung. [...] Pulmonary contusion is associated with complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and it can cause long-term respiratory disability.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} causes of {{toothache}} and its diagnosis is a specialist topic, meaning that attendance at a dentist is usually required. Since {{many cases of}} toothache are inflammatory in nature, over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help (unless contraindicated, such as [...] with a peptic ulcer). [...] Generally, NSAIDs are as effective as aspirin alone or in combination with codeine. However, simple analgesics <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> effect on some causes of toothache, and the severe pain can drive individuals to exceed the maximum dose. For example, when acetaminophen (paracetamol) is taken for toothache, an accidental overdose {{is more likely to}} occur when compared to people who are taking acetaminophen for other reasons. Another risk in persons with toothache is a painful chemical burn of the oral mucosa caused by holding a caustic substance such as aspirin tablets and toothache remedies containing eugenol (such as clove oil) against the gum. Although the logic of placing a tablet against the painful tooth is understandable, an aspirin tablet needs to be swallowed to have any pain-killing effect. Caustic toothache remedies require careful application to the tooth only, without coming into excessive contact with the soft tissues of the mouth.|$|E

In the Ninja World, there exists the [...] "Three Great Dōjutsu": the Byakugan that allows the user 360-degree view within a certain distance and an individual's chakra pathway system; the Sharingan that allows the user to copy others' jutsu and movements as well as a multitude of genjutsu and other abilities; and the Rinnegan, the most [...] "exalted" [...] of the three that gives the user control over the Six Paths. There is also the Rinne Sharingan, the primeval form of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan, and the Tenseigan, a heightened form of Byakugan which is very similar to the Rinnegan in power. There is only one individual who possesses all three of the Great Dōjutsu: Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, who possesses both the Byakugan and the Rinne Sharingan.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{misconception}} is {{that sign}} languages are somehow dependent on spoken languages: {{that they are}} spoken language expressed in signs, or that they were invented by hearing people. Similarities in language processing in the brain between signed and spoken languages further perpetuated this misconception. Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as Charles-Michel de l'Épée or Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, are often incorrectly referred to as [...] "inventors" [...] of sign language. [...] Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed {{by the people who}} use them, in this case, deaf people, who <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> or no knowledge of any spoken language.|$|E

Throughout the existence of Azad Hind, Bose sought {{to distance himself from}} Japanese collaboration and become more self-sufficient, but found this difficult since the existence of Azad Hind as a governmental entity had only come about {{with the support of the}} Japanese, on whom the government and army of Azad Hind were entirely dependent. Bose, however, remains a hero in present-day India and is remembered as a man who fought fiercely for Indian independence.|$|E

2500|$|Pertussis (also {{known as}} {{whooping}} cough or 100-day cough) {{is a highly}} contagious bacterial disease. Initially, symptoms are usually {{similar to those of}} the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough. This is then followed by weeks of severe coughing fits. Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in. The coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase [...] "100-day cough". A person may cough so hard that they vomit, break ribs, or become very tired from the effort. Children less than one year old <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> or no cough and instead have periods where they do not breathe. The time between infection and the onset of symptoms is usually seven to ten days. Disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated, but symptoms are typically milder.|$|E
2500|$|Reforming the {{legislation}} {{in order to}} ensure that domestic violence falls under the scope of the law is important.

Marriage laws are also important, [...] "They [...] should also be able to enter freely into a marriage or to leave it, to obtain financial credit, and to own and administer property." [...] Abolishing or restricting the offering and receiving of dowry and bride price and scrutinizing the impact of these transactions on the legislative decisions regarding DV is also important. UN Women has stated that {{the legislation}} should ensure that [...] "a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge".|$|E
