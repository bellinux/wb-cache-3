30|$|The {{effects of}} {{salinity}} stress on <b>microelement</b> uptake {{have been investigated}} in various studies (Villora et al. 2000; Lao and Plaza 2013). However, the relationship between salinity and <b>microelement</b> uptake is complex. An increase or decrease may be observed in <b>microelement</b> uptake, or salinity may not {{have an effect on}} the <b>microelement</b> concentration of the plant. These differences result from factors such as plant species, plant tissues, level of salinity stress and composition, <b>microelement</b> concentration in the growth medium, growth conditions and stress duration (Grattan and Grieve 1999). In a study by Rahman et al. (1993), Mn 2 + and Cu 2 + accumulation in maize shoots under salinity stress decreased. Eom et al. (2007) suggested that salinity stress does not affect the Fe 2 + or Zn 2 + uptake of six different types of ground cover plants but reduces the concentration of Cu 2 +. In another study, Valdez-Aguilar et al. (2009 b) indicated that increasing salinity in nutrient solution has little effect on the micronutrient uptake of marigold. In the same study, an increase in ECw in the nutrient solution affected marigold varieties differently. Despite the ECw increase, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + accumulation in marigold did not show a pattern consistent with the results of our study. The Mn 2 + concentration showed a decreasing trend in T. erecta varieties. In agreement with similar studies, a decrease in Cu 2 +, Fe 2 +, and Mn 2 + concentration was observed in our study depending on the increase in salinity stress, while salinity stress has no effect on Zn 2 + uptake normally.|$|E
