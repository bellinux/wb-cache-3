Thyroid surgeon or otolaryngologistss <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the surgical management of thyroid disease and general practitioners and family physicians <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> monitoring for and identifying symptoms related to thyroid disease.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that nonpathogenic strains of H. pylori may be beneficial, e.g., by normalizing stomach acid secretion, and <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> regulating appetite, since its presence in the stomach results in a persistent but reversible reduction {{in the level of}} ghrelin.|$|E

5|$|Extirpation {{of prairie}} dogs can also {{contribute}} to regional and local biodiversity loss, increased seed depredation, and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs. Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of fungi and spread spores through their feces, thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants (which usually cannot thrive without them). As such, these rodents <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> maintaining healthy forests.|$|E
5|$|Genetics <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> {{the risk}} that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most {{studies have found that}} having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Seasons <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> some regions. A {{dramatic}} change in colour and texture is created by seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E

5|$|The next ring {{is named}} the Le Verrier ring after Urbain Le Verrier, who {{predicted}} Neptune's position in 1846. With an orbital radius of about 53,200km, it is narrow, with a width of about 113km. Its normal optical depth is 0.0062±0.0015, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.7±0.2km. The dust fraction in the Le Verrier ring ranges from 40% to 70%. The small moon Despina, which orbits just {{inside of it}} at 52,526km, <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the ring's confinement by acting as a shepherd.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> emotional development. Theory of Mind {{is the ability to}} know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck.|$|E
30|$|Studies so far {{report that}} {{osteochondrosis}} goes through stages, similar to Perthes’ disease [3]. The aetiology of Hegemann’s disease remains unclear, although traumatic events <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role,</b> as {{in five of}} eight cases, a contusion, fracture or chronic repetitive micro-trauma are described. It is known that traumatic events in children may sometimes be overlooked or under-reported; therefore, a traumatic origin in the other three cases <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> as well [26].|$|R
50|$|It is also {{suggested}} that eEF-2K <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> the rapid anti-depressant effects of ketamine through its regulation of neuronal protein synthesis.|$|R
50|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that hormonal changes <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role.</b> Hormones {{which have been}} studied include estrogen, progesterone, thyroid hormone, testosterone, corticotropin releasing hormone, and cortisol.|$|R
5|$|Genetics <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people {{having had a}} subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH {{compared to those who}} have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} subcomponents {{are often}} referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient (denoted S). The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular mass containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple ATPase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially {{the same manner as}} the 19S particle; the 11S <b>may</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus.|$|E
