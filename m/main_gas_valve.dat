25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} to the pilot light is a system to create a high voltage electrical arc or spark between two electrodes, in order to light the gas flowing to the burner. Fail-safe design for such a system requires the burner flame to be detected by passing an electric current through the flame, which is received by the flame rectification circuit inside an ignition controller connected to the <b>gas</b> <b>valve.</b> Flame rectification occurs when electrons flow through the flame burning, which the ignition controller senses and knows the flame is there, keeping the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> open. If the appliance loses gas or the flame goes out, the ignition controller doesn't see the flame, closing the <b>gas</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many gas-fed heating {{appliances}} such as ovens and water heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple {{is placed in the}} pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply <b>valve</b> which feeds <b>gas</b> to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{combined}} {{main burner}} and pilot <b>gas</b> <b>valves</b> (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to {{within the range}} of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the [...] "press and hold for x minutes" [...] in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good <b>gas</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Diaphragm {{gas meter}} is a {{specialized}} flow meter that measures {{the volume of}} fuel gas such as natural gas and coal <b>gas.</b> <b>Valve</b> bonnet and valve seat are the key parts of diaphragm gas meter, which compose the main factors of its metering error. The widely detecting ways are direct observational method and pneumatic pressure method. Direct observational method only realizes the qualitative detection with lacking science. Pneumatic pressure method can realize the quantitative detection, but with low accuracy and bad reliability. In order to evaluate the gas tightness of diaphragm <b>gas</b> meter <b>valve</b> accurately, surface texture method was adopted. Firstly, the surface roughness mathematical model of valve working face was established. A fast Gaussian filtering convolution algorithm was proposed based on the symmetry of Gaussian density function. Secondly, the working face of <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> on the high-precision air floating stage was scanned by the chromatic confocal sensor. And the roughness profile of valve working face was got through the fast Gaussian filter when the cut-off wavelength was 0. 8 mm. Then the roughness parameters could be calculated with MATLAB by setting the sampling length and evaluation length. The results show that surface roughness has a difference of over 1 µm between the qualified and unqualified valve. Besides, {{there is a little}} deviation of below 9 % between the experimental value and the stylus profilometer measuring value, which has no influence on the judging result of qualified or unqualified about the measured workpiece. The gas tightness performance of <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> can be judged by measuring surface roughness of its working face, which can provide a scientific basis for evaluating the quality of diaphragm <b>gas</b> meter <b>valve</b> in a quantitative way. 1...|$|R
