50|$|The works order may, {{and usually}} does, {{consist of a}} {{considerable}} number of distinct jobs. Practically the job may be defined as {{the amount of time spent}} by any particular workman on any particular piece or similar set of pieces. Thus, a works order for a lathe will include such jobs as planning bed, cutting leading screw, <b>milling</b> <b>slide</b> rest, etc. If the works order were for six lathes of similar pattern, the jobs would be extended similarly - as, for instance, planning six beds, cutting six leading screws, etc. In the case of work done otherwise than on customer's stock orders, the job would be for items such as new screw for No. 45 lathe, altering position of band saw No. 67, etc. It will be evident that some jobs will be charged with material and some not...|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Sporting Model {{from which}} it was derived, and the 1902 Military Model, who had <b>milled</b> <b>slide</b> grooves and {{checkered}} slides respectively, the 1903 Pocket Hammer featured slide grooves {{at the rear of}} the slide. The first pistols featured the milled pattern similar to the 1902 Sporting Models, but Colt transitioned to rear cut slides around the spring of 1905, apparently for all their automatics. This would indicate that only about 1,700 or so 1903 Pocket Hammers had the rear <b>milled</b> <b>slides,</b> making them the earliest and hardest to find of the type.|$|R
50|$|The {{weapon is}} similar to the Tanfoglio variant of the Czech CZ-75, with design {{elements}} borrowed from the SIG P210, though few of its parts are interchangeable with the Tanfoglio weapon from whose machining dies and blue prints it was derived. It has a hot forged steel frame mated to a heavy <b>milled</b> <b>slide</b> treated with manganese phosphate, and coated in heat-cured epoxy.|$|R
50|$|P225-A1 was {{introduced}} by SIG in 2015. The new model {{was introduced}} based on the P225 {{with a number of}} refinements. Notably the place of origin on the slide is now SIG Sauer Inc. Exeter, NH. There is a new contour to the frame, a short reset trigger, a <b>milled</b> <b>slide</b> (the earlier one was stamped), two barrel lengths, one standard and the other threaded for a suppressor. The Suppressor model comes with high sights.|$|R
50|$|More {{recently}} in 2011/12 was {{the addition of}} a Picatinny rail to the frame under the barrel as standard on all models whose number ends in R. The major difference in slide design, between the older model SIG pistols and the current production, is that the older model slides were stamped whereas the current production models are milled on a CNC machine. The stamped models have an end piece at the muzzle end which is welded in place, to complete the slide. Additionally, the older stamped slides feature a removable breech block. This breech block is pinned to the slide with two hollow roll pins, one pressed inside the other, with their split ends opposed. The newer <b>milled</b> <b>slides</b> are a one-piece unit and do not have a removable breech block.|$|R
5000|$|The P229 {{differs from}} its cousin the P226 in several respects, and was {{originally}} introduced to supplement and then replace the P228 {{by adding the}} [...]357 SIG and [...]40 S&W as available chamberings. The P229 was the first production handgun introduced that could chamber the [...]357 SIG round. The P226 and P228 were originally manufactured using a stamped-steel slide on an aluminum alloy frame. The P229 consists of a CNC-milled stainless steel slide, typically colored black with a Nitron finish. The P229's <b>milled</b> steel <b>slide</b> was introduced to handle the higher slide velocities created by the [...]357 SIG and [...]40 S&W loads, which the stamped slide of the P228 could not handle {{without the use of}} a much stiffer recoil spring. This would have made manual slide-retraction much more difficult and the use of a <b>milled</b> stainless <b>slide</b> (coupled with the new milling and stainless production capabilities found in the U.S. factory) with a standard weight recoil spring made more sense.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{feature of the}} Model 1900 was the sight safety, which while a good idea in theory, did not work out well in execution, and proved to be unpopular. When pushed down the safety blocked the firing pin, when pushed up it performed as the rear sight. This gave an immediate visual indicator of whether the safety was on or off when one went to aim the pistol, without resorting to feeling for the safety lever. The first 1900s were equipped with rear <b>milled</b> <b>slide</b> grooves {{but when it was}} found that this could interfere with the sight safety (one could inadvertently flip the safety on or off while manipulating the <b>slide)</b> the <b>milled</b> <b>slide</b> grooves were moved to the front. This safety was used in about the first 3,000 production pistols. Colt then installed a conventional rear sight and eliminated the sight safety although the cut in the slide remained but was plugged. The grooves, remained {{in the front of the}} slide. There are earlier sight safety M1900s that were factory retrofitted with the new fixed sight. Although Colt considered a new firing pin safety mounted on the left side of the slide with one prototype, it did not produce such a model. This was possibly a mistake as the lack of safety features probably affected sales - the recommended way to carry a safety-less Colt automatic was with an empty chamber, requiring the user the rack the slide to chamber a round before firing - which made it slower to get in action and required two hands, as well as making it impossible to render the weapon safe after firing a partial magazine, without dropping the magazine and extracting the chambered round, itself a dangerous operation in a gun without a safety. This was a major complaint of the military when they tested it, something Colt was for some reason loath to fix in the 1900-1902-1903 series of pistols. The only exception was the new small-sized Colt 1903 Pocket Hammerless, a completely new design with a grip and frame thumb safety at the start of production in 1904. It is possible that Colt found it cheaper to introduce the features into a new model, and the sales of the 1903 Pocket Hammerless were spectacular in comparison to the 1900/1902/1903 large frame automatics. By contrast, Mauser C96's and Lugers had manual thumb safeties from the outset.|$|R

50|$|In 1973 the Cobham Conservation Group was formed, {{later to}} become the Cobham Conservation and Heritage Trust, {{and one of its}} main {{objectives}} was to rescue the much deteriorated grist <b>mill</b> building from <b>sliding</b> into the river as a result of water erosion of the mill island. In 1986 the freehold of the mill was taken over by the Thames Water Authority who, as part of their flood control expenditure rebuilt the weirs nearby. They also recognised that the mill was Grade II listed and shored up the mill's foundations.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{evolution and}} morphological {{changes of the}} nanostructured α-Al 2 O 3 powder using different milling times (1, 8, 16 and 24 h) were studied. It is observed that the crystallite size of the particles reduced to 2 nm after milling for 24 h. Morphological studies of powder particles indicated that the powder particle size continuously decreases with increasing <b>milling</b> time. The <b>sliding</b> wear rate and wear coefficient of friction were lower in the nanocrystalline samples milled at 24 h at same applied load (3, 6 or 10 N). The improved friction and wear resistance is attributed to the finer microstructure of the sample milled for 24 h...|$|R
50|$|The P227 also {{features}} the new Enhanced Ergonomics 'E2' wraparound grip, {{rather than the}} two-piece grips of the P220. The P227 has a magazine capacity of ten rounds {{and one in the}} chamber, unlike the seven- or eight-round capacity of the P220. SIG also offers a fourteen-round capacity magazine, which is included in various models. The P227 is a double-action/single-action-operated handgun, meaning that the first trigger pull is a ten-lbs double-action pull, but all the follow-up shots are a 4.4-lbs single-action pull. The full size model is 7.7 inches in length (with a 4.4 inch barrel) and 5.5 inches in height with 1.5 inches in width. It weighs 32 ounces (907 g) with the magazine, features an accessory rail and three-dot contrast sights or SIGLITE night sights. The frame is constructed from anodized aluminum alloy with a Nitron finish and a <b>milled</b> stainless steel <b>slide.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Dogpatch USA {{opened and}} welcomed about 8,000 {{visitors}} on May 17, 1968. The {{centerpiece of the}} park was a giant statue of the fictional town hero, Jubilation T. Cornpone. [...] Capp unveiled the statue during his dedication speech to a crowd of about 2,000. Kim Capp, son of Al Capp, worked as the assistant Public Relations Director. General admission was $1.50 for adults and $0.75 for children. During the first year, the park's attractions included a railroad, surrey rides, trail rides, a stable, an apiary, a grist <b>mill</b> tour, a <b>slide,</b> a petting zoo, and a [...] "mule swing." [...] Fishing in the trout pond was another activity offered; the Dogpatch restaurant could then cook the trout for visitors. Artisans demonstrated their work, including candlemaking, glassblowing, and woodcarving, and local crafts were available for purchase, including handmade dulcimers, smoking chips, and embroidered aprons, though crafts produced elsewhere supplemented the local products. The [...] "alpine-style" [...] Dogpatch Inn provided accommodations for visitors. The park reported a net profit of about $100,000 {{at the end of}} the 1968 season.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} prerequisites in the drug development is to attain a reproducible and robust product in terms of its nature, and its chemical and physical properties. This can be challenging, since the crystalline form of drugs and excipients can be directly transformed into the amorphous one during normal pharmaceutical processing, referred to as process-induced amorphisation or process-induced disorder. The intention of this thesis was to address the mechanisms causing disorder during powder flow and milling and, in association with this, to evaluate, the ability of Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to quantify and characterize process-induced disorder. The amorphisation mechanisms were controlled by stress energy distribution during processing, which in turn was regulated by a series of process parameters. Compression and shearing stress caused by sliding were stress types that acted on the particles during powder flow and ball <b>milling</b> process. However, <b>sliding</b> was the most important inter-particulate contact process giving rise to amorphisation and the transformation was proposed to be caused by vitrification. The plastic stiffness and elastic stiffness of the milling-induced particles were similar to a two-state particle model, however the moisture sorption characteristics of these particles were different. Thus the milled particles could not be described solely by a two-state particle model with amorphous and crystalline domains.   Raman spectroscopy proved to be an appropriate and effective technique in the quantification of the apparent amorphous content of milled lactose powder. The disordered content below 1 % could be quantified with Raman spectroscopy. AFM was a useful approach to characterize disorder on the particle surfaces. In summary, this thesis has provided insight into the mechanisms involved in process-induced amorphisation of pharmaceutical powders and presented new approaches for quantification and characterization of disordered content by Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy...|$|R
40|$|IsaMill is a stirred type mill used in mineral {{industry}} for fine and ultra-fine grinding. The difficulty in obtaining the internal flow {{information in the}} mill by experimental techniques has prevented {{the development of the}} fundamental understanding of the flow and generating general methods for reliable scale-up and optimized design and control parameters. This difficulty can be effectively overcome by numerical simulation based on discrete element method (DEM). In this work a DEM model was developed to study particle flow in a simplified IsaMill. The DEM model was validated by comparing the simulated results of the flow pattern, mixing pattern and power draw with those measured from a same scale lab mill. Spatial distributions of microdynamic variables related to flow and force structure such as local porosity, particle interaction forces, collision velocity and collision frequency have been analyzed. Among the materials properties of particles, it is shown that by decreasing particle/particle sliding friction coefficient, the particle flow becomes more vigorous which is useful to grinding performance. Restitution coefficient does not affect the particle flow significantly. A too low or too high particle density could decrease grinding efficiency. Although grinding medium size affects the flow, its selection may depend on the particle size of the products. Among the operational variables considered, the results show that fill volume and mill speed proved to be important factors in IsaMil process. Increase of fill volume or mill speed increases the interaction between particles and agitating discs which results in a more vigorous motion of the particles. Among the <b>mill</b> properties, particle/stirrer <b>sliding</b> friction {{plays a major role in}} energy transfer from stirrer to particles. Although there exists a minimum collision energy as particle/stirrer sliding friction increases, large particle/stirrer sliding friction may improve grinding performance as it has both large collision frequency and collision energy. However, that improvement is only up to a critical particle/disc sliding friction beyond which only input energy increases with little improvement on collision frequency and collision energy. Reducing the distance between stirrers or increasing the size of disc holes improves high energy transfer from discs to particles, leading to high collision frequency and collision energy. Among the different stirrer types, the energy transfer is more effective when disc holes are present. Pin stirrer shows increased collision energy and collision frequency which also result in a high power draw. Using the DEM results, a wear model has been developed to predict the wear pattern of the discs. This model can be used to predict the evolution of the disc wear with the time. It is shown that energy transfer from discs to particles are increased when discs are worn out. An attempt has also been made to analyze the microdynamic properties of the mill for different sizes. It is shown that specific power consumption and impact energy are correlated regardless of the mill size and mill speed...|$|R
