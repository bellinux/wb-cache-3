He <b>manufactured</b> <b>evidence</b> incriminating Greenlee in Erica's plane crash, which he is using to blackmail her. Ryan promises Greenlee that he will help her escape the marriage and put David behind bars. Kendall returns on hearing the news that Ryan is gravely ill, but soon learns of his plan.

500|$|Edwin V. Burkholder, who {{specialized}} in stories about the Old West, published an article about Wyatt in 1955 in Argosy Magazine. He called Wyatt Earp a coward and murderer, and <b>manufactured</b> <b>evidence</b> to support his allegations. He also wrote, using the pseudonyms [...] "George Carleton Mays" [...] and [...] "J. S.

His stores were filled with sensational claims about Wyatt Earp's villainy, and he made up fake {{letters to the editor}} from supposed [...] "old-timers" [...] to corroborate this story.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the purge both Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the SS Security Service, assembled a dossier of <b>manufactured</b> <b>evidence</b> to suggest that Röhm had been paid 12 million Reichsmark (EUR [...] in [...] ) by France to overthrow Hitler. Leading officers in the SS were shown falsified evidence on June 24 that Röhm planned to use the SA to launch a plot against the government (...) [...] Göring, Himmler, Heydrich, and Victor Lutze (at Hitler's direction) drew up lists of people in and outside the SA to be killed. One of the men Göring recruited to assist him was Willi Lehmann, a Gestapo official and NKVD spy. On June 25, General Werner von Fritsch placed the Reichswehr on {{the highest level of}} alert. On June 27, Hitler moved to secure the army's cooperation. Blomberg and General Walther von Reichenau, the army's liaison to the party, gave it to him by expelling Röhm from the German Officers' League. On June 28 Hitler went to Essen to attend a wedding celebration and reception; from there he called Röhm's adjutant at Bad Wiessee and ordered SA leaders to meet with him on June 30 at 11h. On June 29, a signed article in Völkischer Beobachter by Blomberg appeared in which Blomberg stated with great fervour that the Reichswehr stood behind Hitler.|$|E

2500|$|Others have {{suggested}} that [...] the silver of the molten reliquary and the water used to douse the flames may have catalysed the airborne carbon into the cloth. The Russian Dmitri Kouznetsov, an archaeological biologist and chemist, claimed in 1994 to have managed to experimentally reproduce this purported enrichment of the cloth in ancient weaves, and published numerous articles on the subject between 1994 and 1996. Kouznetsov's results could not be replicated, and no actual experiments {{have been able to}} validate this theory, so far. Professor Gian Marco Rinaldi and others proved that Kouznetsov never performed the experiments described in his papers, citing non-existent fonts and sources, including the museums from which he claimed to have obtained the samples of ancient weaves on which he performed the experiments. Kouznetsov was arrested in 1997 on American soil under allegations of accepting bribes by magazine editors to produce <b>manufactured</b> <b>evidence</b> and false reports.|$|E

50|$|Fuhrman {{retired from}} the LAPD in 1995. In 1996, he pleaded no contest to perjury for his false {{testimony}} related to his use of racial epithets, although {{the charges against him}} were later expunged. Fuhrman has stated that he is not a racist and apologized for his previous use of racist language. Fuhrman maintains that he did not plant or <b>manufacture</b> <b>evidence</b> in the Simpson case, and Simpson's defense team did not present any evidence to contradict this claim. Fuhrman believes that Simpson is guilty and places blame for his acquittal on the failure of lead detectives to enter evidence into the chain of custody and failure of the prosecution to adequately argue their case.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Li Linfu was {{beginning}} to conflict with Li Shizhi and Wei Jian, who were allies. Li Linfu, who engaged a group of secret police officials to investigate and <b>manufacture</b> <b>evidence</b> against political enemies, {{was able to get}} Wei and Li Shizhi demoted and exiled in 746. (Li Shizhi was replaced by Chen Xilie, who gained favor from Emperor Xuanzong for his knowledge in Taoism and sorcery.) In 747, Li Linfu further carried out a campaign of terror against exiled officials, and among the officials executed were Wei, Li Yong (李邕) and Pei Dunfu (裴敦復). Li Shizhi and Wang Ju, who had been instrumental in Emperor Xuanzong's initial actions against Princess Taiping, committed suicide.|$|R
2500|$|By 600, Yang Guang's {{older brother}} Yang Yong {{had lost the}} favors of Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu—over his {{wastefulness}} (which displeased Emperor Wen) and his having many concubines (which displeased Empress Dugu). [...] Yang Guang, by contrast, pretended to be frugal and loving only Princess Xiao. [...] (It was written that Yang Guang did have concubines, but he pretended that he did not, and that he forced his concubines to have abortions if they became pregnant.) [...] Yang Guang further inflamed Empress Dugu by informing her that she believed that Yang Yong was determined to kill him eventually. [...] Empress Yang thus resolved to remove Yang Yong. [...] Yang Guang further had his associate Yuwen Shu persuade Yang Su's brother Yang Yue (楊約) that, because Yang Su's relationship with Yang Yong was not good, that their family would be in peril should Yang Yong succeed Emperor Wen. [...] Finally, Yang Guang also had Yang Yong's associate Ji Wei (姬威) accuse Yang Yong of plotting treason. [...] Emperor Wen had Yang Su investigate, and Yang Guang and Yang Su <b>manufactured</b> <b>evidence</b> against Yang Yong. [...] Emperor Wen deposed Yang Yong and replaced him with Yang Guang, putting Yang Yong under house arrest under Yang Guang's watch. [...] Yang Guang later prevented Yang Yong from all attempts of seeing his parents again.|$|E

60|$|The {{cases with}} which it has to deal are of all kinds.

Generally, these people are involved in some fraud or other trouble. Again, husbands desert their wives, or wives their husbands, and vanish, in which instances they are probably living with somebody else under another name. Or children are kidnapped, or girls are lured away, or individuals emigrate to far lands and neglect to write. Or, perhaps, they simply sink out of all knowledge, and vanish effectually enough into a paupers grave.|$|E

25|$|The DeLorean Motor Company went {{bankrupt}} in late 1982 following John DeLorean's arrest in October {{of that year}} on drug trafficking charges. He was later found not guilty, {{but it was too}} late for the DMC-12 to remain in production. Approximately 100 partially assembled DMCs on the production line were completed by Consolidated International (now known as Big Lots). The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as well as parts from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were all shipped to Columbus, Ohio in 1983–1984. A company called KAPAC sold these parts to retail and wholesale customers via mail order. In 1997, DeLorean Motor Company of Texas acquired this inventory. There had also been a long-standing rumor that the body stamping dies were dumped into the ocean to prevent later <b>manufacture.</b> <b>Evidence</b> later emerged that the dies were used as anchors for nets at a fish farm in Ards Bay, Connemara, Ireland.|$|R
50|$|The 2nd inquiry, amidst frenzied {{publicity}} {{started on}} August 3 {{in response to}} new developments that suggested cohabitation with ex-employee Kenneth Ormiston in the resort town of Carmel-by-the-Sea instead of being held by kidnappers.

Later, when a defense witness, Lorraine Wiseman-Sielaff, sided with the prosecution as a betrayed co-plotter, another grand jury inquiry was ordered to begin in late September. Testimony and evidence from Carmel-by-the Sea was reintroduced by the prosecution together with their new witness. Their intent was show proof of a conspiracy by the McPherson party to <b>manufacture</b> <b>evidence</b> in bolstering her kidnapping story. The McPherson's defense team, previously overshadowed much of the summer by news publicity favoring the prosecution, was able to comprehensively explain their side of the case during October until they rested their case on the 28th.|$|R

In November 2012, an arbitrator ruled that Ellerbe illegally retaliated against Smith. The arbitrator also strongly criticized Ellerbe for trying to <b>manufacture</b> <b>evidence</b> against Smith, and for supplying a false rationale for Smith's transfer. When the arbitrator's ruling was made public, D.C.
