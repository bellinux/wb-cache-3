With {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons program's scientists, U.S. government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> to use virus as means of biological warfare. Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to be mistaken.|$|E

25|$|The {{daughter}} {{was not only}} in her father's power to be given in marriage, but he might dedicate her {{to the service of}} a god as a vestal or a hierodule or give her as a concubine. She had no choice in these matters, often decided in her childhood. An adult daughter <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> to become a votary, perhaps in preference to an uncongenial marriage, and it seems that her father could not refuse her wish.|$|E
25|$|Stereo linking can be {{achieved}} in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono {{the left and right}} channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case it could still make sense to dial different settings on left and right channels as one <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> to have less compression for left-side events).|$|E
25|$|A council {{court of}} {{randomly}} chosen citizens {{serves as a}} check on the tyranny of the majority, and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council <b>might</b> <b>wish,</b> but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a participatory economy.|$|E

25|$|Separate suits {{were brought}} by the American Independent Party and the Socialist Labor Party, {{challenging}} the validity of Ohio election laws insofar as they precluded the parties' being placed on the ballots to choose electors pledged to particular candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency of the United States; {{the attack on the}} validity of these laws was rested on the ground that they violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—on the ground that they denied plaintiffs and the voters who <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> to vote for them the equal protection of the laws, guaranteed against state abridgment by the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he <b>might</b> <b>wish.</b> The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall {{and saw that it was}} crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E
500|$|The Menon Constitutional Commission {{declined}} {{to recommend that}} political endorsements be prohibited, expressing the view that [...] "olitical parties {{are likely to have}} strong and potentially relevant views on the merits or demerits of Presidential candidates. The presence of an endorsement by a political party might be a factor that voters <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> to consider in the exercise of their vote. The Commission also considers {{that it would not be}} feasible, in any case, to prevent endorsements by politicians speaking in their public, as opposed to personal, capacities, as it would be very difficult to distinguish between the two in practice." ...|$|E

Stan Robertson at NBC suggested to Roddenberry that they <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> to get medical advice over whether the draining of a chemical from a person would kill them instantly. To find out, Roddenberry asked Kellam de Forest Research, who said that, while it had never happened in reality, a quick death would be likely. Johnson suggested that the creature in [...] "The Man Trap" [...] could be the last of its species. He compared its situation to the reduction in numbers of American bison. Roddenberry found the idea intriguing.|$|E

In contrast to arterial ultrasonography the wall of the vein is not relevant and importance is given to the hemodynamic conclusions that the examiner can obtain in order to provide a valuable report. (Hemodynamics is the study of blood flow and of the laws that govern the circulation of blood in the blood vessels). It follows that the [...] examiner knowledge of venous hemodynamics is crucial, which can be a real barrier to a radiologist untrained in this field, who <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> to carry out these examinations.|$|E
500|$|The {{rules and}} {{procedures}} of the Roman Senate were both complex and ancient. Many of these {{rules and procedures}} originated {{in the early years}} of the Republic, and were upheld over the centuries under the principle of mos maiorum ("customs of the ancestors"). While Senate meetings could take place either inside or outside of the formal boundary of the city (the pomerium), no meeting could take place more than a mile outside of the [...] pomerium. Senate meetings might take place outside of the formal boundary of the city for several reasons. For example, the Senate <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> to meet with an individual, such as a foreign ambassador, whom they did not wish to allow inside the city.|$|E

500|$|The {{bankrupt}} {{federal government}} was unable to provide much military assistance to the settlers in Texas, who faced frequent raids by native tribes. Hoping that an influx of settlers could control the raids, in 1824 the government appointed empresarios to encourage families from the United States and Europe to settle in Texas. However, {{as the number of}} settlers from the US and other non-Spanish-speaking areas increased in Texas, Mexican authorities became apprehensive that the United States <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> to annex the area, possibly using force. [...] On April 6, 1830, the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. [...] The laws also cancelled all unfilled empresario contracts and called for the first enforcement of customs duties.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just better do it because some day you <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E
500|$|Despite his influence, {{according}} to Fine and Manning there are [...] "remarkably few scholars who are continuing his work", nor {{has there been}} a [...] "Goffman school"; thus, his impact on social theory has been simultaneously [...] "great and modest". Fine and Manning attribute the lack of subsequent Goffman-style research and writing to the nature of his signature style, which they consider very difficult to duplicate (even [...] "mimic-proof"), and also to his writing style and subjects not being widely valued in the social sciences. With regard to his style, Fine and Manning remark that he tends to be seen either as a scholar whose style is difficult to reproduce, and therefore daunting to those who <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> to emulate his style, or as a scholar whose work was transitional, bridging the work of the Chicago school and that of contemporary sociologists, and thus of less interest to sociologists than the classics of either of those two groups. With regard to his subjects, Fine and Manning observe that the topic of behavior in public places is often stigmatized as being trivial, and thus unworthy of serious scholarly attention.|$|E

500|$|By contrast, NMEs Andy Capper was {{ambivalent}} {{towards the}} band's [...] "less electric, more organic sound" [...] and stated [...] "Older. More Mature. Warning {{is the sound}} of a band losing its way". Greg Kot of Rolling Stone wrote that Armstrong [...] "can't muster the same excitement for his more mature themes" [...] and stated [...] "Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?". Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic gave it three out of five stars and commented that it [...] "consists of instant classics like Minority and Macy's Day Parade, but it also is filled with garbage songs as well". Spin writer Jesse Berrett stated [...] "these maturity moves buoy muzzy be-yourselfism ... Nor does everything in the stylistic grab bag fit", but concluded by complimenting Armstrong's [...] "earnestly good-hearted" [...] lyrics and wrote that [...] "this album is after... evidence that even the snottiest deserve grace and the chance to age into warmth". Q gave the album three out of five stars and described it as [...] "Hugely likeable, terribly noisy and cute, as well as being jammed with proper pop songs". Neal Weiss of Yahoo! Music called the album [...] "crafty pop-rock" [...] and stated [...] "Some <b>might</b> <b>wish</b> Green Day never decided to grow up like this, but others might consider it a starting point to take the band seriously". Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani perceived elements of folk and [...] "pop sensibilities", writing that the album [...] "displays just how well Green Day can construct pop songs".|$|E
