5|$|Since the {{versions}} the {{two houses}} had passed were not identical, the bill {{returned to the}} House of Representatives, where on May 25, Arizona's Carl Hayden successfully moved that the House agree to the Senate amendment. The Speaker, Champ Clark, felt that {{the title of the}} bill <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> changed for reasons he did not explain, but Hayden disagreed and Clark did not press his point. The bill passed the House, and was enacted by the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on June 1, 1918.|$|E

Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary. They had enough vehicles to move 450 people to safety, and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation.

The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E
50|$|In formal {{standard}} English usage, {{more than one}} modal verb is not used consecutively, as modals are followed by an infinitive, which they themselves lack. They can only be combined with non-modal constructions that have a modal function, such as <b>have</b> <b>to,</b> which {{in spite of its}} function is not a modal verb. Thus, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>is</b> acceptable, but <b>might</b> must is not, even though must and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> can normally <b>be</b> used interchangeably. However the main auxiliary (which is usually the first modal verb in the sentence), doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the infinitive. To put double modals in past tense, only the first modal is changed as in I could ought to.|$|R

5|$|On August 31, 2007 the National Meteorological Service in Mexico decreed zone {{of alert}} from Lagunas de Chacahua, Oaxaca to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. It {{requested}} {{the public to}} take precautions before the possible coming of rain, intense winds and storm surges {{in the south and}} southwestern coasts of Mexico. The Ministry of Education of Guerrero canceled classes at all schools in the evening and close the port navigation. Faced with the prospect of Henriette strengthening, The Head of the Harbor Bay in Acapulco stopped all travel for small craft and coastal fisheries. Also blue and yellow flags were raised as a preventive measure for swimmers. On September 4, the port of Mazatlán, Sinaloa had to be shut down to all navigation due to the inclement weather produced by the hurricane. The port authority reported that Henriette produced waves surpassing 4meters (13ft) in height. The Carnival Pride cruise scheduled to arrive at the port had to be diverted out to sea {{as a result of the}} port's closure. In the city itself, school was suspended for two days, and officials stated that approximately 600families <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evacuated.

Political observers regarded Waggonner's criticism of Roemer as a factor in Roemer's failure to obtain a general election berth.

Long, had worked to make the river navigable from Shreveport through Alexandria and south to Simmesport, on the Avoyelles and Pointe Coupee parish border.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{supposed}} genus {{could well be}} paraphyletic, so that for example Dyspetornis – which is now contained therein – <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> separated again. A leg of an undescribed small diver {{was found in the}} Late Oligocene deposits at Enspel (Germany); it too may or may not belong to Colymboides. Of the crown genus Gavia, nearly ten prehistoric species have been named to date, and about as many undescribed ones await further study. The genus is known from the Early Miocene onwards, and the oldest members them are rather small (some are smaller than the red-throated diver). Throughout the late Neogene, the genus by and large follows Cope's Rule.|$|E
25|$|Piecing {{involved}} repairing sporadic yarn breakages. At the rollers, {{the broken}} yarn would be {{caught on the}} underclearer (or fluker rod on Bolton mules), while at the spindle it would knot itself into a whorl on the spindle tip. If the break happened on the winding stroke the spindle <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stopped while the thread was found. The number of yarn breakages was dependent {{on the quality of}} the roving, and quality cotton led to fewer breakages. Typical 1,200 spindle mules of the 1920s would experience 5 to 6 breakages a minute. The two piecers would thus need to repair the thread within 15 to 20 seconds while the mule was in motion but once they had the thread it took under three seconds. The repair actually involved a slight rolling of the forefinger against the thumb.|$|E

25|$|In mid 2008 {{after the}} {{indictment}} had been served, {{it was discovered}} that the main police investigator in the preliminary investigation had started working for one of the plaintiffs, Warner Brothers, before the date of the indictment. Sunde's lawyer Peter Althin questioned the neutrality and reliability of the preliminary investigation in the event that the investigator had entered the new employment during the investigation, and suspected the job might have been a reward for good work in The Pirate Bay investigation. Althin believed that the investigation <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> redone if that was the case. The prosecutor Håkan Roswall responded that it wouldn't have posed problems for the investigation because the police were working under his directive, and the investigator's superior officer brushed off the incident as nothing remarkable. Warner Brothers commented merely that the investigator hadn't received any compensation during the time he worked for the Swedish police. According to Roswall, this type of concurrent employment would not be an individual incident, but that the decision of possible bias would be for the court to decide, and that the investigator is not a key witness in the case. The investigator could not be reached during the trial and was taken off the witness list.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{an appeal}} filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's {{view that the}} President did not possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and was required to act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the legislative history of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, {{and the nature of}} the President's power in the Constitution. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights. In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.|$|E
