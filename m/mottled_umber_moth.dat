30|$|Winter moth (Operophtera brumata) and <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> <b>moth</b> (Erannis defoliaria) are forest Lepidoptera species {{characterized}} by periodic high abundance in a 7 – 11 [*]year[*]cycle. During outbreak years they cause severe defoliation in many forest stands in Europe. In {{order to better}} understand the spatio-temporal dynamics and elucidate possible influences of weather, stand and site conditions, a generalized additive mixed model was developed. The investigated data base was derived from glue band catch monitoring stands of both species in Central and North Germany. From the glue bands only female moth individuals are counted and a hazard code is calculated. The model can be employed to predict the exceedance of a warning threshold of this hazard code which indicates a potential severe defoliation of oak stands by winter moth and mottled umber in the coming spring.|$|E
30|$|In this study, data of <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> <b>moth</b> (Erannis defoliaria) {{and winter}} moth (Operophtera brumata) (short MUWM) from North and Central Germany were analysed. These related species usually occur {{together}} (Altenkirch 1981) and periodically defoliate entire oak stands in spring. In this way they weaken their host {{and act as}} a predisposition factor for severe damage, such as oak decline (Manion 2003). Therefore MUWM are both important and frequently monitored herbivorous insects in Germany. As both species have a similar biology their combined population density is estimated using glue band catches. The amount of caught female MUWM serves for the calculation of the hazard code. When these codes exceed the warning threshold of one, a potential severe defoliation of the host tree in the following spring is expected (Altenkirch 1966; Altenkirch 1981). Therefore, the hazard code also provides a warning threshold for the forest owner that pest control might be necessary in the coming spring.|$|E
50|$|Cotoneaster {{species are}} used as larval food plants by some Lepidoptera species {{including}} grey dagger, <b>mottled</b> <b>umber,</b> short-cloaked <b>moth,</b> winter moth and hawthorn moth. The flowers attract bees and butterflies and the fruits are eaten by birds.|$|R
40|$|Insects in 9 {{research}} {{areas in}} pedunculate oak and sessile oak forests in Slovenia have been studied. We identified 35 insect species {{as well as}} two genera from 13 families. The defoliation of oak leaves in studied forests was between 10 and 90 %. More than 80 % of the defoliation was caused by <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> and winter <b>moth</b> (Erannis defoliaria Cl., Operophthera brumata L.). Leaf-roll moths are an important group of pests of oak leaves and acorns. The most numerous is the green leaf-roll moth, Tortrix viridana L., followed by Archips crataegana Hb., Laspeyresia splendana Hb. and Laspeyresia amplana Hb. The ratio of appearance of oak sawflies (Apethymus abdominalis Lep. and Apethymus braccatus Gmel.) was 9 : 1. During the past 10 years, oak miner (Tischeria complanella Hb.) has attacked young oak trees heavily. Acorn destroyers (Balaninus glandium Mrsh. and Balaninus nucum L.) were important acorn pests. During the gradation of defoliators in the Prekmurje region of Slovenia there was an increased population density of their predators, such asground beetles and burying beetles (Calosoma sycophanta L., Calosoma inquisitor L., Carabus spp., Xylodrepa quadripunctata L. We can confirm that the health of oak forests in Slovenia is better than in Croatia and southeastern Europe...|$|R

30|$|The {{developed}} {{model can}} be used for short-term predictions of potential defoliation risk in Central and North Germany. These predictions are sensitive to weather conditions and the population dynamics. However, a future extension of the data base comprising further outbreak years would allow for deeper investigation of the temporal and regional patterns of the cyclic dynamics and their causal influences on abundance of winter <b>moth</b> and <b>mottled</b> <b>umber.</b>|$|R
50|$|Amelanchier {{plants are}} {{preferred}} browse for deer and rabbits, and heavy browsing pressure can suppress natural regeneration. Caterpillars of such Lepidoptera as brimstone moth, brown-tail, grey dagger, <b>mottled</b> <b>umber,</b> rough prominent, the satellite, winter moth, and the red-spotted purple {{and the white}} admiral (both Limenitis arthemis), as well as various other herbivorous insects feed on Amelanchier. Many insects and diseases that attack orchard trees also affect this genus, in particular trunk borers and Gymnosporangium rust. In years when late flowers of Amelanchier overlap those of wild roses and brambles, bees may spread bacterial fireblight.|$|R
30|$|The {{life cycle}} of the {{univoltine}} geometrid species <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> (Erannis defoliaria) and winter moth (Operophtera brumata) in Europe is characterized by an overwintering egg-stage close to the buds of the host tree, hatching in spring in synchrony with the host plant’s budburst, a long pupation stage from summer to autumn in the soil and emergence of the adults from the ground in autumn, usually after the first frost nights, with highest activity from evening hours until midnight (Schwenke 1978). In middle Europe, MUWM densities follow periodic peaks approx. Every 7 – 11 [*]years (Myers 1988; Tenow and Nilssen 1990; Delb 2012). In outbreak years, the polyphagous larvae might entirely defoliate broadleaves and conifers, with a preference for oak (Connell and Steyer 2007).|$|R

30|$|The {{influences}} on the MUWM populations are very complex and many aspects like predators or parasitisation were not considered explicitly in the modelling, {{even though they may}} have a strong regulating impact (Dempster 1983; Berryman 1996; Hunter 1998). Some meteorological variables, such as wind speed, sunshine and relative humidity, might give further explanations. Lagged effects of environmental factors could also be analysed more intensely in a subsequent study with the help of lagged nonlinear models (DLNM, Gasparrini 2011). Furthermore, Tenow et al. (2013) describe outbreak waves of winter moths that are travelling Europe, so considering the Europe-wide spatio-temporal dynamics of outbreaks might give valuable explanations of regional outbreak patterns. The model, however, gives first hints about existing influences. Future inventory data, including further population cycles, would improve the model and allow for further investigation of additional covariates and the verification of the identified effects. In this context, time series data, in particular, are of great value for model improvements. With the help of such an extended data base, winter <b>moth</b> and <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> should be investigated separately to clarify whether their sensitivity to the discovered parameters are the same.|$|R

40|$|In sub-arctic {{mountain}} birch {{forest in}} northern Fennoscandia, the 2 geometrid moth species Epirrita autumnata (autumnal moth) and Operophtera brumata (winter moth) show high-amplitude population cycles with regular 10 -year periodicity. During some population peaks, moth populations attain outbreak densities and cause region-wide defoliation and mortality of mountain birch. The severity {{and duration of}} moth outbreaks presently appears to be increasing, owing to climate-driven range-expansions of both native and novel (see below) moth species in the system. The causal mechanisms of moth population cycles have been widely studied, with research focusing {{on the role of}} parasitoids during the last decade. This research has focused on total parasitism rates and has paid little attention to parasitoid community organization and its consequences for the functionality of parasitoid communities. Study I – III of this PhD project addressed this knowledge gap for larval parasitoids, which have received more attention than other parasitoid guilds in the research on parasitism the birch-moth system. Study I explored the possibility of stochastic extinction-recolonization dynamics – induced by fluctuations in moth host populations – as a driver of the spatial distribution patterns of different larval parasitoid species. The study documented large-scale spatial segregation in the prevalence of different parasitoid species in O. brumata, which may have resulted from stochastic extinction-recolonization processes. However, the alternative explanation that the observed patterns were caused by spatial gradients in habitat characteristics could not be rejected. Further, the study found that the magnitude of total larval parasitism rates at a given location was independent of which parasitoid species was locally dominant. Study II mapped out the phenology of attack of the larval parasitoid species of O. brumata. The study showed that the attacks of different parasitoid species followed each other in a successional manner throughout the larval season, so that all larval instars were attacked by at least 1 parasitoid species. The study argued that this phenological diversity within the larval parasitoid guild would reduce the probability of climate-induced phenological mismatches between larvae and many parasitoid species within a single season, hence buffering total larval parasitism rates against stochastic climatic variation. Study III compared larval parasitoid species richness and prevalence rates among E. autumnata, O. brumata and Agriopis aurantiaria (scarce <b>umber</b> <b>moth).</b> E. autumnata is native species to the mountain birch forest, while O. brumata and A. aurantiaria invaded this system by range-expansion approximately a century and 15 years ago, respectively. The study found that E. autumnata and O. brumata hosted similar numbers of larval parasitoid species in the mountain birch system, while the larval parasitoid guild of A. aurantiaria was strongly species-impoverished compared to the 2 other moth species. Based on this, the study argued that invasive moth species take at least a century to acquire a larval parasitoid guild with native levels of species richness in the mountain birch forest. Total larval parasitism rates were similar among all 3 moth species, suggesting that invasive geometrid moths do not enjoy release from larval parasitism in the mountain birch forest, despite having species-impoverished larval parasitoid guilds. Taken together, study I – III pointed towards high levels of functional redundancy among larval parasitoid species in the birch-moth system. This could act to stabilize total larval parasitism rates in space and time. The studies also highlighted {{that it is necessary to}} resolve numerous uncertainties surrounding parasitoid taxonomy in order to make further progress in parasitoid community ecology in this system. While the causes of moth population cycles and outbreaks have been intensively studied, comparatively little attention has been paid to the ecological consequences of moth outbreaks. Some of the most serious knowledge gaps relate to the consequences of outbreak-induced forest damage for animal communities in the mountain birch ecosystem. Study IV and V addressed this issue by investigating the short-term responses of saproxylic (i. e. associated with dead wood) beetles and passerine birds, respectively, to an outbreak that had caused widespread mortality of birch forest 3 – 5 years before the outset of the studies. Study IV showed that the proportion of obligate saproxylic species in the beetle community was only about 10 % higher in damaged than undamaged birch forest. The study thereby indicated that saproxylic beetles have limited ability to respond numerically to the enormous amounts of dead wood that are generated by moth outbreaks. Climatic constraints on beetle activity and diversity in my sub-arctic study region, and species-specific preferences for dead wood in certain stages of decay, were suggested as explanations for the weak response of the saproxylic beetle community. The study raised the possibility that saproxylic beetles, owing to weak numerical responses, may play a minor role in wood decomposition in the immediate aftermath of moth outbreaks. This highlighted that there is need to learn more about the role of microbial wood-decomposer communities after outbreaks. The results of study V mirrored those of study IV, by indicating a weak response of bird communities to outbreak-induced forest damage. In 1 of my 2 main study areas (Kirkenes), the total abundance of birds was roughly 25 % lower in damaged than undamaged forest. Bird species-richness showed an even smaller reduction in damaged forest. Meanwhile, in the other study area (Tana), there were no consistent differences in bird abundance or richness between damaged and undamaged forest. The observed reduction in bird abundance in damaged forest in Kirkenes was mainly driven by the Willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus); a foliage gleaning species which may have suffered loss of foraging habitat due to outbreak-induced mortality of trees. By documenting a weak response to forest damage in the studied bird community, study V suggested that this community has a high degree of resistance to the habitat disturbance caused by outbreaks. This may be explained by the fact that many of the studied bird species are habitat generalists. It was also suggested that bird populations in the outbreak area might have been maintained by surviving trees and by standing birch trunks, which could serve to maintain the vertical structure of the forest habitat. Study IV and V were limited in their conclusions by their short-term time perspectives. Thus, both studies highlighted the need for more long-term research on the responses of animal communities to outbreak-induced forest damage in the mountain birch ecosystem...|$|R
