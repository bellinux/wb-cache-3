25|$|<b>Mechatronic</b> engineering, like systems engineering, is a {{multidisciplinary}} field of engineering that uses dynamical systems modeling to express tangible constructs. In that regard {{it is almost}} indistinguishable from Systems Engineering, but what sets it apart is the focus on smaller details rather than larger generalizations and relationships. As such, both fields are distinguished by the scope of their projects rather than the methodology of their practice.|$|E

50|$|Engineering {{cybernetics}} {{deals with}} the question of control engineering of <b>mechatronic</b> systems. It is used to control or regulate such a system (see control theory). Through collaboration, the <b>mechatronic</b> modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of <b>mechatronic</b> modules that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve hierarchy, polyarchy, heterarchy, and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control algorithms, which might or might not utilize formal methods in their design. Hybrid systems important to mechatronics include production systems, synergy drives,planetary exploration rovers, automotive subsystems such as anti-lock braking systems and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, hard disks, and CD players.|$|E

The transmission featured push-button overdrive lock-out, electronic shift scheduling, adaptive shift algorithms and a <b>mechatronic</b> {{transmission control module}} (TCM) that would save adaptive shift data in keep alive memory (KAM). This safeguarded against complete data loss {{in case of a}} power failure (such as disconnecting the battery). In the event of a power failure, the <b>mechatronic</b> unit would simply read the last saved data entry from the system's memory, thus, the transmission did not have to completely relearn the owner's driving style.|$|E
