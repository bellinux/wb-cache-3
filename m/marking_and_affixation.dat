25|$|Gaulish verbs have {{present and}} future tenses; indicative, subjunctive, and {{imperative}} moods; and active and passive voices. Verbs show a number of innovations as well. The Indo-European s-aorist evolved into the Gaulish t-preterit, formed by merging an old 3rd personal singular imperfect ending -t- to a 3rd personal singular perfect ending -u or -e <b>and</b> subsequent <b>affixation</b> to all forms of the t-preterit tense. Similarly, the s-preterit is formed from the extension of -ss (originally from the third person singular) <b>and</b> the <b>affixation</b> of -it to the third person singular (to distinguish it as such). Third-person plurals are also marked {{by the addition of}} -s in the preterit system.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAccording to {{most current}} theories, {{one of the}} main {{differences}} between human speech and animal vocal communication concerns syntax. In searching for the origins of syntactic communication, we analysed the loud call behaviour of free-ranging Campbell's monkey males. Using two years of naturalistic observations and predator-simulation experiments, we were able to distinguish six basic alarm call types. Acoustic variation to discriminate between the different calls was achieved by frequency modulation (Boom, Krak, Hok) <b>and</b> <b>affixation,</b> i. e., the facultative addition of an acoustic suffix (Krak-oo, Hok-oo, Wak-oo). Moreover, when responding to a disturbance, males rarely produce signle calls, but usually generated sequences of 2 to 40 calls. From the analysis of 250 calling events, we identified six contextually-determined calling sequences, which varied in terms of call type composition, order of succession, and rhythm of delivery. These levels of organization appear to encode information about the type and urgency of the danger, as well as the caller's associated behaviour. Preliminary playback experiments confirmed that <b>affixation</b> <b>and</b> call combination were discriminated by females. Our findings suggest that early precursors of syntactic communication may already have been present in the common ancestor of modern non-human primates and humans...|$|R

40|$|Though less {{productive}} than rival word-formation processes like compounding <b>and</b> <b>affixation,</b> blending {{is still}} {{a rich source of}} neologisms in French. Despite this productivity, however, blends are often seen by scholars as unpredictable, uninteresting, or both. This analysis picks up where recent studies of blending have left off, using Correspondence Theory and a bundle of segmental constraints to deal with this phenomenon as it pertains to French. More specifically, it shows that blending {{is the result of a}} single output standing in correspondence with two or more other outputs, and that we do not need to refer to prosodic information, which is crucial in accounts of blending in languages with lexical stress like English, to account for the process in French. The analysis also differs from previous studies in that it locates blending exclusively within the phonology, leaving its morphological and semantic characteristics to be handled by other processes in the grammar...|$|R

40|$|Most of spell {{checkers}} and morphological analyzers {{of natural}} languages {{are based on}} the affixes (suffixes and prefixes) extraction. But there are some other languages which use another kind of word changes like infixes and circumfixes. An infix is an affix that is inserted within a root. or stem. A circumfix is an affix, a morpheme that is placed around another morpheme. Circumfixes contrast with prefixes, attached {{to the beginning of the}} words; suffixes, that are attached at the end; and infixes, inserted in the middle. This features are not implemented now in spellcheckers, and can give more puissance and facility to model more languages rules <b>and</b> <b>affixations.</b> This paper concerns Arabic language which uses internal word changes and has more affixes dependency, and diacritics (HARAKAT) which are ignored usually. These characteristics exist in other languages. In this paper, we illustrate a try to add infixes, circumfixes support, ignoring diacritics to open source spell checkers Aspell and Hunspell. And what's the advantages of this new features in the languages morphology...|$|R
40|$|In Nootka, {{there is}} a {{strategy}} for forming hypocoristic names, or terms of endearment, from the normal form of the name {{by a combination of}} truncation, vowel mutation <b>and</b> <b>affixation.</b> The nature of this formation is highly suggestive of the type of morphology described by many linguists as subtractive. In this paper, however, we will show that what actually occurs is a pattern of template -filling based on the prosodic structure of the language. We will argue that the building of hypocoristic forms is, in fact, highly reminiscent of reduplicative strategies employed in this language as argued for in Stonham 1987 for the closely related Nitinaht language, the difference being that reduplication subsequently concatenates with the structure it has drawn from, while Nootka hypocoristic formation, henceforth H. F., abandons the remainder of the original structure, retaining only the copied portion required for the template. Before investigating the nature of H. F., we will first present certain aspects of Nootka structure which will be important for a clear exposition of the problem...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the number of affixes and vocabulary learning of Iranian advanced EFL (English as foreign language) students. In order to carry out the investigation, 43 (male and female) advanced students in Qazvin Province in Iran were chosen randomly, and then the initial number of students was reduced to 37 after the administration of proficiency pre-test. The data were collected using two separate tests. One of the tests was a proficiency test and the other was a vocabulary recognition test. Students were given information about paying attention to the word parts when answering the questions. One-way Repeated Measure ANOVA was used to analyze the data. The results showed that advanced students who used word formation strategy were aware of it and used that strategy in their test. Then, by using word formation instruction in general <b>and</b> <b>affixation</b> in particular teachers can create a creative situation for teaching and keep learners interested and motivated for learning vocabulary.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop and {{implement}} a program for learning second language (L 2) academic vocabulary with the objective of enhancing vocabulary learning strategies for reading proficiency and comprehension. This specially tailored program, based on language learning research, consists of five alternative strategies in order to identify ways of learning academic vocabulary for university level efl learners. Vocabulary knowledge not only implies being familiar with the meaning of a word, but also with its form (spoken, written, <b>and</b> its <b>affixation)</b> <b>and</b> its uses (collocations, grammatical pattern, and limits of its use). My experience as an english teacher of university students is that learners have considerable technical vocabulary because they are required to read texts in english related to their field of study. For that reason, their word knowledge is merely related to meaning by translation. GuayaquilMagister en Enseñanza del Inglés como Lengua Extranjer...|$|R

Despite the formula established in each respective framework, there could be occurrences of novelty and modification on how words are formed and how meaning developed in the newly formed words. The research shows that well accepted acronyms can become real words by taking lower case <b>and</b> <b>affixation.</b> Some acronyms initialized non-lexical words, used non initial letters, and used letters and numbers that pronounced {{the same with the}} words they represent. Compounding also includes numbers as the element member of the compound. The nominal nouns are likely to have metaphorical and idiomatic meanings. Some compounds evolve to new and more specific meaning. The study also finds that back-clipping is the most dominant clipping. In blending, the sub-category clipping of blending, the study finds out that when clipping takes place, the non-head element is back-clipped and the head is fore-clipped...|$|R
