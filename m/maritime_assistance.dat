FRAM was found to be a valuable tool for describing sociotechnical work, but was enriched by borrowing from ethnographically-inspired work studies traditions, with their strong grounding in empirical studies and themes of 'making work visible', symmetry between human/non-human, and work as activity. This approach indicates that bringing ideas from different traditions together to understand a real work practice may bring us closer to describing 'work as done', and its contributio...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: In case of pathologies or {{accidents}} {{on board}} which require medical intervention but lacking on-board medical or paramedical personnel, the ship’s captain, or his delegate can contact a Telemedical <b>Maritime</b> <b>Assistance</b> Service (TMAS). International Maritime Organisation considers telemedicine at sea {{as an integral}} part of rescue procedures. Five key elements contribute to the delivery of good medical assistance at sea: one or more coordination and rescue centres; the TMAS; the possibility of intervention at sea; an organisation of appropriate institutions on ground and common operating procedures. This paper analyses the responsibility of the ship’s captain and of the TMAS doctor in case of diseases or injuries on board in the frame of the main important international regulations. Responsibility of the ship captain: In case of a disease or injury on board a ship, the captain must contact the TMAS as soon as possible. A captain not acting promptly and not doing whatever it is possible for the ill/injured person by consulting the TMAS or a physician and/or not following prescriptions received, could be charged for omission of responsibility. A captain underestimating a medical problem and knowing that the patient’s condition could worsen, but still not consulting a medical centre for assistance, should be ready to accept the consequences of his choices. Responsibility of the physician: The doctor of TMAS has full responsibility for the diagnosis, prescription and treatment, while the ship’s captain is responsible for the final decision. Regarding the medical treatment and assistance on board a ship, the TMAS doctor should pay attention not only for the diagnosis, but also for the prognosis. Telemedicine implies that the doctor should make decisions without a clinical examination, often without some additional medical examinations and by maintaining a contact with other people who are in direct contact with the patient. The physician usually has to rely on the account of colleagues of the sick seafarer as far as medical history is concerned. This may make harder to take a decision. Conclusions: The ship’s captain is guilty if he fails to contact a TMAS in case of diseases or accidents on board. Similar to a traditional relationship between a patient and a physician, the doctor consulted via telecommunication systems is also responsible for his diagnosis and treatment. However, in telemedicine the contrasts with the most basic principles of the traditional medicine are obvious. This makes the delivery of medical care of seafarers on board ships quite complicated...|$|E
40|$|Sailing ships do {{not carry}} medical doctors or {{adequately}} trained paramedical staff and can {{need time to}} reach a port for medical reasons. This situation {{and the fact that}} merchant seafaring is a rather hazardous occupation makes seafarers more susceptible to risks with consequences on the health status and on the development of some types of disorders. It is the case of cardiovascular diseases that although have a similar frequency in seafarers compared to the general population, they can have a dramatic sudden occurrence at sea. The present study has investigated the cardiovascular causes of deaths on board ships assisted by Centro Internazionale Radio Medico (CIRM) in the years 1999 - 2008. CIRM is the Italian Telemedical <b>Maritime</b> <b>Assistance</b> Service (TMAS) and provides free medical assistance to ships of any nationality, sailing in all seas of the world. During the period under observation, CIRM has assisted 12, 465 patients on board ships. Deaths occurring were 205 (1. 64 %) and involved 192 crew members and 13 passengers. On referring our epidemiological analysis to cardiovascular diseases, during the period analyzed CIRM has assisted 1, 074 patients suffering from cardiovascular problems. Among these individuals, 72 deaths occurred (6. 7 %). On referring this figure to the total number of fatalities occurring, they represent the 35. 12 % of total deaths (205) and therefore they account for the first cause of deaths on board ships as well. Analysis of diagnosis/symptomatology referred according to the ICD- 10 epidemiological code releaveld that ischemic heart diseases (I 20 -I 25) were at the first place (n = 37, 51. 39 %), followed in the order by other forms of heart diseases (I 30 -I 52) (n = 29, 40. 28 %), hypertensive diseases (I 10 -I 15) (n = 4, 5. 56 %) and cerebrovascular diseases (I 60 -I 69) (n = 2, 2. 78 %). This investigation follows a previous study of our group on the causes of death on board ships derived from data of a maritime telemedical centre. This analysis, with limitations of correct/verified diagnosis at sea done from a remote physician through telecommunication systems is the only way of evaluating mortality close to the end of life or immediately after the event. This may contribute to identify situations of high risk of death for seafarers and to undertake possible preventive measures...|$|E
40|$|Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is a shore-side <b>maritime</b> <b>assistance</b> {{service that}} {{supports}} bridge teams in their safe navigation of port approaches {{and other areas}} that present navigational difficulties. The VTS is implemented in national waters and provides vessels with information through transmissions and broadcasts on Very High Frequency (VHF) radio. With a continued growth in the number, size and cargo volumes of merchant vessels, {{the role of the}} VTS has recently become a matter of discussion, and {{it has been argued that}} changes, such as implementing an aviation-like control system, would be of an enormous benefit for stakeholders and guarantee safe and efficient traffic movements in the future. The complexity of processes in safety-critical domains, such as maritime traffic management, is increasing due to continuing technical, organisational and environmental developments. The VTS is currently undergoing drastic changes, primarily driven by strategies and projects focusing on increasing the overall efficiency of the maritime transportation system through advanced technology. To reduce the risk of unforeseen consequences, it is important to study and understand the service and its contribution to traffic management before changes are implemented. The purpose of this thesis has been to increase the overall understanding of everyday performance of the VTS system and identify ways of modelling the performance of the service, as a contribution to the ongoing debate on the future needs of maritime traffic management. The VTS is described as socio-technical system that controls and manages maritime traffic in port approaches and other areas that pose navigational difficulties for bridge teams. Field data collected through semi-structured interviews, observations and focus groups have been analysed with the aid of concepts derived from Cognitive Systems Engineering (CSE) and Resilience Engineering (RE) to understand how the VTS actively contributes to safety through monitoring, responding to and anticipating changes in traffic patterns in the VTS area. The data have also been used to model performance variability in everyday operation with the aid of the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). Performance variability is necessary for a system to be adaptive, and is therefore essential for the system’s functioning. By using the FRAM, a new angle of the VTS system has been explored to understand how variability in its functional units affects the overall system performance. The thesis demonstrates the importance of understanding how performance in a socio-technical system can vary and the consequences this may have. The FRAM can be used to analyse the functional design of a socio-technical system, and therefore help to identify and assess ways in which performance variability can be monitored and managed. By understanding the functional design of the VTS system and the complexity of everyday operation, stakeholders will be able to identify advantages and disadvantages of current system design and use this to consider how future demands can best be met...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Global health {{diplomacy}} {{is important in}} mitigating disaster severity through collaboration. Complex health emergencies resulting from rapid onset disasters frequently rely on international stakeholders to alleviate suffering of an affected population. The United States Government possesses a unique medical capability to provide humanitarian assistance within Department of Defense (DoD that conducts proactive healthcare-capacity building <b>Maritime</b> Humanitarian Civic <b>Assistance</b> (mHCA) missions. Linking HCA proactive healthcare-capacity building activities to efficiencies in reactive disaster responses is a desired outcome for the DoD. Methods: Through examination of peer-reviewed and “grey” literature yielded (a) {{the manner in which}} HCA missions are referenced, as health-related activities or a strategic security tool; (b) identified mHCA missions process outcomes through structured web searches; and (c) the author professional affiliations referencing mHCA missions. A comparative case study of DoD military medical resources during complex disaster responses was undertaken. Disaster-affected nations where mHCAs had been conducted during 2006 - 2013 were systematically selected utilizing disaster risk trend and disaster tracking databases to define the unit of analysis; and (b) conduct thematic analysis of key stakeholders’ post-disaster reports documenting foreign militaries’ medical resources impact on disaster responses and associations with mHCAs. Results: The literature review identified 800 citations regarding mHCA missions with 126 meeting inclusion criteria. Documents identified as grey literature represented 58 % of the results and focused on national security agendas while describing maritime HCAs as a strategic security tool. No mention of mHCA mission impact on host nation health status was noted. Several themes emerged: a) pre-disaster health engagements with foreign nations are not identified with improvements in disaster responses; b) the benefit of establishing a formalized international disaster response and preparedness framework integrating military resources is acknowledged; and (c) ongoing disaster management education of military personnel is needed. Conclusion: This dissertation contributes to the understanding on the utility of military medical assets providing purposeful global health resources in disaster management. By examining the literature on proactive mHCAs and developing a comparative case study, the DoD’s strategic perspectives in disaster mitigation are better understood to inform the design of policy solutions to synergize DoD efforts in disaster-risk-reduction through healthcare-capacity buildin...|$|R
40|$|The {{maritime}} {{and land}} trade of the City of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) and its surroundings {{has always been}} “the corner stone” on which the grandeur of Dubrovnik, its political and economical power and culture were built. As early as 1441, the Dubrovnik trade was considered to consist of 3 / 4 of the maritime and only 1 / 4 of the land based trade. In 1181, the comunitas ragusina - the Commune of Ragusa was mentioned for the first time; as the time went by, it became the City-state. It was named The Ragusan Republic in 1430. The treaty concluded with Turkey in 1442 was in force up to the twilight of the Dubrovnik Republic (1806). It was convenient for Ragusans to have a sole ruler and a single state in their neighbourhood, not to mention how stubborn and quite often wanton ones. In his work “Mari, Gol, Isole, [...] . ” (1688.), Vincenzo Coronelli, the mapmaker, said about the Ragusans: “ [...] . They are the most ardent defenders of their freedom, putting in {{a great deal of}} effort to secure it, and at the same time, hating any kind of slavery [...] . ”. The Ragusan vessels were attacked by the pirates from Rhodes from 1507 - 1509 and later on. The main reason for flourishing of Ragusan shipping and trade was based upon focussing on their public life within these domains. The Ragusan Republic depended upon its investments into <b>maritime</b> affairs and <b>assistance</b> offered through stimulations, interaction of processes and consequential strengthening of its own prosperity (its enriched citizens). The Ragusan Maritime Insurance Law (Ordo super assecuratoribus) of March 5 th, 1568 is the oldest enacted law in the world, and in this way {{it was more than a}} century older than legal regulations on the maritime insurance - Ordonnance de la marine of 1681. Apart from the main shipyard in the old City port (in portu interiori Ragusii, in portu Ragusii), up to the construction of the new shipyard in Gruž (1526) there were shipyards in Ston and in the nearby islands of Lopud, Šipan (in Suđurađ) and Koločep (Kalamota) already in the 14 th century. Palladius Fuscus (1450 - 1520), in his work De situ orae Illyrici (published posthumously in 1540) cited that “there was no such a secluded part of Europe or one so inaccessible to the newcomers, where you would not encounter Ragusans practicing their merchant activity”. According to some researchers, Ragusa was the third strongest force in the Mediterranean (after Genoa and Venice) in the 14 th century. The Ragusan Republic was the first in the Mediterranean in the 16 th century and, in terms of their trading ocean-going sailing vessels under Ragusan and foreign flags, it was the third in the world (after Spain and the Netherlands). In his work Nautica Mediterranea (Rome, 1602, pp. 4 - 5), Bartolomeo Crescentio said: “ [...] . among experts and master craftsmen for galleons are the most numerous, and the most capable in this (the Mediterranean Sea, observation of the author) are Ragusans”, and Pantero Pantera in his work L’Armata Navale (Rome, 1614, p. 66) wrote down: “ [...] . while for navas and galleons building, masters of Dubrovnik, Portugal and England were highly esteemed”. ”Argosy”, in fact, means “a Ragusan ship”. Many endeavours and achievements in the art of shipbuilding raise the East Adriatic coast above the West one, since it had most frequently been a successful way in which ships and men reached di erent parts of the world...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of doctors or {{adequately}} trained paramedic personnel on board of the majority of ships, the most reliable possibility of treating diseases or accidents of sailing seafarers is to provide medical advice via telecommunication systems. For more than 50 years, several radio medical services has been operational, starting by using radio signals and Morse code, evolving through telephones to full blown telemedicine solutions. This study has analyzed the evolution in medical assistance provided by Centro Internazionale Radio Medico (CIRM), the Italian Telemedical <b>Maritime</b> <b>Assistance</b> Service (TMAS) in the last 10 years. CIRM was established since 1935 and offers free medical assistance to ships without a doctor on board of any nationality and navigating in all the seas of the world. In this study analysis was accomplished by reviewing data of medical assistance of the Centre from January 1 st 1999 to December 31 st 2008. Analysis of total patients assisted revealed a significant increase of their number in the years, from 1159 in 1999 to 1963 in 2008 (41 % increase). The number of teleconsultations was also increased. Medical assistance was delivered primarily to merchant ships {{and to a lesser extent}} to passenger and fishing vessels in the order. The main changes were noticeable in the telecommunication systems used for medical assistance. Voice communications remained in percentage at the same levels throughout the years, whereas requests received via radiotelex and telefax remarkably decreased. The use of e-mail for contacts increased by about 6 times from 2001, the year in which this communication system was introduced at CIRM, to 2008. Pathologies assisted were classified according to the ICD- 9 until 2007 and according to the ICD- 10 starting from 2008. Accidents were pathologies most assisted (more than 20 % of total cases), followed by diseases of the digestive system (18 %), urinary system (10 %) and cardiovascular system (7 %). Cardiovascular pathologies represented the first cause of deaths on board ships, accounting for approximately the 45 % of total fatalities (1. 55 % of cases assisted by the Centre). The observation that e-mail is becoming the system most used for medical assistance of patients on board ships represents an advantage in terms of possible evolution of medical care to seafarers. In fact, this system the most suitable for transmitting by store-and-forward images of affected areas and several biomedical data. Hence, from a technological point of view, a system supporting telemedical applications is at the present the most used for obtaining medical advice from CIRM. Unfortunately basic telemedical devices on board ships and a culture/training of their utility and use are still lacking. The wide use of telemedicine for medical assistance to ships has obvious technological limitations, but also significant medical challenges. Telemedicine solutions for ships must be able to use satellite communication, with the limits to message size and real time applications that this introduces. Flexible solutions are developed that are able to use several communication carriers depending on what is available at any time. On maritime telemedicine we are getting significant experience in its advantages as well as in its limitations, but it is the only means by which expert medical advice at sea can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|Seafaring {{represents}} a particularly hazardous occupation {{when compared with}} shore-based activities and seafarers are exposed to risks rarely encountered by workers in other occupations. People living ashore may have medical services available within a short time. On board ships the situation is different {{and the majority of}} vessels is at sea for days or weeks before they can reach a port. On the other hand, ship {{represents a}}t the same time working place and living quarter and only very few ships carry a doctor or an adequately trained paramedic on board. In this situation, the best possibilities for treating diseases or accidents on board are : (i) to provide medical advice via telecommunications systems; (ii) to guarantee adequate training of personnel with the responsibility of health care on board; (iii) to have an adequate supply of drugs and essential medical equipment. Pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies carried by shipping vessels constitute the so-called ship’s medicine chest. The contents of the medicine chest and the medical equipment carried on board is prescribed by national authorities taking into account international recommendations in this field, such as those of the International Medical Guide for Ships and the List of Essential Drugs published by the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as advances in medical knowledge and approved methods of treatment. The last edition of the Medical Guide for Ships and the List of Essential Drugs were published recently (2008). Contents of the medicine chest and of medical supplied to be carried by ships should consider the type of ship, the number of persons on board and the nature, destination and duration of voyages. Literature available on ship’s medicine chest and more in general on maritime pharmacy is sparse and criteria followed by national authorities or by international organizations in establishing their contents are not known. The Working Group Ships Medicines established by the Community Pharmacy Section (CPS) of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) has provided an important counseling on the List of Essential Drugs recently recommended by WHO. The Group proposed an international forum to develop international standards of a global quality management system for maritime pharmacy or an internationally accepted guide issued by the WHO. Unfortunately, adeqate (pharmaco) epidemiological data on diseases occurring on board ships, their standard treatment(s) and on the use of medicines on ships serving as a reference for these actions are still missing. Taking into account that telemedical advice is largely used for treating diseases occurring on board ships, we have undertaken an extensive analysis on the type of medications most often used in telemedical assistance to ships. Analysis was based on the review of medical files assisted by Centro Internazionale Radio Medico (CIRM) in 2004 - 2008. CIRM is the Italian Telemedical <b>Maritime</b> <b>Assistance</b> Service (TMAS) and has one of the largest experience in the world of medical assistance of seafarers with more than 60, 000 patients assisted on board ships.

Based on pharmacotherapeutic guidelines for a given diagnosis, treatment prescribed on board ship and optimal (according to the guidelines) possible therapy will be defined. The expected results may serve as a reference for future regulations on the contents of the medicine chest...|$|E
