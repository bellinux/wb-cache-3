50|$|The Miami Heat {{started the}} 2006-2007 NBA season poorly. After raising their {{championship}} banner {{prior to the}} opening game against the Chicago Bulls, Chicago blew out Miami 108-66. This marked the worst home loss in the team's history, and the worst margin of defeat for a defending Champion (42 points) on opening day in NBA history. O'Neal played the first few games for the Heat, then missed over thirty with a right knee injury. Key members of the Heat's Championship run, Antoine Walker and Gary Payton, were finding themselves on the bench {{at the expense of}} Jason Kapono and Dorell Wright. The first half of the Heat's season was full of misfortune. Coach Riley took an indefinite leave, Wade briefly injured his right wrist, while James Posey and Walker were delisted after failing a body <b>mass</b> <b>exam.</b> Matters improved for the team. Rothstein, the Heat's original head coach, returned on an interim basis. Both Posey and Walker were reinstated. Former Heat star Eddie Jones re-signed with the team after being released by the Memphis Grizzlies. O'Neal returned to play in January. Riley resumed his duties as head coach {{at the start of the}} second half of the season.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the most {{effective}} means of revising course material in-class, the researchers manipulated the type of revision (spaced after each chapter versus a single, pre-exam revision) and collected exam scores, student study time estimates, and student confidence estimates. In addition, the researchers manipulated whether the class received a study skills training lecture {{at the beginning of the}} semester. Results indicated that a single, massed revision might have a counterintuitive effect, increasing student confidence, while decreasing study time and exam scores. This negative effect, however, was mitigated by a brief study skills training that highlighted the dangers of overconfidence and <b>massed</b> practice. <b>Exam</b> revision sessions are popular among university students (Beekes, 2006; Gibson, 1991), but many lecturers hold conflicting feelings regarding revision sessions as a part of, or in addition to, regular class meetings. Properly held exam revision sessions can be an effective means to help the students focus on complicated or poorly-understood material (Aamodt, 1982; Gurung & Bord, 2008). However, exam revision sessions can have their pitfalls. Students may use a single pre-exam revision session as a form of massed practice, and it is well established that spaced practice, studying for shorter periods of time more frequently, is superior to massed practice (Dempster...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is no {{validated}} {{scoring system}} for differentiating {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Studies variably report clinical measures such as radiology, endoscopy, inflammatory markers, and symptoms to separate IBS from IBD. Our study seeks to create a system to IBD patients from IBS. The “REBISS” score incorporates various clinical criteria used commonly for diagnosis. We also studied a second system called “REBISS-PCP” focusing on a subset of criteria {{that are available to}} PCPs when faced with this challenge. Methods: This study was approved by the UMass IRB. Two cohorts were identified: 24 IBD patients (Group 1) and 24 IBS patients (Group 2). Subjects in Group 1 were patients with Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis. Subjects in Group 2 were identified as having IBS based on ROME III criteria. Retrospective analysis was performed and a score was calculated. One point is assigned for having: radiological findings consistent with IBD, endoscopic findings of inflammation or ulceration, biopsy findings consistent with IBD, elevated inflammatory markers, weight loss, hematochezia, extra-intestinal signs/symptoms, palpable <b>mass</b> on <b>exam,</b> and perianal disease. The maximum score is 10 points. For the REBISS-PCP score, the same clinical criteria were studied with the exclusion of endoscopic and biopsy findings. Maximum score for that system is 8 points. A likelihood ratio chi-square test was performed for both cohorts and scoring systems. Results: The REBISS scoring system showed a significant differentiation of the two cohorts in regards to scoring distribution (chi-square value = 59. 8; p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). The REBISS-PCP scoring system also found a significant differentiation of the two cohorts (chi-square value = 35. 7;p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Discussion: The REBISS scoring system could be used to standardize IBD and IBSd populations in an academic research setting, while both the REBISS and REBISS-PCP scoring system {{could be used as a}} screening tool in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Primary neuroendocrine tumors of {{the larynx}} are rare, with {{moderately}} differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (MDNC) being the most frequent histologic type. We report a MDNC in a 57 -year-old gentleman with an enlarging right-sided neck <b>mass.</b> Flexible fiberoptic <b>exam</b> revealed a right arytenoid lesion. Histology from excisional biopsy was concerning for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) versus NET of the larynx. Immunohistochemistry was diffusely positive for calcitonin and CEA and focally positive for TTF- 1. Serum calcitonin was elevated. Thyroid ultrasound was unremarkable. The patient underwent laryngectomy, thyroidectomy, and neck dissection. Pathology showed neuroendocrine carcinoma of right arytenoid with positive cervical lymph nodes. A 4 [*]mm deposit of NET was present in right thyroid with adjacent intravascular tumor consistent with thyroidal metastasis from a primary laryngeal NET (MDNC). MDNC and MTC can be microscopically indistinguishable. Both tumors can stain positively for calcitonin and CEA. TTF- 1 staining has been useful to help distinguish these tumors as it is strongly and diffusely positive in MTC, but usually negative (or only focally positive) in MDNC. We report the fourth case of primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the larynx associated with elevated serum calcitonin level and the first such case associated with metastasis to the thyroid...|$|R
40|$|A 48 -year-old woman {{presented}} with progressive right-sided hearing loss, chronic dysphonia and tinnitus. These signs {{were associated with}} chronic headache and dizziness for two years. On physical examination, the eardrums were normal. There was a right facial nerve dysfunction classified grade III according to House Brackmann grading system. Oral examination found a left side deviating uvula (curtain sign), tongue weakness with mild atrophy and abolition of gag reflex. Cervical examination showed a right shoulder weakness without palpable cervical <b>mass.</b> Laryngeal endoscopic <b>exam</b> found right vocal cord paralysis. There were no other significant cranial nerve findings. A finger-to-nose examination showed mild ataxia of the right upper limb. The gait was normal. An audiogram demonstrated a 60 dB sensorineural hearing loss. The stapedius reflex was absent. A CT scan was performed and found an enlargement of the jugular foramen and moderate enhancement with contrast medium (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an isointense tumor on T 1 weighted images (WI), hyperintense on T 2 WI and enhance with gadolinium, this tumor extended to the internal auditory meatus (Figure 2). The patient was treated with GKS with a good clinical evolution. Jugular foramen schwannomas arising from cranial nerves IX, X, and XI are uncommon pathological conditions, slowly growing benign tumors that constitute approximately 2. 9 to 4 % of all intracranial schwannomas [1, 2]. Jugular foramen schwannomas represent 10 - 30 % of all tumors observed around the jugular foramen [3, 4]. The standard primary treatment for jugular foramen schwannomas is tota...|$|R
40|$|DR. COURTENEY MACKUEN: Today’s {{patient is}} a 56 -year-old woman who {{presents}} with complaint of mid-sternal and left-sided chest discomfort beginning after several episodes of nausea and non-bloody emesis. She {{had been drinking}} alcohol the evening prior to presentation. She became con-cerned when she developed persistent, penetrating chest pain after vomiting. She did not describe a tearing sensation. She presented to the emergency department via ambulance 4 hours after the onset of pain. She received an aspirin and a sub-lingual nitroglycerin tablet without relief from the Emergency Service personnel. Her history is significant for hypertension and an episode of chest pain two years ago with resultant hospitalization. She stated that she had an elevated troponin but minimal coronary artery disease (CAD) on catheterization. She was told she had a “broken heart. ” She denied history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). She is a non-smoker. She reported {{a great deal of}} stress in her employment. Her only medication is venlafaxine hydrochloride. DR. ANDREW NATHANSON: Can you describe her physical exam? DR. MACKUEN: The patient appeared uncomfortable. Her brachial artery blood pressures were equal – 144 / 88 mm Hg. Her pulse was 96 and regular, respiratory rate was 16, and her room air oxygen saturation was 98 %. Her neck was supple, with no bruits; her lungs were clear bilaterally, and her chest wall had no crepitus.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most common cancers in women and the main cause of death due to {{malignancy}} in women between 40 - 44 years of age. This cancer is responsible for 33 % of all cancers in women and 20 % of all deaths due to cancer in women. "nMammography is the main modality for screening and diagnosis of breast lesions, but in dense breasts it has low sensitivity (about 48 %) with low possibility for visualization of mass lesions or calcifications, and this results in fading abnormal findings and increasing the risk of malignancy. This defect is compensated by ultrasonography. "nSonography also elegantly shows hidden areas, which are covered by normal breast tissue in mammography, and also shows the pictures real time without overlap. "nPresence of any palpable <b>mass</b> in clinical <b>exam</b> was an excluding criterion for patients from the study. Any lesion as a cystic or solid mass or echo change or calcification was recorded in the database. If a lesion had a malignant picture, FNA or core biopsy was done for it and the sample was sent for pathologic report. "nThis study showed that correlation with sonography is mandatory in women who have dense breasts in mammography, even if it is a low-grade dense breast. If this correlation was not done, breast cancers present in 1. 5 % of the studied population would be missed. "nSo due to the high false negativity of mammography in dense breasts, in the time being, sonography is considered as the second line screening method and complementary modality for mammography. It not only increases the diagnostic accuracy, but also as the only real time imaging modality, it can be used for localization and precise biopsy of breast lesions. Also, it can be used without any limitation as a cheap and harmless way for follow up imaging in short intervals for suspected patients...|$|R

As sementes do híbrido AG 303, tratadas com deltametrina e clorpirifos, aplicados na forma isolada ou em combinação, fosfina e terra diatomácea, foram acondicionadas em sacos de papel multifoliado e armazenadas por doze meses (maio/ 1997 a abril/ 1998) em condições normais de ambiente. Em intervalos bimestrais, sete épocas no total, as sementes foram submetidas às seguintes determinações: exame de sementes infestadas, massa de 100 sementes, teste de germinação, teste de frio, envelhecimento acelerado, condutividade elétrica, emergência de plântulas em campo e velocidade de emergência de plântulas. A análise dos dados e interpretação dos resultados permitiram concluir que: os inseticidas deltametrina e clorpirifos (isolados ou associados), a terra diatomácea e a fosfina promovem, de maneira similar, o controle de insetos-praga que ocorrem no armazenamento e não causam toxicidade às sementes; a qualidade fisiológica das sementes é efetivamente preservada pelos tratamentos com inseticidas químicos e terra diatomácea. To {{study the}} effects of {{insecticides}} (deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos, phosphin, and diatomaceous earth) on the insect control of stored corn seeds during 12 months, this research was performed to find an alternative product, using a randomized design.
