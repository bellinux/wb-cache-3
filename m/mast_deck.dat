6000|$|... "Then, in {{accordance}} with a clause in the agreement, the vessel must be kept in efficient repair {{to the satisfaction of}} a qualified surveyor. The man I sent down reports that she needs a new <b>mast,</b> <b>decks</b> relaid, and a good deal of new planking about her water-line. Your father has particulars." ...|$|R
60|$|No sooner {{did they}} clamber on board {{than they were}} saluted with a score of spears, which stuck in the <b>masts</b> and <b>deck,</b> one passing through the fleshy part of a sailor's arm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{surveyor}} {{who examined}} Scammel {{prior to her}} entering service noted that [...] "she had two <b>masts,</b> one <b>deck,</b> a short quarter deck, low waists with rails fore and aft, and was schooner rigged." ...|$|R
50|$|The wreck {{remained}} undiscovered until 1987. It is in 160 feet (48.8 meters) of water, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} complete wrecks of a schooner of its era. The <b>masts</b> and <b>deck</b> equipment are still in place.|$|R
6000|$|... "If he {{has tried}} to lay-to, he will not have a sail left in the bolt-ropes, or perhaps a <b>mast</b> on <b>deck.</b> I know the stiff-neckedness of those Spanish tubs. Hurrah! there he is, right on our {{larboard}} bow!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The term jib is {{the generic}} term {{for any of}} an {{assortment}} of headsails. The term genoa (or genny) refers to a type of jib that {{is larger than the}} 100% foretriangle, which is the triangular area formed by {{the point at which the}} stay intersects the <b>mast,</b> and <b>deck</b> or bowsprit, and the line where the <b>mast</b> intersects <b>deck</b> at the rail. Colloquially the term is sometimes used interchangeably with jib. A working jib is no larger than the 100% foretriangle. A genoa is larger, with the leech going past the mast and overlapping the mainsail. To maximize sail area, the foot of the sail is generally parallel and very close to the deck when close hauled.|$|R
2500|$|Scaffolding {{was erected}} over the stern to {{facilitate}} {{the removal of the}} mizzenmast (or aft <b>mast)</b> and <b>deck</b> fittings. These items were stored in a hut constructed on one of the cofferdams or aboard the collier [...] On May 27, 1911, Leonidas transported the mizzenmast back to the United States.|$|R
50|$|A {{staysail}} is a fore-and-aft rigged sail whose luff can be {{affixed to}} a stay running forward (and most often {{but not always}} downwards) from a <b>mast</b> to the <b>deck,</b> the bowsprit, or to another mast.|$|R
50|$|The {{vessel was}} built in 1881 by Richardson, Duck and Company at Stockton-on-Tees, England for E. Bates & Sons of Liverpool. She was an iron hulled fully rigged sailing ship {{consisting}} of three <b>masts</b> and two <b>decks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the masts {{measures}} approximately 57 m above the bottom bearing. As the rig can be tacked to allow flow in both directions, the <b>mast</b> rotates about <b>deck</b> and keel bearings and have symmetrical elliptical sections for better aerodynamics in both flows.|$|R
5000|$|As designed, Wolfs {{dimensions}} were {{in keeping}} with other vessels of her class with an overall length of 87 ft, a beam of 25 ft and measuring 243 [...] tonnes burthen. She had two masts, square-rigged and supported by a trysail mast aft of the main <b>mast.</b> Two <b>decks</b> were fitted instead of one, reflecting the design of her predecessor, the 1731 [...] Constructed with eight pairs of gunports, she was initially supplied with fourteen four-pounder cannons in addition to twelve deck-mounted half-pounder swivel guns.|$|R
25|$|The {{survival}} and position {{of some of}} the features within the wreck would suggest that the buried structure could be mostly intact as the position of hull structure, <b>deck</b> beams, <b>masts</b> and even <b>deck</b> fittings are all as would be expected from a mostly intact buried vessel.|$|R
50|$|The pylons, road <b>deck,</b> <b>masts,</b> {{and cable}} stays are {{equipped}} with a multitude of sensors. These are designed to detect the slightest movement in the Viaduct, and measure its resistance to wear-and-tear over time. Anemometers, accelerometers, inclinometers, temperature sensors are all used for the instrumentation network.|$|R
50|$|The {{survival}} and position {{of some of}} the features within the wreck would suggest that the buried structure could be mostly intact as the position of hull structure, <b>deck</b> beams, <b>masts</b> and even <b>deck</b> fittings are all as would be expected from a mostly intact buried vessel.|$|R
50|$|The damage {{incurred}} by Governor Parr was significant to the <b>masts</b> and <b>deck</b> of the ship; however, {{she did not}} sink. Instead, she remained afloat and drifted throughout the Atlantic. Several {{attempts were made to}} either destroy or tow this derelict to shore, but all failed. On January 1, 1924, the American Coast Guard's USCGC Tampa attempted to tow Parr towards Halifax, NS. Parr broke away from the tow line on January 2 in a heavy gale. Tampa had to give up this attempt to return to shore to refuel.|$|R
50|$|The {{imagery of}} these earlier flaps give little ground to broad {{extraterrestrial}} interpretations: {{they no longer}} look futuristic in the slightest with their Zeppelin shapes, propellors, flapping wings, <b>masts,</b> ship <b>decking,</b> and humans in contemporary attire. It seems irrefutible that social forces are necessary to account for them. Whatever the ultimate explanations of individual modern ufo flaps prove to be, it is blatant that social forces can be a sufficient cause in creating emotional climates favorable to frequent sightings {{of things in the}} sky that are not fully real.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century most yacht races were started by {{allotting}} starting positions to the competitors. Buoys were laid in a straight line, to which the competitors attached their yachts by means of spring ropes. The yachts were required to keep all the sails forward of the main <b>mast</b> on <b>deck</b> until the starting signal was given. [...] The Yacht Racing Association was founded in 1875 by Prince Batthyany-Strattman, Captain J. W. Hughes, and Mr. Dixon Kemp. The Y.R.A. wrote standardised yacht racing rules which included the 'Flying Start' used today.|$|R
5|$|Between 1761 and 1790, 14-15 turumas were built, {{including}} Amphion, {{a modified}} version used by King Gustav III as both a pleasure craft and command ship. The turuma was among the heaviest in the arsenal of the archipelago fleet {{and a number of}} them served in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. It had three <b>masts,</b> two <b>decks</b> and was equipped with 16–22 pairs of oars along with a crew of about 220–260. Its length was 35–39m, width 9m and the draft 3,3m. The armament consisted of 24–28 heavy guns with up to 24 swivel guns for close-quarter combat.|$|R
50|$|By 1850, North Carolina's {{pine forests}} were {{producing}} {{one-third of the}} world's supply of naval stores. Resin collected from elongated, inverted V-shaped cuts in the tree trunks was distilled into turpentine. Turpentine {{was used as a}} solvent and illuminant. Tar, pitch and rosin were used for sealing the hulls, <b>decks,</b> <b>masts,</b> ropes and riggings of sailing vessels.|$|R
60|$|As his {{exhaustion}} vanished {{he began}} to note things. The men had secured the boom; but the schooner's bows looked bare and he remembered the jibs had blown away. The foresail was torn and half-lowered, and the gaff at its head was jambed. The torn canvas kept the vessel from falling off the wind, but would not bring her up {{enough for her to}} lie to. <b>Masts</b> and <b>deck</b> were horribly slanted, the windward bulwark was hove high up, and luminous spray drove across its top. It looked as if she were going over and there was an appalling din, for the scream of the tornado pierced the thunder.|$|R
50|$|Hyperion is {{the name}} of a 155.5 ft sailing yacht built by the Royal Huisman in the Netherlands in 1998 and {{designed}} by German Frers. At the time of her launch, she was the largest sloop ever built, and had the tallest mast. The 194 ft carbon-fiber <b>mast</b> clears the <b>deck</b> of the Golden Gate Bridge by only 30 ft.|$|R
50|$|Alexander was barque-built in Hull in 1783 {{with three}} <b>masts</b> and two <b>decks.</b> She was a plain-looking vessel, without {{galleries}} or figurehead. At 452 tons burthen, {{she was the}} largest transport in the Fleet and carried at least 30 crew. Her owners were Walton & Company, a firm of Southwark merchants headed by master mariner William Walton. Her master was Duncan Sinclair.|$|R
40|$|The "David W. Rust" {{was built}} by Thomas T. Arnold at East Saginaw, Michigan in 1873. She was built of wood and was of 884 gross tons. She {{featured}} four <b>masts</b> and two <b>decks.</b> In 1895, her rigging was changed from four to two masts. By 1892, she was owned by L. S. Sullivan of Toledo, Ohio, where she burned October 3, 1908...|$|R
50|$|Standing rigging is cordage {{which is}} fixed in position. Standing rigging {{is almost always}} between a <b>mast</b> and the <b>deck,</b> using tension to hold the mast firmly in place. Due to its role, {{standing}} rigging is now most commonly made of steel cable. It was historically made of the same materials as running rigging, only coated in tar for added strength and protection from the elements.|$|R
50|$|The {{foot of a}} Bermuda sail may be {{attached}} to the boom along its length, or in some modern rigs the sail is attached to the boom only at its ends. This modern variation of a Bermuda mainsail is known as a loose-footed main. In some early Bermudian vessels, the mainsails were attached only to the <b>mast</b> and <b>deck,</b> lacking booms. This is the case on two of the three masts of the newly built Spirit of Bermuda, a replica of an 1830s British Royal Navy sloop-of-war. Additional sails were also often mounted on traditional Bermudian craft, when running down wind, which included a spinnaker, with a spinnaker boom, and additional jibs.|$|R
5000|$|... 3 October 1923, the SV Governor Parr: This four masted {{schooner}} {{was abandoned}} by her crew after {{she lost her}} mizzen and spanker in a storm while sailing from Ingramport, Nova Scotia, Canada to Buenos Aires, Argentina. The damage incurred by Governor Parr was significant to the <b>masts</b> and <b>deck</b> of the ship; however, she did not sink. Several {{attempts were made to}} either destroy or tow this derelict to shore, but all failed. Governor Parr was sighted for many years after her abandonment as she covered large spans of the Atlantic Ocean. She remained a derelict and “menace to navigation,” drifting as far as the Canary Islands. It is unknown what happened to her in the end.|$|R
60|$|All {{the while}} the winches {{hammered}} and pulleys screamed as the cases {{came up and}} the empty slings went down. The heat got suffocating and the slant of <b>masts</b> and <b>deck</b> made matters worse, because the men must hold the derricks back with guys while the heavy goods cleared the coamings of the hatch. Much judgment was needed to drop them safely in the boats. Men gasped and choked, quarreled with each other, and growled at the mates, but somehow held on while the tide ebbed and the sun sank nearer the mangroves' tops. It dipped when the breathless peons pushed the last boat away from the Rio Negro's side, and the noisy machines stopped.|$|R
25|$|Another {{surviving}} Gozo boat is the Maryanne, {{which was}} built in Gela in 1960. The boat remained in Gozo until February 1983, when it was purchased by Captain Morgan Cruises. The boat still belongs to Captain Morgan, and it is used for cruises around Marsamxett and the Grand Harbour. Maryanne is in good condition, but it {{no longer has the}} distinctive <b>masts</b> and a <b>deck</b> has been added.|$|R
50|$|If the {{accounts}} {{can be taken}} as factual Zheng He's treasure ships were mammoth ships with nine <b>masts,</b> four <b>decks,</b> and were capable of accommodating more than 500 passengers, {{as well as a}} massive amount of cargo. Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta both described multi-masted ships carrying 500 to 1,000 passengers in their translated accounts. Niccolò Da Conti, a contemporary of Zheng He, was also an eyewitness of ships in Southeast Asia, claiming to have seen 5 masted junks weighing about 2,000 tons. There are even some sources that claim some of the treasure ships might have been as long as 600 feet. On the ships were navigators, explorers, sailors, doctors, workers, and soldiers along with the translator and diarist Gong Zhen.|$|R
5000|$|Folding mast ships use a {{tabernacle}} anchor point—"the partly open socket or double {{post on the}} deck, {{into which}} a mast is fixed, with a pivot near the top so that the mast can be lowered", [...] "large bracket attached firmly to the deck, to which {{the foot of the}} mast is fixed; it has two sides or cheeks and a bolt forming the pivot around which the mast is raised and lowered", [...] "substantial fitting for mounting the <b>mast</b> on <b>deck,</b> {{so that it can be}} lowered easily for trailering or for sailing under bridges", [...] "hinged device allowing for the easy folding of a mast 90 degrees from perpendicular, as for transporting the boat on a trailer, or passing under a bridge" ...|$|R
5000|$|WizKids was {{the first}} to label a game as a CSG when they {{released}} their game Pirates of the Spanish Main in 2004. Internally, the term was coined by then-WizKids Communications Director Jason Mical to describe the game where players assemble ships from hulls, <b>masts,</b> and <b>deck</b> pieces punched out of from credit card-like plastic (polystyrene). A second CSG from WizKids, Rocketmen, was released in summer 2005, and a NASCAR-themed CSG called Race Day came out later that year. Both Rocketmen and Race Day were later discontinued.WizKids now utilizes the term [...] "PocketModel" [...] to describe this genre, as with Star Wars PocketModel Trading Card Game and the modern Pirates of the Spanish Main website.White Wolf, Inc. released their own CSG, Racer Knights of Falconus, under their Arthaus Publishing imprint in mid-2005.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a replica}} of the {{battleship}} "Old Ironsides", made for the Paramount motion picture of the same name, ca. 1926. The long sailing vessel is pictured on a body of water at center, the turrets for its cannons fully visible {{in the side of the}} hull. Three <b>masts</b> grace the <b>deck</b> of the ship, trailing complex networks of cables downward, but have their sails stowed. The background which fills the rest of the image is misty and indistinct...|$|R
50|$|The mast {{is made of}} glued clean wood, conical, without stays or shrouds. Boom, pole, gaff, {{spreaders}} {{and such}} are completely omitted. The mast is supported by two ball bearings, one at the keel and one at the deck hole, and can thus rotate freely. The rotation is created using a wooden collar, with a V-shaped track, around the <b>mast</b> below <b>deck.</b> Around this collar an infinite rope sling runs through two blocks to a winch, powered by hand or an electric motor. In this way the sail is rolled onto the mast when less area is needed or when the sailing is finished. As {{a result of the}} conic mast, the clew will move up the less sail that exposed. As a result of the mast taper the clew will end up higher and higher the closer it is to the mast.|$|R
50|$|Napoléon Gallois later relayed {{the legend}} that an {{unspecified}} French frigate had encountered {{the wreck of}} Duc de Dantzig drifting at sea, covered with dried blood and the putrefying corpses of her crew, many crucified to the <b>masts</b> or the <b>deck.</b> There were no signs {{that she had been}} in a recent battle: no new shot holes, and her sails and rigging were intact. Some blood-stained papers found in the captain's cabin identified her captain as François Aregnaudeau. The crew of the frigate set the brig ablaze.|$|R
50|$|The mast {{pieces were}} driven {{over the new}} road deck lying down horizontally. The pieces were joined to form the one {{complete}} mast, still lying horizontally. The mast was then tilted upwards, as one piece, at one time in a tricky operation. In this way, each mast was erected {{on top of the}} corresponding concrete pylon. The stays connecting the <b>masts</b> and the <b>deck</b> were then installed, and the bridge was tensioned overall, and weight tested. After this, the temporary pylons could be removed.|$|R
25|$|Cymric was an iron schooner. She had {{a shallow}} draught of only 10.8 feet, three wooden <b>masts,</b> no poop <b>deck,</b> a flaring bow, a round counter-stern and very square yards on her fore mast. She {{was built by}} the Thomas yard for their own fleet. Her early days, under Captain Robert Jones, were spent in the South American trade running from Runcorn to Gibraltar {{and on to the}} Rio Grande, docking at the Brazilian port of Porto Alegre. In 1906 she was sold to Captain Richard Hall of Arklow.|$|R
