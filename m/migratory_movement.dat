40|$|International audiencePopulations of the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax in the farmlands of Europe have {{declined}} greatly {{over the last}} century. In Western Europe, France now holds the only remaining migratory population, which currently numbers fewer than 300 displaying males. However, the movements of these birds are virtually unknown, {{in spite of the}} important implications of this information for the conservation of this species. We identified <b>migratory</b> <b>movements</b> and overwintering areas of French migratory populations, using wild individuals fitted with satellite or radio-transmitters. Little Bustards completed their migration journey over a relatively short time period (2 – 5 days), with nocturnal migration flights of 400 – 600 km per night. All birds overwintered in Iberia. In addition, we tested the consequences of captive rearing on <b>migratory</b> <b>movements.</b> French wild adults and French captive-bred juveniles behaved similarly with regard to migration, suggesting that hand-raising does not alter <b>migratory</b> <b>movements.</b> However, birds originating from eggs collected in Spain and reared in western France did not migrate, suggesting a genetic component to migratory behaviour. These results therefore suggest that a conservation strategy involving the release in France of birds hatched from eggs collected in Spain may imperil the expression of <b>migratory</b> <b>movements</b> of the French population. More generally, to maintain the integrity of native populations, the introduced individuals should mimic their <b>migratory</b> <b>movements</b> and behaviour...|$|R
2500|$|Other open {{questions}} of shoaling behaviour include identifying which individuals {{are responsible for}} the direction of shoal movement. In the case of <b>migratory</b> <b>movement,</b> most members of a shoal seem to know where they are going. Observations on the foraging behaviour of captive golden shiner (a kind of minnow) found they formed shoals which were led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available. If all golden shiners in a shoal have similar knowledge of food availability, there are a few individuals that still emerge as natural leaders (being at the front more often) and behavioural tests suggest they are naturally bolder. [...] Smaller golden shiners appear more willing than larger ones to be near the front of the shoal, perhaps because they are hungrier. Observations on the common roach have shown that food-deprived individuals tend to be at the front of a shoal, where they obtain more food [...] but where they may also be more vulnerable to ambush predators. Individuals that are wary of predation tend to seek more central positions within shoals.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis note {{is based}} on a {{literature}} search and a recent review of bat mortality data from wind farms in Europe (published elsewhere).

Modern wind turbines seem to reach high enough into the airspace to interfere with the <b>migratory</b> <b>movements</b> of insects. The hypothesis is consistent with recent observations of bats at wind turbines. It is supported by the observation that mortality of bats at wind turbines is highly seasonal (August-September) and typically peaks during nights with weather conditions known to trigger large-scale <b>migratory</b> <b>movements</b> of insects (and songbirds). We also discuss other current hypotheses concerning the mortality of bats at wind turbines...|$|R
