Kennan was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Yugoslavia, so he accepted Kennedy's offer and began his job in Yugoslavia during May 1961.|$|E
5|$|Asch {{was exposed}} to Gestalt {{psychology}} through Gardner Murphy, then a young faculty member at Columbia. He became much <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Gestalt psychology after meeting and working closely with his adviser at Columbia, Max Wertheimer, {{one of the founders}} of Gestalt psychology. Asch later became close friend with Wertheimer.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, he drew {{inspiration}} from nature, making studies of insects, landscapes, and plants such as lichens, all of which he used as details in his artworks. He traveled in Italy and Spain, sketching buildings, townscapes, architecture and the tilings of the Alhambra and the Mezquita of Cordoba, and became steadily <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> their mathematical structure.|$|E

5|$|Hesketh enjoyed {{looking after}} the Rossall estate (which had no steward or agent), but {{struggled}} to keep on top of finances; he was an indulgent landlord. He became an enthusiastic member of the Lancashire Agricultural Society and {{was concerned about the}} fate of local farm workers who were losing their jobs because of increased mechanisation. Hesketh was gradually becoming <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the lives and conditions of the working classes.|$|E
5|$|In Colombia, Gulf {{purchased}} the Barco oil concession in 1926. The government of Colombia revoked the concession the same year, but after much negotiation Gulf won {{it back in}} 1931. However, {{during a period of}} over-capacity, Gulf was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> holding the reserve than developing it. In 1936 Gulf sold Barco to the Texas Corporation, now Texaco.|$|E

5|$|Russia, Armenia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are {{all members}} of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), an {{alternative}} military alliance. In 2009, Russian envoy Dmitry Rogozin did not rule out joining NATO at some point, but stated that Russia was currently <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> leading a coalition as a great power. Azerbaijan has committed to a policy of neutrality, but has not ruled out eventually joining NATO or the CSTO.|$|E
5|$|The rumours were correct. In 1845, the MacLean laird {{sold the}} island to the Marquess of Salisbury, who {{converted}} Rùm into an estate for country sports. The Marquis first built a pier at Kinloch, and adjacent limekiln, to help with this process, re-introducing deer, both Red and Fallow. He then passed the land to his son, Viscount Cranbourne, who was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> fishing.|$|E

5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E
5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E

5|$|In early 1950, Saville {{served on}} the Guided Missiles Interdepartmental Operational Requirements Group (GMIORG), a {{military}} and civilian committee tasked with the coordination of research on guided missiles, {{as well as the}} development of tactics and overall strategy. In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC. Saville was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> air-to-air guided missiles than in ground-based ballistic missiles, which became the focus of the committee.|$|E

5|$|John Chrysostom, deacon at Antioch from 381, {{was made}} priest in 386. As a special distinction, his bishop, Flavian, {{decided that he}} should preach in the city's {{principal}} church. Chrysostom's contribution to the literature on Philip and Christianity is a homily on Babylas, a martyr-bishop who died in 253, during the Decian persecution. The treatise was composed about 382, when John was a deacon, and forms part of Chrysostom's corpus of panegyrics. Chrysostom's Babylas confronts an emperor; and, since Chrysostom is <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the bishop than his opponent, the emperor goes unnamed. He has since been identified with Philip.|$|E
5|$|Junior Johnson, {{owner of}} one of the top NASCAR teams, {{approached}} Kulwicki {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 season to try to get him to replace Terry Labonte in the No. 11 Budweiser Ford. Kulwicki declined, stating that he was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> running his own team. He won his second Cup race at Rockingham on October 21, 1990, and finished eighth in points that year, his first finish in the top10 points in a season. In 29races, he had thirteen top10 finishes and onepole position.|$|E
5|$|Klein had {{the power}} to make or break {{academic}} careers, so Born felt compelled to atone by submitting an entry for the prize. Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor. Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, Born developed the equations for the stability conditions. As he became <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the rector announced that Born had won the prize. A month later, he passed his oral examination and was awarded his PhD in mathematics magna cum laude.|$|E
