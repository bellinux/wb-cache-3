5|$|The mill {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} TW Monds & Sons until their 1918 merger with T Affleck & Son—which owned the Newry mill at Longford—creating the company Monds & Affleck. Monds & Affleck only operated the mill until 1924, and never reopened it. By 1931 it was reported as having ceased operations years ago. Monds & Affleck sold the mill in 1947, though it is not known when the mill's machinery was removed. By this time the mill was descending into Ruin and had long been vacant. The mill was renovated in 1984 and opened as a restaurant, though four years later it had closed and was being sold. After this it was reopened as a wedding and <b>meeting</b> <b>venue.</b> It had closed again by 2008, but was being renovated with the intention of reopening.|$|E

25|$|The {{explosives}} {{used were}} found to be gelatin sticks activated by timer devices.

25|$|South of this {{courtyard}} {{lies the}} Palace of Man SinghI, {{which is the}} oldest part of the palace fort. The palace took 25 years to build and was completed in 1599 {{during the reign of}} Raja Man SinghI (1589–1614). It is the main palace. In the central courtyard of the palace is the pillared baradari or pavilion; frescoes and coloured tiles decorate the rooms on the ground and upper floors. This pavilion (which used to be curtained for privacy) was used as the <b>meeting</b> <b>venue</b> by the maharanis (queens of the royal family). All sides of this pavilion are connected to several small rooms with open balconies. The exit from this palace leads to the town of Amer, a heritage town with many temples, palatial houses and mosques.|$|E
500|$|Manorial records {{indicate}} that the Town Hall (...) dates to the 15th century but it is often attributed to Gilbert de Clare, Lord of Glamorgan, who died much earlier in 1295. It then functioned as a manor and a <b>meeting</b> <b>venue</b> for the court to organise duties and collect rents and at weekends held fairs. It was renovated in the late 16th century {{and over the years}} the lower floor functioned as a school, a slaughterhouse and a jail and the top floor a venue for church meetings, leased to Oddfellows in the 1830s. Aside from fairs it also held plays, concerts and dances. It became a Grade: II* listed building on 22 February 1963. It features a bell with the inscription, Sancte Iltute, ora pro nobis ("Saint Illtyd, pray for us"). It is reached by a flight of steps.|$|E
500|$|The 1846 stone {{building}} {{known as}} [...] "Monds Roller Mill" [...] is the town's most prominent feature. The operation of this mill—and the preceding wooden mill—was {{the foundation of}} the town's prosperity during the 19th century. The mill operated until 1924, for most of this time by Thomas Monds and his family company, and was the last water powered flour mill in Tasmania. Since a 1984 renovation it has intermittently been a restaurant, wedding venue and <b>meeting</b> <b>venue.</b> Near the mill is Archer's Folly, an imposing and now ruined, but never completed, grand colonial house. The folly was started in 1847, sold incomplete in 1867 and burned to a roofless shell in 1978. Significant people associated with Carrick include: Thomas Reibey, once Premier of Tasmania; Thomas Monds who founded an extensive milling company; and Sammy Cox whose claims would make him the earliest European settler in Tasmania.|$|E
