5|$|And to Think That I Saw It on <b>Mulberry</b> Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book. It was {{published}} under the pen name Dr. Seuss. First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows {{a boy named}} Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, <b>Mulberry</b> Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father {{at the end of}} his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.|$|E
5|$|Considerable damage {{occurred}} as the tornado moved through Cordova. Buildings in downtown {{had already been}} damaged by an EF3 tornado earlier that morning and received further damage from this tornado. East of Cordova, the tornado crossed the <b>Mulberry</b> Fork of the Black Warrior River three times (along with the Sipsey Fork once, just north of its confluence with the <b>Mulberry</b> Fork). It intensified further into a violent EF4 in northeastern Walker County, as it completely leveled a site-built home and obliterated two nearby mobile homes. South of Sipsey, additional homes and mobile homes were destroyed at EF2 to EF3 strength.|$|E

5|$|In bold colors Geisel {{illustrated}} the surreal scenery and strange {{human and animal}} characters of the book with the strong, loose, energetic line that remained familiar in his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in <b>Mulberry</b> Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and looseness than in <b>Mulberry</b> Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If I Ran the Zoo (1950).|$|E

5|$|<b>Mulberry</b> House is a late Georgian {{building}}, {{dated to}} 1818. It served as Bentworth's rectory {{and became a}} Grade II listed building on 31 July 1963.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the composition of three major stilbenes (mulberroside A, oxyresveratrol, and resveratrol) in different portions of <b>mulberries</b> collected in different seasons and their change molds during growth by high-performance liquid chromatography. Mulberroside A levels were {{the highest in the}} bark and roots of Morus atropurpurea Roxb, Morus alba Linn, and Morus latifolia Poir. Oxyresveratrol levels were the highest in roots and stem. Both of these high levels were in September. The amount of resveratrol was very low in all samples. In the stem, Morus latifolia Poir contained more mulberroside A than the other two <b>mulberries.</b> Mulberroside A was not detected in the leaves of the three <b>mulberries.</b> In Morus atropurpurea Roxb seedlings, the root tended to contain more of the three stilbenes than leaves. The temporal peaks of resveratrol were always ahead of those for oxyresveratrol. The levels of the stilbenes varied in different portions of the varieties of <b>mulberries</b> collected in different season and in the seedlings of Morus atropurpurea Roxb...|$|R

5|$|At 10:38 on {{the morning}} of 21 June, Fury detonated a ground mine off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British <b>Mulberry</b> harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to {{starboard}} from flooding. The Dutch tug Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the <b>Mulberry,</b> damaging her port side above the waterline, and the towline snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. She let go her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging under the pressure of the wind and waves and the salvage ship Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside to steady Fury. Another tug made a towline fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the tug began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by slamming into Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the <b>Mulberry,</b> but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.|$|E
40|$|Sugars (glucose and fructose), {{organic acids}} (citric acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, succinic acid and fumaric acid), vitamin C, {{phenolic}} compounds (catechin, rutin, quercetin, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, o-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid and gallic acid) and antioxidant capacity (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, TEAC assay) were determined in fruits of wild blackberry, {{black and white}} <b>mulberries</b> from southern Bulgaria. Malic acid was the predominant organic acid for {{the black and white}} <b>mulberries.</b> Citric and malic acids were represented with the highest content in blackberries. The highest fructose concentration was observed in blackberries (16. 187 g· 100 g− 1). Black <b>mulberries</b> showed the highest antioxidant activity (12. 230 µmol TE g− 1), followed by white <b>mulberries</b> (8. 6133 µmol TE g− 1) and blackberries (4. 490 µmol TE g− 1). Chlorogenic acid and rutin were the main phenolics in the analysed fruits. The results illustrated significant phytochemical profiles of the studied berries, which could contribute to the medicinal industry and provide valuable genetic resources for breeding programmes...|$|R
