The Avro designation 618 Ten was adopted as the aircraft was capable of carrying two crew and eight passengers. After a modification of the centre <b>motor</b> <b>mounting</b> to accommodate British airworthiness requirements, the aircraft was first displayed at the 1929 Olympia Aero Show. The Avro 642 Eighteen used the same wing as the Ten but had a new fuselage for 16 passengers.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, the LORD Manufacturing Company is incorporated. The {{company would}} supply engine mounts to many {{aircraft}} manufacturers. Mountings for railroad cars and buses are manufactured and LORD produces {{the first ever}} elastomeric transmission parts and engine isolators(also known as bushings) for helicopters. Elastomeric compounds are also developed by LORD as substitutes for natural rubber for the Korean War in the 1950s. To isolate aircraft cowling, cowl mountings and motor-nose supports for locomotives are manufactured. LORD develops the outboard <b>motor</b> <b>mounting</b> for the marine industry. Chemlok adhesives are developed. The company develops the snubbing skirt mounting for heavy equipment installations.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{aspect of}} their design was the <b>motor</b> <b>mounting</b> system. The locomotive's six 566 hp double traction motors were mounted directly to the frame, one above each driving axle. They were geared to a [...] "quill," [...] a steel tube 15 inches in diameter that was mounted around the axle. At {{each end of the}} quill, seven-armed [...] "spiders" [...] stuck out between the spokes of the driving wheels, and were connected to the drivers by coil springs. This system, which was later used very effectively on the famous GG1 locomotive, minimized weight suspended directly from the axles, as the traction motors were bolted directly to the locomotive frame.|$|E

40|$|Professor Steven Leeb teaches Power Electronics Lab, which {{teaches the}} {{fundamentals}} of power electronic systems and has students build their own motor controllers. As a fun way to test these student built motor controllers, Professor Leeb has been using large go-karts built specifically for the class. However, these go-karts are large, heavy, and difficult to maintain. Professor Leeb recently acquired a number of production stand-up electric scooters {{with the intention of}} replacing the aging gokarts. To enhance the educational value of the scooters, Professor Leeb wanted them heavily modified to allow students to explore the effect of gearing on electromechanical systems. Furthermore, the scooters were modified to incorporate a modular <b>motor</b> <b>mounting</b> system, allowing students to easily switch out different motor models, including brushed and BLDC motors.

40|$|This {{report is}} an {{explanation}} about actuation system design for solar car. The word actuation is almost same with propulsion. This actuation system involved motor, motor controller and transmission system. Actuation system is vital {{in order to}} make sure solar car able to run smoothly when power is supplied. Without proper actuation system design, the power system design that been developed by other person is useless. This system also crucial to ensure safety to driver when driving solar car. Analyses have been done to select suitable electrical device before the devices have been bought. Besides, in this report, <b>motor</b> <b>mounting</b> bracket have been designed and analyzed in software ALGOR. The purpose is to ensure the bracket can withstand vibration of motor and avoid failure. Comparison between AC motor and DC motor are made to compare the torque and power produced. Solar car use simple transmission which is belt drive. Gear ratio analysis is made to ensure correct ratio and car can move with no problem. Then gear ratio analysis is used to consider which torque converter is suitable. This project is successfully completed when every basic part needed for actuation system is analyzed and designed...|$|E

50|$|A {{secondary}} {{problem with}} either the 3.5L (though true {{for any of the}} OM60x family diesels) is lack of maintenance of the <b>motor</b> <b>mounts,</b> which results in hard engine vibration from the engine resting on the frame members. Especially in the OM603, the vibration helps loosen one of the myriad of small screws in the crankcase which primarily hold on the windage tray. If these small bolts and screws find their way into the oil pump or passages, the resulting oil starvation can cause bearing failure, and subsequent broken or thrown rods—often cracking the block. Proper <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> maintenance eliminates these issues.|$|R
