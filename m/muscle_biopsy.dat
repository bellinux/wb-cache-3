5|$|<b>Muscle</b> <b>biopsy</b> can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is thought to be}} the result of an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E
25|$|In general, a {{clinical}} myopathy and a <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsy</b> showing a centronuclear (nucleus {{in the center}} of the muscle cell) appearance would indicate a centronuclear myopathy (CNM). The most commonly diagnosed CNM is myotubular myopathy (MTM). However, <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsy</b> analysis alone cannot reliably distinguish myotubular myopathy from other forms of centronuclear myopathies, and thus genetic testing is required.|$|E

Results: All patients with selectively elevated serum aldolase had muscle discomfort (92 %), weakness (proximal and distal) (50 %), or both. Frequent systemic features included joint pain (75 %), skin disorders (75 %) and pulmonary involvement (50 %). EMG patterns included normal (36 %), non-irritable myopathy (45 %) and irritable myopathy (18 %). Jo- 1 antibodies were {{not found in the}} 5 patients tested.

40|$|Objective: To {{report a}} family with Marfan’s {{syndrome}} in whom a myopathy was associated with res-piratory failure; <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> from affected individuals were examined {{to determine whether there}} were abnormalities in fibrillin. Methods: 21 family members underwent detailed clinical examination, including neurological and pulmonary assessment. <b>Muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> in the most severely affected cases were immunostained using monoclonal antibodies to specific fibrillin components. Genomic DNA from all 21 members was ana-lysed for mutations in the fibrillin gene, FBN 1, on 15 q 21. Results: 13 individuals had a C 4621 T base change in exon 37 of the FBN 1 gene, which in four cases segregated with muscle weakness or evidence of respiratory muscle dysfunction or both. Their <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> revealed an abnormality in fibrillin immunoreactivity. Conclusions: Abnormalities in fibrillin can be detected in <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> from patients with Marfan’s syndrome who have myopathy. This pedigree, with a point mutation in FBN 1, also draws attention to the potential for respiratory failure associated with myopathy.

25|$|A 2001 study, {{conducted}} by Aagaard et al., utilized MRI, ultrasonography and <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsy</b> techniques {{to examine the}} relationship between muscle architecture, contractile strength and pennation angle in the human quadriceps muscle after 14 weeks of resistance training. Upon completion of the training program, Aagaard et al. noticed a symmetrical increase in quadriceps CSA and volume, as each increased 10.2 and 10.3 percent respectively; however, these parameters increased disproportionately to quadriceps PCSA, which grew 16 percent. The rapid increase in PCSA was accompanied by a 35.5% increase in the fascicle pennation angle of the vastus lateris, one of the major quadriceps muscles, as well as a 16% increase in myofiber CSA. The increase in pennation angle in the vastus lateris resulted in an increase to the muscle’s PCSA, a measure proportional to the contractile force a pennate muscle is capable of producing. Work by Azizi et al. suggests this increase in pennation angle of the vastus lateris following resistance training generates an increase in the muscle’s AGR, a property which allows the whole muscle to contract with a higher velocity.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} {{lactate dehydrogenase}} enzyme {{consists of four}} protein subunits. Since the two most common subunits found in lactate dehydrogenase are encoded by the LDHA and LDHB genes, either variation of this disease causes abnormalities {{in many of the}} lactate dehydrogenase enzymes found in the body. In the case of lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, mutations to the LDHA gene results in the production of an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase-A subunit that cannot bind to the other subunits to form the complete enzyme. This lack of a functional subunit reduces the amount of enzyme formed, leading to an overall decrease in activity. During the anaerobic phase of glycolysis (the Cori Cycle), the mutated enzyme is unable to convert pyruvate into lactate to produce the extra energy the cells need. Since this subunit has the highest concentration in the LDH enzymes found in the skeletal muscles (which are the primary muscles responsible for movement), high-intensity physical activity will lead to an insufficient amount of energy being produced during this anaerobic phase. This in turn will cause the muscle tissue to weaken and eventually break down, a condition known as rhabdomyolysis. The process of rhabdomyolysis also releases myoglobin into the blood, which will eventually end up in the urine and cause it to become red or brown: another condition known as myoglobinuria. Some other common symptoms are exercise intolerance, which consists of fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise, and skin rashes. In severe cases, myoglobinuria can damage the kidneys and lead to life-threatening kidney failure. In order to obtain a definitive diagnosis, a <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsy</b> may be performed to confirm low or absent LDH activity. There is currently no specific treatment for this condition.|$|E
40|$|Proteins in the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) require an efficient system of molecular chaperones whose {{role is to}} assure their proper folding and to prevent accumulation of unfolded proteins. The response of cells to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER is termed “unfolded protein response” (UPR). UPR is a functional mechanism by which cells attempt to protect themselves against ER stress, resulting from the accumulation of the unfolded/misfolded proteins. Because intracellular inclusions, containing either amyloid-β (Aβ) or phosphorylated tau, are the characteristic feature of sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies,</b> we studied expression and immunolocalization of five ER chaperones, calnexin, calreticulin, GRP 94, BiP/GRP 78, and ERp 72, in s-IBM and control <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Physical interaction of the ER chaperones with amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP) was studied by a combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting technique in s-IBM and control <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies,</b> and in AβPP-overexpressing cultured human muscle fibers. In all s-IBM <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies,</b> all five of the ER chaperones were immunodetected {{in the form of}} inclusions that co-localized with amyloid-β. By immunoblotting, expression of ER chaperones was greatly increased as compared to the controls. By immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiments, ER chaperones co-immunoprecipitated with AβPP. Our studies provide evidence of the UPR in s-IBM muscle and demonstrate {{for the first time that}} the ER chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, GRP 94, BiP/GRP 78, and ERp 72 physically associate with AβPP in s-IBM muscle, suggesting their playing a role in AβPP folding and processing...|$|R
40|$|Stable isotope tracer {{experiments}} {{of human}} muscle amino acid and protein kinetics often involve a sequential design, {{with the same}} subject studied at baseline and during an intervention. However, prolonged fasting and sequential <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> from the same area could theoretically affect muscle protein metabolism. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if sequential <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> and extended fasting significantly affect parameters of muscle protein and amino acid kinetics in six human subjects. After a 12 -h overnight fast, a primed continuous infusion of l-[ring- 2 H 5]phenylalanine was started. After 120 min, we took the first of a series of five hourly <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> from the same vastus lateralis to measure mixed muscle protein fractional synthetic rate. Furthermore, between 150 – 180, 210 – 240, and 330 – 360 min, we measured leg phenylalanine kinetics using the two-pool and the three-pool arteriovenous balance models. Tracer enrichments were at steady state, and muscle protein FSR and phenylalanine kinetics did not change throughout the experiment (P = not significant). We conclude that a 6 -h tracer infusion during extended fasting (up to 18 h) with five sequential <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> from the same muscle do not affect basal mixed muscle protein synthesis and muscle phenylalanine kinetics in human subjects. Thus, when using a sequential study design over this period of time, it is unnecessary to include a saline only control group to account for these variables...|$|R

A magnetic resonance imaging scan of her orbits with gadolinium revealed diffuse enhancement of the bellies of the extraocular muscles bilaterally, particularly the medial rectus, superior rectus, and superior oblique muscles, consistent with an infiltrative myositis. She underwent unilateral extraocular <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Results: The extraocular <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> contained macrophages between the muscle fibres. These contained periodic acid-Schiff-positive cytoplasmic granules. Immunohistochemistry with an antibody raised to Tropheryma whipplei showed positive staining of the same macrophages.

40|$|The overall {{focus of}} thesis is {{determining}} key disease-driving molecular pathways {{involved in the}} progression of a specific subtype of neuromuscular diseases, the collagen type VI-related muscular dystrophies (COL 6 RD). These kinds of muscular disorder encompass {{a wide spectrum of}} diseases, ranging from the severe Ullrich muscular dystrophy (UCMD) to the mild Bethlem myopathy (BM), characterized by a plethora of clinical manifestations. Both UCMD and BM usually arise at birth or early childhood with hypotonia and progressive muscle weakness, joint contractures and hyperlaxity of the distal joints. In UCMD, ambulation is achieved with a delay of 2 years compared to healthy children, but it is eventually lost. In BM, ambulation is generally maintained and only few affected individuals require wheel chair. Genetically, UCMD and BM are caused by mutations in the genes encoding for the three α-chains of the collagen type VI acting in a recessive or dominant way. Morphologically, the <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> of UCMD and BM patients are characterized by variable degree of atrophy, fibrosis, and regeneration and degeneration of the muscle fibers. In the present work, we systematically reviewed and classified a cohort of 22 COL 6 RD patient <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> and 14 age-matched control <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> according to basic histological features, such as muscle fibers atrophy and fibrosis. This classification was achieved through an innovative automatic image analysis algorithm and generated three groups, COL 6 RD- 1, COL 6 RD- 2 and COL 6 RD- 3, of increasing histological severity. Microarray-based gene expression profiling and RNA-Seq of the same cohort produced gene expression fingerprint that suggested a strong segregation of COL 6 RD <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> from the control <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies,</b> but did not clearly correlated with the histological grouping established among the patients. In silico analysis of the gene expression results revealed TGFβ 1 pathway as the major regulator of the COL 6 RD histological changes and, most likely, of the underlying disease pathophysiology. TGFβ 1 involvement was further confirmed by upstream regulator analysis, validation of downstream gene targets by qRT-PCR, and protein targets by western blot and immunofluorescence. Moreover, we also found a downregulation of skeletal muscle specific genes. RNA-Seq data also highlighted a deeper level of regulation of the gene expression carried over by alternative splicing. We identified 43 genes having more than one splice isoform whose expression level was significantly different between COL 6 RD <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> and controls, with DECORIN being the one displaying the highest number of alternatively spliced isoforms. Overall, this study suggests that different histological stages of COL 6 -RD are characterized by the same pattern of gene expression, involving predominantly the upregulation of matricellular components, even when the muscle involvement is not evident yet, and downregulation of muscle specific genes. Our results also suggest that TGFβ 1 acts as a major driver of the pathological changes at the skeletal muscle level. Moreover, <b>muscle</b> <b>biopsies</b> from COL 6 -RD patients are characterized by an increase in alternative spliced isoforms of extracellular matrix-related genes that might contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease...|$|R
