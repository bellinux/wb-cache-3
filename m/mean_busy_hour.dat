50|$|The {{practical}} {{measurement of}} traffic is typically based on continuous observations over several days or weeks, {{during which the}} instantaneous traffic is recorded at regular, short intervals (such as every few seconds). These measurements are then used to calculate a single result, most commonly the <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> traffic (in erlangs). This is {{the average number of}} concurrent calls during a given one-hour period of the day, where that period is selected to give the highest result. (This result is called the time-consistent <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> traffic). An alternative is to calculate a <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> traffic value separately for each day (which may correspond to slightly different times each day) and take the average of these values. This generally gives a slightly higher value than the time-consistent <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> value.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The Erlang loss {{model is}} one of the {{fundamental}} tools in queueing theory with many applications to communica-tions networks. For example, in a simple cellular voice network, the Erlang-B blocking formula is the traditional approach to model the proportion of time cellular base-stations are fully loaded in the <b>busy</b> <b>hour.</b> Such steady state results do not provide information on such important questions as: how likely is it that the blocking time in the <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> exceeds some threshold. Hence we look in detail at the blocking time in the <b>busy</b> <b>hour,</b> or any finite period. We derive the exact distribution function and density as well as the moments and moment generating function of the blocking time, denoted X. In addition we derive the probabilities of zero blocking, P (X = 0), and complete blocking, P (X = 1 <b>hour),</b> in the <b>busy</b> <b>hour.</b> I...|$|R

Such difference is expected to grow further in the next half a decade, where Cisco predicts that the growth rate of <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> traffic will be almost 1.5 times that of average Internet traffic.|$|R
50|$|To {{determine}} normal reference traffic for a network, the ITU {{recommends that}} a network traffic analyst must take measurements for the <b>busiest</b> <b>hour</b> {{of each day}} for a whole year. The <b>busiest</b> <b>hour</b> is defined as that four consecutive quarter hours whose traffic intensity is the greatest. Measurements taken outside the <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> can be discarded. The reference intensity of traffic is then calculated by taking the average traffic intensity of the top thirty days in the year. Measurements taken on individual days can be discarded. This will give the normal high traffic intensity in the network, allowing network managers to make long-term strategic decisions.|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{method has}} been validated {{in a live}} LTE network. The considered urban area is {{a section of the}} whole network, consisting of 120 LTE cells that are located in the same area as all the 3 G cells of a particular Radio Network Controller (RNC); thus, LTE and 3 G coverage areas are overlapped. The trial was carried out during the <b>busy</b> <b>hours</b> to analyze the coverage of the network. In particular, the cell-level indicators were stored at hourly bases while the user-level indicators were stored every 15 min during the <b>busy</b> <b>hours</b> and subsequently aggregated at hour level. Given that this method aims to identify coverage problems which are permanent over time, cells can be monitoring at any time period. However, the ATOL average metric is estimated based on the group of users that actually performed an IRAT HO, which may be small. Thus, in order to ensure a good diagnosis, the tracing period should be long enough. This can be also achieved tracing the users during the <b>busy</b> <b>hours,</b> which provide more sample in a shorter time.|$|R

Call holding times follow the lognormal distribution and are uncorrelated.
