25|$|Tensions {{erupted into}} battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British {{attempted}} {{to capture and}} destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in {{what became known as}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal.</b>|$|E

The government had to pass {{an amendment to the}} Constitution to get white women the vote. Then the government had to pass an equal rights amendment to get equal protection under the law for women. The government still thinks a woman has no rights over her own body, and between Uncle Clarence who sexually harassed Anita Hill, and a closeted Klan court, that is a throwback to the 19th century, handpicked by Daddy Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, between Clarence and that stacked court, they are about to undo Roe vs. Wade, just like they are about to un-do affirmative action.

500|$|The Senate {{campaign}} {{featured the}} seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, {{the most famous}} political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that [...] "The Slave Power" [...] was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting {{the values of the}} Founding Fathers that all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal,</b> while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision.|$|E

5000|$|Lafitau’s {{comparative}} method (method {{of reciprocal}} illumination) rests on his “system” {{which is a}} compendium of his theoretical presupposition. He believed that <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal</b> by God and was given a set of divine moral principles. These principles were gradually violated due to the inherited sinfulness of man - {{a consequence of the}} penalty of the Original Sin. All men originally shared one religion with one God but over time as people migrated to separate margins of the earth where they then lost touch with the values and traditions of this one “true religion” and culture [...] Therefore, Lafitau believed in the [...] "psychic unity of mankind" [...] and the doctrine of primitive monotheism.

50|$|Spaniards {{considered}} it legitimate to enslave non-Christian captives from wars and trade them legally in the past.

Christians, however, were anticipated to show sympathy to the people suffering and this made some masters free their slaves.

The U.S. Commissioner of education came to see firsthand what Pratt was doing, and so did the president of Amherst College.

[...] He enlisted the aid of Tapping Reeve, the founder of Litchfield Law School, one of America's earliest law schools, located in Litchfield, Connecticut. They were two of the top lawyers in Massachusetts, and Sedgwick later served as US Senator. Arthur Zilversmit suggests the attorneys may have selected these plaintiffs to test the status of slavery under the new state constitution.|$|E

5000|$|The poem {{consists}} of 4 parts: [...] "Spring Joys" [...] (Pavasario linksmybės), [...] "Summer Toils" [...] (Vasaros darbai), [...] "Autumn Boons" [...] (Rudenio gėrybės), and [...] "Winter Cares" [...] (Žiemos rūpesčiai). In these 4 idylls, totaling 2997 hexameters, are depicted the natural setting of Lithuania Minor, its people, their work, and their customs. The poem depicts a realistic portrayal of Lietuvininkai (Prussian Lithuanians) peasants' {{life in the}} middle 18th century, as it was affected by colonization of East Prussia. Germans and Austrians, Swiss and French, brought in and given special consideration by the government, became the upper class of landlords and officials, while the indigenous population became the lower class of serfs. In The Seasons the village life of the latter is depicted as patriarchal in structure. The natural virtues idealized by the Pietist movement, diligence, piety, honesty, and submission to authority, flourish. Social consciousness of the people is largely dormant. There appear only a few characters through whose lips the poet accuses the gentry {{and the government of}} exploiting the people. However, such characters are not portrayed sympathetically; they are considered degenerates by the villagers in the poem and by its author. The poet contents himself with telling his readers that all <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal</b> in the beginning and that only later did some become lords and others serfs. Donelaitis calls the latter burai (boors), and shows deep sympathy for them. He reprimands their evil exploiters, but he does not raise any protest against the system of serfdom.|$|R

2500|$|While Locke {{spoke in}} the {{language}} of natural law, the content of this law was by and large protective of natural rights, and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred. Political philosopher Jeremy Waldron has pointed out that Locke's political thought was based on [...] "a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions." [...] To Locke, the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the Decalogue, Christ's teaching and exemplary life, and St. Paul's admonitions. Locke derived the concept of basic human equality, including the equality of the sexes ("Adam and Eve"), from , the starting-point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free, governments need the consent of the governed. Thomas Jefferson, arguably echoing Locke, appealed to unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence, [...] "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal,</b> that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

2500|$|Liberalism, {{the belief}} in freedom and human rights, is {{historically}} associated with such thinkers as John Locke and Montesquieu. [...] It is a political movement which spans {{the better part of}} the last four centuries, though the use of the word liberalism to refer to a specific political doctrine did not occur until the 19th century. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England laid the foundations for the development of the modern liberal state by constitutionally limiting the power of the monarch, affirming parliamentary supremacy, passing the Bill of Rights and establishing the principle of 'consent of the governed'. The 1776 Declaration of Independence of the United States of America founded the nascent republic on liberal principles without the encumbrance of hereditary aristocracy; the declaration stated that [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal</b> and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," [...] echoing John Locke's phrase [...] "life, liberty, and property". A few years later, the French Revolution overthrew the hereditary aristocracy, with the slogan [...] "liberty, equality, fraternity", and was the first state in history to grant universal male suffrage. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, first codified in 1789 in France, is a foundational document of both liberalism and human rights.|$|E

50|$|Prior to Emerson’s {{letter to}} President Martin Van Buren, {{there was not}} a very {{positive}} relationship between the colonists and the Indians. In fact, it was extremely negative and relations between the two groups were very harsh. Violence and hatred was almost always present whenever the two encountered one another. It was rare for such a letter to come from the time (1838) because the idea of Manifest Destiny was very strong among Americans throughout the 19th century. Most all writings that came from that time period represented much bias and hatred towards the opposing side. Oftentimes, the Indians were pictured as barbaric and ravenous beasts and the colonists were regarded as unjust and unprovoked murderers. Emerson {{was one of the first}} respected and significant figures that decided to stand up in defense of the Cherokee tribe. In his letter, Emerson showed support for the Indians and expressed that many Americans also felt as though the Indians were being treated unfairly. Emerson was a big supporter that <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal,</b> and therefore, it would be morally wrong to strip the Cherokees of their native land. He stresses the concept of both sides mutually respecting each other as a unitary group, despite the hateful relationship that has existed between them in the past. This idea would have come as almost foreign to many people at the time because there was such a push for American expansion and supremacy. However, through writing this letter, Emerson sparked support for the Cherokee people. It formed a positive link between the two groups even if it did not solve the problem. Even though the letter was not enough to prevent the government from proceeding in its aggressive expansion, it created the opportunity for Americans to stand up and support the idea of treating the Indians as equals.|$|R
