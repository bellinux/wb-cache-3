This paper presents {{an evaluation of the}} temperature field and residual stresses in a <b>multipass</b> <b>weld</b> of API 5 L X 80 steel, which is extensively used in oil and gas industry, using the Finite Element Method (FEM). In the simulation, the following complex phenomena were considered: the variation in physical and mechanical properties of the material {{as a function of the}} temperature, welding speed and convection and radiation mechanisms. Additionally, in order to characterize a <b>multipass</b> <b>weld</b> using the Gas Tungsten Arc Welding process for the root pass and the Shielded Metal Arc Welding process for the filling passes, the analytical heat source proposed by Goldak & Chakravarti was used.

40|$|Though butt-welds {{are among}} the most {{preferred}} joining methods in aerostructures, their strength dependence on inelastic mechanics is generally the least understood. This study investigated experimental strain distributions across a thick aluminum U-grooved weld and identified two weld process considerations for improving the <b>multipass</b> <b>weld</b> strength. One is the source of peaking in which the extreme thermal expansion and contraction gradient of the fusion heat input across the groove tab thickness produces severe angular distortion that induces bending under uniaxial loading. The other is the filler strain hardening decreasing with increasing filler pass sequences, producing the weakest welds on the last weld pass side. Both phenomena are governed by weld pass sequences. Many industrial welding schedules unknowingly compound these effects, which reduce the weld strength. A depeaking index model was developed to select filler pass thickness, pass numbers, and sequences to improve depeaking in the welding process. The result was to select the number and sequence of weld passes to reverse the peaking angle such as to combine the strongest weld pass side with the peaking induced bending tension component side to provide a more uniform stress and stronger weld under axial tensile loading...|$|E

Strain scanning of Gleeble test bars of 2 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo steel has been carried out in conjunction with strain scanning investigations of a <b>multipass</b> <b>weld</b> in 0. 5 -in. plate of the same alloy. The residual stresses in the Cleeble bars depend on the time spent at the maximum temperature and the rate of cooling. The longitudinal strains on the Gleeble bar center-line are tensile with a maximum {{on either side of the}} central hot zone. The transverse strains are compressive but vary with thermal treatment to a higher degree than variations in the longitudinal strains. The difference between strains at the center-line and off the center-line can be significantly greater than statistical error in aircooled Gleeble bars. The strains in the Gleeble bar have a high tensile component parallel to the direction of maximum heat transfer (viz. along the bar axis).

40|$|Owing {{to their}} low {{ductility}} at room temperature, heat resistant cast {{austenitic stainless steels}} {{are very sensitive to}} weld cracking. Cracks are formed in brittle zones of the heterogeneous microstructure constituted by the carbide rich interdendritic spaces. In order to identify the operating factors affecting the cracking propensity of such steels during welding, a three step method, based on numerical simulation, is presented. First, the macroscopic emperature and stress fields are determined by a finite element calculation, considering a homogeneous material. In a second step, a localisation criterion is defined to identify critical zones, according to the macroscopic fields determined in the first step. Then, the heterogeneous microstructure of the cast steel is modelled in a 'representative cell', and the thermomechanical history of the critical zone previously identified is applied as boundary condition, {{in order to determine the}} local stress field. The cracking is then supposed to occur when the maximal principal stress in the interdendritic zone of the representative cell reaches the cleavage stress of the carbides, determined using SEM in situ tensile tests. This method is used to predict cracking during <b>multipass</b> <b>weld</b> repair of bulk samples, under various welding conditions.

In practice, weld material properties are determined from {{tensile test specimen}} and provided to the stress analyst {{in the form of}} a stress versus strain diagram. Variations in properties through the thickness of the weld and along the width of the weld have been suspect but not explored because of inaccessibility and cost. The purpose of this study is to investigate analytical and computational methods used for analysis of welds. The weld specimens are analyzed using classical elastic and plastic theory to provide a basis for modeling the inelastic properties in a finite-element solution. The results of the analysis are compared to experimental data to determine the weld behavior and the accuracy of prediction methods. The weld considered in this study is a multiple-pass aluminum 2219 -T 87 butt weld with thickness of 1. 40 in. The weld specimen is modeled using the finite-element code ABAQUS. The finite-element model is used to produce the stress-strain behavior in the elastic and plastic regimes and to determine Poisson's ratio in the plastic region.

40|$|Abstract This thesis studies {{controlling}} {{factors that}} govern transverse hydrogen cracking in high-strength <b>multipass</b> <b>weld</b> metal (WM). The experiments {{were concerned with}} heavy-restraint Y- and U-Groove multipass cracking tests of shielded-metal arc (SMAW) and submerged-arc (SAW) weld metals. Results of tensile tests, hardness surveys, weld residual stress measurements and microstructural investigations are discussed. The analytical phase comprised numerical calculations for analysing the interactions between crack-controlling factors. The objectives were: (i) the assessment of WM hydrogen cracking risk by defining the Crack-No Crack boundary conditions in terms of 'safe line' description giving the desired lower-bound estimates, and (ii) to derive predictive equations capable of giving reliable estimates of the required preheat/interpass temperature T 0 /Ti for the avoidance of cracking. Hydrogen cracking occurred predominantly in high strength weld metals of Rp 0. 2 ≈ 580 - 900 MPa. At intermediate strengths of Rp 0. 2 ≈ 500 - 550 MPa, cracking {{took place in the}} cases where the holding time from welding to NDT inspection was prolonged to 7 days. Low strength WMs of Rp 0. 2 ≤ 480 MPa did not exhibit cracking under any conditions examined. Cracking occurrence was, above all, governed by WM tensile strength, weld diffusible hydrogen and weld residual stresses amounting to the yield strength. The appearance of cracking vanished when transferring from 40 to 6 mm thick welds. The implications of the holding time were more significant than anticipated previously. A period of 16 hrs in accordance with SFS-EN 1011 appeared much too short for thick multipass welds. Interpass time and heat input showed no measurable effect on cracking sensitivity, hence being of secondary importance. Equations were derived to assess the weld critical hydrogen content Hcr corresponding to the Crack-No Crack conditions as a function of either weld metal Pcm, yield strength Rp 0. 2 or weld metal maximum hardness HV 5 (max). For the calculation of safe T 0 /Ti estimates, a formula incorporating: (i) WM strength as a linear function of either weld carbon equivalent CET or weld HV 5 (max), (ii) weld build-up thickness aw in the form of tanh expression and (iii) weld diffusible hydrogen HD in terms of a combined [ln / power law] expression was found descriptive...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} varying welding {{conditions}} on <b>multipass</b> <b>weld</b> metal {{has been investigated}} in all-weld test plates produced by flux cored arc (FCA) welding. The principal welding conditions varied for the test samples in the current research program were heat input (between approximately 1 and 2. 5 kJ/mm), welding technique (stringer or weave beads), shielding gas, welding position (flat or vertical) and consumable type. Mechanical testing of weld metal included tensile testing and Charpy-vee-notch impact tests over a range of temperatures from - 60 °C to 40 °C. The tensile testing results showed that yield and tensile strength generally decreased with increasing heat input and that the changes were {{of the order of}} 100 MPa. Impact properties showed more varied behaviour depending on consumable type. The effect of varying welding conditions on some less commonly studied microstructural factors has also been investigated, such as proportions of reheated and double-reheated regions and mean free path (MFP) in various distinctive microstructural zones. Using the simplifying assumption that the structural gradient the heat affected zone (HAZ) of reheated weld metal can be characterized in terms of three regions: the grain coarsened, GC; grain refined, GR and intercritical, IC heat affected regions; a second overlapping weld bead creates double-reheated weld metal structures which can be defined in terms of 9 sub-zones: GC-GC, GC-GR, GC-IC, GRGC, GR-GR, GR-IC, IC-GC, IC-GR, IC-IC. Linear and areal measurement techniques have been used on cross-sections of seventeen test plates to determine the volume fractions of solidified weld metal (SW), GC, GR and IC sub-zones of the reheated weld metal and the double-reheated zone. The hardness variation in the sub-zones and the influence of welding conditions has also been investigated in the present research. The mean free path was determined for SW, GC, GR and IC regions and the overall average mean free path of ferrite in each weld was also calculated to provide a characteristic length of the totality of the structural microconstituents in the weld metal. Strong relationships were found between mean free path and heat input and also with the strength of the weld metal. In contrast, toughness correlated poorly with overall mean free path. Impact toughness {{is one of the most}} important mechanical properties of welds. Assessment and understanding of the impact properties of welds is central to the avoidance of catastrophic failure of welded steel structures. Neural networks analysis has been used for the purpose of assessing which factors are beneficial to the low temperature impact properties of steel welds in order to obtain practical guidance as to how impact properties might be improved in FCA welds. Four major data fields were involved in the training of the neural networks: chemical composition, microstructure, non-metallic inclusions and welding condition. The backpropagation algorithm was used for the analysis. Sensitivity analysis of the neural network model revealed that the characteristics of the non-metallic inclusion distribution exerted only a small direct influence on toughness. In contrast, chemical composition and microstructure were indicated to be very important. In particular the toughness is predicted to increase with increasing % acicular ferrite and % reaustenitised region and these factors in turn are sensitive to the selected FCAW process and the welding conditions...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} {{hydrogen}} assisted cold cracking in {{high strength steel}} weld metal during flux cored arc welding (FCAW) using a technique involving the deliberate introduction of hydrogen into the CO 2 shielding gas. A specific objective was to investigate weld metal cold cracking susceptibility by development of a research tool which permitted control over both the weld metal diffusible hydrogen content and the stress applied during mechanical testing of single bead on plate weld deposits. The basis for this undertaking is twofold, and {{stems from the fact}} that crack mitigating measures traditionally address cracking in the heat affected zone, although it has been shown that weld metal hydrogen assisted cold cracking is more likely when strength matching weld metals are used to join high strength low alloy steels. As a result existing weldability test methods have a limited ability to simulate weld metal hydrogen assisted cold cracking. The literature relevant to hydrogen assisted cold cracking (HACC) has been reviewed, and the current understanding and assertions relating to HACC have been detailed. The primary findings are that this form of cracking in high strength steel weld metal occurs by localised plastic deformation, which eventually results in fracture through bands of intense shear. The increase in alloying elements and the as-cast nature of the weld metal are also recognised as two key reasons why cracking has migrated from the heat affected zone into the weld metal. Current welding standards and recognised weldability test methods have also been reviewed to establish the techniques and engineering guidance available. This review indicates that the majority of test methods and all of the welding standards are heat affected zone specific A further revelation is that weldability test methods typically function as a ranking tool and offer limited scope to serve as a research tool. The initial experimental investigation of multipass welds in thick plate revealed that the majority of weld metal cold cracking occurred within 48 hours of weld completion. Crack detection was also recorded several days after welding had ceased, indicating that the diffusion, trapping and stress-strain conditions of solute hydrogen contribute significantly to crack initiation and propagation. Self restraint <b>multipass</b> <b>weld</b> techniques were then considered as a means of generating weld metal hydrogen assisted cold cracking test data. Subsequent research also evaluated tensile and bend testing to develop cracking in single bead on plate weld deposits. The analysis of the requirements to generate cracking in both single and multipass welds was then used to produce a single bead, applied stress test which preferentially targeted the weld metal. The test methods developed during the experimental phase subsequently allowed manipulation of the diffusible hydrogen content and the magnitude of the applied stress, which in turn facilitated weld metal cold cracking under controlled conditions. The test specimens were produced by depositing high strength ferritic weld metal onto a strength matched martensitic base material via an automated flux cored arc welding process. In order to increase the susceptibility to cracking, 2 % and 5 %H 2 was deliberately added to the CO 2 shielding gas. Both tensile and 4 -point bend testing of single pass weld deposits were evaluated, although 4 -point bending was ultimately selected as the most suitable test method providing preferential targeting of the weld metal. Standard bead on plate and geometrically modified bead on plate specimen geometries were employed during testing. These were assessed according to their functionality, machinability and reproducibility of the results generated. Rising load and stress controlled test configurations were applied to observe the behaviour of the weld metal mechanical properties. Although the test configurations permitted close control over the test variables (hydrogen, stress, microstructure and time), the results indicated that variations in cold cracking delay times will occur under near identical test conditions. The variations observed are explained in terms of differences in the transport and trapping behaviour of hydrogen in the heterogeneous structure of the weld metal. The inability to generate closely matching cold cracking delay times under matching conditions suggests that a single time to fracture cannot be realised for the test conditions employed. It is therefore proposed that a maximum delay time after which fracture will not occur be used as a research outcome, instead of defining specific or closely matching delay times. Metallographic analysis of the test specimens was also conducted to determine the effect of hydrogen on the evolution of the microstructure and to establish the fracture morphology. Image analysis revealed that a reduction of non-metallic inclusions occurred during welding with hydrogen-rich shielding gas. The introduction of hydrogen into the shielding gas also resulted in a coarsening of the general microstructure, believed to be the product of reduced acicular ferrite nucleation, allowing individual grains to coarsen without being impeded by the growth of nearby nucleated grains. The morphology of the fractures observed under microscopy and their reliance on the introduction of hydrogen in the shielding gas indicated that the fractures were typical of those produced under weld metal hydrogen assisted cold cracking conditions. Ductile tearing, microvoid coalescence, quasi cleavage and cleavage fracture facets were observed along the fracture path. The cracks were observed to have propagated along both the columnar solidification structure and along the prior austenite grain boundaries. Microcracks were also observed on the fracture faces, which are believed to have contributed to the final fracture by means of crack-linkage. Higher concentrations of impurity elements were also observed on the boundary along which the cracks had propagated. The typical region from which cracking would originate was associated with second phase constituents and low grain boundary ferrite content. Whilst it was not possible to develop a quantitative test for hydrogen cracking susceptibility; the reasons for the test variability have been explored and show that the interaction of hydrogen with microstructural development may play a significant role in WM HACC susceptibility...|$|E

The microstructure, chemical composition, phase constitution and microhardness of all the test components were respectively examined by using light microscopy, SEM-EDS, X-ray diffraction and a Duromain 70 Hardness Tester. No appreciable changes in microstructure and composition were found as interpass temperature was changed. However, as the interpass temperature was increased from 100 °C to 400 °C, a decrease of α 2 phase fraction was observed due to the lower cooling rate. Consequently, the microhardness value also decreased. A further increase of interpass temperature to 500 °C produced only minor reductions in the brittle α 2 phase fraction and the microhardness value.

The results show very good agreement {{between theory and}} experiment. The transfer of carbon and oxygen is also discussed. It is shown that the transfer of oxygen into the weld metal occurs in the zone of droplet reactions, whereas oxygen is lost by formation and separation of inclusions in the solidifying weld pool. Methods of applying this analysis to <b>multipass</b> <b>welds</b> and active fluxes containing ferroalloy additions are also described. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In some {{austenitic}} stainless steel welds grains orientations cause deviation and splitting of the ultrasonic beam. It {{is especially true in}} the case of <b>multipass</b> <b>welds</b> when the remelting process after each pass causes complex solidification process. With the new model MINA (Modelling anisotropy from Notebook of Arc welding) we show that we are able to predict thoroughly grains orientations. This model has been validated with microstructural analysis and ultrasonic measurements. With these orientations we define a precise description of the heterogeneous and anisotropic material. Grain orientation give the Cartesian coordinates system in which we expressed the elastic constants. Incorporating this description in an ultrasonic propagation code allows simulating ultrasonic inspection. Comparisons are made with previous models given by several authors. The reference grain structure is obtained by macrograph analysis. Different propagations of the elastic waves induced by a modification of the evolution of the grains orientations are shown. The best simulation results are obtained with MINA model. We thus provide a very interesting model dedicated to <b>multipass</b> <b>welding</b> to improve understanding of ultrasounds propagation in a very heterogeneous medium. This work ensures a better reliability of ultrasonic testing. Introduction: The ultrasonic assessment of structural integrity in nuclear power station progresses with advances in ultrasonic wave propagation codes. It makes ultrasonic testing more accurate and reliable. Several modelling codes have been proposed to forecast the propagation of ultrasounds. Authors use ray tracing codes, semi-analytica...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{informed}} industry of {{the capabilities of}} advanced simulation to better understand and improve the manufacture of welded joints; in turn, to improve the lifetime and safety of high temperature structures used in the petrochemical and power generation industries. This paper was also presented at the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) conference in San Diego, USA, and was awarded the best paper prize. This contribution deals with the complex temperature profiles that are generated by the welding process in the intersection region of thick walled, cylinder-cylinder junctions. These affect material microstructure, mechanical properties and residual stresses. Knowledge of the thermal history and temperature distributions are thus critical in developing control schemes for acceptable residual stress distributions to improve in-service component behavior. A comprehensive study of three-dimensional temperature distributions in a stainless steel tee branch junction during a <b>multipass</b> <b>welding</b> process is presented. A newly developed partitioning technique {{has been used to}} mesh the complex intersection areas of the welded junction. Various phenomena associated with welding, such as temperature dependent material properties, heat loss by convection and latent heat have been taken into consideration. The temperature distribution at various times after deposition of certain passes and the thermal cycles at various locations are reported. The results obtained in this study will be used for on-going and future analysis of residual stress distributions. The meshing technique and modeling method can also be applied to other curved, <b>multipass</b> <b>welds</b> in complex structures...|$|R

The heterogeneous anisotropic nature of these welds causes disturbance to ultrasonic propagation. Simulation is a useful tool when attempting to understand physical phenomena. With this objective, a finite element code called ATHENA was developed. Sufficiently realistic modelling of the material is proposed by the Modelling anIsotropy from Notebook of Arc welding (MINA) model, which determines {{the orientation of the}} weld grains. Optimisation by inversion of the MINA model is proposed in this study. The results validate the strategy and open perspectives regarding use on real data...|$|R
