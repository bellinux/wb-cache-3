40|$|Group size (GS) {{and space}} {{allowance}} have major {{implications for the}} welfare of production species, however their effects are often confounded. In a previous study we investigated the impact of varying space allowance at constant GS. In the present work we report the consequences of varying GS on pregnant ewes while controlling space allowance. We housed ewes at 6 (GS 6) or 12 ewes/enclosure (GS 12), while controlling space allowance to 1. 5 m 2 /ewe (3 enclosures/treatment), and necessarily varying <b>enclosure</b> <b>size.</b> Therefore, when indicating GS effects we implicitly reflect a confounding effect with that of <b>enclosure</b> <b>size.</b> Movement, use of space, behaviour, serum cortisol concentration and body condition score (BCS) were collected during the last 12 gestation weeks. Movement, use of space, and behaviour were collected every other week, during 2 days/week, using 10 minute continuous scan samplings. Blood was collected during weeks 10, 13, 17, and 21 of gestation, and BCS during weeks 15 and 21. Data were analysed using repeated measures, generalized linear mixed models, with GS, week, and their interaction as fixed effects, and enclosure as random effect. GS mainly affected movement and use of space. GS 12 ewes walked longer distances using longer steps (P< 0. 001). An interaction GS by week was observed for angular dispersion (P< 0. 0001), which was smaller for GS 12 from week 10 onwards. Initial restlessness levels were lower for GS 12, as shown by the reduced frequency of location changes (P< 0. 0001). Furthest and mean neighbour distances increased with GS (P< 0. 0001). The effect of GS on behaviour was only evident for eating behaviour as an interaction with gestation week (P< 0. 05). Changes in behaviour, movement and use of space along the study indicated an activity peak during weeks 3 to 5. Cortisol changes during gestation (P< 0. 01) also reflected this activity peak, while BCS (P< 0. 001) reflected normal physical condition changes during pregnancy. Although the separate effects of GS and <b>enclosure</b> <b>size</b> cannot be disentangled, we conclude that if enough space/ewe is given during gestation, larger GS will result in larger effective space, and no major implications {{for the welfare of}} ewes should be expected as GS increases.

Despite their elevated conservation status, and established, increasing global captive population, zoos do not yet have information on optimal husbandry. To help address this problem, a husbandry survey was distributed to all global holders of banteng. Questions focused on herd demographic structure, exhibit features (including mixed-species exhibition), dietary provision, and behavioral management. Completed surveys from 16 zoos enabled analysis of contemporary practice between institutions. Results indicate differences in <b>enclosure</b> <b>size</b> between zoos, and that herd size is unlikely to predict <b>enclosure</b> <b>size.</b> Herd sizes are smaller than wild examples, and enclosure space (per animal) is significantly smaller than a potential wild range. Banteng are frequently maintained successfully in mixed species exhibits alongside a wide range of other taxa. Nutrient analysis focused on fiber and protein, and although provision of these nutrients appears comparable between zoos, more work is needed on browse and forage intake to determine overall diet suitability. Behavior management shows variation between zoos, with numerous collections providing browse but only a minority undertaking training, and not all providing enrichment.

40|$|This {{research}} report examines {{the use of}} zone modelling compared with CFD modelling to determine when zone model approximation is valid and when a CFD model might be required. A series of computer simulations with enclosures and fires of various sizes was performed to compare the capabilities and limitations of the two computer methods. The relationship between the <b>size</b> of the <b>enclosure</b> space {{and the size of}} the fire has been demonstrated in a dimensionless form. The zone model BRANZFIRE and the CFD model FDS were used for simulating smoke development. The simulations included various full-scale experimental data on both small and large spaces found in the literature. Further simulations of large exemplar spaces with a range of fire sizes were performed to investigate different variables, which have not been examined in full-scale experiments. The simulation results have been compared based on the smoke layer height and the average layer temperature. Zukoski’s smoke filling equation was also used to compare the layer height predictions against BRANZFIRE and FDS. It was found that different data reduction techniques gave different approximations to the layer height. A perfect match between the experimental data and the model output was very difficult to achieve. FDS showed a large uncertainty of the smoke layer height and temperature in the early stages of fire across the enclosure space. In the later stages, this uncertainly became minimised where the smoke layer height and temperature were fairly uniformly developed across the space. For fire enclosures with instantaneous steady-state fires, the predictions between BRANZFIRE and FDS agreed well with each other if the fire <b>size</b> and the <b>enclosure</b> <b>size</b> were within a reasonable range. From the modelling of the full-scale experiments, FDS showed favourable layer-height comparisons against the full-scale experimental tests. However, the output results from BRANZFIRE are less comparable with those of FDS for the experiments with fire growth. An appropriate smoke transport time lag should be included for Zukoski’s smoke filling equation and BRANZFIRE; otherwise, they gave conservative estimates of the layer height to smaller fires with a growth phase. In general, the data reduction methods and zone models should not be used if the fire is too small relative to the <b>enclosure</b> <b>size.</b> A very low temperature rise within the enclosure space would give invalid predictions of the layer height and average layer temperature. This is because there is no clear indication of a separation between the upper and lower smoke layers or temperatures. Single point data of smoke concentrations and temperatures from CFD models should be considered through the entire space or at the specified location of interest. This also applies to an extremely large fire relative to the <b>enclosure</b> <b>size</b> where temperature distribution across the space might not be very homogenous. CFD models could also be used to investigate the details of the smoke properties in the early stages of growing fires, in which the smoke transport lag and the plume effects cannot be seen in BRANZFIRE. This research is intended to provide guidance for fire engineers by determining which of the computer methods can be used confidently and appropriately as a design tool...|$|R
