5|$|Prokofiev {{died at the}} age of 61 on 5 March 1953, {{the same}} day as Joseph Stalin. He had lived near Red Square, and for three days the throngs {{gathered}} to mourn Stalin, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to carry Prokofiev's body out for the funeral service at the headquarters of the Soviet Composers' Union. He is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. He was an atheist.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for Coffin to find a replacement to run the company {{so that he could}} return to Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding {{it would be impossible to}} maintain a profitable business.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, Tai Loong had argued, {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, the interplay between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II. It argued that this failure {{of the government to}} thus provide adequate notice that the law would be enforced against such vessels was a violation of their right to due process.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 {{was further}} pushed back to October 2008 due to {{manufacturing}} delays on external tanks for future space shuttle missions. Lockheed Martin experienced delays during the production changes {{to make new}} external tanks with all the enhancements recommended by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for them to produce two tanks for the STS-125 mission–one for Atlantis, and one for Endeavour for an emergency rescue mission, if necessary–in time for the original August launch date.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s and 1990s {{were a very}} unsafe {{time for}} bulk carriers. Many bulkers sank during this time, 99 were lost between 1990 and 1997 alone. Most of these sinkings were sudden and quick, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for the crew to escape: more than 650 sailors were lost during this same period. Due partly to the sinking of , a series of {{international}} safety resolutions regarding bulkers were adopted during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The French 7th Army, on the {{northern}} flank of the Belgian line, protected the Bruges–Ghent–Ostend axis and, covering the Channel ports, had advanced into Belgium and into the Netherlands with speed. It reached Breda in the Netherlands, on 11 May. But German parachute forces had seized the Moerdijk bridge on the Hollands Diep river, south of Rotterdam, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for the French to link up with the Dutch Army. The Dutch Army withdrew north to Rotterdam and Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} paper published {{ten years after}} the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315km/h) 195mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to confirm such intensity.|$|E

5|$|Along a highway, {{the group}} is forced to stop {{as a number of}} {{abandoned}} cars litter the road, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to pass; further, Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) must stop to fix his RV. As the others push cars {{out of the way and}} scavenge for supplies, a horde of walkers appear behind them. The group take shelter under cars to avoid conflict, though in his haste, T-Dog (IronE Singleton) severely cuts his arm. Some walkers spot Sophia (Madison Lintz), daughter of Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), hiding under a car, and she flees into the nearby forest. Rick follows her and tells her to find someplace safe to hide while he dispatches the walkers.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{an attempt}} was made to {{relocate}} the original quarry where A. fragillimus and other species had been found, using ground-penetrating radar in an attempt to image bones still buried in the ground. This attempt failed because the fossilized mudstone bones were the same density as the surrounding rock, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to differentiate the two. A study of the local topography also showed that the fossil-bearing rock strata was severely eroded, and probably was so at the time Lucas made his discovery of A. fragillimus, indicating {{that a majority of the}} skeleton was gone by the time the vertebra and femur were recovered.|$|E
5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in {{the same type of}} chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E

That day, there was a huge gale blowing, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; they were having as much trouble getting into the bay as the First Fleet was having getting out.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen, {{driving a}} Lancia Delta S4, {{died in a}} crash on 2 May 1986 while leading the Tour de Corse rally in Corsica. His American co-driver, Sergio Cresto, also died when the Lancia plunged down a ravine and exploded. The fatal crash had no close {{witnesses}} and the only remains of the car were the blackened spaceframe, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to {{determine the cause of}} the crash. Within hours of the crash, Jean-Marie Balestre, then President of the FISA, had banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season, ending rallying's popular supercar era.|$|E
5|$|Treblinka {{was divided}} into two {{separate}} camps that were 2 kilometres apart. Two engineering firms, the Schoenbronn Company of Leipzig and the Warsaw branch of Schmidt–Munstermann, oversaw the construction of both camps. Between 1942 and 1943 the extermination centre was further redeveloped with a crawler excavator. New gas chambers made of brick and cement mortar were freshly erected, and mass cremation pyres were also introduced. The perimeter was enlarged to provide a buffer zone, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to approach the camp from the outside. The number of trains caused panic among the residents of nearby settlements. They would likely have been killed if caught near the railway tracks.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{overflow}} of the Arecibo River on October7, a neighborhood in Utuado {{was cut off}} from surrounding communities after gushing waters severely damaged its main road. Shortly thereafter, a landslide lugged a utility pole along the road, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for larger vehicles—including ambulances—to access the site. Landslides trapped fourteen families in the municipality of Ponce; a residence alongside a road suffered significant damage {{and had to be}} evacuated. In Cayey, a district was isolated from neighboring areas due to the collapse of a bridge. In the area, burst riverbanks triggered floods across local streets, which trapped dozens of families in their homes. Severe flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving an estimated 45,000 people without drinking water {{in the wake of the}} storm. In response, the government declared a state of emergency for the entire island. Authorities opened 120 shelters, and several flood victims had to be rescued.|$|E
5|$|Geneforges {{dialogue}} is delivered through on-screen text. Encounters with intelligent creations or humans {{result in the}} player being given a series of pre-determined questions or responses. Conversation options and the outcome of those conversations change according to the player's previous interactions. as well as which quests have been completed; which items the player has; which group the player belongs to and the player's leadership skill. The player can collect items from defeated enemies and the game environments to improve their own equipment. Non-player characters can trade with the player, buying most items regardless of type. The shopkeeper has a fixed amount of gold {{at the start of}} the game which does not replenish itself. It is possible for the player to drain all shopkeepers of their gold reserves, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to sell further items.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to {{evacuate}} via Mogadishu International Airport. Soon after the evacuation request, the United States Air Force deployed C-130 transport planes and an AC-130, for gunfire support, to Nairobi, Kenya, awaiting clearances to enter Somalia {{and the ability to}} safely transfer evacuees from the embassy to the airport. However, the US and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances. It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command-and-control structure, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage. Likewise, government troops faced a command-and-control problem; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines, in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with. Thus, it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible. Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu, but faced the same problems of landing and transit of evacuees to the airport.|$|E
