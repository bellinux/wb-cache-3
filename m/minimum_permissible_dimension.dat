30|$|This paper {{provides}} a modified droop control scheme for the VSC-based MVDC RES, with an objective of obtaining better current-sharing among the TSSs {{in conjunction with}} acceptable catenary voltages.

40|$|Background: The {{main source}} of noise in open plan office are conversations. Office work {{standards}} in such premises are attained by applying specific acoustic adaptation. This article {{presents the results of}} pilot tests and acoustic evaluation of open space rooms. Material and Methods: Acoustic properties of 6 open plan office rooms were the subject of the tests. Evaluation parameters, measurement methods and criterial values were adopted according to the following standards: PN-EN ISO 3382 - 3 : 2012, PN-EN ISO 3382 - 2 : 2010, PN-B- 02151 - 4 : 2015 - 06 and PN-B- 02151 - 3 : 2015 - 10. Results: The reverberation time was 0. 33 – 0. 55 s (maximum permissible value in offices – 0. 6 s; the criterion was met), sound absorption coefficient in relation to 1 m 2 of the room’s plan was 0. 77 – 1. 58 m 2 (<b>minimum</b> <b>permissible</b> value – 1. 1 m 2; 2 out of 6 rooms met the criterion), distraction distance was 8. 5 – 14 m (maximum permissible value – 5 m; none of the rooms met the criterion), A-weighted sound pressure level of speech at a distance of 4 m was 43. 8 – 54. 7 dB (maximum permissible value – 48 dB; 2 out of 6 rooms met the criterion), spatial decay rate of the speech was 1. 8 – 6. 3 dB (<b>minimum</b> <b>permissible</b> value – 7 dB; none of the rooms met the criterion). Conclusions: Standard acoustic treatment, containing sound absorbing suspended ceiling, sound absorbing materials on the walls, carpet flooring and sound absorbing workplace barriers, is not sufficient.

30|$|As {{emphasized}} before, {{the main}} objective of IAC is {{to mitigate the}} overhead involved in estimating available bandwidth information at each interfering neighbor seen in existing literatures such as CACP [12], MARIA [18]. For this purpose, IAC requires each node locally to estimate the channel utilization ratio and then to compare with the threshold {{to determine whether the}} current channel utilization has exceeded the <b>minimum</b> <b>permissible</b> threshold. If exceeded, each node is required to compute the available bandwidth and broadcast this information to all the interfering nodes. IAC requires all the receiving nodes to buffer these broadcasts and as a result, when a new flow request arrives at each node, it locally determines whether the incoming flow can be accepted by comparing the new flow requirement with the buffered bandwidth information.|$|R

Both stations retained omnidirectional antennas. Therefore, GE effectively removed from the West one of its eight clear channels and added another clear channel to the East,thereby giving the East nine cleared channels and the West only seven. The other [...] "regions" [...] in the Band Plan all retained their allotted eight cleared channels.|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in third-generation mobile systems is {{the adaptation of}} the channel allocation to the traffic volume variation.
