5|$|A {{supply of}} 929 M249 SAWs was issued to {{personnel}} from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War. Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners {{who were involved}} in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly <b>maneuvering</b> troops from fixed positions, rather than <b>maneuvering</b> with them. There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.|$|E
5|$|Gemini was {{the second}} American manned orbital spaceflight program, after Mercury. It was {{intended}} to demonstrate technologies and techniques required for the Apollo program, such as extra-vehicular activities, rendezvous and docking, <b>maneuvering</b> in orbit and long duration flight.|$|E
50|$|ZPMs are {{developed}} by solving a specific nonlinear two-point-boundary-value optimal control {{problem for a}} fixed <b>maneuver</b> end time. Whereas an eigenaxis <b>maneuver</b> maintains a constant rotation axis and <b>maneuver</b> rate, a ZPM uses a time varying rotation axis and <b>maneuver</b> rate. An eigenaxis <b>maneuver</b> attitude trajectory tries to overcome disturbances to maintain a constant <b>maneuver</b> rate, which results in saturating the momentum storage devices. By using a variable <b>maneuver</b> rate, ZPMs avoid saturation of momentum storage actuators.|$|R

5|$|Tactically, SAWs {{are either}} carried with a <b>maneuvering</b> unit and fired while handheld, or {{positioned}} to remain stationary and provide covering fire for other units. The usual load of ammunition carried for the weapon is 1,000 rounds in five 200-round belts, although up to 500 extra rounds generally get loaded into 100-round soft pouches.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} also under latent danger of {{attack by the}} Venetians. For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to {{preserve}} their city-republic by skillful <b>maneuvering</b> between East and West.

40|$|When {{designing}} a mission, {{the addition of}} a <b>maneuver</b> at the right spot often improves the utility of an otherwise mediocre trajectory. However, the additional degrees of freedom of finding the best <b>maneuver</b> location can severely complicate automated broad-search algorithms. A computationally-efficient formulation that reduces the <b>maneuver</b> design space to a single dimension is presented, where the efficacy of additional <b>maneuvers</b> along previously computed transfers is calculated explicitly via Lawden's "primer vector. " Examples include leveraging <b>maneuvers</b> to ease capture at Europa, phasing <b>maneuvers</b> to enable resonant-hopping among Saturn's moons, and broken-plane <b>maneuvers</b> on transfers to Mars...|$|R

5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, to lighten it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use <b>maneuvering</b> thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. When even that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned <b>Maneuvering</b> Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E

25|$|The sight {{distance}} {{needed for a}} given situation is the distance travelled during the two phases of a driving maneuver: perception-reaction time (PRT), and <b>maneuver</b> time (MT). Perception-reaction time is {{the time it takes}} for a road user to realize that a reaction is needed to a road condition, decided what <b>maneuver</b> is appropriate, and start the <b>maneuver.</b> <b>Maneuver</b> time is {{the time it takes to}} complete the <b>maneuver.</b> The distance driven during perception-reaction time and <b>maneuver</b> time is the {{sight distance}} needed.|$|R
40|$|The Cassini-Huygens Saturn tour poses an {{interesting}} navigation challenge. From July 2004 through June 2008, the Cassini orbiter performed 112 of 161 planned <b>maneuvers.</b> This demanding schedule, where <b>maneuvers</b> are often separated {{by just a}} few days, motivated the development of <b>maneuver</b> design/analysis automation software tools. Besides generating <b>maneuver</b> designs and presentations, these tools are the mechanism to producing other types of navigation information; information used to facilitate operational decisions {{on such issues as}} <b>maneuver</b> cancellation and alternate <b>maneuver</b> strategies. This paper will discuss the navigation data that are communicated inside the Cassini-Huygens Project, as well as the <b>maneuver</b> software tools behind the processing of the data...|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} the debates and {{legislative}} <b>maneuvering</b> that went into crafting the Bill of Rights amendments was done, many personal opinions had shifted. A number of Federalists came out in support, thus silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective critique. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, were now opposed, realizing that Congressional approval of these amendments would greatly lessen {{the chances of a}} second constitutional convention. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E

5|$|Earwigs {{are mostly}} scavengers, {{but some are}} {{omnivorous}} or predatory. The abdomen of the earwig is flexible and muscular. It is capable of <b>maneuvering</b> as well as opening and closing the forceps. The forceps are used {{for a variety of}} purposes. In some species, the forceps have been observed in use for holding prey, and in copulation. The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females.|$|E
5000|$|Rubin <b>maneuver</b> is a secondary, {{rotational}} <b>maneuver</b> {{to deliver}} the baby in case of shoulder dystocia. The first Rubin <b>maneuver</b> is the rotation of anterior shoulder under pubic symphysis by giving suprapubic pressure. As a result, the bisacromial diameter is rotated from anteroposterior to oblique lie. The obstetrician uses the right hand for performing this <b>maneuver</b> if the foetus is facing mother's right side, and vice versa. During first Rubin <b>maneuver,</b> fundal pressure should not be applied because it may cause uterine rupture or further impaction of the shoulder. If the first Rubin <b>maneuver</b> does not disengage the shoulder, second Rubin <b>maneuver</b> is performed.|$|R

Traffic aircraft approaching from various azimuths and altitudes were periodically presented on a trajectory, which posed a collision threat to the pilot’s aircraft if a <b>maneuver</b> was not initiated. <b>Maneuver</b> choices were classified by the axis (vertical, lateral, airspeed) and direction within the axis and were analyzed in terms of their safety, operationally defined as the time spent with a predicted loss of separation. Decision analysis revealed a strong tendency to use single-axis <b>maneuvers,</b> to prefer vertical over lateral <b>maneuvers,</b> to climb, rather than descend, and to avoid airspeed <b>maneuvers.</b> Vertical <b>maneuvers</b> were less safe than lateral and airspeed <b>maneuvers</b> and tended to be opposite the vertical direction of the traffic.

30|$|In {{the second}} {{critical}} phase, perigee-up delta-V <b>maneuvers</b> were required because the initial perigee altitude of 214  km was {{so low that}} the apogee altitude would diminish rapidly and the AO around the perigee would erode surface materials. Before these <b>maneuvers</b> were carried out, the AOCS functions were checked step by step, including the execution of test attitude <b>maneuvers</b> and a test delta-V <b>maneuver.</b> The actual delta-V <b>maneuvers</b> were conducted twice {{to reduce the risk}} of a <b>maneuver</b> control error; as a result, the perigee altitude was increased to 440  km as intended.|$|R
40|$|Several {{techniques}} {{are used to}} synthesize the formation-keeping control law for a three-satellite formation in low-earth orbit. The objective is to minimize <b>maneuver</b> cost and position tracking error. Initial reductions are found for a one-satellite case by tuning the state-weighting matrix within the linear-quadratic-Gaussian framework. Further savings come from adjusting the <b>maneuver</b> interval. Scenarios examined include cases with and without process noise. These results are then applied to a three-satellite formation. For both the one-satellite and three-satellite cases, increasing the <b>maneuver</b> interval yields a decrease in <b>maneuver</b> cost {{and an increase in}} position tracking error. A <b>maneuver</b> interval of 8 - 10 minutes provides a good trade-off between <b>maneuver</b> cost and position tracking error.
