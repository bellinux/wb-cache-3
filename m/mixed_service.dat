50|$|The <b>Mixed</b> <b>Service</b> Organisation (MSO) was a {{civilian}} {{arm of the}} British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) which employed displaced persons as drivers, clerks, mechanics and guards. Originally formed as Watchman and labour units {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the Second World War the MSO employed citizens of Eastern European nations occupied by the Soviets. These former prisoners of war, concentration camp inmates and forced labourers were left in western sectors of occupied Germany at the end of the war and chose not to return to their countries of origin. Whilst some displaced persons only worked with the organisation for a short time others stayed until retirement age. The MSO was organised in a structure similar to British Colonial Units, with a British Commanding Officer and senior Non-commissioned officers operating over a 'native' officer and NCO structure. Whilst the Transport Service was disbanded in the late 1980s the MSO Guard and Labour Services continued into the 1990s using guest labour from Turkey, Pakistan and other Non-EU Countries.|$|E

50|$|Woodville {{became the}} {{terminus}} of the Wairarapa Mail, a replacement locomotive-hauled passenger train introduced to provide passenger services to Wairarapa between Wellington and Woodville. In its later years, the Wairarapa Mail was extended from Woodville through to Palmerston North, operating as a <b>mixed</b> <b>service</b> {{between these two}} stations. Railcar services were introduced in 1936 over the same route using the new Wairarapa-class RM railcars, which eventually replaced the Wairarapa Mail in 1948 to due coal shortages. Despite this development, mixed trains on the northern section of the Wairarapa Line continued to operate. A mixed Woodville - Masterton and return service was run six days a week, Monday - Saturday, and {{in the opposite direction}} on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The daily nature of this service made it popular with students attending secondary school in Masterton. After the Rimutaka Tunnel opened, both the Wairarapa railcars and the mixed trains were withdrawn and replaced by the new twinset railcars. As at 1959, Wairarapa services were still terminating at Woodville using the Wairarapa dock siding, and it was not uncommon for two or three railcars to be waiting at Woodville to transfer passengers between services. Locomotive hauled passenger trains through the Wairarapa to Woodville were gradually re-introduced from the mid-1960s, fully replacing the railcars in 1977. Later, passenger trains were run as through services between Palmerston North and Wellington via Woodville, but demand for these services declined through the 1980s, leading to their cancellation from 1 August 1988.|$|E
