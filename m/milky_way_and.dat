5|$|Actual {{proof of}} the Milky Way {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> discovered that it is composed of {{a huge number of}} faint stars.|$|E
5|$|Although {{globular}} clusters generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities can occur due to tidal interactions.

5|$|In {{addition}} to detecting extrasolar planets, SIM {{would have helped}} astronomers construct {{a map of the}} Milky Way galaxy.

5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E

5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>and</b> therefore hosts an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Only three Milky Way naked-eye {{supernova}} {{events have}} been observed during the last thousand years, though many have been seen in other galaxies using telescopes. The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, but the remnants of two more recent supernovae have also been found. Statistical observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur on average about three times every century in the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>and</b> that any galactic supernova would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes.|$|E
5|$|The WHT is {{equipped}} {{with a wide range of}} instruments operating over the optical and near-infrared regimes.

Astronomers using the telescope discovered the first evidence for a supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) at the centre of the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>and</b> made the first optical observation of a gamma-ray burst. The telescope has 75% clear nights, with a median seeing of 0.7".|$|E

5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>and</b> Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>and</b> elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E
5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Alpha Andromedae, is {{a binary}} star that {{has also been}} counted {{as a part of}} Pegasus, while Gamma Andromedae is a colorful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers. Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its color visible to the naked eye. The constellation's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> one of the brightest Messier objects. Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions M110 and M32, as well as the more distant NGC 891, lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object.|$|E
