5|$|Although {{proposals}} for television projects were submitted to him, {{he had no}} interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he {{would never be able to}} film his stories.|$|E
5|$|While under Iso's tutelage, Kanō {{witnessed}} a demonstration by the Yōshin-ryū jūjutsu teacher Totsuka Hikosuke and later {{took part in}} randori with members of Totsuka's school. Kanō {{was impressed by the}} Yōshin-ryū practitioners and realized that he <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to beat someone as talented as Totsuka simply by training harder: he also needed to train smarter. It was this experience that first led Kanō to believe that to be truly superior, one needed to combine the best elements of several ryū, or schools, of jūjutsu including Yagyu Shingan-ryū Taijutsu. Toward this end, he began to seek teachers who could provide him with superior elements of jūjutsu that he could adopt.|$|E
5|$|Back in her bedroom, Rapunzel is {{suddenly}} flooded by memories from her past. Realizing Gothel is a fraud, she finally finds {{the courage to}} rebel against her. However, Gothel, unwilling to lose Rapunzel, chains her up and gags her with a white handkerchief. When Flynn, having managed {{to escape from the}} castle, arrives at the tower, Gothel stabs him. Desperate to save him, Rapunzel promises to do whatever Gothel pleases in return. Gothel complies, but just as Rapunzel is about to heal him, Flynn cuts her hair short, causing it to turn brown and lose all of its magical powers and <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> long again, resulting in Gothel's death. Flynn dies in Rapunzel's arms and she cries bitterly. However, the flower's magic manifests itself through Rapunzel's tears and returns Flynn to life. Flynn returns Rapunzel to the palace, where she is finally reunited with her parents.|$|E

5|$|A {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events of the game, three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would come to be called the War of the Magi. This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers—magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war. Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues. Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> used again. The espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land, sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game's opening, the most advanced nation is the Empire, a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo. Approximately eighteen years before {{the events of the}} game begin, the barrier between the espers' land {{and the rest of the}} world weakened. Soon after, Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers' land, capturing several of them.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{threw himself}} into Parliamentary work, begrudging the times when {{he was unable to}} attend debates and {{spending}} much time on committee work. When Austen Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the continued coalition government led by the Liberal Prime Minister, Lloyd George, tried to recruit him to serve on an additional committee, Neville Chamberlain informed his half-brother that he could only serve if it met between midnight and 7:30am. Chamberlain took time to assure the future of the Birmingham Savings Bank, and Parliament passed an act which removed onerous restrictions from the bank. In March 1920, he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health by Bonar Law on behalf of the Prime Minister, but was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George despite Bonar Law's warnings that Chamberlain, now past fifty, <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> offered another chance to serve in government, as Lloyd George was likely to remain premier for a very long time. Chamberlain was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership, and when Bonar Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament.|$|E

Though he was warned that he <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to {{live a normal life}} again, eight years later he was fit enough to insist on playing tennis nearly every day and to launch a hostile takeover of Viacom. Redstone has discussed the story of surviving the fire as a reflection of his strong determination and will to live.|$|E
25|$|The first Bifrenaria {{species to}} be {{described}} was in 1824 by English Botanist William Jackson Hooker, under the name Dendrobium harrisoniae. Three years later, he also described the first small-flowered species, B. racemosa, but placed it in Maxillaria. With these two publications began {{a long series of}} species descriptions and confusing genera creation which generated much doubt for the next two centuries. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew registers the submission of 69 species or subspecific taxa under Bifrenaria since the description of the first species. Among these, twenty are generally accepted but only seventeen are truly well established, with no doubts about their limits and classification. Thirteen other species are still accepted but now placed in other genera, and four or five, due to deficiencies in their descriptions, <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> definitely identified.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of authorship—essentially {{of how much}} of the music is Monteverdi's—is a contentious one, which Rosand acknowledges <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> entirely resolved. Virtually none of the contemporary documentation mentions Monteverdi, and music by other composers has been identified in the scores, including passages found in the score of Francesco Sacrati's opera La finta pazza. A particular style of metric notation used in some passages of the L'incoronazione scores suggests the work of younger composers. The most debated areas of authorship are parts of the prologue, Ottone's music, the flirtation scene between Valetto and Damigella, and the coronation scene including the final [...] "Pur ti miro" [...] duet.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Ian McKellen {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} not be reprising his role as Magneto in the Origins movie citing his age, and Shuler Donner stated that the movie <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> made, stating it was [...] "at the back of the queue" [...] in the studio's priorities. Both Donner and Bryan Singer have stated that Magneto would not be produced as the plot of X-Men: First Class [...] "superseded" [...] the story of the planned film. Singer denied using Sheldon Turner's script for Magneto as inspiration to write his draft of First Class, but the Writer's Guild of America arbitration still credited Turner for the film's story, while Moss and Schwartz's collaborations ended up uncredited. Singer set the film in a period where Xavier and Magneto were in their twenties, and seeing that it was during the 1960s, added the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop, considering it would be interesting to [...] "discuss this contemporary concept in a historical context". Shuler Donner suggested the Hellfire Club as the villains.|$|E
500|$|At the congress, Kim Il-sung {{stressed}} the importance of [...] "achieving the goal of the unification of the fatherland which has been the greatest and long-cherised desire of the whole people is the most important revolutionary task facing the Party". He warned his audience that if Korea remained divided, it <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> unified again because of relations among the big powers. Kim Il-sung called for the establishment of the [...] "Democratic Confederal Republic of Korea" [...] (DCRK), a national government of North and South Korea. The DCRK would be ruled by a Supreme Confederal National Congress (SCNC), with an equal number of representatives from North and South Korea. The SCNC representatives would elect a Presidium, which would rule on its behalf. Under this system, South Korea would remain capitalist and North Korea socialist. However, the WPK leadership named three conditions for North Korea to join the DCRK: (1) Social democratization of South Korea, the ouster of its current ruling class, repeal of the Anti-Communist and National Security Laws and replacement of its military regime by a democratic one representing the will of the people; (2) Reducing tensions with the establishment of a truce and a peace agreement; (3) Reducing American interference in the region, holding open the possibility of improved relations with the United States if it supported Korean reunification.|$|E

500|$|Attempting to {{reconcile}} these disparate positions, Eastern Orthodox theologian Dr. Mario Baghos notes that [...] "when taken {{at face value}} the saint seems to be contradicting himself in these passages; {{on the one hand}} he asserted the salvation of all and the complete eradication of evil, and, on the other, that the fire needed to purge evil is ‘sleepless’, i.e. everlasting. The only solution to this inconsistency is to view any allusion to universal salvation in St Gregory as an expression of God’s intention for humanity, which is in fact attested to when his holy sister states that God has “one goal [...] some straightway even in this life purified from evil, others healed hereafter through fire for the appropriate length of time.” That we can choose either to accept or ignore this purification is confirmed by the saint’s many exhortations that we freely undertake the virtuous path." [...] Dr. Ilaria Ramelli has made the observation that for Gregory free will was compatible with universal salvation, since every person would eventually accept the good having gone through purification. However, Gregory conceded that some sinners, such as Judas, <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> completely purified when he wrote, [...] "that which never existed is to be preferred to that which has existed in such sin. For, as to the latter, on account of the depth of the ingrained evil, the chastisement in the way of purgation will be extended into infinity".|$|E
500|$|The {{valley of}} Jackson Hole {{remained}} primarily in private ownership when John D. Rockefeller, Jr. {{and his wife}} visited {{the region in the}} late 1920s. Horace Albright and Rockefeller discussed ways to preserve Jackson Hole from commercial exploitation, and in consequence, Rockefeller started buying Jackson Hole properties through the Snake River Land Company for the purpose of later turning them over to the National Park Service. In 1930, this plan was revealed to the residents of the region and was met with strong disapproval. Congressional efforts to prevent the expansion of Grand Teton National Park ended up putting the Snake River Land Company's holdings in limbo. By 1942 Rockefeller had become increasingly impatient that his purchased property <b>might</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> added to the park, and wrote to the Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes that he was considering selling the land to another party. Secretary Ickes recommended to President Franklin Roosevelt that the Antiquities Act, which permitted Presidents to set aside land for protection without the approval of Congress, be used to establish a National Monument in Jackson Hole. Roosevelt created the [...] Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943, using the land donated from the Snake River Land Company and adding additional property from Teton National Forest. The monument and park were adjacent to each other and both were administered by the National Park Service, but the monument designation ensured no funding allotment, nor provided a level of resource protection equal to the park. Members of Congress repeatedly attempted to have the new National Monument abolished.|$|E
