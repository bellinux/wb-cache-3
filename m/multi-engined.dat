5|$|The year {{preceding}} 1945 {{had been}} catastrophic for the ZNDH. Aircraft losses amounted to 234, {{primarily on the}} ground, and it began 1945 with 196 machines, including 17 Messerschmitt Bf 109Gs, 12 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, seven Fiat G.50s and two Fiat CR.42 fighters and some 30 <b>multi-engined</b> bombers, although shortages of fuel had begun to hamper operations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 48, {{he learned}} to fly. Kesselring {{believed}} that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial {{to being able to}} command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and <b>multi-engined</b> aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945. At times, his flight path took him over the concentration camps at Oranienburg, Dachau, and Buchenwald.|$|E
25|$|The PA-44 is a {{development}} of the Piper Cherokee single-engined aircraft and is primarily used for <b>multi-engined</b> flight training.|$|E
25|$|The A-17 entered {{service in}} February 1936, and proved a {{reliable}} and popular aircraft. However, in 1938, the Air Corps decided that attack aircraft should be <b>multi-engined,</b> rendering the A-17 surplus to requirements.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War Blériot Aéronautique {{was largely}} {{concerned}} with manufacturing aircraft designed by others. The only aircraft produced under the Blériot name {{was a series}} of prototype <b>multi-engined</b> heavy bombers, none of which entered service.|$|E
25|$|The rating {{may only}} be {{exercised}} for aircraft in the group endorsed. An instrument rating is often combined with other ratings to form a set of piloting privileges. For example, the multi-engine rating is required {{in addition to an}} instrument rating to fly a <b>multi-engined</b> aircraft under instrument flight rules.|$|E
25|$|The Stipa-Caproni's great {{drawback}} {{was that}} the intubed propeller design created so much aerodynamic drag {{that most of the}} design's benefits in efficiency were negated by the drag. However, Stipa viewed the Stipa-Caproni as a mere testbed, and probably did not believe that the intubed propeller's aerodynamic drag problem would be significant in the various large, <b>multi-engined</b> flying wing aircraft he had designed.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, when a 72.4percent {{decrease}} was represented, a {{total of}} 4,254aircraft used the Omak Airport. 80aircraft were used for local military purposes and there were 2,714commercial air taxi movements, while the count for both itinerant and local general aviation was 730, totaling to 1,460. Statistics for based aircraft and passengers have also been recorded. In 1980, there were 32based aircraft, 28of which were single-engined and fourwere <b>multi-engined,</b> while in 1985, 29aircraft were based, with the total of singled-engined planes being 27and <b>multi-engined</b> being two. Meanwhile, the airport had 64enplanement passenger boardings in 2000, 57in 2001, 24in 2002, 20in 2003, 31in 2004, 56in 2005, 69in 2006, 14in 2007, 25in 2008, 48 in 2009, and 23 in 2010. While the FAA has not released statistics, {{it was estimated that}} approximately 2,000passengers were served in 2005. Overall, the highest amount of movements it has gained yearly is 142,000 and lowest is 4,254 according to the WSDOT; the most based aircraft at the Omak Airport was 658 at one point.|$|E
25|$|A {{site was}} {{available}} in a former trolleybus garage on Piccadilly, York. Despite setbacks and tribulations, including the usual problem of the start-up business, liquidity, Airspeed Limited eventually gained significant recognition when its Envoy aircraft was chosen for the King's Flight. With the approach of war a military version of the Envoy was developed, {{to be called the}} Airspeed Oxford. The Oxford became the standard advanced <b>multi-engined</b> trainer for the RAF and British Commonwealth, with over 8,500 being built.|$|E
25|$|Once pilots {{graduated}} from basic {{training on the}} BAC Jet Provost and gained their wings they were selected for one of three streams: fast jet, <b>multi-engined,</b> or helicopter. Those selected for fast jets were posted to RAF Valley for advanced training on the Gnat T.1, typically 70 hours of flying. Students would {{then move on to}} operational training using the Hawker Hunter, followed by a posting to an operational conversion unit for the type of aircraft to be flown.|$|E
25|$|Between 1919 and 1922 Caudron built {{a series}} of <b>multi-engined</b> civil {{passenger}} transport biplanes of similar design but increasing size and engine power, the C.33, C.37, C.39, C.43 and C.61. The C.33 was the only twin engined aircraft in the series and the smallest in span and passenger capacity, while the others had three or five engines. Rather than being a small airliner taking paying passengers, the Landaulet Monsieur-Madame was intended as {{the equivalent of a}} chauffeur driven car carrying a couple and one other member of the household, as its name suggested.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Diamond {{introduced}} its first <b>multi-engined</b> aircraft, the Diamond DA42 Twin Star. The Twin Star would be popular {{with both a}} civil and government operators; demand from the latter {{led to the development}} of the Aeronautics Defense Dominator, a medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used for aerial surveillance duties. For several years, the company was engaged in the development of a single-engined very light jet aircraft, known as the Diamond D-Jet, intended for both private and military customers alike. However, as a consequence of the Great Recession, funding became scarce and work on the D-Jet's development was eventually terminated during early 2013.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the other}} <b>multi-engined</b> jet {{aircraft}} in existence, when the Il-22 was being designed, either had the engines in a nacelle (singly or in pairs) directly attached to {{the underside of the}} wing or were buried in the wing itself. Clustering them in a nacelle offered several advantages over individual nacelles as it reduced overall drag and minimized interference drag, but had the major operational disadvantage that an uncontained fire in one engine could disable its neighbor as well and the early jet engines were not reliable, so this was a significant risk. Ilyushin chose to put the TR-1 engines ahead and below the wing leading edge on short horizontal pylons. This gave them the beneficial effect of acting as anti-flutter weights and proved to be more efficient aerodynamically than underwing nacelles. This also facilitated engine changes and maintenance by making them more accessible to the ground crews.|$|E
500|$|No. 1 Operational Training Unit (No.1OTU) was an {{operational}} conversion {{unit of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII. [...] Formed in December 1941 at Nhill, Victoria, it relocated to Bairnsdale in mid-1942, and then to East Sale the following year. No.1OTU's primary role was to train aircrew for <b>multi-engined</b> aircraft operations. At its peak of activity in August 1944, it was operating over 130 aircraft, the most numerous being Bristol Beauforts. Its aircraft and personnel also conducted transport missions in New Guinea and maritime patrols in southern Australian waters. Following the end of hostilities, the unit was disbanded in December 1945.|$|E
500|$|No.2 SFTS was {{reported}} as having achieved its nominal strength of 1,100 personnel, including 160 students, in October 1940. By this time up to 2,000 flights per month {{were said to}} be taking place, 150 of them at night, with instructors completing up to 90 hours flying time per week. The school underwent further reorganisation in February 1941 with the establishment of Intermediate Squadron; successful students from this unit were awarded their wings before proceeding to Advanced Squadron. Another new unit, Maintenance Squadron, formed in March. From this point on, No.2 SFTS phased out its Ansons, as single-engined and <b>multi-engined</b> aircraft training was split up on orders of the RAAF Air Board. By the end of July, only Wirraways were in operation, their numbers eventually reaching 96. A Wirraway crashed during an instrument training flight on 29August, killing both pilots. In October, Scherger was posted to take over RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, from Group Captain Charles [...] "Moth" [...] Eaton, who in turn assumed command of No.2 SFTS. Like Scherger, Eaton also served as Forest Hill's station commander.|$|E
2500|$|Advanced Pilot Training {{placed the}} {{graduates}} in two categories: single-engined and <b>multi-engined.</b> Single-engined pilots flew fighters and fighter-bombers. <b>Multi-engined</b> pilots learned to fly transports and bombers. First they flew Trainer aircraft, then transitioned to front-line aircraft. [...] Those students selected for single-engine training flew the AT-6 [...] "Texan," [...] {{and those who}} went into twin-engine training flew the Curtiss AT-9 [...] "Jeep," [...] the all-wood Beechcraft AT-10 [...] "Wichita," [...] or the Cessna AT-17 [...] "Bobcat." ...|$|E
2500|$|The de Havilland DH.54 Highclere was a single-engined 15-passenger biplane {{airliner}} {{designed to}} replace the DH.34. [...] Its development ended when Imperial Airways decided to use only <b>multi-engined</b> types.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>multi-engined</b> {{aircraft}} {{where the}} engines {{are off the}} centre line, the rudder {{may be used to}} compensate for the yaw effect of asymmetric thrust, for example in the event of engine failure. Further, on large jet airliners, the rudder is mainly used to align the aircraft with the runway during crosswind landing and take-off.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922 Blériot Aéronautique, {{which had}} been a private company became a {{limited-liability}} company, Blériot Aéronautique S.A.. [...] Although a single company, aircraft were produced using both the Blériot and SPAD names, the former generally being used for the larger <b>multi-engined</b> aircraft, while the smaller single-engined aircraft bore the SPAD name, and it was these that were most successful.|$|E
2500|$|The Yak-2 was {{initially}} {{known as the}} Ya-22, in the Yakovlev OKB numbering sequence, before it was redesignated as the Yak-2 in 1941. It was of mixed construction with wooden wings and center fuselage, duralumin forward fuselage, and steel tube framing in the rear fuselage with a wooden upper decking and fabric skin. The cockpit was at the very tip of the nose, but the navigator/gunner was in a compartment behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. The prototype was unarmed and no bomb shackles were fitted. It also lacked a radio and navigational equipment. It was, however, the fastest <b>multi-engined</b> aircraft in the Soviet Union, able to reach [...] at , not least because it lacked heavy military equipment.|$|E
2500|$|With {{very few}} {{exceptions}} aircraft of the pioneer era were relatively small designs {{powered by a}} single engine and designed to carry at most two or three people. [...] Early multiple-engine designs were produced by the Short Brothers, who constructed a number of variants of their Farman-type Improved S.27 design. However the intention of using a pair of engines in these aircraft was to safeguard against engine failure rather than to permit a larger machine, and even a large aircraft such as the Voisin Aero-Yacht, intended to carry six people and with a wingspan of 22.5m (73ft 10in), was powered by a single engine. [...] The first large <b>multi-engined</b> aircraft was [...] Igor Sikorsky's Bolshoi Baltisky, first flown in May 1913 with two engines and later equipped with four.|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{founding}} in the 1980s, Austrian manufacturer Diamond Aircraft Industries had concentrated on building up an extensive product line. During the late 1990s, company founder and chief executive office Christian Dries approached the design team with a concept for a twin-engined aircraft, which would become the company's first <b>multi-engined</b> aircraft and serve as the next step above the Diamond DA40. This concept emphasised several key qualities, including {{the need for the}} aircraft to be relatively simple to operate and be fuel-efficient, while also providing a luxurious four-seat passenger compartment akin to modern automobiles. The concept was not popular at the time; Aerospace publication Flying Magazine referred to Diamond's choice to develop a twin-engined aircraft for general aviation use as [...] "the emergence of an all-new light-piston twin in this class something of a surprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|These three {{carriers}} later {{evolved into}} United Airlines (the northern airmail route, CAMs 17 and 18), Trans World Airlines (the mid-United States route, CAM 34) and American Airlines (the southern route, CAM 33). Brown also extended the southern {{route to the}} West Coast. He awarded bonuses for carrying more passengers and purchasing <b>multi-engined</b> aircraft equipped with radios and navigation aids. By the end of 1932 the airline industry was the one {{sector of the economy}} experiencing steady growth and profitability, described by one historian as [...] "Depression-proof." [...] Passenger miles, the numbers of passengers, and new airline employees had all tripled over 1929. Airmail itself, despite its image to many Americans as a frivolous luxury for the few remaining affluent, had doubled following restructuring. Much of this if not all {{was the result of the}} postal subsidies, funded by taxpayers.|$|E
2500|$|The BC-348 is the 28 vdc powered {{version of}} the 14 vdc powered BC-224. [...] The first version, the BC-224-A, was {{produced}} in 1936. Installed in almost all USAAF (and some USN, some British and some Canadian) <b>multi-engined</b> transports and bombers used during the fifteen-year period from before World War II through the Korean War, BC-348 radio receivers were easy to operate and reliable. Designed as LF/MF/HF receivers for use in larger aircraft (B-17, B-24, B-25, B-26, B-29, C-47, etc.), they were initially paired with a BC-375 transmitter in the SCR-287-A system. [...] Late in World War II, the AN/ARR-11 (BC-348) was the receiver and the AN/ART-13A (ART-13) was the transmitter in the AN/ARC-8 system. [...] They were also used in some ground and mobile installations such as the AN/MRC-20. The BC-348 series ran to several variations during its long production history, which included the BC-224. More than 100,000 of these receivers were produced, 80 percent by Belmont Radio and Wells-Gardner and the balance by RCA and Stromberg-Carlson.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} year of the airlift, inexperienced {{officers}} of the Services of Supply often ordered planes loaded until they were [...] "about full", ignorant of gross weight limitations or center of gravity placement, while most pilots were reserves recently called up from the airlines with little military transport experience and accustomed to civilian safety standards. As the airlift grew in size and scope in 1943, demands of tactical units and the failure of airline-conducted ATC training programs to produce sufficient <b>multi-engined</b> pilots limited nearly all reinforcement pilots to those just out of flight school or single-engine rated pilots from training fields who had relatively little instrument time. In December 1942, one-third of the 102 technical sergeant (non-commissioned officer) pilot training graduates of the Lubbock Field Class 42-I were immediately sent to India to fly the Hump as replacement co-pilots. This collective inexperience required ICW to create an in-theater OTU near Karachi to qualify new arrivals, taking 16 experienced pilots and eight to ten aircraft away from the airlift. CNAC pilots, while accustomed to a variety of aircraft, also had little instrument experience, and most were unfamiliar with the large American transport aircraft used in the airlift. Not until 1944, when the ATC recruited high hour civilian flight instructors released by the AAF in pilot training program cutbacks, and the 3rd OTU at Reno AAF (Nevada) turned out a growing number of C-46 crews, were highly qualified replacements more readily available for the airlift.|$|E
