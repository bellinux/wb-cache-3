40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanical}} properties of <b>Milano</b> <b>rib</b> knit fabric reinforced composites have been previously characterized [1 – 5]. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to theoretically pre-dict the stiffness and tensile strength of these composites. Attention has been focused on simplicity and user-friendliness. The complicated <b>Milano</b> <b>rib</b> knit fabric structure has been approximated by several simpler plain stitches, for which an analytical geometric model is applicable. After discretizing the representative volume element of the Milano fabric com-posite into sub-elements which contain only straight yarn segments, the overall stiffness and strength of the composite are obtained by assembling the contributions of a number of unidirectional fibrous composites. A recently developed micromechanics model, the bridging model [6], is applied to estimate the stiffness and strength of each unidirectional composite. The predicted stiffness and strength of the Milano fabric composites have been compared with the available experimental results. Reasonably good correlation has been found between the predictions and the experiments.

40|$|The {{effect of}} biaxially {{deforming}} a weft-knit <b>Milano</b> <b>rib</b> fabric {{on the overall}} composite compressive properties has been studied for a glass/vinyl-ester knitted composite. A range of combinations of wale-course stretch ratios was considered. It {{was found that the}} compression properties of these structures, on the whole, appeared to be closer to isotropic and relatively insensitive to fabric deformation. This observation is believed to be due to the dominance of the matrix properties. Despite not detecting any gross changes in the knit structure, it is believed that some redistribution and reorientation of the fibres did occur during fabric deformation, which in turn altered the relative contents and/or directionality of the fibres in the composites. A feature of the compressive failure was kinking of the highly bent yarns, particularly in resin rich regions having reduced lateral support for yarns...|$|E
40|$|Weft knitted {{composites}} have a {{very complex}} reinforcement structure which affects their mechanical behaviour. Six kinds of weft knitted fabric reinforcement were examined in this study. These were a group of knitted reinforcements without inlays: <b>Rib,</b> <b>Milano</b> and Interlock and a group with inlays: <b>Rib</b> Inlay, <b>Milano</b> Inlay and Interlock Inlay. The knitting and performing parameters were varied but the fibre volume fraction was kept constant within the two groups. In all cases the fibre used was E-glass. After knitting, the fabrics were infused with epoxy resin using a resin transfer moulding (RTM) process. The mechanical properties of the cured composites were then determined in the wale direction using the tension test, compression test, flexural test, short beam shear test and Izod impact test. The {{results showed that the}} knitting and preforming parameters strongly influenced the mechanical properties of the weft knitted glass/epoxy composites...|$|R
50|$|On {{his first}} {{appearance}} of 1976 Quiet Fling was ridden by Lester Piggott and started at odds of 5/1 for the John Porter Stakes at Newbury in April. He tracked the leaders before taking the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by two lengths from the French-trained Rouge Sang (later to win the Gran Premio di <b>Milano,</b> with Libra's <b>Rib</b> (Princess of Wales's Stakes) in third. At Epsom Racecourse in June Quiet Fling, with Piggott again in the saddle, started 5/2 favourite for the 71st running of the Coronation Cup. His opponents included Libra's Rib, Zimbalon (King George V Stakes, Ormonde Stakes) and the French challengers Infra Green (Prix Ganay) and Val du Fier. After being restrained by Piggott {{at the rear of}} the field, Quiet Fling produced a strong late run in the straight, took the lead a furlong out, and won by half a length from Libra's Rib.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental investigation {{carried out to}} understand the mechanical behavior of composite materials made of 3 D stitched woven-knitted basalt fabrics. The innovative preforms used consist of two outer layers of a plain woven fabric combined with two inner layers of weft-knitted fabrics. The weft-knitted fabrics selected for the study were varied plain knit, 1 × 1 <b>rib,</b> <b>Milano,</b> and interlock. The fabric layers were stitched together with Kevlar yarns. These 3 D stitched preforms were impregnated with polyester resin using resin transfer molding, and the corresponding composites obtained were tested under tensile, bending, and impact loads. The results obtained show {{that the type of}} knitted structure significantly influences the mechanical performance of the 3 D stitched woven-knitted composites. The composite using interlock structure as the inner layers has the best results concerning energy absorption and tensile strength. The varied plain knit structure has proved to be the best suited to impart stiffness as it provides the highest Young’s modulus among the above four knitted structures.
