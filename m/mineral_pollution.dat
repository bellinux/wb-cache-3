For this purpose, a computer program linking a linear program, a stochastic pig growth model and a genetic algorithm (GA) was developed. The objective function to be maximised by the GA is the weighted difference of gross margin and nitrogen excretion cost. Simulations were conducted to investigate how different pig genotypes (fat, normal, lean) and different relative economic weighting of gross margin (1) and nitrogen excretion (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 or 120) affect the nitrogen excretion and profitability under practical or GA optimised feeding strategies in Switzerland. In all the cases investigated, nitrogen excretion is reduced and profitability increased when the pigs are from a leaner genotype. Across all genotypes a 45 % reduction in nitrogen excretion can be achieved with only a 3. 5 % drop in profitability when diets designed to maximise profitability and minimise nitrogen excretion are fed. The maximal nitrogen retentions observed were 44. 9 %, 52. 6 % and 57 % for the fat, normal and lean genotypes respectively.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried on Lake Giwa (100. 8 ha, 9. 4 m), in the {{drainage}} basin of the Giwa and Pasêka rivers. The data {{obtained in the}} study allowed the authors to classify Lake Giwa as a water body belonging to the third stability degree according to PATALAS (1960). As evidenced in the study, Lake Giwa is a highly eutrophic reservoir. The lake waters were characterized by a high content of nutrients, up to 1. 40 mg P⋅dm– 3 and 12. 47 mg N⋅dm– 3. The high fertility of the lake was also exhibited by the values of BOD 5 reaching 7 mg O 2 ⋅dm– 3, chlorophyll a content (73 mg⋅m– 3) and low transparency – 0. 7 m. In {{the peak of the}} summer, the stagnation oxygen profile is represented by a clinograde curve typical for eutrophic lakes, while carbon dioxide distribution in the water column is shown by a „reverse ” clinograde curve, also typical for fertile reservoirs.

40|$|Rhizophora mangle, red mangrove, is {{the basis}} for an {{essential}} ecosystem found throughout South Florida. Red mangroves provide habitats, nursery areas, shoreline protection, and runoff treatment which are enormously beneficial to the environment. The recruitment of red mangroves is an important aspect of their ecology. Red mangroves are often recruited to a specific area for a variety of reasons, relating to the characteristics and dispersion of their propagules, as well as outside factors. Propagule anatomy, growth and developmental stages, chemical make-up of propagules, and required nutrients of propagules have profound effects on the ability of a mangrove propagule to grow into a mature tree. These propagules must reach adulthood to keep the mangrove ecosystem flourishing. An outside factor which affects recruitment of red mangroves is physical. Physical influences can include such things as tides, waves, currents, temperature, sedimentation, hydrology, and storms. Another outside effect on mangrove ecology is chemical. Salinity, nutrients, <b>minerals,</b> and <b>pollution</b> affect the growth and development of the propagules. The final and most important outside effect is human influence. Pollution and human disturbances have profound effects on recruitment of all species of mangroves. Since numerous factors influence how mangroves propagate, grow and develop to maturity, and since few studies address this particular aspect of mangrove ecology, this field and literature study was undertaken. Additionally, as a result of urbanization and industrialization, mitigation projects are in demand to compensate for impacts of development, and mangrove culture from propagules is often used in south Florida coastal projects. Besides obtaining and analyzing data on mangrove propagation this paper will address potential uses in mitigation, anticipating that an artificial mangrove ecosystem may provide values similar to those which occur naturally...|$|R

Spectral aerosol optical depth (tau) and single scattering albedo (omega (sub 0)) from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements are used to form absorption [i. e., omega (sub 0) and absorption Angstrom exponent (alpha(sub abs)) ] and size [i. e., extinction Angstrom exponent (alpha(sub ext)) and fine mode fraction of tau] relationships to infer dominant aerosol types. Using the long-term AERONET data set (1999 - 2010), 19 sites are grouped by aerosol type based on known source regions to: (1) determine the average omega (sub 0) and alpha(sub abs) at each site (expanding upon previous work); (2) perform a sensitivity study on alpha(sub abs) by varying the spectral omega (sub 0); and (3) test the ability of each absorption and size relationship to distinguish aerosol types. The spectral omega (sub 0) averages indicate slightly more aerosol absorption (i. e., a 0. 0 < delta omega (sub 0) <= 0. 02 decrease) than in previous work and optical mixtures of pollution and smoke with dust show stronger absorption than dust alone. Frequency distributions of alpha(sub abs) show significant overlap among aerosol type categories and at least 10 % of the alpha(sub abs) retrievals in each category are below 1. 0. Perturbing the spectral omega (sub 0) by +/- 0. 03 induces significant alpha(sub abs) changes from the unperturbed value by at least approx. +/- 0. 6 for Dust, approx. +/- 0. 2 for Mixed, and approx. +/- 0. 1 for Urban/Industrial and Biomass Burning.

This observation is relevant for several other fields (agriculture, transport, industry…), notably when technology is playing an increasing role [18]. Consequently, there is a great risk that - by keeping research on the same tracks - breakthroughs and innovative issues are missed out [19 – 21]. Multi- or interdisciplinary research is then necessary as it facilitates the pooling of approaches, not just in terms of scientific knowledge, but also in terms of “thought systems” [22, 23]. Images or mental representations of the sea should also be taken into account, because they influence human behaviors on the scale of hundreds of millions of people, in a variety of activities like seaside tourism or seafood consumption [24].|$|R
40|$|Three cloud data sets, each {{covering}} {{four months}} of observations, were recently recorded with a lidar at Punta Arenas (° 53 S), Chile, at Stellenbosch (34 S, near Cape Town), South Africa, and aboard the research vessel Polarstern during three north-south cruises. By comparing these observations with an 11 -year cloud data set measured with a lidar at Leipzig (° 51 N), Germany, the occurrence of heterogeneous ice formation (as a function of cloud top temperature) for very different aerosol conditions in {{the northern and southern}} hemisphere is investigated. Large differences in the heterogeneous freezing behavior in the mostly layered clouds are found. For example, < 20 %, 30 %- 40 % and around 70 % of the cloud layers with cloud top temperatures from- 15 °C to- 20 °C, showed ice formation over Punta Arenas, Stellenbosch, and Leipzig, respectively. The observed strong contrast reflects the differences in the free tropospheric aerosol conditions at northern midlatitudes, that are controlled by anthropogenic <b>pollution,</b> <b>mineral</b> dust, forest fire smoke, terrestrial biological material and high southern midlatitudes with clean marine conditions.

40|$|Since 1986 the {{municipal}} solid wastes {{produced by the}} city of Casablanca are stockpiled in a landfill installed on old quarries located 10 km out of the city’s periphery. The bottom of the landfill consisted on fractured quartzite, which is not sealed off before it’s starting up. The aquifer thus risks contamination by the leachate. Indeed, four years later, a study detected the beginning of groundwater’s downstream pollution from the landfill, with reduced extension. During the actual study, a hydro-chemical campaign was carried out, on 2001. Groundwater was collected on aquifer wells upstream and downstream the landfill. The results showed an important disparity concerning the measured parameters. In addition, water of a certain number of wells meets no more neither the drinking water supply standards nor the irrigation standards. The analysis of these campaigns permitted to distinguish the contaminated wells from those that are not. Then, plumes of <b>mineral</b> and organic <b>pollution</b> are delineated. The comparison of the last results with the ones determined by the 1990 study showed an advance of the pollution plume towards the city, through a zone of agricultural vocation, according to the faults affecting the fractured aquifer matrix...|$|R
