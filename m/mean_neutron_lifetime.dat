40|$|The precise {{value of}} the <b>mean</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>lifetime,</b> τ_n, plays an {{important}} role in nuclear and particle physics and cosmology. It is a key input for predicting the ratio of protons to helium atoms in the primordial universe and is used to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. There is a 3. 9 standard deviation discrepancy between τ_n measured by counting the decay rate of free neutrons in a beam (887. 7 ± 2. 2 s) and by counting surviving ultracold neutrons stored for different holding times in a material trap (878. 5 ± 0. 8 s). The experiment described here eliminates loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold neutrons above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored neutrons do not interact with material trap walls and neutrons in quasi-stable orbits rapidly exit the trap. As a result of this approach and the use of a new in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here (877. 7 ± 0. 7 (stat) + 0. 3 /- 0. 1 (sys) s) is the first measurement of τ_n that does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.

Neutral and charged particle traps are widely used tool for studying both composite and elementary particles, because they allow long interaction times and isolation from perturbing environments. Here we report the magnetic trapping of neutrons. The trapping region is filled with superfluid 4 -He, which is used to load neutrons into the trap and as a scintillator to detect their decay. <b>Neutrons</b> have a <b>lifetime</b> in the trap of 750 + 330 /- 200 seconds, mainly limited by their beta decay rather than trap losses. Our experiment verifies theoretical predictions regarding the loading process and magnetic trapping of neutrons. Further refinement of this method should lead to improved precision in the <b>neutron</b> <b>lifetime</b> measurement...|$|R
