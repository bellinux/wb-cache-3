500|$|According to Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, Murdoch told Captain Smith {{that he was}} {{attempting}} to [...] "hard-a-port around [...] ", suggesting that he {{was attempting}} a [...] "port around" [...] manoeuvre– to first swing the bow around the obstacle, then swing the stern so that {{both ends of the}} ship would avoid a collision. There was a delay before either order went into effect; the steam-powered steering mechanism took up to 30seconds to turn the ship's tiller, and the complex task of setting the engines into reverse would also have taken some time to accomplish. Because the centre turbine could not be reversed, both it and the centre propeller, positioned {{directly in front of the}} ship's rudder, were simply stopped. This reduced the rudder's effectiveness, therefore impairing the turning ability of the ship. Had Murdoch simply turned the ship while maintaining her forward speed, Titanic <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> the iceberg with feet to spare.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} several years Heyer {{published}} one romance novel and one thriller each year. The romances were far more popular: they usually sold 115,000copies, while her thrillers sold 16,000copies. According to her son, Heyer [...] "regarded the writing of mystery stories rather as we would regard tackling a crossword puzzle – an intellectual diversion before the harder tasks of life have to be faced". Heyer's husband was involved in much of her writing. He often read the proofs of her historical romances to catch any errors that she <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed,</b> and served as a collaborator for her thrillers. He provided the plots of the detective stories, describing the actions of characters [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B". Heyer would then create the characters and the relationships between them and bring the plot points to life. She found it difficult at times to rely on someone else's plots; on at least one occasion, before writing the last chapter of a book, she asked Rougier to explain once again how the murder was really committed.|$|E
500|$|Owen's mother, Narcissa Chisholm Owen (1831–1911), {{was part}} Cherokee. She {{did much to}} foster her son's career, as well as {{becoming}} a distinguished painter. In 1907 she published memoirs about her life lived between Cherokee and mainstream U.S. societies, which have more recently attracted scholarly attention when republished in a critical edition in 2005. However, the precise extent of her (and thus his) Cherokee ancestry is unclear. Owen's listing on the Dawes Rolls, dating from around 1900, records him as 1/16th Cherokee by blood. However, Narcissa's Memoirs (1907), self-describe her as 1/16th Cherokee, which if correct would imply that her son was 1/32nd Cherokee. Some secondary sources describe Narcissa as 1/8th Cherokee The modern editor of Narcissa's memoirs speculates that Narcissa <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> [...] "one generation or possibly two" [...] in her family tree; adjusting for this possibility might further dilute her Cherokee blood. However, Narcissa had been raised among Cherokees, and skillfully used her Cherokee heritage, colorfully describing her father, Thomas Chisholm (a leader of the [...] "Old Settlers" [...] who moved west before the Trail of Tears), as [...] "the last hereditary war chief of the Western Cherokees." [...] Narcissa also gave both her sons parallel Indian names derived from famous Cherokee chiefs: she named Robert Oconostota after a noted Cherokee chief of {{the late eighteenth century}} who was also, she claimed, her own great great uncle.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the score}} they were chasing seemed daunting, England set about their innings in a {{sensible}} fashion, {{and although they}} lost Graham Gooch and Chris Broad before lunch, Allan Lamb and Kim Barnett set about building a solid partnership of 184, before Barnett was adjudged LBW for 80, replays suggested that the ball from [...] Terry Alderman <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> leg stump.|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm Not Over You" [...] (written by Steve Hurley, Jamie Principle, and M-Doc) <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> {{the highest}} {{position}} of the US Dance chart, but only by about one point (at No. 2), and the single was later classified in the overall Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart as the ninth most successful track of 1994 (leaving [...] "I'm in the Mood" [...] far behind, at #44). However, although the song had sealed the Top 10 of the US R chart, it {{did not succeed in}} the Hot 100 that much, failing to crack Top 40 (No. 41). Considering that expectations of A Records company must have been bigger than a club play sale of Peniston's singles, [...] "I'm Not Over You" [...] was released in UK only on B-side of the [...] "Hit by Love" [...] release.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this game}} from the 1978 World Championship between Victor Korchnoi and Anatoly Karpov, White's pawn {{is the wrong}} rook pawn. [...] White went on to [...] the black b-pawn on move 107, {{but was unable to}} force the black king far enough away from the a8-square to get to a winning position. [...] The game ended in an {{intentional}} stalemate on move 124 (see Stalemate#Korchnoi versus Karpov for the final position). [...] Some commentators thought that Korchnoi <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> a win in this endgame, but Karpov defended well and White never had a theoretically won position. [...] (However, Korchnoi did miss a win earlier in the game.) [...] Black's pawn on b5 is actually a liability. [...] If the black king is forced into a position where he cannot move, Black would have to move the pawn and White would win the game. [...] As of 2008, this is the longest game of a world championship , [...] [...] (Karpov retained his title by a score of six wins to five.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Once {{his knee}} had recovered, Mortaza {{suffered}} another setback {{when he was}} prevented playing against New Zealand in February 2010 due to a fever. Mortaza made his comeback from injury in a match for Bangladesh Cricket Board XI against England during their tour of Bangladesh. Following the match, he commented {{that he had no}} interest in regaining the captaincy as in his opinion Shakib Al Hasan had done a good job. He also said that if his injury problems persisted he would contemplate retiring from Test cricket to focus on ODIs and T20s, similar to fellow fast bowlers Shane Bond, Shaun Tait, Andrew Flintoff, and Brett Lee. Mortaza declined to play in the Test series to avoid aggravating his knee injury, but played only the first out of the three ODIs against England before withdrawing from Bangladesh's squad {{as he was about to}} be dropped. Bangladesh lost the one match Mortaza played in, and the captain criticised his bowling. Shakib Al Hasan said [...] "The way Mashrafe bowled before his injury, that Mashrafe we <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> tonight. But the way he bowled in the last match and the practice match, not really. He needs some time to get back to full confidence and rhythm. He needs to play some games and get match-fit again." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{was a brief}} silence, {{during which}} Crawshay {{discussed}} the subject of inoculation for colds {{in the head with}} his neighbour on the other side, and the doctor showed a very formidable capacity for making up for any meals which he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> by too rigid an attention to his patient.

60|$|I {{was soon}} on the road, {{nibbling}} a cake of chocolate and seriously occupied {{with a case}} of conscience. Was I to pay for my night's lodging?

60|$|Cameron's awakened {{interest}} {{brought home}} to him the realization that for years he had shunned companionship.

In his own driving passion to take his secret into the limitless abode of silence and desolation, where he could be alone with it, he had forgotten that life dealt shocks to other men. Somehow this silent comrade reminded him.|$|E

60|$|It struck Maitland, finally, that Miss Marlett {{was very}} slow about finding the {{despatch}}es. She had been absent quite {{a quarter of}} an hour.

60|$|Courtland {{would have}} preferred, and half looked for her company and {{commentary}} on this round of inspection, but he concealed his disappointment and descended.

6000|$|Now {{it is an}} interesting, but by {{no means}} {{surprising}} fact, that Cupid planted himself {{in the midst of this}} party, and, with his fat little legs, in imminent danger of capsizing the dishes, began to draw his bow and let fly his arrows right and left. Being an airy sprite, though fat, and not at any time particularly visible, a careless observer <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> seeing him; but to any one with moderate powers of observation, he was there, straddling across a dish of salad as plain as the salt-cellar before Captain Wopper's nose. His deadly shafts, too, were visibly quivering in the breasts of Lewis Stoutley, George Lawrence, and the mad artist. Particularly obvious were these shafts in the case of the last, who was addicted to gazing somewhat presumptuously on [...] "lovely woman" [...] in general, from what he styled an artistic point of view--never from any other point of view; of course not.|$|E

I could not think what had become of you; but when the men came pouring down again without their arms, and I heard them cursing and swearing because the sailors and the officers and all was found in readiness to receive them, it somehow came to my mind as that you was at the bottom of it--though how, I could not {{for the life of me}} make out, for I knew you had gone below when I did." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{four days}} the wind held, and they ran down Channel before it, {{hoping to catch}} sight of the Spaniard; but the San Antonio was a swift caravel of 250 tons with much canvas, for she carried four masts, and {{although}} the Margaret was also a good sailer, she had but two masts, and could {{not come up with}} her. Or, for anything they knew, they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> her on the seas. On the afternoon of the fourth day, when they were off the Lizard, and creeping along very slowly under a light breeze, the look-out man reported a ship lying becalmed ahead. Peter, who had the eyes of a hawk, climbed up the mast to look at her, and presently called down that he believed from her shape and rig she must be the caravel, though of this he could not be sure as he had never seen her. Then the captain, Smith, went up also, and a few minutes later returned saying that without doubt it was the San Antonio.|$|E
50|$|It was possible, {{investigators}} realized, that {{he could}} have changed his clothes in the bar or put on a hat and kept his head down, hiding his face from the camera.

He <b>might</b> <b>have</b> also left the building by another route. However, the building's only other exit, a service door not generally used by the public, opened at the time onto a construction site that officers believed would have been difficult to walk through while sober, much less intoxicated, as Brian likely was at the time.|$|R

30|$|Nurses {{in general}} wards play an {{important}} role as observers and reporters of ADRs. In the OPD their role is different, but it is still important, for they serve as connection between patients, physicians, and pharmacists.
