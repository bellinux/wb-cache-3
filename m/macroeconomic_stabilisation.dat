50|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} the development of national accounts and the systematic measurement of employment was the need for accurate measures of aggregate economic activity. This was made more pressing by the Great Depression and as a basis for Keynesian <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> policy and wartime economic planning. The first efforts to develop such measures were undertaken in the late 1920s and 1930s, notably by Colin Clark and Simon Kuznets. Richard Stone of the U.K. led later contributions during World War II and thereafter. The first formal national accounts were published by the United States in 1947. Many European countries followed shortly thereafter, and the United Nations published A System of National Accounts and Supporting Tables in 1952. International standards for national accounting are defined by the United Nations System of National Accounts, with the most recent version released for 2008.|$|E
50|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis {{that began to}} affect Indonesia in mid-1997 became an economic and political crisis. Indonesia's initial response was to float the rupiah, raise key domestic interest rates, and tighten fiscal policy. In October 1997, Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached agreement on an economic reform program aimed at <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> and elimination {{of some of the}} country's most damaging economic policies, such as the National Car Program and the clove monopoly, both involving family members of President Soeharto. The rupiah remained weak, however, and President Soeharto was forced to resign in May 1998. In August 1998, Indonesia and the IMF agreed on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) under President B.J Habibie that included significant structural reform targets. President Abdurrahman Wahid took office in October 1999, and Indonesia and the IMF signed another EFF in January 2000. The new program also has a range of economic, structural reform and governance targets.|$|E
40|$|Since 1980 many {{developing}} countries have adopted two major <b>macroeconomic</b> strategies: <b>Stabilisation</b> and Structural Adjustment. A generally held view regarding {{the impact of these}} macroeconomic strategies is that it led to unemployment, low investment, decline in real wages, capital flight, rise in inequality and poverty. All these resulted in deterioration in living conditions of the poor in the short run. 1 In some cases, the long run benefits, if any, of these programmes are sacrificed due to the high social costs in the short run. A number of studies, examining the impact of the observed macroeconomic impact of the Structural Adjustment Policies (StAP), report mixed impact on women. For example, on the one hand, Khan (1999) found an increasing trend in feminisation of agricultural labour 2, and feminisation of poverty 3 while Brown (1992), on the other hand, reports employment as a key factor in determining women’s empowerment and argues that some aspects of economic reforms hold for improvement in the long-run. The argument {{is based on the assumption}} that greater economic role for women offers protection and that employment itself mitigates against domestic violence. However, the overall effect of structural adjustment is difficult to measure as it varies across countries, across sectors, and across individuals within a household. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of monetary and fiscal policies' interaction on the financial stability of the eurozone. Based {{on the construction of}} a financial stability index for the entire euro area, we assess the impact in terms of the stability of different configurations of policy-mix using a static Keynesian model in a closed monetary union. Mainly following the nature of fiscal spillovers, we show that fiscal coordination may be useful {{to improve the quality of}} the European Monetary Union financial stabilisation. The explicit consideration by the European Central Bank of the aggregate euro area financial stability as one of its macroeconomic objectives makes the non-cooperative game efficient.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we develop}} a {{monetary}}-fiscal {{game in a}} monetary union with uncertainty due to imperfect transparency about the central bank's preferences. The objective is to investigate the macroeconomic effects of this uncertainty by explicitly {{taking into account the}} role of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We first consider the case of symmetric monetary transmission in the monetary union and show that if the transmission mechanism is not too strong, monetary uncertainty may be beneficial in terms of <b>macroeconomic</b> performances and <b>stabilisation.</b> We then allow for some transmission asymmetry among the member countries and show that the beneficial impact of monetary uncertainty is exacerbated for countries that are more sensitive to the common monetary policy. More importantly, our findings suggest that the central bank's communication about its preferences could represent a specific instrument to influence inflation expectations and thus macroeconomic outcomes in the member countries...|$|R

In this paper, I discuss the challenges involved in deploying fiscal policy in pursuit of a broad definition of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stabilisation.</b> The main policy conclusion is that pro-stabilisation fiscal policies {{are likely to be more}} effective if fiscal policy is determined under a formal fiscal framework that combines a set of fiscal rules and a substantive role for an independent fiscal policy council. fiscal council, fiscal rules, <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stabilisation...</b>|$|E

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crises have posed {{a challenge to}} the conduct of financial stability and monetary policy. The international debate mainly focused on the potential benefits of reducing procyclicality in financial intermediation in order to avoid boom and bust cycles in the supply of credit. We study the stabilisation benefits of macroprudential and monetary policy rules that react to indicators of financial imbalances. In particular, we contribute to an investigation of the benefits of dampening credit cycles and explore the effectiveness of alternative policy instruments, such as the interest rate and the loan-to-value ratio (LTV henceforth), for <b>macroeconomic</b> and financial <b>stabilisation.</b> Lambertini et al (2010) show that expectation of future macroeconomic developments can generate boom-bust cycles in housing prices and credit. 2 Housing-market cycles driven by expectations on future developments in the demand and supply of houses are characterised by boom-bust dynamics in both housing prices and housing investment. However, only expectations of a future reduction in the supply of houses also generate boom-bust cycles in all aggregate quantities such as output, consumption and investment, as in the data. 3 Relying on a model that allows for macroeconomic booms and busts driven by expectation...|$|R

40|$|Estonia {{has made}} {{significant}} progress in the liberalisation {{of the economy and}} in <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> during the last years of economic transition. Tight monetary and fiscal policies have been the main factors of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stabilisation,</b> and there are some important signs concerning the early stages of economic recovery. Some precautionary remarks include: a rapidly increasing trade balance deficit, high inflation, problems with collecting budgetary revenue, tax avoidance (and great tax arrears), the deepening of economic inequality, and increased political pressure by various interest groups to change successful economic policies. The currency board system with a pegged exchange rate regime is the corners tone of Estonian monetary policy. Some empirical results of the Estonian commercial banking systems performance is analysed and presented in the paper. For example, there was an overall decline in market-determined interest rates and the interest rate spread decreased substantially over the last year. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{spillover}} sizes and signs and the institutional {{design of the}} co-ordination of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> policies within the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Moreover, in a dynamic setup, {{the consequences of this}} institutional design on macroeconomic outcomes and policies are analysed. We distinguish two types of co-ordination: ex-ante - related to the institutional framework; and ex-post concerning the actual policy decisions. The first type is modeled as the result of an endogenous coalition formation process that leads to the formation of policymakers’ coalitions. Ex-post co-ordination implies then the implementation by each coalition of its internally coordinated <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> policies in a non-cooperative dynamic game with the other coalitions, and subject to the constraints of the internal dynamics of the EMU economy. The paper shows that the institutional setting of macroeconomic policy co-ordination is of crucial importance in reaching the Pareto-optimal equilibrium of the game, especially when the number and the magnitude of asymmetries increase. The specific recommendations depend on the particular characteristics of the shocks and the economic structure. In the case of a common shock, fiscal co-ordination is counterproductive but full policy co-ordination is desirable. When asymmetric shocks are considered, fiscal co-ordination improves the performance but full policy co-ordination doesn’t produce further gains in policymakers’ welfare. In general, structural asymmetries reduce the gains from co-operation so that in many cases co-operation cannot be supported without introduction of exogenous factors, e. g. a transfer system. <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>stabilisation,</b> EMU, Coalition formation, Linear quadratic differential games...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a lively debate among {{scholars}} about the feasibility and desirability of fiscal federalism in the European Union (EU). The paper addresses {{the question of whether}} ‘conventional fiscal federalism ’ is feasible in the EU, considering the distinctiveness of European integration and the political-economic template of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). It is an attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} economics and political science by adding the political conditions that might create difficulties to the economics’ rationale. Starting from the conceptual instruments used (fiscal federalism, centralisation and decentralisation) the paper highlights how fiscal federalism is multi-faceted concept embracing both a centralisation and a decentralisation outcome. Borrowing the Musgravian classification of allocation-equity-stabilisation, the EU is examined as far as redistribution and <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> are concerned. The aim is to conclude whether centralisation or decentralisation is the prevailing outcome for both functions.
