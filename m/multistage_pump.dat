Sixteen impellers are designed based on the quadratic regression orthogonal test, which have three factors including impeller outlet slope, impeller blade outlet stagger angle, and impeller blade outlet width. Through quadratic regression equation, the function relationship between efficiency values and three factors is established. The optimal combination of geometric parameters is found through the analysis of the regression equation. To further study the influence of blade thickness on the performance of <b>multistage</b> <b>pump,</b> numerical simulations of <b>multistage</b> <b>pump</b> with different blade thicknesses are carried out.

40|$|Background: Efficiency {{of a water}} {{management}} and irrigation control system is important for improved production and quality of crops. Electronic valve {{is one of the}} most important components for the irrigation management system, and the performance is characterized by the flow-pressure relationships. In the study, a test bench was developed to test electronic valves for irrigation management systems. Methods: A <b>multistage</b> <b>pump</b> (Model: DRL 10 - 8; DOOCH, Korea), flow rate sensors (Model: E-MAG-I, AUTOFLOW, Korea), and pressure sensors (Model: A- 10; WIKA, Germany) were used to construct the test bench. A control program was coded to control the pump operation. The flow rate was set at four different levels (20, 40, 60, 80 m 3 /h) using the <b>multistage</b> <b>pump.</b> Flow rate and pressure sensors were installed before and after the test electric valve. Data were collected through a wireless sensor network. The electric valve was controlled remotely by the software developed using C # (visual studio 2010, USA). Results& discussion: The experimental results showed that the error ranges were 2 % at 20 m 3 /h and 7 % at 80 m 3 /h. We found that the flow rate within 20 ~ 80 m 3 /h and the pressure loss within 2 ~ 10 bar measured before and after the electric valve were linearly plotted. The pressure decreased 10 % before and after the solenoid valve. The delay time need to be considered for stable flow control. To solve this problem, relief valve was installed to remove the flow rate exceeding the specified value.
