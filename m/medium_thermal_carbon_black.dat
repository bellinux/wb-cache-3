Pure component adsorption isotherms on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> are first characterized with the GCMC method, and then mixture simulations are carried out over a wide range of pore width, temperature, pressure and composition to investigate the cooperative and competitive adsorption of all species in the mixture. Results of mixture simulations are compared with the experimental data of ethylene and ethane (Friederich and Mullins, 1972) on Sterling FTG-D 5 (homogeneous <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> having a BET surface area of 13 m(2) /g) at 298 K and a pressure range of 1. 3 - 93 kPa.

40|$|The {{performance}} of intermolecular potential models on the adsorption of benzene on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> at various temperatures is investigated. Two models contain only dispersive sites, {{whereas the other}} two models account explicitly for the dispersive and electrostatic sites. Using numerous data {{in the literature on}} benzene adsorption on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> at various temperatures, we have found that the effect of surface mediation on interaction between adsorbed benzene molecules must be accounted for to describe correctly the adsorption isotherm as well as the isosteric heat. Among the two models with partial charges tested, the WSKS model of Wick et at. I that has only six dispersive sites and three discrete partial charges is better than the very expensive all-atom model of Jorgensen and Severance. (2) Adsorbed benzene molecules on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> have a complex orientation with respect to distance from the surface and also with respect to loading. At low loadings, they adopt the parallel configuration relative to the graphene surface, whereas at higher loadings (still less than monolayer coverage) some molecules adopt a slant orientation to maximize the fluid-fluid interaction. For loadings in the multilayer region, the orientation of molecules in the first layer is influenced by the presence of molecules in the second layer. The data that are used in this article come from the work of Isirikyan and Kiselev,(3) Pierotti and Smallwood,(4) Pierce and Ewing,(5) Belyakova, Kiselev, and Kovaleva,(6) and Carrott et al.

40|$|Adsorption of {{ethylene}} and ethane on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> and in slit pores whose {{walls are}} composed of graphene layers is studied in detail to investigate the packing efficiency, the two-dimensional critical temperature, and the variation of the isosteric heat of adsorption with loading and temperature. Here we used a Monte Carlo simulation method with a grand canonical Monte Carlo ensemble. A number of two-center Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential models are investigated to study {{the impact of the}} choice of potential models in the description of adsorption behavior. We chose two 2 C-LJ potential models in our investigation of the (i) UA-TraPPE-LJ model of Martin and Siepmann (J. Phys. Chem. B 1998, 102, 25692577) for ethane and Wick et al. (J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 8008 - 8016) for ethylene and (ii) AUA 4 -LJ model of Ungerer et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2000, 112, 5499 - 5510) for ethane and Bourasseau et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2003, 118, 3020 - 3034) for ethylene. These models are used to study the adsorption of ethane and ethylene on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> It is found that the solid-fluid binary interaction parameter is a function of adsorbate and temperature, and the adsorption isotherms and heat of adsorption are well described by both the UA-TraPPE and AUA models, although the UA-TraPPE model performs slightly better. However, the local distributions predicted by these two models are slightly different. These two models are used to explore the two-dimensional condensation for the graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> and these values are 110 K for ethylene and 120 K for ethane...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the solid surface on the fluid-fluid intermolecular potential energy. This modified fluid-fluid interaction energy due to the inducement of a solid surface is used in the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation of various noble gases, nitrogen, and methane on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> This effect is such that the effective interaction potential energy between two particles close to surface is less than the potential energy if the solid substrate is not present. With this modification the GCMC simulation results agree extremely well with the experimental data over a wide range of pressures while the simulation results with the unmodified potential energy give rise to a shoulder near the neighborhood of monolayer coverage and the significant overprediction of the second and higher layer coverages. In particular the unmodified GCMC results exhibit very sharp change in those higher layers while the experimental data have a much gradual change in the uptake.

40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) and {{adsorption}} of ethylene on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> and in slit pores whose walls {{are composed of}} graphene layers. Simple models of a one-center Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential and a two-center united atom (UA) -LJ potential are investigated to study {{the impact of the}} choice of potential models in the description of VLE and adsorption behavior. Here, we used a Monte Carlo simulation method with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo ensembles. The one-center potential model cannot describe adequately the VLE over the practical range of temperature from the triple point to the critical point. On the other hand, the two-center potential model (Wick et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 8008 - 8016) performs well in the description of VLE (saturated vapor and liquid densities and vapor pressure) over the wide range of temperature. This UA-LJ model is then used in the study of adsorption of ethylene on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> and in slit pores. Agreement between the GCMC simulation results and the experimental data on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> for moderate temperatures is excellent, demonstrating that the potential of the GCMC method and the proper choice of potential model are essential to investigate adsorption. For slit pores of various sizes, we have found that the behavior of ethylene exhibits a number of features that are not manifested in the study of spherical LJ particles. In particular, the singlet density distribution versus distance across the pore and the angle between the molecular axis and the z direction provide rich information about the way molecules arrange themselves when the pore width is varied. Such an arrangement {{has been found to be}} very sensitive to the pore width...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of Lennard-Jones fluids (argon and nitrogen) onto a graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> {{surface was}} studied with a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation (GCMC). The surface {{was assumed to}} be finite in length and composed of three graphene layers. When the GCMC simulation was used to describe adsorption on a graphite surface, an over-prediction of the isotherm was consistently observed in the pressure regions where the first and second layers are formed. To remove this over-prediction, surface mediation was accounted for to reduce the fluid-fluid interaction. Do and co-workers have introduced the so-called surface-mediation damping factor to correct the over-prediction for the case of a graphite surface of infinite extent, and this approach has yielded a good description of the adsorption isotherm. In this paper, the effects of the finite size of the graphene layer on the adsorption isotherm and how these would affect the extent of the surface mediation were studied. It was found that this finite-surface model provides a better description of the experimental data for graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> of high surface area (i. e. small crystallite size) while the infinite- surface model describes data for <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> of very low surface area (i. e. large crystallite size) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{quadrupole}} {{moment of}} carbon {{atoms in the}} graphite layer has a surface mediation effect on the adsorption of simple gases on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> Basically, the graphite surface exerts an electric field in the volume space above the surface, inducing a dipole moment on every particle above the surface. The dipole moment in each particle is modelled with the Drude oscillator model. Because of polarization, the dipole-dipole interaction gives lower intermolecular potential energy between adsorbed particles. As a result the adsorption isotherm in the region where monolayer is being completed is lower than that if this effect of induced dipole is neglected. This phenomenon of reduction in the intermolecular interaction has been tested against the experimental data of argon on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> and the agreement between our model and the data is excellent. We also tested the surface defect (geometrical factor) as a possible reason for surface mediation, but the results fail to agree with experimental data, lending support {{to the possibility of}} surface electric effect as the principal reason for the surface mediation.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to an {{investigation}} of the effects of surface structure (structure-less or structured) on the description of the adsorption isotherm and the isosteric heat of nitrogen and argon adsorption onto graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> It was found that the surface structure had little effect on the adsorption of either argon or nitrogen at 77 K and 87. 3 K. The variation of the monolayer coverage concentration was also investigated as well as the concentrations of higher layers as a function of pressure and temperature. Finally, the commonly used values for the molecular projection area of nitrogen and argon for graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> (16. 2 angstrom(2) and 13. 8 angstrom) were revisited. For this material, a value of 15. 5 angstrom(2) is recommended for nitrogen at 77 K, while for the case of argon at the same temperature the recommended values of 13. 8 angstrom(2) and 12. 94 angstrom(2) are suggested for the reduced pressure range (0. 1 - 0. 2 P/P- 0) and (0. 25 - 0. 35 P/P- 0), respectively.

40|$|Adsorption of pure nitrogen, argon, acetone, {{chloroform}} and acetone-chloroform {{mixture on}} graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> is considered at sub-critical conditions {{by means of}} molecular layer structure theory (MLST). In the present version of the MLST an adsorbed fluid is considered as a sequence of 2 D molecular layers, whose Helmholtz free energies are obtained directly from the analysis of experimental adsorption isotherm of pure components. The interaction of the nearest layers is accounted for {{in the framework of}} mean field approximation. This approach allows quantitative correlating of experimental nitrogen and argon adsorption isotherm both in the monolayer region and in the range of multi-layer coverage up to 10 molecular layers. In the case of acetone and chloroform the approach also leads to excellent quantitative correlation of adsorption isotherms, while molecular approaches such as the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) fail to describe those isotherms. We extend our new method to calculate the Helmholtz free energy of an adsorbed mixture using a simple mixing rule, and this allows us to predict mixture adsorption isotherms from pure component adsorption isotherms. The approach, which accounts for the difference in composition in different molecular layers, is tested against the experimental data of acetone-chloroform mixture (non-ideal mixture) adsorption on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> at 50 degrees C.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} various potential models {{in the description of}} vapor–liquid equilibria (VLE) and adsorption of simple gases on highly graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> It is found that some potential models proposed in the literature are not suitable for the description of VLE (saturated gas and liquid densities and the vapor pressure with temperature). Simple gases, such as neon, argon, krypton, xenon, nitrogen, and methane are studied in this paper. To describe the isotherms on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> correctly, the surface mediation damping factor introduced in our recent publication should be used to calculate correctly the fluid–fluid interaction energy between particles close to the surface. It is found that the damping constant for the noble gases family is linearly dependent on the polarizability, suggesting that the electric field of the graphite surface has a direct induction effect on the induced dipole of these molecules. As a result of this polarization by the graphite surface, the fluid–fluid interaction energy is reduced whenever two particles are near the surface. In the case of methane, we found that the damping constant is less than that of a noble gas having the similar polarizability, while in the case of nitrogen the damping factor is much greater and this could most likely be due to the quadrupolar nature of nitrogen...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} three intermolecular potential models (TraPPE, HMT and 5 -Charge) on the adsorption of carbon dioxide on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> at various temperatures. All models have three dispersive interaction sites, which coincide with the centers of the three atoms of carbon dioxide. To account for the quadrupole, the first two models have three discrete charges, while the other has five discrete charges to reproduce not only the quadrupole moment, but also the higher moments. Simulation results obtained from the GCMC are tested against experimental data of adsorption of carbon dioxide on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> at 193 K [R. A. Beebe, A. V. Kiselev, N. Kovaleva, R. Tyson, J. Holmes, Adsorption and state of carbon dioxide, sulfur hexafluoride and ammonia on a graphitized carbon surface. I. Adsorption isotherms. Russian J. Phys. Chem. 38 (1964) 372 – 378. ] and 273 K [A. Guillot, F. Stoeckli, Reference isotherm for high pressure adsorption of CO 2 by carbons at 273 K, Carbon 39 (2001) 2059 – 2064. ]. Very low pressure data for carbon dioxide of Myers and Prausnitz [A. Myers, J. Prausnitz, Hindered rotation in physical adsorption. Trans. Farad. Soc. 61 (1965) 755 – 764. ] at various temperatures are also tested. In general, the adsorption isotherms are well described by the TraPPE model, while the isosteric heat is only reasonably described. The HMT under-predicts the data while the 5 -Charge model over-predicts it. In the case of Guillot and Stoeckli data, the agreement between the simulation results and the data is substantially better if the charges of the carbon dioxide molecules are increased by 8 % whenever the particles are within the first layer.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} surface mediation on the adsorption behavior of argon at different temperatures on homogeneous graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> and on heterogeneous nongraphitized <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> surface. The grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation is used to study the adsorption, and its performance is tested against a number of experimental data on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> (which {{is known to be}} highly homogeneous) that are available in the literature. The surface-mediation effect is shown to be essential in the correct description of the adsorption isotherm because without accounting for that effect the GCMC simulation results are always greater than the experimental data in the region where the monolayer is being completed. This is due to the overestimation of the fluid–fluid interaction between particles in the first layer close to the solid surface. It is the surface mediation that reduces this fluid–fluid interaction in the adsorbed layers, and therefore the GCMC simulation results accounting for this surface mediation that are presented in this paper result in a better description of the data. This surface mediation having been determined, the surface excess of argon on heterogeneous carbon surfaces having solid–fluid interaction energies different from the graphite can be readily obtained. Since the real heterogeneous carbon surface {{is not the same as}} the homogeneous graphite surface, it can be described by an area distribution in terms of the well depth of the solid–fluid energy. Assuming a patchwise topology of the surface with patches of uniform well depth of solid–fluid interaction, the adsorption on a real carbon surface can be determined as an integral of the local surface excess of each patch with respect to the differential area. When this is matched against the experimental data of a carbon surface, we can derive the area distribution versus energy and hence the geometrical surface area. This new approach will be illustrated with the adsorption of argon on a nongraphitized carbon at 87. 3 and 77 K, and it is found that the GCMC surface area is different from the BET surface area by about 7 %. Furthermore, the description of the isotherm in the region of BET validity of 0. 06 to 0. 2 is much better with our method than with the BET equation...|$|R

Instead of being calculated from some standard equations, such as the 10 - 4 - 3 Steele equation, the solid-fluid potential is obtained experimentally from adsorption isotherms and it {{was found to be}} a fast decaying function that becomes negligibly small at a distance of about two collision diameters from the surface. The model presented in this paper implicitly accounts for the energetic heterogeneity of the disordered graphite surface and yet it retains the simplicity of the conventional NLDFT as applied to graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> The approach may be further extended to slit pores whose walls are non-graphitized surface, and such an approach will raise questions on the conventional approach where pore walls are assumed to behave like a graphite surface...|$|R

The heat at zero loading is associated with the interaction between an adsorbate and the functional group. The variation in the heat with loading is due to a combination two effects: (1) Saturation of the functional groups by adsorbate molecules. (2) Adsorption at the convex boundary of the clusters, resulting in a lower number of neighbours for each new molecule adsorbed onto the clusters compared to the bulk liquid. The isosteric heat versus loading reaches a minimum and then increases again as the number of interactions with neighbouring molecules increases, and finally reaches the heat of liquefaction when the very large clusters approach liquid-like behaviour...|$|R

Mixtures of these components with nitrogen and argon are also studied. Nitrogen is modeled a two-site plus discrete charges while argon as a spherical particle.

By this we study two models, one is the fully flexible molecular model in which n-alkane is subject to bending and torsion, while the other is the rigid molecular model in which all carbon atoms reside on the same plane. It is found that (i) the adsorption isotherm results of these two models are close to each other, suggesting that n-alkane model behaves mostly as rigid molecules with respect to adsorption although the isotherm for longer chain n-hexane is better described by the flexible molecular model (ii) the isotherms agree very well with the experimental data at least up to two layers on the surface...|$|R

The samples {{were characterized by}} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, gas adsorption, and electrophoretic mobility measurement; the enzymatic activity of catalase adsorbed on the <b>carbons</b> <b>blacks</b> was also examined. No significant variation of texture was produced by oxidation. The oxygen surface concentration increased {{as a function of}} the H 2 O 2 concentration up to 0. 8 M, and tended to decrease above this concentration; this is attributed to the competition between surface modification and release of products of oxidation. The surface was found to be more negative as the oxygen concentration increased. The specific activity of catalase adsorbed (degree of coverage about 0. 5 %) on non-oxidized carbon is much lower that the specific activity of dissolved catalase, indicating a modification of the enzyme conformation in the adsorbed slate. The activity increases with the oxygen surface concentration; this is attributed to a weaker interaction with the surface, due to its lower hydrophobicity, or a stronger contribution of electrostatic repulsion. Catalase activity measurements appear as a promising way to probe carbon surface properties...|$|R

This contrasts with their report of a linear increase in isosteric heat for propane, a similar molecule to propylene. In this paper, we report extensive Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and a high-resolution {{experimental study}} of propylene adsorption on Carbopack F, a highly graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> over the same temperature range studied by Bezus et al. From this combined simulation and experimental study we conclude that propylene also shows a linear increase in the isosteric heat versus loading in the sub-monolayer region, indicating that the linear increase in the fluid-fluid interaction in this region more than compensates for the decrease in the solid-fluid interaction that results from the change in orientation of the adsorbate molecules. Our study contradicts the propylene results of Bezus et al., and careful inspection of their isotherm in the sub-monolayer region shows {{that it does not}} follow Henry 2 ̆ 7 s law.

This effect arises from the lower effective interaction potential energy between two particles close to the surface compared to the potential energy of the same two particles when they are far away from the surface. A simple equation is proposed to calculate the reduction factor and this is used in the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation of nitrogen adsorption on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> With this modification, the GCMC simulation results agree extremely well with the experimental data over a wide range of pressure; the simulation results with the original potential energy (i. e. no surface mediation) give rise to a shoulder in the neighbourhood of monolayer coverage and a significant over-prediction of the second and higher layer coverages. The influence of this surface mediation on the dependence of the pore-filling pressure on the pore width is also studied. It is shown that such surface mediation has a significant effect on the pore-filling pressure.

Analysis of the complete adsorption isotherm over a wider range of pressure yields information on the monolayer coverage concentration and the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction energy. Among the various equations tested, the Hill-de Boer equation accounting for BET-postulated multilayer formation describes well the adsorption isotherms of all adsorbates. On average, the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction energy in the adsorbed phase is less than that in the bulk phase, suggesting that the distance between adsorbed molecules in the first layer of the adsorbed phase is slightly less than the equilibrium distance between two adsorbate molecules in the bulk phase. This suggests that the first layer is in a compressed state, which is due to the attraction of the adsorbent surface. The monolayer concentration as determined from the fitting of the Hill-de Boer equation with experimental data is slightly larger than the values calculated from the molecular projection area, suggesting that molecules can be oriented such that a larger number of molecules can be accommodated on the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> surface.

Isotherms at temperatures greater than the critical temperature exhibit a clear maximum, and near the critical temperature this maximum is a very sharp spike. Under the supercritical conditions and very high pressure the excess of adsorbed density decreases towards zero value for a graphite surface, while for slit pores negative excess density is possible at extremely high pressures. For imperfect pores (defined as pores that cannot accommodate an integral number of parallel layers under moderate conditions) the pressure at which the excess pore density becomes negative is less than that for perfect pores, and {{this is due to the}} packing effect in those imperfect pores.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{computer}} simulation and {{experimental study of}} adsorption of methanol on a highly graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> over a range of temperatures to investigate the adsorptive capacity, the isosteric heat, and the configuration of molecules in the adsorbed layer. We include coverage beyond the monolayer region, not previously studied in detail. The adsorption is shown to be strongly affected by hydrogen bonding which results in strong fluid-fluid interaction between the adsorbed molecules. The adsorption isotherms are initially sigmoidal, however, and in the multilayer region the isotherms follow typical type II behavior. The isosteric heat of adsorption of methanol is distinctly {{different from that of}} simple gases because of the dominance of the strong interactions between adsorbed molecules over the solid-fluid interactions. The configuration of adsorbed molecules in the submonolayer region favors the formation of 2 D cyclic clusters of four or five methanol molecules, which maximizes the hydrogen bonding, while {{near the end of the}} completion of the first layer methanol molecules form molecular chains with some degree of 2 D-zigzag pattern which again maximizes the hydrogen bonding between all molecules. This is in qualitative agreement with the X-ray diffraction measurements obtained by Morishige (Morishige, K.; Kawamura, K.; Kose, A. J. Chem. Phys. 1990, 93, 5267). When the second and higher layers are formed above the surface, the adsorbate forms clusters in three-dimensional configurations; however, the molecular chains with some degree of 2 D-zigzag pattern in the first layer still remain...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of intermolecular potential models on the adsorption of carbon tetrachloride on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> at various temperatures is investigated. This {{is made possible}} with the extensive experimental data of Machin and Ross(1), Avgul et al.,(2) and Pierce(3) that cover {{a wide range of}} temperatures. The description of all experimental data is only possible with the allowance for the surface mediation. If this were ignored, the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation results would predict a two-dimensional (2 D) transition even at high temperatures, while experimental data shows gradual change in adsorption density with pressure. In general, we find that the intermolecular interaction has to be reduced by 4 % whenever particles are within the first layer close to the surface. We also find that this degree of surface mediation is independent of temperature. To understand the packing of carbon tetrachloride in slit pores, we compared the {{performance of}} the potential models that model carbon tetrachloride as either five interaction sites or one site. It was found that the five-site model performs better and describes the imperfect packing in small pores better. This is so because most of the strength of fluid-fluid interaction between two carbon tetrachloride molecules comes from the interactions among chlorine atoms. Methane, although having tetrahedral shape as carbon tetrachloride, can be effectively modeled as a pseudospherical particle because most of the interactions come from carbon-carbon interaction and hydrogen negligibly contributes to this...|$|R
40|$|We model nongraphitized <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> {{surfaces}} and investigate adsorption of argon on these surfaces {{by using the}} grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation. In this model, the nongraphitized surface is modeled as a stack of graphene layers with some carbon atoms of the top graphene layer being randomly removed. The percentage of the surface carbon atoms being removed and the effective size of the defect (created by the removal) are the key parameters to characterize the nongraphitized surface. The patterns of adsorption isotherm and isosteric heat are particularly studied, {{as a function of}} these surface parameters as well as pressure and temperature. It is shown that the adsorption isotherm shows a steplike behavior on a perfect graphite surface and becomes smoother on nongraphitized surfaces. Regarding the isosteric heat versus loading, we observe for the case of graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> the increase of heat in the submonolayer coverage and then a sharp decline in the heat when the second layer is starting to form, beyond which it increases slightly. On the other hand, the isosteric heat versus loading for a highly nongraphitized surface shows a general decline with respect to loading, which is due to the energetic heterogeneity of the surface. It is only when the fluid-fluid interaction is greater than the surface energetic factor that we see a minimum-maximum in the isosteric heat versus loading. These simulation results of isosteric heat agree well with the experimental results of graphitization of Spheron 6 (Polley, M. H.; Schaeffer, W. D.; Smith, W. R. J. Phys. Chem. 1953, 57, 469; Beebe, R. A.; Young, D. M. J. Phys. Chem. 1954, 58, 93). Adsorption isotherms and isosteric heat in pores whose walls have defects are also studied from the simulation, and the pattern of isotherm and isosteric heat could be used to identify the fingerprint of the surface...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of surface {{mediation}} on the adsorption isotherm and isosteric heat of adsorption on a graphite surface were investigated, as the surface mediation is known to affect the intermolecular interaction of adsorbed molecules close to the surface. Kim and Steele (Phys. Rev. B 45 (11) (1992) 6226 - 6233) and others have assumed that the surface mediation is confined only to the first layer. This will be tested in this paper with a combined experimental and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation of adsorption of argon on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> (GTCB) over a range of temperatures (77 - 95. 25 K). By matching the simulation results against the experimental data, {{we have found that}} the surface mediation is extended up to the fourth layer, rather than only the first as suggested by Kim and Steele, and the extent of this mediation is reduced with distance from the surface. This reinforces the important role of surface on the intermolecular interaction. With regard to the heat of adsorption, we found that the isosteric heats obtained directly from the simulation agree fairly well with the heats calculated from the application of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation on experimental isotherms of 77 and 87. 3 K. The temperature dependence of the isosteric heat was investigated with the GCMC simulation results. One interesting observation is the existence of a heat spike at 77 K and its absence at higher temperatures, a phenomenon which is common to both simulation results and experimental data. This lends good support to the molecular model with surface mediation as a proper one to describe adsorption of noble gases on GTCB. © 2009 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) {{simulation}} {{was used}} to study multilayer adsorption of benzene on graphitised <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> over a range of temperature between 273 K and 373 K. Three potential models for benzene were compared: TraPPE-UA- 9, OPLS-AA and TraPPE-EH, in order to study their capability to correctly describe the adsorption isotherms and isosteric heats. In the sub-monolayer region, {{there is no difference}} between the simulation results obtained with the three models, which all describe the experimental data well. However, in the multilayer region only the TraPPE-EH model, that includes the quadrupole moment and explicit modelling of the hydrogen, is able to describe the experimental data accurately; the other two models significantly under-predict the data. The TraPPE-EH model was then used to investigate the microscopic behaviour of the adsorbed phase: the local density distribution and the orientation of various layers, particularly the change in orientation of benzene in the first layer with increase in loading from sub-monolayer to multi-layer. It was found that the orientation of benzene molecules in the first layer is affected by the presence of molecules in the higher layers, but that most benzene molecules remain in an orientation parallel to the surface, which is favoured by the interaction with the surface, while a smaller population takes 60 ° and verical orientations to the surface which maximises the entropy. The ratio of the number of molecules having parallel orientation to that having 60 ° and vertical orientations decreases in higher layers due to the weaker influence of the adsorbate–adsorbent interaction. Detailed study of the orientation shows that most slant and vertical molecules have two of their hydrogen atoms closer to the surface...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we review and {{classify}} the various patterns of isosteric heat versus loading for adsorption of gases on graphitised <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> at temperatures ranging from below the 3 D triple point to temperatures above it, {{but less than}} the 3 D critical point. We have identified the features of heat curve and highlighted the microscopic origin of these features. The patterns vary with temperature and with the relative strength of the fluid-fluid interaction and solid-fluid interaction. For simple adsorptives (by simple we meant there is no strong association between fluid particles), the heat curve is typified by fluid-fluid attraction and layering phenomena. For adsorptives showing strong association such as water, ammonia and methanol, the heat curve essentially begins below the condensation heat and then approaches it as loading is increased. This is mainly due to the strong hydrogen bonding in these fluids. A third group includes adsorprives such as benzene, where the heat curve is constant in the sub-monolayer coverage region (but {{is higher than the}} condensation heat) and then drops off to the condensation heat when higher layers are formed. The constant heat in the sub-monolayer region is due to the balance between the energy factor (from fluid-fluid interaction) and entropy factor (due to re-orientation of adsorbed molecules). Our proposed classification is supported by detailed GCMC simulations of various gases that {{have been reported in the}} literature, and we supplement these with new results for the adsorption of xenon on graphite to investigate in more detail the change in heat pattern with temperature. Xenon is chosen because of its high fluid-fluid interaction, allowing us to study the 2 D-phase transition in the first as well as higher layers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} pore {{curvature}} and surface heterogeneity on the adsorption {{of water on}} a graphitic surface at 298 K were investigated using a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation. Slit and cylindrical pores are used to study the curvature effects. To investigate the surface heterogeneity the functional group and the structural defect on the surface were specifically considered. The hydroxyl group (OH) {{is used as a}} model for the functional group and the water potential model proposed by Müller et al. is used to calculate the water interaction. For the homogeneous cylinder, the pore filling occurs at a pressure lower than the saturation pressure of the water model, while it is greater in the case of homogeneous slit pore. The size of hysteresis loop is more sensitive to the length of cylinder than that of the slit, and it increases with decreasing pore length. The isotherms of water in cylindrical pores are found to depend on the position and the concentration of the functional group. The pore filling pressure is lower with an increased number and/or with the position of the functional group. The structural defect shows significant effects on the adsorption isotherm in shifting to a lower pore filling pressure when it is located at a position away from the pore entrance. The adsorption of water on the heterogeneous surface was studied and it was found that the simulated isotherm can describe the behaviour of water on Graphitized <b>Thermal</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>Black</b> (GTCB) satisfactorily. The water cluster grows mostly along the surface for the case of finite extent surface, while for the slit the pore grows in all directions but the preference is a direction perpendicular to the pore wall.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the surface {{heterogeneity}} {{and the surface}} mediation on the intermolecular potential energy for nitrogen adsorption on graphitized <b>thermal</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> (GTCB). The surface heterogeneity is modeled as the random distribution of effective carbonyl functional groups on the graphite surface. The molecular parameters and the discrete charges of this carbonyl group are taken from Jorgensen, et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., (1984) 106, 6638) while those for nitrogen (dispersive parameters and discrete charges) are taken from Murthy et al. (Mol. Phys., (1983) 50, 531) in our Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation. The solid surface mediation in the reduction of intermolecular potential energy between two fluid molecules was taken from a recent work by Do et al. (Langmuir, (2004) 20, 7623). Our simulation results accounting for the surface heterogeneity and surface mediation on intermolecular potential energy were compared with the experimental data of nitrogen at 77 and 90 K. The solid-fluid dispersive parameters are determined from the Lorentz-Berthelot (LB) rule. The fraction of the graphite surface covered with carbonyl functional groups was then derived from the consideration of the Henry constant, and for the data of Kruk et al. (Langmuir, (1999) 15, 1435) {{we have found that}} 1 % of their GTCB surface is covered with effective carbonyl functional groups. The damping constant, due to surface mediation, was determined from the consideration of the portion of the adsorption isotherm where the first layer is being completed, and it was found to take a value of 0. 0075. With these parameters, we have found that the GCMC simulation results describe the data over the complete range of pressure substantially better than any other MC models in the literature. The implication of this work is demonstrated with local adsorption isotherms of 10 and 20 A slit pores. One was obtained without allowance for surface mediation, while the other correctly accounts for these factors. The two local isotherms differ substantially, and the implication is that if we used incorrect local isotherms (i. e. without the surface mediation) the pore size distribution would be incorrectly derived...|$|R
