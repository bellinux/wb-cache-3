40|$|Immunosuppressive {{drugs are}} used in the {{treatment}} of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as in transplantation. Frequently prescribed in young people, these treatments may have deleterious effects on fertility, pregnancy outcomes and the unborn child. This review aims to summarize the main gonadal side effects of immunosuppressants, to detail the effects on fertility and pregnancy of each class of drug, and to provide recommendations on the management of patients who are seen prior to starting or who are already receiving immunosuppressive treatment, allowing them in due course to bear children. The recommendations for use are established with a rather low level of proof, which needs {{to be taken into account}} in the patient management. Methotrexate, mycophenolate, and le- and teri-flunomide, cyclophosphamide, <b>mitoxanthrone</b> are contraindicated if pregnancy is desired due to their teratogenic effects, as well as gonadotoxic effects in the case of cyclophosphamide. Anti-TNF-alpha and mTOR-inhibitors are to be used cautiously if pregnancy is desired, since experience using these drugs is still relatively scarce. Azathioprine, glucocorticoids, mesalazine, anticalcineurins such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, ß-interferon, glatiramer-acetate and chloroquine can be used during pregnancy, bearing in mind however that side effects may still occur. Experience is limited concerning natalizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl-fumarate and induction treatments. Conclusion: At the time of prescription, patients must be informed of the possibl...|$|E
40|$|In many cases, only {{advanced}} stage {{colorectal cancer}} is diagnosed. At this point, {{it has often}} already metastasised to the liver. In these cases, not only the patient’s primary tumor, but also metastases have to be treated. For the treatment of both liver metastases and primary tumors there are local procedures to be offered. The objective of this project was to investigate new methods of local therapy of liver tumors/ metastases, {{which can be used}} either as neoadjuvant, adjuvant or stand-alone treatment. It was the aim of this study to investigate minimally invasive local tumor therapy using a low dose of drugs. The study on efficacy and tolerance of this method was conducted in 20 rabbits with implanted VX 2 liver tumors. The initial idea was to allow local percutaneous treatment of tumors with therapeutically active substances delivered by drug-coated balloon catheters. In this way, a large tissue surface area will be attained by the increased surface of the balloon through its expansion. In addition, the coating will be sustainably pressed into the tumor tissue. After that, the active substance should be slowly dissolved in the tissue or slowly washed away from its location. The following cytostatics were selected: paclitaxel, arsenic trioxide, 5 -fluorouracil, fantolon, bortezomib, doxorubicin and <b>mitoxanthrone.</b> In addition, the drugs were compared with appropriate drug-free controls. The above mentioned substances were tested in vitro for their cytotoxicity against the VX 2 tumor cells in culture. The cells were exposed to any substance at four different concentrations (2 - 32 μmol/l for paclitaxel, arsenic oxide, fantolon, 5 -fluorouracil and <b>mitoxanthrone,</b> 10 - 25 μmol/l for doxorubicin, 0. 1 - 0. 4 μmol/l for bortezomib) for 24, 48 and 72 hours. As a control, tumor cells were incubated without drugs. The total remaining intramitochondrial dehydrogenase activity as a measure of the cellular vitality compared to the control was the lowest for doxorubicin with 12 3 % (16 μmol/l after 72 h incubation) and the highest for arsenic trioxide with 52 4 % (15 μmol/l after 48 h) when the lowest value was selected for each substance. All tested substances were shown to be effective, and their selection for the investigation in the animal study was based on their physicochemical properties and mechanism of action, {{as well as on the}} experience with these substances in previous studies for other indications. Not all test substances selected in this study were shown to be suitable for the coating of balloon catheters, thereby limiting this method of administration in the in vivo experiments. For that reason another mode of administration of these substances had to be chosen. Arsenic trioxide and doxorubicin were injected directly into the tumor using a syringe (four animals per group). Four rabbits were used for each drug to be tested. The applied doses were between 1. 57 to 1. 78 mg for paclitaxel, 11. 5 to 22. 0 mg for arsenic trioxide, 1. 12 to 1. 16 for fantolon and 5. 94 to 20. 78 for doxorubicin. In the course of the study the doses for doxorubicin and arsenic trioxide could be increased due to their good tolerabi lity and low effect. Half of the animals in the control group were treated with an uncoated balloon catheter (two animals), while the other half of the same group (two animals) received a physiological saline solution by injection to mimic mechanical manipulation of the tumor in treatment with the drugs. The effectiveness of the treatment on tumor growth was controlled after 1 - 2 weeks by computer tomography during and shortly after injection of a contrast agent. In contrast-enhanced computed tomography the liver tumor is detected by its low blood supply, defined here as perfusion defect, when compared to the healthy liver tissue. A reduction in the size of the perfusion defect after therapy indicates a decrease in the tumor size, while an increase can be attributed to tumor growth or necrosis. Therefore, after dissection TCC staining of vital parts of the tissue with a perfusion defect was performed. Overall, the effect of the investigated substances in vivo did not completely correspond to the results in cell culture experiments. In only two out of twenty animals a reduction of the tumorrelated perfusion defect in the liver was observed: one animal in the group treated with fantolon (- 36 % of the value measured one week before) and one control animal treated with an uncoated balloon (- 6 % of the value measured one week before). In all other animals the assessment of the efficacy of the substances is only based on the increase of the perfusion defect. The lowest percentage growth in the perfusion defect was observed in animals treated with paclitaxel (271 ± 186 %), followed by animals of the control group (903 ± 925 %). The largest increase in the perfusion defect was seen after treatment with arsenic trioxide (3580 ± 4871 %), where the largest proportion of the poorly or not perfused liver tissue was necrotic. None of the substances and formulations tested in this study showed the desired local cytotoxic properties in vivo. However, it cannot be excluded that local administration of paclitaxel and arsenic trioxide inhibits tumor growth. This assumption is supported by the results of ex vivo measurements of the tumor size and by pathological examination. Thus, further experiments regarding the dose, formulations and mode of administration should be conducted, especially for arsenic trioxide, in order to demonstrate reproducibility of the findings, gain insight certainty with respect to vitality of the damaged tissue defined as perfusion defect and to assess the potential benefits of these substances for local tumor therapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} DNA {{supercoiling}} {{in the cell}} is carefully controlled by DNA topoisomerases. These enzymes catalyze the passage of individual DNA strands (Type I DNA topoisomerases), or double helices (Type II DNA topoisomerases) through one another. The {{purpose of the present}} study is to conduct a detailed analysis of the topo llα and β mRNAs expressed in several vertebrate cell lines. The final aim of this project is to analyze the relative roles of topo llα in chromatin condensation and chromosome segregation during mitosis, by performing topo llα gene targeting experiments in the DT 40 chicken lymphoblastoid cell line. The knock-out strategy was based on the observation of a high rate of homologous recombination versus random integration in the DT 40 cell line. The topo llα gene was shown to be located on the chicken chromosome 2 (APM unpublished), for which the DT 40 cell line is trisomic. The targeting vector completely replaced the 32 kb topo IIα genomic locus, generating a topo llα (-/+/+) cell line, which showed an increased resistance to topo II inhibitors. Paradoxically, 150 uM etoposide or 100 uM <b>mitoxanthrone</b> induced apoptosis within 5 hours in the topo llα (- 1 + 1 +) cell line, more rapidly as compared to the normal DT 40 cells. A topo IIα (-I-I+) cell line has also been generated. This study revealed the presence of evolutionarily conserved alternatively spliced forms of both topo llα and β isoforms between birds and humans. Hybridization screening of two chicken cDNA libraries, MSB- 1 and DU 249, revealed the presence of two distinct forms of both topo llα and β cDNAs. One form of topo llα, designated topo llα- 1, encodes the chicken topo llα amino acid sequence previously reported (dbjiAB 007445) in the database (unpublished). The second form, designated topo llα- 2, encodes a protein containing an additional 35 amino acids inserted after Lysine- 322 of chicken topo IIα- 1 protein sequence. In the case of topo 11 (3 mANA, one form, designated topo IIβ- 1, encodes the protein already described (dbjiAB 007446). The second form, tapa IIβ- 2, would encode a protein missing the next 86 amino acids after Valine- 25 in tapa II β- 1 protein sequence. The tapa 11 β variant is positioned similarly to one previously described in human (Hela) cells. The 5 amino acid insertion in the human tapa 11 β- 2 variant follows v 23. In chicken cells, a longer insertion of 86 amino acids sequence follows v 25, the homologous position in the tapa 11 β protein. In human cells, the situation with tapa llα is more complex, as revealed by RT-PCR experiments (APM, unpublished) which generated several bands. One of these amplified species was found to contain a 36 amino acids insertion, positioned after residue K 321 in the human tapa IIα cDNA, similarly to chicken tapa IIα- 2 variant. The second human tapa llα spliced form cDNA was shown to contain a 26 amino acids insertion after residue A 401 in the canonical human tapa llα protein sequence. The third cDNA variant isolated from human cells was described to encode a 81 amino acids insertion after residue Q 355 positioned within the known human tapa IIα protein. It appears possible that the posttranslational modifications of the a- 2 and β- 2 isoforms may differ substantially from those of the canonical a- 1 and β- 1 isoforms. Such variant proteins could fulfil specialized functions, which might be tissue or cell-type specific. In summary, two novel forms of tapa llα and β cDNAs have been identified in three chicken cell lines. These spliced versions of both tapa llα and 13 isoforms seem to be evolutionary conserved, with similar forms occurring in their human counterparts. Future functional analysis of vertebrate tapa IIα and β will have to account for the existence of these novel isoforms, which might encode proteins that may exhibit different regulation of their subcellular localization, interaction with other proteins, or catalytic activity...|$|E
