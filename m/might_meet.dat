Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harriers of all models were delivered. In 2001, Flight International reported that Taiwan <b>might</b> <b>meet</b> its requirement for a short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft by purchasing AV-8Bs, outfitted with the F-16 Fighting Falcon's APG-66 radar. A Taiwanese purchase would have allowed the production line to stay open beyond 2005. Despite the possibility of leasing AV-8Bs, interest in the aircraft waned as the country switched its intentions to procuring the F-35 and upgrading its fleet of F-16s.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{personally}} pinned a Silver Star on Leclerc, {{and brought}} with him another six Silver Stars and 25 Bronze Star Medals for {{other members of the}} 2e DB. Patton then gave Leclerc his next objective: the town of Baccarat and the bridge there over the Meurthe River. The bridge was captured before the Germans could destroy it. Haislip's XV Corps was transferred to the Seventh United States Army on 29 September, and Leclerc feared that 2e DB would be transferred to Général d'armée Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's French First Army. Leclerc regarded the First Army as being full of traitors who had supported Vichy France. Moreover, de Lattre had sacked Général de division Edgard de Larminat for Gaullist sentiments, and Leclerc had good reason to fear that he <b>might</b> <b>meet</b> a similar fate.|$|E

He took the simple vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{specialist}} institutional provision {{for the care}} {{and control of the}} insane remained extremely limited {{at the turn of the}} 18th century. Madness was seen principally as a domestic problem, with families and parish authorities in Europe and England central to regimens of care. Various forms of outdoor relief were extended by the parish authorities to families in these circumstances, including financial support, the provision of parish nurses and, where family care was not possible, lunatics might be 'boarded out' to other members of the local community or committed to private madhouses. Exceptionally, if those deemed mad were judged to be particularly disturbing or violent, parish authorities <b>might</b> <b>meet</b> the not inconsiderable costs of their confinement in charitable asylums such as Bethlem, in Houses of Correction or in workhouses.|$|E

25|$|Feminism in Mexico {{is often}} divided {{chronologically}} into peak periods followed by lulls: the Revolutionary period (1915-1925), the Second Wave (1968-1990, peaking in 1975-1985), and the post-1990 period. While feminism {{may be defined}} as a set of organized philosophy and activity aimed at creating, defining, and protecting political, economic, cultural, and social equality in women’s rights and opportunity, Marta Lamas and other feminists caution that the women's movement in Mexico can not be equated with the feminist movement. Lamas, a leading Mexican feminist, laments that the Mexican feminist movement has always been weak and has struggled in the modern era to move beyond Mexico City's middle class to working-class and rural women. In the Revolutionary period where a broader spectrum of women from throughout Mexico were seeking suffrage, the movement lacked sophistication and focus, evident in the fact that Mexican women did not gain the vote until 1953. Women's equality demands, per Lamas, stem from a situation where women are juggling between household commitments and underpaid jobs. As most Mexican women in the upper and middle classes are provided with domestic help, women are more accepting of traditional gender roles. For many Mexican women, assisting other women through benevolent organizations and charitable works is in-line with their traditional view of womanhood, whereas a radical approach <b>might</b> <b>meet</b> with disdain or even violence.|$|E

Mascaró had taken part in a debate, televised on The Frost Programme on 4 October 1967, during which Harrison and John Lennon discussed the merits of Transcendental Meditation with an audience of academics and religious leaders. In a subsequent letter to Harrison, dated 16 November, Mascaró expressed {{the hope that they}} <b>might</b> <b>meet</b> again before the Beatles departed for India, where the group were to study meditation with their guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

500|$|People {{would gather}} in the rooms in the evening for balls and other public functions, or simply to play cards.

Walter Hart, the club's chairman, spoke of the good character of the players, most of whom still worked at their own trades when not required for football, suggesting that [...] "a man who had nothing to do but loaf about from week's end to week's end was not ready for play, and such a mode of life was not conducive to good football". He praised the players' esprit de corps and pluck which had taken them {{to the top of the}} division, and encouraged them to resist the temptation to sign for other clubs, insisting that [...] "whatever money [...] made after providing things of necessity would come to the players and... the club could do as well for its players, if they only clung together, as any club in the country".

500|$|Treves {{observed}} that Merrick was very sensitive and showed his emotions easily. At times Merrick was bored and lonely, and demonstrated signs of depression. He {{had spent his}} entire adult life segregated from women, first in the workhouse and then as an exhibit. The women he met were either disgusted or frightened by his appearance. His opinions about women were derived from his memories {{of his mother and}} what he read in books. Treves decided that Merrick would like to be introduced to a woman and it would help him feel normal. The doctor arranged for a friend of his named Mrs. Leila Maturin, [...] "a young and pretty widow", to visit Merrick. She agreed and with fair warning about his appearance, she went to his rooms for an introduction. The meeting was short, as Merrick quickly became overcome with emotion. He later told Treves that Maturin had been the first woman ever to smile at him, the first to shake his hand. She kept in contact with him and a letter written by Merrick to her, thanking her for the gift of a book and a brace of grouse (a pair of birds), is the only surviving letter written by Merrick. This first experience of meeting a woman, though brief, instilled in Merrick a new sense of self-confidence. He met other women during his life at the hospital, and appeared taken with them all. Treves believed that Merrick's hope was to go to live at an institution for the blind, where he <b>might</b> <b>meet</b> a woman who could not see his deformities.|$|E

When Stottor regained consciousness, Nilsen embraced him; he then explained to Stottor he had almost strangled himself on the zip of the sleeping bag, {{and that he had}} resuscitated him. Over the following two days, Stottor repeatedly lapsed in and out of consciousness. When Stottor had regained enough strength to question Nilsen as to his recollections of being strangled and immersed in cold water, Nilsen explained he had become caught in the zip of the sleeping bag following a nightmare, and that he had placed him in cold water as [...] "you were in shock".

2500|$|The {{history of}} Ba Zaw’s early {{training}} as a painter is a patchwork of contradictory claims. For example, Ludu Daw Amar and Ko Ko Naing describe Ba Zaw as self-taught and maintain that he learned painting by studying from books. Min Naing, on the other hand, mentions that the doyen of Traditional painting in Burma {{at the turn of}} the century, Saya Chone (18661917), was an instructor of Ba Zaw while Ba Zaw taught at St. Paul’s High School and offers convincing details about their interaction. Nyan Shein claims that Ba Ohn (c. 1877 [...] fl. 1924) was one of Ba Zaw’s teachers, and Ko Ko Naing acknowledges the influence that the three early British chairmen and teachers of the Burma Art Club (BAC)—Martin Ward, Martin Jones, and E.G.N. Kinch—had on Ba Zaw, which is almost certainly true. The BAC was informally organized in 1913 as a venue where amateur British colonial painters in Burma <b>might</b> <b>meet</b> and exchange skills, and became more officially established in 1918. Toward the later date, the BAC began to train Burmese painters. Ba Zaw was one of the earliest Burmese members of the club, and he picked up much from its lectures. Ko Ko Naing and Amar’s claim that Ba Zaw was self-taught is accurate in the sense that Ba Zaw was self-taught to a degree. He won scholarships or painting competitions when he was a youngster before he encountered Ba Ohn, Saya Chone or British painters.|$|E
