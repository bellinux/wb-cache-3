The United States District Court had {{ruled that the}} records be unsealed and {{made available to the}} public. However, on July 13, 2007, the city filed an emergency motion to stay the judge's order.

5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E

25|$|Eugène never led large {{formations}} into battle, yet Napoleon {{appointed him}} {{commander of the}} Army of Italy. To prepare his stepson Eugène for the role, the emperor wrote him many detailed letters advising him how to defend Italy. He urged Eugène to fall back from the Isonzo River line to the Piave River if the Austrians invaded in strength. Napoleon <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the Adige River was an extremely important strategic position. He did not believe Austria was going to attack in April {{and he did not}} want to provoke his enemy by massing his armies. Thus, Eugène's army remained somewhat dispersed.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, Barth {{became an}} {{important}} voice in support both of German penitence and of reconciliation with churches abroad. Together with Hans-Joachim Iwand, he authored the Darmstadt Statement in 1947– a more concrete statement of German guilt and responsibility for the Third Reich and Second World War than the 1945 Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt. In it, he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the Church's willingness to side with anti-socialist and conservative forces had led to its susceptibility for National Socialist ideology. In the context of the developing Cold War, that controversial statement was rejected by anti-Communists in the West who supported the CDU course of re-militarization, as well as by East German dissidents who believed that it did not sufficiently depict the dangers of Communism. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. In the 1950s, Barth sympathized with the peace movement and opposed German rearmament.|$|E

25|$|Although British Prime Minister John Major {{rejected}} John Hume's {{requests for}} a public inquiry into the killings, his successor, Tony Blair, decided to start one. A second commission of inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville, was established in January 1998 to re-examine Bloody Sunday. The other judges were John Toohey QC, a former Justice of the High Court of Australia who had worked on Aboriginal issues (he replaced New Zealander Sir Edward Somers QC, who retired from the Inquiry in 2000 for personal reasons), and Mr Justice William Hoyt QC, former Chief Justice of New Brunswick {{and a member of}} the Canadian Judicial Council. The hearings were concluded in November 2004, and the report was published 15 June 2010. The Saville Inquiry was a more comprehensive study than the Widgery Tribunal, interviewing a wide range of witnesses, including local residents, soldiers, journalists and politicians. Lord Saville declined to comment on the Widgery report and <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the Saville Inquiry was a judicial inquiry into Bloody Sunday, not the Widgery Tribunal.|$|E

500|$|Grant (1992) {{acknowledges}} that Robert II's reign {{in terms of}} foreign and domestic policy was [...] "not so unsuccessful". [...] As far as William, Earl of Douglas's reaction was concerned when he staged an armed demonstration before Robert's coronation, Grant does not hold {{to the view that}} Douglas was in some way demonstrating against Robert's legitimate right to the throne, but more an assertion that royal patronage should not continue as in the time of David II. [...] Grant also advocates that the demonstration was aimed at father and son Robert and Thomas Erskine, who held the castles of Edinburgh, Stirling and Dumbarton from Robert's predecessor. [...] Grant seriously called into question the dependability of Froissart's writings as an effective source for Robert II's reign. [...] Influential magnate coalitions headed by Carrick, having undermined the king's position, manipulated the Council of November 1384 to effectively oust Robert II from any real power. [...] Grant gives little weight to the asserted senility of Robert, and suggests that the deposition of Carrick in 1388, and then the resolution to join the Anglo-French truce of 1389, were both at the instigation of Robert II. [...] Yet power was not handed back to Robert II but to Carrick's younger brother, Robert, earl of Fife which once again saw the king at the disposition of one of his sons. [...] Despite this, the now unknown source whom both Wyntoun and Bower relied on <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Fife deferred to his father on affairs of state emphasising the difference in styles in the guardianships of his two sons.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the most}} {{striking}} advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria. Two {{of the most}} famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were Herophilus and Erasistratus. These two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research. They also conducted vivisections on the cadavers of condemned criminals, which was considered taboo until the Renaissance – Herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections. Herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine. Some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse, the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls then veins, and that the atria were parts of the heart. Herophilus’s knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and nervous system, and characterizing the course of disease. Erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain, including the cavities and membranes, and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum [...] During his study in Alexandria, Erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems. He was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart, which was then carried throughout the body. His distinction between the arteries and veins – the arteries carrying the air through the body, while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery. Erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart, including the tricuspid. During the third century, Greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons [...] and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses. It was Herophilus who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> damage to motor nerves induced paralysis. Herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain, appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the [...] "seat of intellect" [...] and not a [...] "cooling chamber" [...] as propounded by Aristotle [...] Herophilus is also credited with describing the optic, oculomotor, motor division of the trigeminal, facial, vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves.|$|E

25|$|Havelock Ellis, in Studies in the Psychology of Sex, {{argued that}} there is no clear {{distinction}} between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also <b>made</b> <b>the</b> important <b>point</b> <b>that</b> sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.|$|R

I {{argue that it is}} not, as Rugman proposed, because MNEs are better at safeguarding their firm-specific advantages (FSAs) but because having them hold the equity is sometimes {{the most efficient way to}} bundle assets. I present a more general model of internalization that shows why MNEs can be the most efficient way to both exploit and acquire FSAs, why a firm does not need to have FSAs to become an MNE, and why internalization is not a question of setting up internal markets but consists instead in the replacement of output by behavior constraints.
