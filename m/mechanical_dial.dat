50|$|A lens {{clock is}} a <b>mechanical</b> <b>dial</b> {{indicator}} {{that is used}} to measure dioptric power of a lens. It is a specialized version of a spherometer. A lens clock measures the curvature of a surface, but gives the result as an optical power in diopters, assuming the lens is made of a material with a particular refractive index.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} had an analogue <b>mechanical</b> <b>dial</b> with a pivoted needle indicator on a {{scale that}} covered 0.1 roentgens to 500 roentgens. Powered by three obsolete high voltage batteries (15 volt and 30 volt), that had to be specially manufactured, the meter was contained in a sturdy enamelled metal case. The controls featured an on-off switch combined with a calibration adjustment and a multi-position battery test switch.|$|E
5000|$|The torque is thus {{proportional}} to the instantaneous line voltage times the instantaneous load current, automatically correcting for power factor. The disc is braked by a permanent magnet so that speed is {{proportional to}} torque and the disc mechanically integrates real power. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>dial</b> on the meter reads disc rotations and the total net energy delivered to the load. (If the load supplies power to the grid, the disc rotates backwards unless prevented by a ratchet, thus making net metering possible.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>dials</b> are {{provided}} for key operations, including shutter speed, ISO sensitivity, exposure compensation, drive modes and metering modes. For {{the prevention of}} operation errors, the dials for shutter speed and ISO sensitivity are equipped with a Lock & Release button, and are designed with extra height for operability improvement over the Fujifilm X-T1.|$|R

50|$|For the US and UK {{release the}} next year, {{the system was}} updated by {{replacing}} the <b>mechanical</b> tuning <b>dials</b> with a push-button system with eight pre-selected channels. A panel in the top flipped up to access small <b>mechanical</b> tuning <b>dials</b> {{for each of the}} eight channels. Push-button tuning was relatively rare at this time. The UK model was also released under the Ferguson brand name.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} clock mechanism was refurbished in 2000; it {{is complete}} and intact, despite two previous modifications. The Ferry Building has its original Special #4 clock made in 1898 by the Boston clock maker E. Howard. It {{is the largest}} wind-up, <b>mechanical</b> <b>dial</b> clock in the world. The four dials are each twenty-two feet in diameter, and {{a portion of the}} dial appears to be back-lit at night. This is the effect of two concentric dials on each clock face, in which the inner dial is lit and visible at night.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993, the Century Road Club Association of New York, NY retired their vintage rollers and <b>mechanical</b> <b>dial</b> for Kreitler Rollers and a {{computer}} system that could clock up to six racers at a time. Elsewhere in America, every winter a USA Cycling sanctioned event called the Iowa Roller Race Series defines roller racing champions.The series uses Kreitler Rollers and a DOS program Roller Fusion, which was commissioned in the 1990s by the late Al Kreitler. In honor of Al Kreitler, the promoter of the Iowa Roller Race Series, Greg Harper, organized the 2011 Al Kreitler Memorial Killer 2-Mile Roller Races. (To clarify, Al Kreitler was not killed; his dog was named [...] "Killer.") ...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{technique}} is proposed to compute interface slip of stud connected steel-concrete composite (SCC) girders {{based on the}} results of a flexure test. The technique makes use of relative longitudinal displacement of the concrete slab and steel beam to calculate the interface slip. In the flexure test of a SCC girder, a cost-effective instrumentation arrangement consisting of <b>mechanical</b> <b>dial</b> gauges is used to measure the relative longitudinal displacement. Responses measured from experiments on SCC girders conducted by the authors are used for numerical implementation and validation of the technique. Alternatively, interface slip is also evaluated by applying an analytical model which is based on first principles of mechanics. The values of interface slip computed by using the proposed technique are found to have close correlation with those of the analytical model. The effect of edge restraint on slip due to friction between steel and concrete is also studie...|$|E

5000|$|Most Ericofons had <b>mechanical</b> rotary <b>dials,</b> {{typical of}} all phones {{made in the}} era. While Ericofons {{produced}} by Ericsson used miniature buzzers as ringers, North Electric introduced the electronic [...] "Ericotone" [...] ringer. The Ericotone ringer used a simple, one-transistor oscillator circuit to produce a distinctive [...] "chirping" [...] sound. This {{was one of the}} earliest uses of a transistor in a telephone; telephones with mechanical bell ringers and rotary dials did not need transistors.|$|R
50|$|Simple {{mechanical}} {{types are}} used in civil engineering to measure movement of buildings, foundations, and other structures. More sophisticated <b>mechanical</b> types incorporate <b>dial</b> indicators and mechanisms to compensate for temperature changes. These types can measure movements as small as 0.002 mm.|$|R
40|$|Heading {{estimation}} involves both inertial {{and visual}} cues. Inertial motion is sensed by the labyrinth, somatic sensation by the body, and optic flow by the retina. Because {{the eye and}} head are mobile these stimuli are sensed relative to different reference frames and it remains unclear if a perception occurs in a common reference frame. Recent neurophysio-logic evidence has suggested the reference frames remain separate even at higher levels of processing but has not addressed the resulting perception. Seven human subjects expe-rienced a 2 s, 16 cm/s translation and/or a visual stimulus corresponding with this transla-tion. For each condition 72 stimuli (360 ° in 5 ° increments) were delivered in random order. After each stimulus the subject identified the perceived heading using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>dial.</b> Some trial blocks included interleaved conditions in which the influence of ± 28 ° of gaze and/ or head position were examined. The observations were fit using a two degree-of-freedom population vector decoder (PVD) model which considered the relative sensitivity to lateral motion and coordinate system offset. For visual stimuli gaze shifts caused shifts in per-ceived head estimates in the direction opposite the gaze shift in all subjects. These percep-tual shifts averaged 13 ± 2 ° for eye only gaze shifts and 17 ± 2 ° for eye-head gaze shifts. This finding indicates visual headings are biased towards retina coordinates. Similar gaze and head direction shifts prior to inertial headings had no significant influence on heading direction. Thus inertial headings are perceived in body-centered coordinates. Combined visual and inertial stimuli yielded intermediate results...|$|E
40|$|The ilioinguinal/ iliohypogastric nerve {{block is}} an {{effective}} technique that provides analgesia {{for a variety of}} inguinal surgical procedures in children. However, a relatively high failure rate of between 20 - 30 % has been reported. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the exact anatomical position of the ilio-inguinal and iliohypogastric nerves in relation to an easily identifiable bony landmark, the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), in neonates. Dissections were performed on a sample of 54 neonatal cadavers (51 left and 53 right sides; mean length: 0. 43 m ± 0. 06 m; mean weight: 1. 64 kg ± 0. 72 kg) and the distance from the ASIS to both these nerves, on a line connecting the ipsilateral ASIS to the umbilicus, was measured using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>dial</b> sliding calliper (accuracy: 0. 01 mm). No significant difference was found when comparing the left and right sides of the sample. The data for the left and right sides were therefore combined, i. e., a total of 104 ilio-inguinal and 103 iliohypogastric nerves were examined. The nerves were found to be much closer to the ASIS than was previously thought. The ilio-inguinal nerve was between 1. 98 mm- 2. 43 mm from the ASIS, while the iliohypogastric nerve was approximately 3. 56 mm- 4. 07 mm from the ASIS. The data obtained from this study suggest that the high failure rate of the ilio-inguinal/ iliohypogastric nerve block could be due to lack of spatial knowledge regarding the anatomy of these nerves in neonates. An improved needle insertion site was therefore developed, one that aims to block these nerves at a point closer to the ASIS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the relative proportions of the flange angles necessary to make an axially compressed plate reach any buckling strength up to 60, 000 psi. ^ The principal variables which were investigated were the L/b ratio for the plate, the b/t ratio for the plate, and the size of edge angles. Steel of various yield points was used, with the maximum being about 75, 000 psi. The range of the variables was so chosen as to cover the current practice and extend considerably above the values now being generally used. ^ Eighty column specimens have been tested under axial compression with lateral support so arranged as to simulate the effect of lacing bars as used in column design. The specimens were built up channels each consisting of a web plate with edge angles on one face. The test columns are arranged in fifteen series such that the only variable for a given series is the size of edge angles used. ^ SR- 4 strain gages were used to determine the stress distribution throughout the member and to measure the stresses during buckling. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>dial</b> indicators were used to determine the overall change in length of the specimen and the lateral deflections due to the axial loading. ^ Lateral support for the specimens was provided at the third points along each edge of the plate. ^ Principal results and conclusions are as follows: (1) It is possible to stiffen plates with edge angles so that they will carry the stress given by the Bryan formula for an axially compressed plate with simple supports along the longitudinal edges. (2) Present methods of analysis do check the experimental results. (3) With proper care the current limit of b/t for web plates may be considerably exceeded. Edge angles of sufficient size must be used. (4) A set of tentative ultimate strength curves are given showing the size of edge angles required to make a plate of given b/t safe against buckling for any stress up to 60, 000 psi. This curve applies to plates where the L/b ratio is 2. ...|$|E
