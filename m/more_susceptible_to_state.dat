40|$|Given {{the steady}} {{attention}} higher education researchers have paid to state postsecondary education finance, state capital expenditures (e. g., new construction, infrastructure) have received surprisingly little consideration. Scholars have examined trends and determinants {{of higher education}} general appropriations (e. g., Delaney & Doyle, 2007; Lowry, 2001; Rizzo, 2006; St. John & Parsons, 2004; Tandberg, in press-a, in press-b) and of student financial aid (e. g., Heller, 2001, 2002). Yet, {{we are aware of}} only a single empirical study examining capital expenditures for higher education (White & Musser, 1978). This lack of attention is especially surprising for three reasons: (1) states spend a substantial sum on capital projects, (2) capital spending appears to be <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>state</b> education and economic trends, and (3) the allocation of capital project funds appear to be rife with political influence. With regard to the first reason, according to the fiscal year 2007 report of the National Associations of State Budget Officers, states provided $ 12. 3 billion dollars to higher education institutions in the form of capital support. Higher education is the second largest single capital expenditure category in state budgets (the first is transportation). In fact, higher education makes up 13 % of all state capital expenditures (NASBO, 2008). In addition to the relatively large shar...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim: {{subjects}} with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) show greater startle responsiveness resulting from aversive physiological stimulation compared with {{subjects with}}out MUS. It {{has been suggested}} that an enhanced degree of anxiety is responsible for this effect. Current study attempts to determine whether subjects with MUS (HMUS subjects) are <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> anticipatory <b>state</b> social anxiety compared with subjects without MUS (LMUS subjects). Methods: subjects were fifteen female college students. The acoustic startle reflex (ASR), and a self-assessment with the STAI-state anxiety questionnaire, were used as measures of the degree of state social anxiety. The differentiation between HMUS and LMUS was achieved by means of SCL- 90 mean scores. The social speech task was used <b>to</b> induce <b>state</b> social anxiety in subjects. Results: in contrast to what was to be expected, there is no significant difference between experimental conditions with regard to the ASR of HMUS and LMUS subjects. Furthermore, there is no significant difference regarding the STAI-state measurements of HMUS and LMUS subjects between experimental conditions. Conclusion: having medically unexplained symptoms did not lead to a higher susceptibility to anxiety within the research population. Due to the limited n, reservations are {{to be taken into account}} with regard to the generalization of the results...|$|R
30|$|Most rapid {{predissociation}} {{occurs on}} timescales ≪ 1 μs. As a result, in general predissociative {{states are not}} well suited to Rydberg-Stark deceleration for which lifetimes ≳ 10 μs are required. However, the molecular Rydberg states which exhibit the most rapid predissociation are those of core-penetrating low- ℓ character, for which the Rydberg electron has a significant charge density {{in the vicinity of}} the ion core. For Rydberg electrons in higher ℓ states, the centrifugal barrier ensures that they do not significantly perturb the bond in the molecular ion core and predissociation can be inhibited. Because the quantum defects of high Rydberg states depend directly on the penetration of the Rydberg electron into the ion core, molecular Rydberg states with large quantum defects tend <b>to</b> be significantly <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> predissociation than <b>states</b> with quantum defects approaching zero.|$|R

Many {{studies have shown that}} these channels are crucial for performing several physiological functions. Additionally, a large body of evidence indicates that these channels are also involved in numerous human diseases, known as channelopathies. A characteristic event frequently observed during pathological states is the raising in intracellular oxidative agents over reducing molecules, shifting the redox balance and inducing oxidative stress. In particular, three members of the TRPM subfamily, TRPM 2, TRPM 4 and TRPM 7, share the remarkable feature that their activities are modulated by oxidative stress. Because of the increase in oxidative stress, these TRPM channels function aberrantly, promoting the onset and development of diseases. Increases, absences, or modifications in the function of these redox-modulated TRPM channels are associated with cell dysfunction and human pathologies. Therefore, the effect of oxidative stress on ion channels becomes {{an essential part of the}} pathogenic mechanism. Thus, oxidative stress-modulated ion channels are <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> generating pathological <b>states</b> than oxidant-independent channels. This review examines the most relevant findings regarding the participation of the oxidative stress-modulated TRPMion channels, TRPM 2, TRPM 4, and TRPM 7, in human diseases. In addition, the potential roles of these channels as therapeutic tools and targets for drug design are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} history and {{phenomenon}} of legal pluralism in Indonesia. The need to explore this topic has been urged by the revival there of Islamic law and adat law, the two greatest non-state normative orderings, {{in the last two}} decades. At the same time the ideal of modernity in Indonesia has been characterized by a state-driven effort in the post-colonial era to make the institution of law an inseparable part of national development. The result has been a conception of law as a homogenous system in which the ideology of legal positivism represents the basic tool for lawmaking. This, however, has led to an impasse, seeing that pluralism and multiculturalism are in fact self-evident phenomena in the society. The state has been obliged, therefore, to accommodate these non-state normative orderings. The discussion of Indonesian legal pluralism in this thesis focuses on understanding the state's attitude and behavior towards the three largest legal traditions currently operative in the society, i. e., adat law, Islamic law and civil law. Socio-political factors are shown to have much influenced the relations between state and non-state laws. The state's strategy of accommodation of legal pluralism has in fact largely depended {{on the extent to which}} those legal traditions have been able to conform to national ideology. Certain "national legal postulates" have functioned as a yardstick by which the country's legislative and judicial institutions have measured the extent of their accommodation of legal pluralism, although they have had little choice but to do so. Influenced by Masaji Chiba's theory of "three levels of law" (i. e., official law, unofficial law and legal postulates), this thesis analyzes two aspects of legal pluralism in Indonesia: the political and "conflictual" domains of legal pluralism. The analysis is thus generally based on the state policy of legal pluralism reflected in the legal and political strategies confronting the issue of unofficial laws as well as the conflicts arising from such situations. The first aspect is addressed by looking at a number of statutes and regulations promulgated specifically to deal with Islamic law and adat law, while the second is analyzed in terms of actual cases of private interpersonal law arising from conflict between state and non-state legal traditions, as reflected in legislation and court decisions. From a discussion of these two aspects, the thesis concludes that, although the form of the relations between official and unofficial laws may have changed in conjunction with the socio-political situation of the country, the logic behind legal pluralism has in fact never altered, i. e., to use law as a tool of state modernism. Thus conflicts arising from the encounter between different legal traditions will usually be resolved by means of "national legal postulates," making the unofficial laws <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> the <b>state's</b> domination of legal interpretation and resolution...|$|R
