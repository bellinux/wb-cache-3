40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of commercial <b>mayonnaises</b> is investigated {{by means of}} a squeeze flow rheometer. Theoretical study is based on plastic flow analysis. Data analysis of this test shows that the <b>mayonnaises</b> behaviour at low shear rate is mainly plastic. Result analysis allows differentiating the material rheological response and the material friction effect on the plates. Results highlight the influence of the boundary conditions and roughness conditions. The increasing of compression speed changes the value of apparent plastic yield value and the friction yield value. A tribological law links friction stress and sliding velocity. The interface effects are not the same for all the tested <b>mayonnaises.</b> A probable change of internal structure explains this phenomenon. Finally, the simple compression test proved suitable for food materials characterisation. ...|$|R

5|$|The company {{introduced}} its first broiled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, in 1990. The sandwich included a dill-ranch <b>mayonnaise</b> and was {{served on a}}n oat-bran roll. In 1998, BK reformulated the BK Broiler into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich: a larger chicken patty with <b>mayonnaise</b> served on a Whopper bun. In 2002, BK changed {{the name of the}} sandwich to Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich. The company replaced the Chicken Whopper line with another broiled sandwich line in 2003, the BK Baguette line. The chicken sandwich, served on a fresh cooked baguette roll, and came in several varieties, all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were low in fat. They were sold in the United States at one time, but are now sold only in the European market. The failed Baguette line was replaced in North America with the current grilled chicken iteration, the TenderGrill sandwich.|$|E

40|$|Texture and {{mouthfeel}} {{sensations of}} {{three groups of}} semisolid foodstuffs (<b>mayonnaises</b> and dressings, custard desserts and warm sauces) were characterised, measured, evaluated and compared based on quantitative descriptive sensory analysis of commercial products. Six groups of texture attributes were generated and used by the sensory panel. These were related to: viscosity, surface feel, bulk homogeneity, adhesion/cohesion, wetness-dryness and fat.

The importance of the attributes for each product category is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The sensory {{components}} of creamy mouthfeel in commercial <b>mayonnaises,</b> custard desserts and sauces were determined, using multi-variate {{analysis of the}} mean sensory ratings obtained from a quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) panel. Creamy is a particularly interesting attribute, as it is generally well correlated with consumer preference. Texture attributes which were found to contribute positively to creamy mouthfeel included thick, airy, smooth and fatty mouth- or afterfeel, negative contributions were found for rough, heterogeneous, grainy and melting mouth- or afterfeel. Odour (assessed before ingestion) and non-texture trigeminal attributes {{had little or no}} effect on creamy mouthfeel, taste/flavour attributes (assessed while the product is in the mouth) did affect creamy mouthfeel, in some cases positively (caramel flavour) and in some cases negatively (broth and cheese flavour). The use of noseclips or the addition of a flavouring substance, confirmed that olfactory cues and/or intranasal sensations have an effect on creamy mouthfee...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{and model}} <b>mayonnaises</b> varying in fat content and type {{and amount of}} {{thickener}} were characterized by sensory analysis, rheological measurements and novel instrumental measurements covering other physicochemical properties and/or reflecting changes of food properties during oral processing. Predictions of texture attributes by rheological measurements were analyzed and compared with predictions by rheological measurements combined with novel measurements. Most of the texture attributes were predicted well by rheological parameters alone. Parameters from other instrumental measurements played a small complementary role, except in the predictions {{of most of the}} afterfeel attributes. Most important were rheometry at large deformation and in the nonlinear regime of the dynamic stress sweep and two novel measurements reflecting the effect of saliva: turbidity of rinse water and viscosity with added saliva. Tan † at 500 % strain, reflecting the fluid-like character of the samples during high-strain dynamic flow, relates best to creaminess and other texture attributes. © 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
5|$|Crab dip, {{sometimes}} referred to as Maryland crab dip, is a thick, creamy dip that is typically prepared from cream cheese and lump crab meat. Other primary ingredients such as <b>mayonnaise</b> may be used. Various types of crab preparations, species and superfamilies are used, as are a variety of added ingredients. It is typically served hot, although cold versions also exist. Hot versions are typically baked or broiled. It is sometimes served as an appetizer. Accompaniments may include crackers and various breads. Some U.S. restaurants offer crab dip, commercially produced varieties exist, and some stadiums offer it as a part of their concessions.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with <b>mayonnaise,</b> ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|Other LTO {{products}} {{sought to}} expand existing product lines with new base ingredients. The company's 1992 offering, a Meatloaf Specialty Sandwich, was introduced {{as part of}} a push into limited table service. Other LTO variants in its Specialty Sandwich line included an Italian sausage sandwich served in one of three ways: with onions and peppers; parmigiana-style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce; or with all four ingredients. Steak sandwiches were made from steak fillets or later, restructured beef. Other offerings were a ham and cheese sandwich with <b>mayonnaise,</b> lettuce, and tomato, and a veal parmigiana sandwich.|$|E
40|$|Perceived fattiness and creaminess plus other {{texture and}} flavor {{attributes}} were assessed {{for a group}} of vanilla custard desserts, white sauces, and <b>mayonnaises</b> that differed widely in ingredients, fat content (0 - 72 %), and consumption temperatures. In addition, the foods were measured instrumentally with regard to their lubricative properties, infra-red reflectance and turbidity of rinse water. Despite the variety in foods, fat content showed strong correlations with the instrumental measures, and perceived fattiness, and weaker but still significant correlations with creamy mouth and after-feel. Friction and infra-red reflectance demonstrated that properties of the surface of the oral food bolus are important for fat-related attributes via mechanisms such as lubrication. Turbidity of rinse water suggested that properties of the bulk of the food bolus are important as well. Creamy after-feel related less well to instrumental measures, fat content and other sensory attributes suggesting that the creaminess of oral coatings is not only affected by fat but also by other unknown properties. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the effect of oral {{processes}} on perception, we defined a set of five specific oral manipulations and investigated their effects on the perception of low and high fat versions of two semi-solid foodstuffs, vanilla custard desserts and <b>mayonnaises.</b> Behavior modifications ranged from simply placing the stimulus {{on the tip of}} the tongue to vigorously moving it around in the mouth. Sensory ratings for mouth-feel and flavor attributes were made 5 s after placing the stimulus in the mouth, and after-feel attributes were rated immediately after swallowing. Most attributes showed a similar pattern, with lowest attribute ratings where the tongue's movement was restricted and gradually increasing ratings with increasing complexity of the tongue movements. An individual's normal oral processing behavior typically resulted in the most intense sensations of flavor and mouth-feel. Residence time for all mouth-feel attributes, except prickling, was determined by the time required for tongue movements. The exact tongue movements required for sensations appeared to be related to food groups and individual foods, rather than to specific mouth-feel attributes...|$|R
2500|$|Melted butter {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the preparation of sauces, most obviously in French cuisine. Beurre noisette (hazelnut butter) and Beurre noir (black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of vinegar or lemon juice. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are emulsions of egg yolk and melted butter; they are in essence <b>mayonnaises</b> made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful emulsifiers in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own. Beurre blanc (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. Beurre monté (prepared butter) is melted but still emulsified butter; it lends its name to the practice of [...] "mounting" [...] a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.|$|R
