40|$|In {{order to}} raise {{sugarcane}} productivity and milling yield, {{it must be}} applied a <b>mobile</b> <b>sprayer</b> machine in asugarcane dry land to apply nutrition droplets on plants rows that it can follows vegetative and generative plantsgrowths until nearly harvesting time. The objective of the research was to design a <b>mobile</b> <b>sprayer</b> machine. Resultof the design was a prototype A (<b>mobile</b> <b>sprayer</b> machine based on a motorcycle). Test result of the prototype Ashowed that spraying flow rate increased from 3. 79 6. 71 l/minute by increasing liquid pressure from 2 7 kgf/cm 2,so that operating time of the machine with 50 l capacity were 7. 46 13. 20 minutes. Test result in the PG Subangsugarcane area showed that the prototype A was difficult to control, but it still could accelerate on between plantsrows with average forward speed of 0. 32 0. 76 m/second. It were operated on liquid load of 100 and 50 kg. Theprototype A was changed by a prototype B (<b>mobile</b> <b>sprayer</b> machine based on tri-cycle motorbike). Test result inthe PG Subang sugarcane area showed that the prototype B could accelerate smoothly with forward speed of 2. 15 m/second on a flat area, but it just had capability to accelerate with average forward speed of 0. 24 m/second when itwas applied on three-months ratoon plants rows area...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNational {{policies}} in Europe aim to reduce use of pesticides. Grapevine receives yearly many sprayings. There {{is a great}} variety of sprayers available for vineyards. We can sum up ques-tions addressed to research bodies by the following issues. Is it possible to sort out sprayers and practices according to crop protection and environmental performances? How much is it possible to save on amounts of chemicals sprayed when one uses an efficient sprayer? The present contribution to this research is based on a 4 rows, 10 meters length, physical full scale model of a vineyard. The Evasprayviti model of a vineyard row was designed to repro-duce different foliage volume and densities and to simulate the interaction of the canopy with the flow of plant protection product and air emitted by a <b>mobile</b> <b>sprayer.</b> It comprises a col-lecting device, and a complementary structure on each side of it. The collecting device ena-bles accurate and repeatable sampling of the spray deposits. It is composed of plastic sheets that simulate leaves, attached to vertical aluminium posts. The complementary structure pre-vents perturbative effects on the spray flow on the edges of the collecting device. Evasprayviti can be configured to simulate different growth stages (Codis&al, 2013). The test spray is a mix of a tracer, Tartrazine, and water. A standard pneumatic sprayer, an airblast sprayer and an air-assisted face to face sprayer were tested. The pneumatic sprayer was tested in 3 configurations, for spraying respectively 2, 3 and 4 rows at a time. The face to face sprayer and the airblast sprayer were configured to be used to spray 3 rows and 2 rows, respectively. The amount of product deposited in the canopy and its distribution according to depth and height of leaves was studied for early, intermediate and full growth stage, with respective Leaf Area Index (LAI) values of 0. 24, 0. 88 and 1. 68 ha/ha. The sampling of a cross-section of the collecting device was divided in compartments (3 depths x 3 heights at full growth stage). Deposits on rows close to sprayer and on rows next to sprayer were compared when relevant. The mass of deposits per unit of leaf surface, normalised by amount sprayed per hectare of ground, was measured for each compartment. For precision assessment, this normalised deposit was divided by the reference potential deposit on the target, which is cal-culated for each growth stage according to the hypothesis that all the spray is homogeneous-ly deposited in the compartments. Results showed different deposition profiles, which are discussed. The face to face sprayer exhibited the best efficiency and homogeneity in full and intermediate growth stage, and best efficiency on early stage as well, with homogeneity comparable to the pneumatic sprayer's on this stage. The airblast sprayer used on two rows had a good overall efficiency for early and intermediate stages but a bad homogeneity at all stages...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—For the {{diffusion}} control problem, this paper con-siders spraying control via {{a group of}} networked mobile robots equipped with chemical neutralizers, known as smart <b>mobile</b> <b>sprayers</b> or actuators, in a domain of interest having static mesh sensor network for concentration sensing. The major contribution {{of this paper is}} the investigation of the problem of information sharing and consensus when using centroidal Voronoi tessellations algorithm to control a diffusion process. The information is shared not only on where to spray but also on how much to spray among the mobile actuators. Benefits from using information sharing and information consensus seeking are demonstrated in simulation results.

40|$|Abstract—When {{a team of}} {{networked}} <b>mobile</b> actuators (<b>sprayers)</b> {{are used}} to control the diffusion process in a region of interest {{with the help of}} the static mesh sensor networks, the question on how to group the mobile actuators into smaller subgroups is investigated in this paper to check the performance change under various grouping strategies. Our actuator path planning is based on the so-called Central Voronoi Tessellations (CVT) technique. Via extensive simula-tion studies, we found that, under the same total actuation resources, it is not definite to tell if the larger number of subgroups corresponds to a better performance.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} trajectory tracking in crops by a weed <b>sprayer</b> <b>mobile</b> robot (WSMR). This problem arises because to fumigate, the robot must follow a predefined path and avoid any obstacles it may encounter. To achieve both trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance, a control scheme based on different behaviours is proposed, which consists essentially of an adaptive controller with a reference model for trajectory tracking and a fuzzy reactive for obstacle avoidance. Each of these controllers is executed according to {{the selection of the}} fuzzy behaviour controller, which uses information delivered by anti-collision sensors located on the robot. As a result of the implementation of this behaviour-based architecture and by means of computer simulations and experimental laboratory tests, the WSMR demonstrates the capability of autonomously following a desired trajectory between the rows of a crop in the presence of obstacles. The results are evaluated by taking into account trajectory tracking curves and the operating requirements of each controller, as well as the application of different errors indices for quantitatively evaluating the proposed control scheme...|$|R
