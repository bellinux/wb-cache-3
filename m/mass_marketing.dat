5|$|Released firstly in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2007 and {{in other}} {{countries}} later in the year, Becoming Jane earned approximately $37 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Hathaway's performance received mixed critical reception, with some reviewers negatively focusing on her nationality and accent. Commentators and scholars have analysed the presence of Austen characters and themes within the film, and also noted the implementation of <b>mass</b> <b>marketing</b> in the film's release.|$|E

40|$|Australia’s <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> fashion labels have {{traditionally}} benefitted from their peripheral location to the world’s fashion centres. Operating a season behind, Australian <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> designers and buyers were well-placed to watch trends play out overseas before testing {{them in the}} Australian marketplace. For this reason, often a designer’s role was to source and oversee the manufacture of ‘knock-offs’, or close copies of Northern hemisphere <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> garments. Both Weller (2007) and Walsh (2009) have commented on this practice. The knock-on effect from this {{continues to be a}} cautious, derivative fashion sensibility within Australian <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> fashion design, where any new trend or product is first tested and proved overseas months earlier. However, there is evidence that this is changing. The rapid online dissemination of global fashion trends, coupled with the Australian consumer’s willingness to shop online, has meant that the ‘knock-off’ is less viable. For this reason, a number of <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> companies are moving away from the practice of direct sourcing and are developing product in-house under a Northern hemisphere model. This shift is also witnessed in the trend for <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> companies to develop collections in partnership with independent Australian designers. This paper explores the current and potential effects of these shifts within Australian <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> design practice, and discusses how they may impact on designers, consumers and on the wider culture of Australian fashion...|$|R

25|$|Cook's {{status as}} one of the South's most famous photographers was due in part to his visit to Fort Sumter on Feb. 8, 1861, which {{resulted}} in the first <b>mass</b> <b>marketing</b> of cartes-de-visite, a photograph of the fort's commander, Maj. Robert Anderson. A successful portrait business that survived the war, and the systematic documentation of Union shelling of Charleston and in particular, Fort Sumter added to Cook's fame. Then, on September 8, 1863 he and business partner James Osborn photographed the inside of Fort Sumter, and as luck would have it, also captured the developing naval action in the harbor, Federal ironclads firing on Fort Moultrie.|$|E
25|$|Colt's {{methods were}} at the {{forefront}} of the Industrial Revolution, and his successes secured Hartford's place as a major 19th century manufacturing center. It is estimated that his company produced over 400,000 revolvers in its first 25 years of manufacturing. His use of interchangeable parts helped him become one of the first to exploit the assembly line. Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements, and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising, product placement, and <b>mass</b> <b>marketing.</b> His business practices were also innovative, involving a shrewd use of patents to protect his products, as well as new developments in marketing and business organization to create a highly successful business which long outlived him.|$|E
500|$|The {{implementation}} of <b>mass</b> <b>marketing</b> in the film's production and release has attracted notice from film and literary scholars. Dianne F. Sadoff writes that Becoming Jane [...] "confirms the two-decades-long megaplexing of Jane Austen." [...] According to Andrew Higson, {{the film was}} another example of [...] "Austen Power" [...] and the desire of filmmakers to [...] "exploit the possibilities of both the Austen industry and the market for literary cinema and television – and more generally, the market for 'traditional' English drama." [...] While reviewing Austen adaptations of the 1990s and 2000s in her book Heritage Film: Nation, Genre and Representation, author Belén Vidal viewed Becoming Jane as yet another [...] "transformation of Austen's novels into icons of popular culture." [...] To Vidal, this and other productions, such as The Jane Austen Book Club (2007) and Miss Austen Regrets (2008), confirmed [...] "the generic status of the Austen phenomenon whilst dispensing with the incorporation of the literary text." ...|$|E

500|$|LARP is {{not well}} known in most {{countries}} and is sometimes confused with other role-playing, reenactment, costuming, or dramatic activities. While fan and gamer culture in general has become increasingly mainstream in developed countries, LARP has often not achieved {{the same degree of}} cultural acceptability. This may be due to intolerance of the resemblance to childhood games of pretend, a perceived risk of over-identification with the characters, and the absence of <b>mass</b> <b>marketing.</b> In US films such as the 2006 documentary Darkon, the 2007 documentary Monster Camp, and the 2008 comedy Role Models, fantasy LARP is depicted as somewhat ridiculous and escapist, but also treated affectionately as a [...] "constructive social outlet". In the Nordic countries, LARP has achieved a high level of public recognition and popularity. It is often shown in a positive light in mainstream media, with an emphasis on the dramatic and creative aspects. However, even in Norway, where LARP has greater recognition than in most other countries, it has still not achieved full recognition as a cultural activity by government bodies.|$|E

[...] Successful genre cycles in the late 1990s and early 2000s have included: American-styled, high-tech action pictures such as Downtown Torpedoes (1997), Gen-X Cops and Purple Storm (both 1999); the [...] "Triad kids" [...] subgenre launched by Young and Dangerous (1996); yuppie-centric romantic comedies like The Truth About Jane and Sam (1999), Needing You...

Playing recorded music for dancing and parties rose with the <b>mass</b> <b>marketing</b> of home phonographs in the late 19th century, and Jimmy Savile is credited with hosting the first live DJ dance party in 1943. Savile is also credited as the first to present music in continuous play by using multiple turntables. In 1947, the Whiskey A Go-Go opened in Paris as the first discoteque. In the 1960s, Rudy Bozak began making the first DJ mixers, mixing consoles specialized for DJing.|$|E

Stereotypes {{centered}} around the negative connotations of blacks having dark skin, nappy hair, and other physical attributes. The specific female and male stereotypes were generally known as: the Sambo, the Mammy, and the Uncle Tom. The Mammy is represented by the fat, nurturing, black female domestic worker. Uncle Tom, is the elderly, submissive, male servant. Blanche and Nate view their role as the Mammy and Uncle Tom separate from their true identities.

2500|$|Many bands gained {{exposure}} {{through the}} show, which caused {{an increase in}} sales of their music.

However, not all bands were keen to feature on the show. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah were asked to perform, but they turned it down because they were worried that it could diminish their credibility. Some fans and critics echoed that sentiment by stating that such appearances and <b>mass</b> <b>marketing</b> techniques are creating sell-outs.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{located in}} the Northern Transversal Strip, {{the valley of the}} Polochic River was {{inhabited}} since ancient times by k'ekchí and P'okomchi people. In {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, President Justo Rufino Barrios (1835–1885) began the allocation of land in the area to German farmers. Decree 170 (or decree of Census Redemption Decree) facilitated the expropriation of Indian land in favor of the Germans, because it promoted the auction of communal lands. [...] Since that time, the main economic activity was export-oriented, especially coffee, bananas and cardamom. [...] The communal property, dedicated to subsistence farming, became private property led to the cultivation and <b>mass</b> <b>marketing</b> of agricultural products.

2500|$|According to Stollznow (2010) [...] "Bandler and Grinder's infamous Frogs into Princes {{and their}} other books boast that NLP is a cure-all that treats {{a broad range}} of {{physical}} and mental conditions and learning difficulties, including epilepsy, myopia and dyslexia. With its promises to cure schizophrenia, depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and its dismissal of psychiatric illnesses as psychosomatic, NLP shares similarities with Scientology and the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR)." [...] A systematic review of experimental studies by Sturt et al (2012) concluded that [...] "there is little evidence that NLP interventions improve health-related outcomes." [...] In his review of NLP, Stephen Briers writes, [...] "NLP is not really a cohesive therapy but a ragbag of different techniques without a particularly clear theoretical basis... evidence base is virtually non-existent." [...] Eisner writes, [...] "NLP appears to be a superficial and gimmicky approach to dealing with mental health problems. Unfortunately, NLP appears to be the first {{in a long line of}} <b>mass</b> <b>marketing</b> seminars that purport to virtually cure any mental disorder...it appears that NLP has no empirical or scientific support as to the underlying tenets of its theory or clinical effectiveness.

2500|$|The {{marketing}} management school, {{evolved in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s, is fundamentally linked with the marketing mix framework, a business tool used in marketing and by marketers. In his paper [...] "The Concept of the Marketing Mix", Neil H. Borden reconstructed {{the history of the}} term [...] "marketing mix". [...] He started teaching the term after an associate, James Culliton, described the role of the marketing manager in 1948 as a [...] "mixer of ingredients"; one who sometimes follows recipes prepared by others, sometimes prepares his own recipe as he goes along, sometimes adapts a recipe from immediately available ingredients, and at other times invents new ingredients no one else has tried. The marketer E. Jerome McCarthy proposed a four Ps classification (Product, Price, Promotion, Place) in 1960, which has since been used by marketers throughout the world. Robert F. Lauterborn proposed a four Cs classification (Consumer, Price, Promotion, Place) in 1990 which is a more consumer-oriented version of the four Ps that attempts to better fit the movement from <b>mass</b> <b>marketing</b> to niche marketing. Koichi Shimizu proposed a 7Cs Compass Model (corporation, commodity, cost, communication, channel, consumer, circumstances) to provide a more complete picture of the nature of marketing in 1981.|$|E
