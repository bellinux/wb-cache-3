25|$|To {{limit the}} {{environmental}} impact of returning the brine to the ocean, it can be diluted with another stream of water entering the ocean, such as the outfall of a wastewater treatment or power plant. With medium to large power plant and desalination plants, the power plant's cooling water flow is likely to be several times larger than that of the desalination plant, reducing the salinity of the combination. Another method to dilute the brine is to mix it via a diffuser in a <b>mixing</b> <b>zone.</b> For example, once a pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor, it can split into many branches, each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length. Mixing can be combined with power plant or wastewater plant dilution.|$|E

A frequently proposed solution to protect the location privacy of mobile nodes suggests changing pseudonyms in regions called <b>mix</b> <b>zones.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel metric based on the mobility profiles of mobile nodes in order to evaluate the mixing effectiveness of possible <b>mix</b> <b>zone</b> locations. Then, as the location privacy achieved with <b>mix</b> <b>zones</b> depends on their placement in the network, we analyze the optimal placement of <b>mix</b> <b>zones</b> with combinatorial optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm maximizes the achieved location privacy {{in the system and}} takes into account the cost induced by <b>mix</b> <b>zones</b> to mobile nodes. By means of simulations, we show that the placement recommended by our algorithm significantly reduces the tracking success of the adversary. ...|$|R

25|$|Not all {{ecosystems}} need groundwater, of course. Some terrestrial ecosystems – for example, {{those of}} the open deserts and similar arid environments – exist on irregular rainfall and the moisture it delivers to the soil, supplemented by moisture in the air. While there are other terrestrial ecosystems in more hospitable environments where groundwater plays no central role, groundwater is in fact fundamental {{to many of the}} world’s major ecosystems. Water flows between groundwaters and surface waters. Most rivers, lakes, and wetlands are fed by, and (at other places or times) feed groundwater, to varying degrees. Groundwater feeds soil moisture through percolation, and many terrestrial vegetation communities depend directly on either groundwater or the percolated soil moisture above the aquifer for at least part of each year. Hyporheic zones (the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> of streamwater and groundwater) and riparian zones are examples of ecotones largely or totally dependent on groundwater.|$|E

A three-dimensional model for mixing process was simulated. The effected parameters are rotation speed and impeller diameter. Continuity, momentum, and turbulent equations were solved by ANSYS package software 5. 4 code with FLOTRAN/CFD based on Finite Element method. In the experimental work, two visualization methods are used in this work, the first method is the acid-base reaction visualization method and the second is the particle distribution visualization method.

40|$|Glaciological {{processes}} at grounding lines, which divide {{floating ice}} shelves from grounded ice sheets, may strongly influence the dynamics {{and evolution of}} inland ice. Therefore, understanding the oceanic forcing on ice shelves in this region is of importance to predictions of cryospheric change and sea level rise. As the ocean cavity shallows toward the grounding line, tidal mixing becomes proportionately more important until a tidal front forms, beyond which the water properties are vertically homogenized. The extent of this <b>mixed</b> <b>zone</b> is relevant to several questions because a fully mixed region behaves differently to the stratified ocean offshore. In this study a highly simplified one-dimensional model is {{used to examine the}} size, properties, and sensitivities of the <b>mixed</b> <b>zone.</b> The model suggests that most grounding line <b>mixed</b> <b>zones</b> are small, implying that the usual models representing a stratified ocean are generally valid if tidal mixing is also taken into account. Modeled <b>mixed</b> <b>zones</b> can be significant in near-freezing regions with vigorous tides and a shallowly sloping cavity, but even these areas are smaller than previously proposed. It therefore seems that upwelling of warm water, rather than <b>mixing</b> in tidal <b>zones,</b> generally maintains ice shelf basal melting near grounding lines. Where <b>mixed</b> <b>zones</b> are present, the model suggests that they insulate the grounding line from offshore ocean waters. The model illustrates the origin of Ice Shelf Water plumes and confirms that unlike elsewhere in the cavity, melting in the <b>mixed</b> <b>zone</b> increases linearly in response to ocean warming...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Privacy {{protection}} is of critical concern to Location-Based Service (LBS) users in mobile networks. Long-term pseudonyms, although {{appear to be}} anonymous, in fact em-power third-party service providers to continuously track users’ movements.

A mathematical model is presented that treats the deployment of multiple <b>mix</b> <b>zones</b> as a cost constrained optimization problem.

40|$|Abstract. Users {{of mobile}} {{networks}} can change their identifier in regions called <b>mix</b> <b>zones</b> {{in order to}} defeat the tracking of their location by third parties. <b>Mix</b> <b>zones</b> must be carefully deployed in the network {{to reduce the cost}} induced on mobile users and to provide high location privacy. Unlike most previous work that considers a global adversary, we consider a local adversary equipped with multiple eavesdropping stations. We study the interaction between the local adversary deploying eavesdropping stations to track mobile users and mobile users deploying <b>mix</b> <b>zones</b> to protect their location privacy. We use a game-theoretic model to predict the strategies of both players. We derive the strategies at equilibrium in complete and incomplete information scenarios and propose an algorithm to compute the equilibrium. Finally, based on real road traffic information, we numerically quantify the effect of complete and incomplete information on the strategies of mobile users and of the adversary. In complete information scenarios, mobile users and the adversary tend to adopt complementary strategies: users place <b>mix</b> <b>zones</b> where there is no eavesdropping station, and vice versa. In incomplete information scenarios, the location privacy level achieved by mobile users depends on their level of uncertainty about the strategy of the adversary. ...|$|R

50|$|Like most {{gasoline}} stoves, the Svea 123 uses {{an inverted}} bell-shaped burner {{topped with a}} flame spreader (sometimes called a “target burner” or “plate burner” design). As the vaporized fuel exits the jet, it shoots upward and strikes {{the bottom of the}} flame spreader, where it mixes with air that is drawn into the burner housing by convection and, more importantly at higher flow rates, by Bernoulli effect entrainment. The air/fuel mixture flows around the bottom of the flame spreader where it burns with a blue flame. In this type of burner design, flame efficiency depends on how fast the vaporized fuel strikes the flame spreader and on how well the air and vaporized fuel mixes beneath the flame spreader (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel <b>mixing</b> <b>zone).</b> As a result, this design works best at high fuel output levels; efficient combustion is indicated by a blue flame. As the fuel output is decreased (i.e., when the control valve is turned down) the velocity with which the fuel exits the jet is also decreased, and fuel mixing (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel <b>mixing</b> <b>zone)</b> is likewise decreased.
