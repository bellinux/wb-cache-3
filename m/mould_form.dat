50|$|The dimorphic form of {{the species}} mainly exists and grows vegetatively as either a {{filamentous}} hyphae (<b>mould</b> <b>form)</b> or as spherical yeast (yeast form). However, the organism is best known from the <b>mould</b> <b>form</b> which is characterised by the production of asexual reproductive state consisting of tall (up to 2 cm) needle-like sporangiophores with an apical swelling enclosed by a large sporangium filled with ellipsoidal, single-celled, smooth-walled, unpigmented sporangiospores. In the laboratory, the fungus forms dark grey or light grey colonies on most common laboratory media. If subjected to anaerobic conditions, the fungus may convert to the yeast-like form. Anaerobic conditions and 30% carbon dioxide presence stimulate conversion to yeast form. Likewise, cultures supplemented with Tween 80, ergosterol and supplied with 100% nitrogen also converted to yeast. Conversely, increasing oxygen concentration will cause conversion of the yeast form to the <b>mould</b> <b>form.</b> Like many zygomycetes, M. racemosus reproduces both sexually and asexually depending on environmental conditions. During sexual reproduction, hyphae of compatible mating types touch and fuse, ultimately giving rise to a thick-walled zygosporangium containing a single zygospore. Germination from the zygospore leads to growth of new hyphae {{that give rise to}} asexual spores of both + and - mating type. Germination of these spores produces new haploid hyphae of the same mating type.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The article {{deals with}} the mould cooling system design. The goal of design {{presented}} in the article was to propose the <b>mould</b> <b>form</b> so to be achieved the shortest time for both mould filling and product cooling. Studied product is intended {{to serve as a}} stopper in the automotive spotlight. After filling of mould cavity, the melt has to cool at 100 ° C, only then it is possible to accede to the next phase, which is final pressure. So the cooling and filling time is directly proportional to the reduction of production cost. 3 D model of the mould was created in Autodesk Inventor Proffesional software and then solidification of material was simulated in Autodesk Moldflow Insight software. There were considered four types of cooling system in the article and the best one from the view of time was manufactured and placed into the injection moulding machine Arburg Allrounder 320 C...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The project {{shows the}} results of {{researches}} {{of the flow of}} polymer materials during the filling the mould. The main purpose of carry out research was estimate the influence thermal conditions of the mould on the temperature profile of injection moulded parts. Design/methodology/approach: The most important issues like injection moulding process and the conditions of this process are covered in article. Moreover, the computer system used in the process of material conversion like Cadmould- 3 D by SIMCON is analysed in this work. The simulation of the injection moulding process is done with the variety of different parameters of conversion. The aim of this simulation was to present the distribution of the temperature in the moulded piece. The cooling system of the injection moulding form was taken into analysis during this simulation. Findings: The results of researches enabled documentation of specific occurrences in injectionmolding process of polymer materials and comparison of those results with {{the results of}} numericalcalculations. Research limitations/implications: Research was limited to a three thermoplastics polymers. Carrying out of simulation of injection process require data input concerning geometrical parameters of moulded piece, conditions of injection process,properties of processed plastic and data referring to injection machine into calculating program. Practical implications: The investigation delivered information about temperature profile of moulded piece in thermostatic <b>mould</b> <b>form,</b> what can be useful in practice, when selecting the material for good quality parts. Originality/value: In result of carried out computer simulations, extensive research material was obtained, which was subjected into detailed analysis in order to its adequate interpretation...|$|E

40|$|One {{major goal}} of the {{research}} project was the development and definition of a neutral data model for ship <b>moulded</b> <b>forms</b> based on the international standard STEP/EXPRESS (ISO 10303). Other work concerned neutral modelling of CFD (Computerised Fluid Dynamics) information and towing tank results related to ship <b>moulded</b> <b>forms</b> using the same methodology. On {{the basis of these}} models processor software has been developed and implemented in order to interpret neutral files and to interface to specific application software packages (NAPA, Unigraphics, E 4) and formals (VDAFS, IGES). Software development took as much as possible advantage from modern software tools related to STEP/EXPRESS. Validation of concepts and data models was achieved by applying the method to actual ship <b>moulded</b> <b>forms</b> data stemming from a shipyard design (BV 3000). Data were transmitted from the originating software system (NAPA, E 4) to a different receiving system (Unigraphics). Communication between systems was established via the 'EDI-Manager' communication platform developed in another ITiS project (ITiS- 3). (orig.)
