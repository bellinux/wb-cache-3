40|$|There is a {{critical}} need to understand why <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> are deleterious. The deleterious effects of <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> are commonly attributed to their impact on primary amino acid sequence and protein structure. However, several {{recent studies have shown}} that some <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> are deleterious because they disturb cis-acting splicing elements—so-called “exonic splicing enhancers” (ESEs). It is not clear whether the ESE-related deleterious effects of <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> are common. We have evaluated colocalization of pathogenic <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> (found in affected individuals) with high-score ESE motifs in the human mismatch-repair genes hMSH 2 and hMLH 1. We found that pathogenic <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> in the hMSH 2 and hMLH 1 genes are located in ESE sites significantly more frequently than expected. Pathogenic <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> also tended to decrease ESE scores, thus leading to a higher propensity for splicing defects. In contrast, nonpathogenic <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> (polymorphisms found in unaffected individuals) and nonsense mutations are distributed randomly in relation to ESE sites. Comparison of the observed and expected frequencies of <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> in ESE sites shows that pathogenic effects of ⩾ 20 % of mutations in hMSH 2 result from disruption of ESE sites and disturbed splicing. Similarly, pathogenic effects of ⩾ 16 % of <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> in the hMLH 1 gene are ESE related. The colocalization of pathogenic <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> with ESE sites strongly suggests that their pathogenic effects are splicing related...|$|R

5|$|W2 {{is found}} in Thoroughbred horses descended from KY Colonel, a {{stallion}} born in 1946. While KY Colonel {{was described as a}} chestnut with extensive white markings, he is known for siring a family of pure white horses through his white daughter, White Beauty, born in 1963. The W2 allele is also linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism (c.1960G>A), but it is a <b>missense</b> <b>mutation</b> located on Exon17.|$|E

This mutation is also an SNP (c.1805C>T), a <b>missense</b> <b>mutation</b> on Exon12.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMissense {{mutations}} and intronic {{mutations in}} {{the gene for}} microtubule-associated protein tau cause frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP- 17).

We report here an additional effect of several <b>missense</b> <b>mutations,</b> namely the stimulation of heparin-induced filament assembly of recombinant tau, {{despite the absence of}} any change in structure indicated by circular dichroism. These findings indicate that <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> in tau lead to frontotemporal dementia through potentially multiple mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In the {{analysis}} of genes associated with predispositions to malignancy the causative status of mutations can be made relatively easily where {{it is obvious that}} there is a clear disruption in the coding sequence of the gene. Difficulties arise, however, if <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> are identified, as these are not easily categorised into genetic variants that are not associated with disease risk or into clearly causative changes that impart a significant risk of disease. As more individuals are subject to DNA sequence analysis for the identification of causative changes in genes associated with cancer predisposition, an increasing number of <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> are being identified. Causative status assignment to <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> continues to be problematic especially where no functional assessment of the alteration can be made. As more information is gathered on <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> our predictive ability to assign significance will improve. In this report we review, in broad terms, what measures can be undertaken to categorise <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> into those that are clearly causative, probably causative and most likely not causative. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene are {{frequent}} in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). Nonsense and frameshift mutations abrogate {{the function of}} the VHL protein (pVHL), whereas <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> can have different effects. To identify those <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> with functional consequences, we sequenced VHL in 256 sporadic ccRCC and identified 187 different VHL mutations of which 65 were <b>missense</b> <b>mutations.</b> Location and destabilizing effects of VHL <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> were determined in silico. The majority of the thermodynamically destabilizing <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> were located in exon 1 in the core of pVHL, whereas protein surface mutations in exon 3 affected the interaction domains of elongin B and C. Their impact on pVHL's functionality was further investigated in vitro by stably reintroducing VHL <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> into a VHL null cell line and by monitoring the green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals after the transfection of a hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) ?-GFP expression vector. pVHL's functionality ranged from no effect to complete HIF stabilization. Interestingly, Asn 78 Ser, Asp 121 Tyr, and Val 130 Phe selectively influenced HIF 1 ? and HIF 2 ? degradation. In summary, we obtained three different groups of missense mutations: one with severe destabilization of pVHL; a second without destabilizing effects on pVHL but relevance for the interaction with HIF?, elongin B, and elongin C; and a third with pVHL functions comparable with wild type. We therefore conclude that the specific impact of <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> may help to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations and may explain responses of ccRCC patients to HIF-targeted therapies...|$|R
5|$|Most of the cancer-causing {{mutations}} {{cause the}} protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus. The C-terminal end of folliculin has {{shown to be}} the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway. FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a <b>missense</b> <b>mutation</b> in some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at this position {{is found to be}} conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating {{that it is important to}} the protein's function.|$|E
5|$|New Forest ponies have {{a gentle}} {{temperament}} and {{a reputation for}} intelligence, strength, and versatility. On the whole, they are a sturdy and hardy breed. The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital myotonia, a muscular condition also found in humans, dogs, cats, and goats. It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009, after a clinically affected foal {{was presented to the}} Equine Clinic of Utrecht University. DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a <b>missense</b> <b>mutation</b> in the gene encoding CLCN1, a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle. The mutated allele was found in both the foal's parents, its siblings, and two other related animals, none of whom exhibited any clinical signs. The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, whereby both parents have to contribute the mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype. The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin: the founder of the mutated gene, as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion. The probable founder stallion has been identified as Kantje's Ronaldo; testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the mutated gene. All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding & Cattle Society's stud book, and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested, whether or not they descend from Kantje's Ronaldo, to cover the possibility that the mutated gene may have appeared earlier in the pedigree, although it is believed that the mutated gene has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock. All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested.|$|E

40|$|Heterozygous {{germline}} {{mutations in}} fumarate hydratase (FH) predispose to the multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis syndrome (MCUL), which, when co-existing with renal cancer, {{is also known}} as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. Twenty-seven distinct <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> represent 68 % of FH mutations reported in MCUL. Here we show that FH <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> significantly occurred in fully conserved residues and in residues functioning in the FH A-site, B-site, or subunit-interacting region. Of 24 distinct <b>missense</b> <b>mutations,</b> 13 (54 %) occurred in the substrate-binding A-site, 4 (17 %) in the substrate-binding B-site, and 7 (29 %) in the subunit-interacting region. Clustering of <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> suggested the presence of possible mutational hotspots. FH functional assay of lymphoblastoid cell lines from 23 individuals with heterozygous FH <b>missense</b> <b>mutations</b> showed that A-site mutants had significantly less residual activity than B-site mutants, supporting data from Escherichia coli that the A-site is the main catalytic site. <b>Missense</b> FH <b>mutations</b> predisposing to renal cancer had no unusual features, and identical mutations were found in families without renal cancer, suggesting a role for genetic or environmental factors in renal cancer development in MCUL. That all <b>missense</b> FH <b>mutations</b> associating with MCUL/hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer showed diminished FH enzymatic activity suggests that the tumor suppressor role of fumarate hydratase may relate to its enzymatic function...|$|R

A frameshift mutation can drastically change the coding capacity (genetic information) of the message. Small insertions or deletions (those less than 20 base pairs) make up 24% of mutations that manifest in currently recognized genetic disease.|$|E
25|$|Also called Hirschsprung's disease, it is a {{congenital}} {{disorder of}} the colon in which nerve cells of the myenteric plexus in its walls, also known as ganglion cells, are absent. It is a rare disorder (1:5 000), with prevalence among males being four times that of females. Hirschsprung’s disease develops in the fetus {{during the early stages}} of pregnancy. A genetic predisposition to Hirschsprung's disease has been linked to chromosome 13 where a <b>missense</b> <b>mutation</b> at an ultraconserved region impairs functionality of the W276C receptor. Seven other genes seem to be implicated, however. If untreated, the patient can develop enterocolitis.|$|E

25|$|The {{regulation}} of dietary iron absorption {{is complex and}} our understanding is incomplete. One of the better characterized genes responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis is HFE on chromosome 6, which codes for a protein that participates in the {{regulation of}} iron absorption. The HFE gene has two common mutations, C282Y and H63D. The C282Y allele is a transition point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 845 in the HFE gene, resulting in a <b>missense</b> <b>mutation</b> that replaces the cysteine residue at position 282 with a tyrosine amino acid. Heterozygotes for either allele do not manifest clinical iron overload but may display an increased iron uptake.|$|E
25|$|Tay–Sachs disease {{exists in}} Jacob sheep. The {{biochemical}} mechanism for this {{disease in the}} Jacob sheep is virtually identical to that in humans, wherein diminished activity of hexosaminidaseA results in increased concentrations of GM2 ganglioside in the affected animal. Sequencing of the HEXA gene cDNA of affected Jacobs sheep reveal an identical number of nucleotides and exons as in the human HEXA gene, and 86% nucleotide sequence identity. A <b>missense</b> <b>mutation</b> (G444R) {{was found in the}} HEXA cDNA of the affected sheep. This mutation is a single nucleotide change at the end of exon 11, resulting in that exon's deletion (before translation) via splicing. The Tay–Sachs model provided by the Jacob sheep is the first to offer promise as a means for gene therapy clinical trials, which may prove useful for disease treatment in humans.|$|E
25|$|While some {{mutations}} in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, see table 1, {{at least one}} mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for Cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Others include {{the introduction of a}} sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased calcium permeability. When mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability. While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca2+ leads to ACHM, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1 region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface. Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the cone cell's ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other <b>missense</b> <b>mutation</b> outside of the S1 region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.|$|E
