40|$|Administration of pellets in fed stomach {{state can}} prolong the gastric {{emptying}} of pellets {{in comparison to}} the administration under fasting conditions [1]. On the basis of literature data we aimed to investigate the influence of caloric value of food on gastric emptying of pellets. A systematic literature search on evaluation of human gastric emptying of pellets based on the technique of gamma scintigraphy was performed in the MEDLINE database. Studies estimating the gastric emptying of pellets under fedconditions were focused. In addition to the caloric value of the meal, a special attention was made on other factors such as, pellets size and density,pellets formulation (filled into capsules or compressed into tablets),a time delay for pellets administration in relation to the time of meal completion, and refreshments provision. The majority of pellets gastric emptying data was presented in terms of pellets t 50 values - a time when 50 % of the administered pellets emptied the stomach. In order to evaluate the influence of the caloric value of the meal on pellets t 50 values a linear regression model was built. In this model the caloric value was regarded as a categorical variable, which was recorded into dummy variables with the lowest caloric value set as a reference. In total 17 studies were recovered, however,only 6 of them met the selection criteria: pellets density between 1. 2 and 1. 5 g/cm 3, administration of the pellets at the time of meal completion, pellets filled into capsules, and pellets size in the range from 0. 6 to 1. 4 mm. In these studies 48 individual values of pellets t 50 were collected (6 or 8 subjects per study) and the obtained caloric values were 1200, 1500, 2300, 2800, and 3600 kJ. <b>Mean</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>t</b> 50 of pellets administered right after the 1200 kJ meal was 136 min.

No significant difference in terms of mean values of pellets t 50 could be noted between the 1200 kJ meal and 1500 or 2300 kJ meal. Our results suggest that gastric emptying of pellets can be more prolonged if administered along with the food with higher caloric value...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} increased body hair growth in women and serum sex hormone level, body mass index, and clinical signs. Sample and methods The sample group consisted of 186 women, 18 – 35 year old residents of Lithuania who were referred to the Clinic of Endocrinology, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital in 2002 – 2004 and complained for increased body hair growth. Exclusion criteria: 1) taking systemic medications within the period shorter than {{three months before the}} beginning of the study; 2) specific reasons of excessive body hair growth, such as androgen secreting adrenal or ovarian tumors, hyperprolactinemia, Cushing syndrome; 3) thyroid dysfunction. A total number of 37 women were excluded from further study. Statistical analysis was performed on 149 women. Increased body hair growth was assessed using Ferriman-Gallwey (F-G) method. Blood samples were drawn in the morning (08 : 00 – 10 : 00 h), in the early follicular phase, with an exclusion of 7 women with amenorrhea, while the blood sample of 12 women with oligomenorrhea was drawn following at least 2 months after the last menstruation. Serum hormones (total testosterone (T), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), free androgen index (FAI), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) level were measured using the commercial kits. FAI was calculated as follows: T (nmol/l) × 100 / SHBG (nmol/l). Results The significance of correlations between the F-G score and the tested variables decreased in the following order: FAI (r= 0. 470; p= 0. 0000001), T (r= 0. 385; p= 0. 000001), SHBG (r=– 0. 358; p= 0. 000007), and DHEAS (r= 0. 232, p= 0. 004). When F-G score reached 8, there was a significant increase in T level (compared to F-G≤ 7), which remained increased with the further tendency to go up. Although T level significantly increased when it reached F-G score 8, it did not exceed the normal reference value. Although with the increase of F-G score, SHBG mean value was decreasing, there was no overt alteration. With the increase of F-G score FAI mean value has also increased. When F-G score reached 8 there was a more evident FAI increase than similar increase of T level. When F-G score reached 8 then FAI mean value exceeded the normal reference value. With the further increase of F-G score, despite the well–marked dispersion of FAI mean values, FAI value remained higher than normal. In order to {{determine the}} cut–off level of F-G score that associated with statistically significant androgen and SHBG mean value differences, all studied women were divided into four groups according to the level of increased body hair growth. The analysis showed that according to T, SHBG, FAI, and DHEAS level the group F-G≤ 5 did not differ from the group F-G 6 – 7, and the group F-G 8 – 9 did not differ from the group F-G≥ 10. Women with F-G score 8 or higher had significantly higher levels of T, FAI, and DHEAS and lower SHBG level as compared to women with lower F-G score. The significance of correlations between the BMI and the tested variables decreased in the following order: FAI (r= 0. 520; p= 0. 0000001), SHBG (r=– 0. 410; p= 0. 0000001), T (r= 0. 345; p= 0. 00002), DHEAS (r= 0. 234; p= 0. 004) The correlation between BMI and F-G score was significantly positive and expressed moderately (r= 0. 346; p= 0. 00002). The comparison of BMI mean values in the groups of women with different F-G score intervals showed significant BMI mean value differences with the exception of group F-G≤ 5 versus group F-G 6 – 7 (p> 0. 05). These findings demonstrate that women with more increased body hair growth have elevated BMI versus women with the less increased body hair growth (p 0. 05). Significantly more women of group F-G≥ 8 than group F-G 0. 05). Women of group F-G≥ 8 as compared to group F-G< 8 had significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> (1. 66 ± 0. 87 vs. 1. 10 ± 0. 48 nmol/l, p= 0. 00002), DHEAS (7. 78 ± 3. 06 vs. 6. 12 ± 2. 59 µmol/l, p= 0. 0009), and FAI (6. 73 ± 5. 99 vs. 2. 77 ± 1. 93, p= 0. 000004), and lower mean value of SHBG (35. 52 ± 21. 87 vs. 49. 44 ± 21. 73 nmol/l, p= 0. 0002). Conclusions The cut–off level of increased body hair growth, associated with the higher serum androgen (total testosterone, free androgen index, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate) level is F-G score 8. F-G score has the strongest correlation with free androgen index, a weaker one with testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. Increased body weight is associated with higher androgen level and lower level of sex hormone binding globulin. Women with excessive body hair growth (F-G score ≥ 8), compared to the women with less expressed body hair growth (F-G score < 8), had higher body mass index and waist–to–hip ratio (p< 0. 001); higher level of androgens and lower level of sex hormone binding globulin (p< 0. 001); they more frequently had abnormal menstrual cycle and infertility (p< 0. 01) ...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the effects of fume inhalation of oil-based paints on the serum level of thyroid hormones in female and male rats. Materials & Methods: In the experimental study, 15 male and 15 female Wistar rats were studied. The rats were divided into six 5 -rat groups including a control group and groups with either 1 - or 8 -hour a day {{exposure to}} the paint fumes by gender division. The serum levels <b>of</b> <b>T</b> 3, T 4, and TSH thyroid hormones were measured after 10 weeks. Data was analyzed by SPSS 20 software using two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc. Findings: <b>Mean</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> 3 and T 4 hormones were significantly reduced in both 1 - and 8 -hour male and female groups than control group (p< 0. 001). In addition, the more the inhalation time, the more the reduction was. Any reduction in T 3 in females in 1 -hour (p< 0. 001) and 8 –hour (p< 0. 05) groups was significantly more than the males. Nevertheless, a significant reduction in T 4 was only in 1 -hour group (p< 0. 001). Mean TSH hormone was significantly increased due to the inhalation of paint fume than control group (p< 0. 001). In addition, such an increase was significant in the female rats in 8 -hour group than the male group (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: The inhalation of oil-based paint fume leads to a reduction in the serum levels <b>of</b> <b>T</b> 3 and T 4 thyroid hormones, while increases TSH serum level.

40|$|There {{are very}} few reports {{on the effect of}} {{treatment}} with human growth hormone (hGH) of hypopituitarism in {{the first three years of}} life, although early treatment is probably the main requirement for obtaining good end results. Therefore the effect of hGH therapy has been studied retrospectively in six patients (three males) affected by hypopituitarism (multiple deficiency in five) diagnosed in the first two years of life. At the onset of hGH therapy mean age was 16 months (range 5 - 24); the mean dose has been 0, 55 ± 0, 19 (SD) I. U. /Kg/week (range 0, 3 - 0, 7), in three times/week in three subjects, by daily injections in three of them more recently treated. At the age of three years the mean treatment period has been 20 month (rang 12 - 31). Linear growth velocity (GV), in the semester pre-therapy and every six months on therapy, has been calculated in standard deviation score (SDS) for chronological age (CA) and for bone age (BA); moreover for every six-months period <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> 4 and T 3 have been calculated. Four patients achieved a sharp catch-up growth (CA-SDSGV > + 2 DS) both in the first and second six-months; however the CA-SDSGV has been greater than 0, 5 DS in the whole treatment period. T 3 levels correlated with SDSGV for bone age (r = 0, 60; p < 0, 01). Mean length gain achieved on therapy at the age of three years has been greater than 2 DS for chronological age (from - 3, 84 ± 1, 59 SDS to - 1, 07 ± 1, 47) and 0, 5 for bone age (from - 0, 72 ± 1, 47 to - 0, 10 ± 1. 09). Bone age-chronological age ratio has increased from 0, 42 ± 0, 23 at onset to 0, 79 ± 0, 18 at the age of three years.

The animals were offered a concentrate mixture (CM) along with wheat straw (WS), ammoniated wheat straw (AWS) (4 % urea at a 50 % moisture level) and hydrochloric acid treated ammoniated wheat straw (HCl-AWS) (4 % urea at a 50 % moisture level and HCl added to trap 30 % of NH 3 evolved) in groups I, II and III, respectively for an average daily gain (ADG) of 500 g. All the diets were made iso-nitrogenous by preparing three types of concentrate mixtures of different CP levels. The blood was collected from the jugular vein randomly from three animals of each group initially after 8 months post feeding and subsequently after two months interval up to 14 months of experimental feeding. Due to urea ammoniation, the CP content of WS increased from 3. 66 to 8. 51 and was further increased to 11. 35 due to the addition of HCl during urea-ammoniation of wheat straw. The cumulative period <b>mean</b> plasma glucose <b>values</b> (mg %), in group II (53. 13) were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than those in groups I (48. 44) and III (50. 60).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article was to {{evaluate}} whether the anti-inflammatory agent palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) can counteract the increase of intraocular pressure (IOP) that may occur after neodymium-doped: yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser iridotomy. Methods: Fifteen patients underwent bilateral laser iridotomy (Visulas YAG III Laser; Zeiss) for the prevention of primary closed-angle glaucoma. The IOP was measured {{at the beginning of the}} study (t- 1), after 15 days of pretreatment with placebo or PEA (t 0), and at 15, 30, and 120 min after the iridotomy (t 1, t 2, t 3). The pretreatment consisted of 2 tablets of placebo or PEA per day for 15 days.

Analysis of variance/Tukey's test pointed out a significant increase of the postoperative IOP values in placebo pretreated patients (P <= 0. 05), but not in those who were pretreated with PEA. The trend analysis confirmed the significant positive trend in placebo pretreatment. The parallelism test between the 2 regressions showed a significant difference for the slopes (P = 0. 022) and not for the intercepts (P = 0. 520).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder of the airways. The persistence of airway inflammation {{depends on a}} decrease in apoptosis <b>of</b> <b>T</b> lymphocytes and eosinophils and survival of these activated cells. T lymphocytes expressing gamma delta receptors can be identified in human lungs and {{play an important role}} in immune defence against pathogens and in the regulation of chronic inflammation. Aging is associated with evidence of some immune dysregulation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the apoptosis receptors <b>of</b> <b>T</b> lymphocytes in long-lasting asthma, to establish their correlation with activation markers such as CD 25 + and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR+, and to analyze the gama delta T cell expression in this disease. METHODS: A group of 64 individuals (group A) who had had asthma for more than 30 years (mean age [+/-SD] 72 +/- 5 years) and 61 healthy individuals acting as controls [...] group B with 41 individuals (mean age 79 +/- 7 years) and group C with 20 individuals (mean age 38 +/- 12 years) were included in the study. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation and spirometric testing. Peripheral blood cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies anti-CD 3, anti-CD 4, anti-CD 8, anti-CD 25, anti-TCR gamma delta, anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD 95. Statistical comparisons were performed between the asthmatics and the elderly control group and between the elderly control group and the adult control group. RESULTS: The average percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second was 73. 6 gamma delta 25. 3. The <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> cell receptors for asthma group A vs elderly control group B vs adult control group C respectively, were the following: CD 3, 74. 9 +/- 7 vs. 74. 8 +/- 8. 8 (P=ns) vs. 76. 7 +/- 4. 2 (P=ns); CD 4, 48. 8 +/- 8. 7 vs. 43. 5 +/- 10. 2 (P=ns) vs. 44. 8 +/- 3. 8 (P=ns); CD 8, 23. 3 +/- 7. 9 vs. 25. 7 +/- 10. 2 (P=ns) vs. 25. 6 +/- 4. 5 (P=ns); CD 25, 14. 3 +/- 5. 9 vs. 22. 4 +/- 7. 8 (P =. 0001) vs. 5. 5 +/- 2. 4 (P =. 0001); TCR gamma delta, 2. 8 +/- 2. 1 vs. 4. 1 +/- 3. 3 (P <. 05) vs. 4. 6 +/- 2. 1 (P=ns); HLA-DR, 18. 4 +/- 9. 2 vs. 17. 8 +/- 5. 9 (P=ns) vs. 15. 4 +/- 5. 1 (P=ns) and CD 95, 49. 3 +/- 13. 7 vs. 52. 6 +/- 12. 1 (P=ns) vs. 13. 8 +/- 10. 8 (P =. 0001).
