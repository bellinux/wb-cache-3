30|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{evaluate}} the range of technical and economic competitiveness of combined transport, primarily in terms of covered distance, by using a simple method and with the support of realistic data. The simplicity of the method and the related calculations allow a proper dissemination among the actors involved in the decision-making processes (<b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Operators</b> or politicians, for instance). In order to achieve the aim, it is important to consider both the well-known range of convenience of different transport modes and the European environmental constraints that mainly affect the road sector. This analysis can widen the area that can be covered by combined transport, including, for example, the port-hinterland connection and the introduction of electric vehicles to cover road terminations for short haulages, thus reducing the operational costs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{container}} sea–rail <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system faces complex challenges {{with demand}} uncertainties for joint slot allocation and dynamic pricing. The challenge is formulated as a two-stage optimal model based on revenue management (RM) as actual slots sale of multi-node container sea–rail <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> usually includes contract sale to large shippers and free sale to scattered shippers. First {{stage in the}} model utilizes an origin-destination control approach, formulated as a stochastic integer programming equation, to settle long-term slot allocation in the contract market and empty container allocation. Second stage in the model is formulated as a stochastic nonlinear programming equation to solve a multiproduct joint dynamic pricing and inventory control problem for price settling and slot allocation in each period of free market. Considering the random nature of demand, the methods of chance constrained programming and robust optimization are utilized to transform stochastic models into deterministic models. A numerical experiment is presented to verify the availability of models and solving methods. Results of considering uncertain/certain demand are compared, which show that the two-stage optimal strategy integrating slot allocation with dynamic pricing considering random demand is revealed to increase the revenue for <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operators</b> (MTO) while concurrently satisfying shippers' demand. Research resulting from this paper {{will contribute to the}} theory and practice of container sea–rail <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> revenue management and provide a scientific decision-making tool for MTO...|$|R

The carrier does not have to possess all the means of transport, and in practice usually does not; the carriage is often performed by sub-carriers (referred to in legal language as [...] "actual carriers").

40|$|Multimodal {{transportation}} means transporting goods from a pickup point, where the operator receives the goods, {{all the way}} to the delivery location, using at least two different means of transportation, covered under the same multimodal transport contract and by only one document, regardless of the number or type of transportation vehicles used. The key factor to the optimal operation of multimodal transportation is the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operator.</b> It is up to this individual to compensate for various unpredictable circumstances, the complexity of the business processes, nature’s whims and carelessness. He must also organize and execute multimodal transport in all stages. Due to the above mentioned dangers and the fact that the area of liability insurance for multimodal transport operators is still being neglected, this article raises some valid points in favour of a proposal that would cover all of the {{transportation means}} as well as all the accompanying activities with a single insurance policy. The model includes 17 elements of liability insurance for a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operator</b> and all values which quantify the insurance elements in 2009 as well as the projected values for 2015, when progress is expected in the areas pertaining to the implementation of economical processes concerning transit development, as well as values for 2025, representing a period of innovation, reconstruction, optimization and modernization.

In the absence of internationally recognized definitions, the use of expressions such as "Freight Forwarders" or "international Freight Forwarders" is consequently a frequent cause of misunderstanding -and confusion. The recent use of the expression ''Multimodal Transport Operator" (MTO), introduced in the UN Convention on International <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport,</b> further increased the confusion. They are today increasingly taking a carrier's responsibility of offering door-to-door transport operations and, by doing so; they are becoming <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operators.</b> At the time when international transport was confined to port-to-port operations, freight forwarders were considered as subordinates of shipping companies and their agents. With the advent of containerization and the growing demand for tailored transport services, freight forwarders started identifying their role as complementary to modal operators by securing certain continuity in the intermodal movement of goods across borders. Today, they are becoming carriers and their profession is now essential to the international trade of a country.

40|$|Each mode of {{transport}} has their limitation but <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> which combines various transport modes is an alternative solution to breakthrough such limitation by way of synergy. To achieve such synergy, containerization and electronic commerce are, inter alia, the two indispensible factors for the rapid development of the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport.</b> In the modern supply chain operation, containerization facilitates the interchange of goods among different transport modes whereas electronic commerce expedites the documentation flow in a more efficient and secured manners. As a result, <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> has become more efficient than ever so as to create a room for lower transportation cost and shorter travelling time. Nevertheless, {{it is observed that}} the prevailing liability system of the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport,</b> in which, not a single and uniform convention for the international <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> has been in place, is unable {{to keep pace with the}} astonishing growth of the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport.</b> This results in unpredictability and uncertainty as to the obligation and liability of all the parties including shippers, <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operators,</b> carriers and insurance companies. This paper discusses the effectiveness of the Rotterdam Rules which is a maritime-plus convention in <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> to which many attempts such as the <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport</b> Convention 1980 and the UNCTAD/ICC Rules have been taken. To evaluate such effectiveness, a comparative study has been adopted that incorporates three aspects, namely the horizontal comparison with the Hague-Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules, the vertical comparison with the <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport</b> Convention 1980 and the UNCTAD/ ICC Rules and the harmonization comparison with the multimodal aspects of other unimodal conventions. Regarding the first two horizontal and vertical comparisons, they are made on the basis of five multimodal parameters including door-to-door delivery, intermodality, just-in-time delivery, containerization and electronic commerce. Furthermore, a common law case “Quantum Corp Inc and others v Plane Trucking Ltd and another” is selected for the case study on how well the Rotterdam Rules tackled the typical issues of unspecific or optional carriage contracts in the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> if they were put in the real operation. The results show that the “Outward Approach” adopted in the Rotterdam Rules is a feasible alternative different from the traditional “Inward Approach” to regulate the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport.</b> Besides, in view of the recourse action for unlocalized damages, the use of maritime-basis liability amount is seen as the fair balance of interest and risk among the stakeholders. In the comparative and case studies, it is found that the general results are Expand, Possess, Harmonize and Apply (EPHA) in the respective areas of the comparisons and case analysis.

40|$|This paper gives a {{particular}} attention to the handling of the multimodal transport operator’s liability in view of the new legislation in Kosovo, in terms of comparison with international legislation. From the research carried out in this area of transport, it has been found that, over the last decades, the international transport of goods has become more sophisticated and effective, and has increased rapidly because of the increased use of containers. Containers have advanced the flexibility to focus more on an integrated movement of goods instead of the movement specifically associated with a certain mode of transport. Unfortunately, this technical flexibility has been accompanied by a severe rigidity in the legal field in Kosovo as well. Although the transfer of goods from one type of transport to another type of transport has been greatly facilitated {{as a result of the}} container revolution, developments in the area of international and Kosovo legislation in the field of transport have not followed this pace.

Combining private transport and public transport in a truly <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system offers opportunities to capitalise on the strengths of the various systems while avoiding their weaknesses. The requirements for such a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system, however, are high. Travellers have {{to be aware of the}} possibilities to change modes and the related benefit. Thus high quality travel information is crucial. Transfers between transport modes and services should be seamless, setting new standards for the design of transfer nodes and for the synchronisation of time-tabled <b>transport</b> services. <b>Multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> requires new organisational and financial arrangements between all actors involved. The most fundamental component of a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system, however, is the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> network that consists of networks for private transport, public transport, and other transport services that are part of the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system, including of course the transfer possibilities between these networks. This thesis investigates the consequences of multimodal travelling for designing <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> networks. It describes the characteristics of multimodal travel today and assesses its future potential. The analysis focuses on the way transport networks are organised in hierarchical network structures and determines the main mechanisms leading to these hierarchical network structures. Furthermore, an analysis is made of the role in a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system of transport services other than private transport or public transport.

Owing to the increasing use of containers to consolidate cargo, <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> practice has become inevitable in the field of international trade based on its numerous advantages over the traditional unimodal carriage practices. Therefore, the urgent need of an internationally legal instrument to govern liability issues arising from multimodal carriage transactions is highly requested by trading parties. This research, however, present the difficulties involve when trying to establish liability issues arising from multimodal carriage claims and the impact it has on contracting parties who are never certain on which regime their contracts are based, instead depends on already existing unimodal liability regimes to sort out their disputes.
