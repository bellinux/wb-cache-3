50|$|This {{emphasis}} on experience constitutes {{a fundamental shift}} {{in the way in}} which natural history knowledge was accumulated. Traditionally, knowledge was gained by studying the ancient texts and applying the information and formulas found there. Leoniceno’s approach was novel because he suggested that the knowledge of the ancients should be verified by comparing the texts to firsthand observations of the plants that ancient writers described. This approach, while novel, faced several obstacles. First, there was the issue of translation. While Barbaro’s study resolved the philological issues, there was still the question of how to approach the contradictions that translation errors produced. Leoniceno maintained that if Pliny was found to be in error, one should examine the texts of Theophrastus and Dioscorides rather than medieval Arab writers such as Avicenna. Leoniceno’s preference for Greek authors over Arab authors was one of the distinguishing characteristics of his efforts to reform <b>medical</b> <b>pedagogy</b> in the early modern period.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comThe behavioral sciences are taught in medical curricula around the world. In the current paper psychologists teaching in medical schools in Australia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States share their experience and reflections. Whilst direct comparisons between countries are not made, the themes that are evident within and between accounts are instructive. As behavioral scientists around the globe are struggling to maintain a presence in medical education many of the reasons behind this are shared, regardless of the country. Challenges discussed include those related to the impact of unrealized potential contributions of psychologists as health care professionals, teaching of behavioral sciences by other professions, domination of the biomedical model without a corresponding recognition of psychology as science, and modern <b>medical</b> <b>pedagogies</b> such as problem-based learning, which favor biomedicine.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} medical humanities education for students considering careers in healthcare should {{begin at the}} general undergraduate level and should have two primary objectives, (1) providing tools that will help students foster therapeutic, compassionate relationships with their patients, and (2) providing strategies that will help students maintain healthy habits of mind that afford resilience against compassion fatigue. I assert {{that in order for}} students to practice compassion for themselves and others three core objectives must be met. (1) Students must be exposed to the fundamentals of bioethics {{in order to understand the}} virtue of compassion itself, (2) they must develop expertise in the tenets of narrative medicine in order to fully comprehend the causes of suffering in their patients, and (3) they must be introduced to the practice of mindfulness as a means of self-care. The following chapters suggest that literature and the visual arts offer the most effective means of teaching these concepts and present a pedagogy that incorporates traditional academic theory as well as practical application of knowledge. Chapter one introduces the tenets of narrative medicine through the study of Frida Kahlo’s 1932 painting, Henry Ford Hospital. Chapter two explores the concept of empathy, a prerequisite to compassion, using short stories by Eudora Welty and Richard Selzer. Chapter three uses ancient and modern dramatic literature to introduce the fundamentals of bioethics. Chapter four introduces the concepts of mindfulness and creative “flow” and suggests that engagement with and creation of fully abstract visual art helps students experience and practice the healthy states of mind that provide resilience against compassion fatigue.

40|$|Dr. Mahtab JanfadaEnglish for Academic /Specific Purposes courses (EAP/ESP) are {{designed}} {{in response to}} the demand for mastery of academic English for students in order to enter into global communities of professionals. Within the specific educational context of medicine in Iran, English is highly significant as this is the requirement for national and international, as well as academic and professional, contexts of practice. Despite this significance, the current <b>medical</b> English <b>pedagogy</b> in Iran does not afford students sufficient competence and confidence due to what can be problematized as a fragmented, instrumental and monologic curriculum. This project addresses the challenges, and explores the possibilities of teaching English for Medical Purposes (EMP) in an Iranian university through an ‘Integrated, Dialogic’ approach to EMP pedagogy. This approach brings together critical and pragmatic pedagogical paradigms as well as academic and professional discourses of medicine. Grounded in socio-cultural theories of learning and language (Vygotsky, 1986; Bakhtin, 1981), and synthesised through Wertsch’s (1991) concepts of ‘mediated actions’ and ‘appropriation’, this approach examines ‘critical pragmatism’ as advocated by Pennycook (1997), Benesch (2001), and Harwood and Hadley (2004). This aim for integration involves students’ gaining an awareness of ‘self’ as a medical student and a future doctor, scaffolding their understandings of different types of medical discourses and genres in English, and the facilitation of dialogic interactions with peers at local/global levels and clinical communications with patients. Employing a ‘bricolage’ methodology (Levi-Strauss, 1962; Kincheloe, 2001), the study seeks to identify and explain the possible transformations and challenges that medical students experience through this approach and the way they appropriate processes of personal and professional ‘becoming’ (Bakhtin, 1986) as voiced, agentive members of the medical community. Findings have led to the conceptualisation of an ‘Organic Model’ of ESP/EMP pedagogy which goes beyond the dichotomy of the critical and the pragmatic, and sets out a new typology for ESP pedagogy at three levels: linguistic (instrumental), epistemological, and most importantly, ontological. This model encapsulates deeper levels of learning and offers significant implications for curriculum designers, materials developers and ESP/ EAP practitioners worldwide.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Virtual {{worlds are}} rapidly {{becoming}} part of the educational technology landscape. Second Life (SL) {{is one of the best}} known of these environments. Although the potential of SL has been noted for health professions education, a search of the world's literature and of the World Wide Web revealed a limited number of formal applications of SL for this purpose and minimal evaluation of educational outcomes. Similarly, the use of virtual worlds for continuing health professional development appears to be largely unreported. METHODS We designed and delivered a pilot postgraduate medical education program in the virtual world, Second Life. Our objectives were to: (1) explore the potential of a virtual world for delivering continuing medical education (CME) designed for physicians; (2) determine possible instructional designs using SL for CME; (3) understand the limitations of SL for CME; (4) understand the barriers, solutions, and costs associated with using SL, including required training; and (5) measure participant learning outcomes and feedback. We trained and enrolled 14 primary care physicians in an hour-long, highly interactive event in SL on the topic of type 2 diabetes. Participants completed surveys to measure change in confidence and performance on test cases to assess learning. The post survey also assessed participants' attitudes toward the virtual learning environment. RESULTS Of the 14 participant physicians, 12 rated the course experience, 10 completed the pre and post confidence surveys, and 10 completed both the pre and post case studies. On a seven-point Likert scale (1, strongly disagree to 7, strongly agree), participants' mean reported confidence increased from pre to post SL event with respect to: selecting insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes (pre = 4. 9 to post = 6. 5, P=. 002); initiating insulin (pre = 5. 0 to post = 6. 2, P=. 02); and adjusting insulin dosing (pre = 5. 2 to post = 6. 2, P=. 02). On test cases, the percent of participants providing a correct insulin initiation plan increased from 60 % (6 of 10) pre to 90 % (9 of 10) post (P=. 2), and the percent of participants providing correct initiation of mealtime insulin increased from 40 % (4 of 10) pre to 80 % (8 of 10) post (P=. 09). All participants (12 of 12) agreed that this experience in SL was an effective method of medical education, that the virtual world approach to CME was superior to other methods of online CME, that they would enroll in another such event in SL, and that they would recommend that their colleagues participate in an SL CME course. Only 17 % (2 of 12) disagreed with the statement that this potential Second Life method of CME is superior to face-to-face CME. CONCLUSIONS The results of this pilot suggest that virtual worlds offer the potential of a new <b>medical</b> education <b>pedagogy</b> to enhance learning outcomes beyond that provided by more traditional online or face-to-face postgraduate professional development activities. Obvious potential exists for application of these methods at the medical school and residency levels as well. The Physicians’ Foundatio...|$|R

Results: Medical educational leaders and the ACGME concluded in the late 1990 s that medical education was not preparing clinicians sufficiently for lifelong learning in the 21 st century. A confluence of medical, social, and historic factors required definitions and a com-mon vocabulary for teaching and evaluating medical competency.

40|$|ABSTRACT Suffering is the {{experience}} of distress or disharmony caused by the loss, or threatened loss, of what we most cherish. Such losses may strip away the beliefs by which we construct a meaningful narrative of human life in general and our own in particular. The vocation of physicians and other health professionals is to relieve suf-fering caused by illness, trauma, and bodily degeneration. However, since suffering is an existential state that does not necessarily parallel physical or emotional states, physicians cannot rely solely on knowledge and skills that address physiological dysfunction. Rather, they must learn to engage the patient at an existential level. Unfortunately, however, <b>medical</b> <b>pedagogy</b> encourages “detached concern, ” which devalues subjectiv-ity, emotion, relationship, and solidarity. The term “compassionate solidarity ” summa-rizes an alternative model, which begins with empathic listening and responding, re-quires reflectivity and self-understanding, and is in itself a healing act. Poetry, along with other imaginative writing, may help physicians and other health professionals grow in self-awareness and gain deeper understanding of suffering, empathy, compas-sion, and symbolic healing. IN MEDICINE THE WORDS pain and suffering are so frequently in tandem that formany physicians pain-and-suffering glides off the tongue as a single concept. Suffering tends {{to be treated as}} merely the psychological or personal dimension of pain. It follows, then, that since pain and other unpleasant symptoms cause the suffering, this negative psychological reaction should be eliminated by treating pain or, better yet, by curing the disease. Thus, the primary focus of research and teaching about pain-and-suffering is on nocireceptors and pharmacology...|$|E
40|$|Reports on {{undergraduate}} {{medical education}} in the recent decade clearly point towards a need for greater integration of content in the <b>medical</b> curriculum. The <b>pedagogy</b> of an integrated curriculum embraces many models of integration, representing a continuum where full integration sits {{at one end and}} discipline–based teaching at the other, with many intermediate steps between the two extremes. A vertically integrated curriculum seeks to bridge the preclinical and clinical divide in content by teaching the content concurrently rather than sequentially, but still retaining discipline boundaries. A horizontally integrated curriculum seeks to further break down the distinctions between the basic and clinical sciences, with {{the early years of the}} program focusing on the basic sciences and introducing clinical features into the program wherever possible as part of a gradual shift to a more continued collaborative clinical focus. At the College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, the overall redesigned curricular program will be phased in over the next four years of the curriculum, with a greater emphasis towards an integrated approach of the teaching and learning of human disease. In the first year, this has led to the creation of a patchwork quilt teaching style, where a cross disciplinary functional system incorporates elements of the traditional basic science components of anatomy, physiology, embryology, and histology, and an introduction of core general pathological concepts in a vertical and horizontal integrated fashion. The main objective of this research, detailed in Chapter 1, was to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the two models of horizontal and vertical integration of the reorganized structural teaching of pathology through an analysis of the perceptions of medical educators and first- and second-year students in the undergraduate curriculum at the College of Medicine, and based contextually within a theoretical framework of the newly designed medical curriculum. In this context, the literature review in Chapter 2 focused on four major areas that are the underpinnings of the pedagogy of pathology teaching in the undergraduate medical curriculum: (a) integration concepts in relation to medical education; (b) the practice of pathology teaching in the past, present, and future; (c) theories of curricular integration; and (d) its effects on the student learning environment. This resulted in the development of the pre-research conceptual framework for this study. The in-service monitoring research design for this study included a triangulation of research methodologies using multiple data sources, multiple subjects, and multiple data collection techniques using comparative qualitative and quantitative research inquiry techniques. Data collected from the semi-structured interviews of the medical faculty provided not only an understanding of the educators’ perceptions towards the integrated curriculum, but also some insight towards their feelings of respect, power, and identity in this new integrative environment. Personal perceptions of fear, apathy, and stress and perceptions regarding accountability and sustainability of this integrative process were also observed as arising from this educational intervention. Quantitative data analysis collected from the first-year student survey questionnaires derived the following grand mean responses with respect to the vertical integration of pathology teachings: student learning satisfaction with integration (3. 6); the learning environment (3. 8); student engagement (3. 3); and student stress (2. 9). The grand mean responses to horizontal integration showed a similar trend: student learning satisfaction (3. 7); learning environment (4); student engagement (3. 5); and student stress (3). Perceptions of the second-year medical students to horizontal integration of pathology teachings were comparable: student learning satisfaction (3. 7); learning environment (4. 2); student engagement (3. 7); and student stress (3. 1).

Defining {{of medical and}} psychological assistance volume to women with physiological pregnancy O. Bozhuk National Medical University named after O. O. Bohomolets Department of General and <b>Medical</b> Psychology and <b>Pedagogy</b> Summary. Mother and prenate are in close symbiotic relationship, which manifests itself in the interaction at physiological and psychological levels of organisms’ functioning. Reflexive accepting yourself as a pregnant woman depends also on the the motives of conception, planed / not planed parenthood, social situation and level of psychological and social support. The aim of the research is to determine the volume and structure of medical and psychological assistance. The research was conducted in maternity hospital prenatal consultation centre of Chernihiv City Council and Municipal nonprofit company "Consultation and Diagnostic Center" of Golosiivsky district in Kyiv in 2010 - 2014. The research involved 185 pregnant women whose age ranged from 17 to 36 years old (group 1 μ = 25, 5 ± 0, 27, group 2 -μ = 24, 8 ± 0, 27). Women of group 1 show some fear of future childbirth, which applies to both the woman herself and the unborn child. The course of psychological education was developed for women of group 1, which included not only the educational part regarding the physiology of pregnancy and childbirth, postpartum, etc. but also the part aimed at reducing anxiety and overcoming identified fears. For the women of group 2 psychological influence is required in all researched spheres (personal, psycho-social, psycho-emotional and reproductive) if the fear of future birth is present and vivid. According to conducted research for women of group 2 there were found the next targets of psycho-therapeutic influence which have been taken into account when developing the course of psycho- correction: to normalize psycho-emotional state of the pregnant woman, to reduce anxiety level; to work with identified fears; to normalize emotional relation in the dyad "prenate - mother" and creating the triad "father-mother-prenate"; to normalize family relations and to construct optimal types of family systems; to harmonize personal traits of the pregnant woman. Based on the results of the study proved the need for medical and psychological support to women with physiological pregnancy.

Results: Personal decisions about career choice were important because they shaped the life of the practitioner and made a significant impact on those around them. Professional decisions were made in the domains of the mechanistic and probabilistic scientific world of medicine and in the domain of human relationships, emotions and suffering. There was often a tension between the different domains and the context of the life-world often modified decisions that might logically have been determined by evidence-based medicine and its bio-knowledge. Conclusions: Decisions had a strong effect on the development of identity within the field of practice. Individuals came to see themselves as doctors who made certain kinds of decisions of immediate relevance to the individual patient. Teaching medical students and graduates how to apply evidence to their decisions and how to use formal computational decision aids may well have a useful place in pedagogy, but the impact of decision-making on the lives of doctors and their individual patients deserves at least equal emphasis.

Methods: Undergraduate medical students of 6 th and 8 th semesters were enrolled in humanities based study module (HSM) on voluntary basis for a total duration of six months. During their compulsory rotatory medicine ward posting, they were introduced and exposed to learning bedside experience of HSM with various tools of art and literature in the form of poem, short narratives, paintings, sketches and group discussions to express their feelings about patients′ sufferings. Students′ feed-back was recorded through an anonymized questionnaire. Result: Of the 235 students, 223 (95 %) enrolled themselves voluntarily and 94 per cent (210 of 223) of them completed the total six month duration of the study module. Seventy three per cent of the students found HSM effective in improving their affective motivational behavior, 82 per cent found it effective in motivating them to learn more about core medical subjects, and 85 per cent wanted its continuation as part of medical curriculum. Interpretation & conclusions: The positive response of the students towards the HSM was an indicator of the potential for integrating the module within the undergraduate medical curriculum...|$|E
40|$|Master of EducationThis is a {{qualitative}} study exploring {{the experiences of}} medical practitioners in conducting consultations where the patient is from a non-English-speaking background. The {{purpose of this study}} is to present an overview of the medical practitioners' experiences in conducting culturally diverse consultations and their perception of their preparedness. This is to develop an understanding of their needs and their suggestions for training to ensure a high quality service is available for all. It was found that the combination of four levels of investigation into this subject was not in available literature. Data was collected from current medical practitioners, undergraduate medical students and their pedagogy team, prescriptive documents of the students' education, plus two affiliated observers. Questionnaires, interviews and document exploration were the data tools. The survey focused on the training of undergraduate students and their perceptions of their professional preparedness. Current practitioners, the undergraduate <b>medical</b> <b>pedagogy</b> team, a medical interpreter service manager, and a hospital unit manager were all interviewed. The prescriptive documents included the university handbook, the appropriate curriculum components and the Medical Council's Guidelines. Analysis of the data revealed a dichotomy between the prescriptions of multi-cultural education and the perceptions of the medical professions' preparedness in the subject. It also revealed that they believed they needed more preparation for multi-cultural consultations and provided suggested solutions. It is concluded that the medical practitioners require ongoing education, pre and post-registration, in cross cultural awareness and sensitivity. This is to ensure the same quality of care is available for the English-speaking background patients and the non-English speaking background patients. It is established that further investigation is required in order to determine the cause of the disparity between the prescribed education and the practitioners' preparedness.

In Britain, medical education evolved significantly between roughly 1770 and 1858. The doctrines established by medical {{teachers in the}} late eighteenth century not only revised or overturned received theories of disease, physiology, and therapeutics, but also entailed new approaches to instruction. Though this educational reform process met some resistance, by the mid-nineteenth century, the new scientific perspective had displaced the traditional humanistic paradigm in <b>medical</b> <b>pedagogy.</b> In Britain, this evolution was initiated in Scotland, where its leading medical teachers would gain considerable fame for championing a new science-based educational curriculum. A contribution to the fields of rhetoric of medicine and rhetoric of science, this study investigates the rhetorical demarcation of the medical discipline in Britain during the years of medical education reform. It draws attention to how the medical discipline evolved and transformed between these years, ultimately defining itself as a science. Focusing on documents addressed to questions of pedagogical method, curricular emphases, and doctrinal disputes, this study identifies the chief arguments, assumptions, and aspirations that motivated and justified innovations in the teaching of medicine at specific British institutions and promoted broader, sweeping reform of the whole system of British medical education. The analysis of these texts highlights the complexities of medical education reform in Britain, and the diverse perspectives that coalesced to shape medical education in new ways. Moreover, these discourses serve as historical markers for how the medical discipline was (re) shaped scientifically. Finally, this study contends that disciplines are most apparently shaped through what is taught, and to understand the rhetoric of disciplinarity in British medical education reform, one must understand the history of its teaching practices...|$|E
40|$|Students {{from lower}} {{socio-economic}} groups remain underrepresented in UK medical schools. This enquiry explores {{the perspectives of}} medical student participants to better understand how medical students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may be perceived, their experience of an undergraduate medical curriculum, and any issues concerned with what is required for them to learn {{in order to become}} doctors. A conceptual framework that encompasses both sociological and sociocultural learning theories that enable the professional development and learning processes of medical students, and students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in particular, to be better understood was required. Theoretical concepts from the literature informed the iterative development of the research questions that addressed student perspectives, the relational aspects between student practice and medical school structures including the medical culture, and how student participation is pivotal to their learning. An interpretive methodology including focus groups and individual interviews was used to access the perspectives of medical students from across the curriculum of one medical school. Analysis used a priori concepts and a modified grounded theory approach which generated three main categories of themes: who becomes a doctor, students’ developmental processes and issues underlying their learning. Non-traditional medical students were found to possess certain socioeconomic characteristics that distinguished them from their peers from a more advantaged background. For some students this led to disadvantage inherent in their differing patterns of socialisation, issues with developing an effective medical habitus and resultant professional identity, and reduced or less effective participation in authentic learning activities. A more nuanced nondualistic {{understanding of the nature of}} medical professional knowledge and the undergraduate curriculum by incorporating a more balanced approach to the insights afforded by participatory models of learning have several implications for both <b>medical</b> <b>pedagogy</b> and medical student practice...|$|E
40|$|The term medical {{humanities}} is American {{in origin}} and {{dates back to}} the 1970 s, when US teachers of medical education began to incorporate selected materials from the humanities more formally into their classes (Sirridge and Welch 2002, quoted in Evans 2007). Today, the term medical humanities denotes a broad and systematic programme of teaching and research. In this chapter we start from the assertion that the study of humanities complements and strengthens the study of formal scientific methods in medicine, and that this alignment of the human and scientific paradigms of medicine enables the development of powerful analytical tools for modern practice. The rationale for the incorporation of the humanities in the medical curriculum is predicated on a growing awareness that the disconnections between these two paradigms are counterproductive and deny students of medicine a rich learning experience that will enhance their personal and professional development. We argue that these disconnections are anachronistic—a hangover from the Victorian era, when the newly-formed medical profession reconstructed itself as a scientific endeavour and in so doing rejected its origins in the arts and natural philosophy. Medical humanities is understood in different ways. Here we describe an interdisciplinary subject that integrates the study of conceptual analysis and critical thinking, derived from the humanities curricula, into formal medical curricula. The subject incorporates teaching methodologies from art, history (including the history of medicine), law, literature, music, philosophy (including philosophy of ethics), and theology (see fig. 20. 2). It aligns the scientific aspects of medical education—and its socioscientific mode of analysis and communication—with the broader and deeper enquiries that {{are at the heart of}} the humanities: compassion and empathy; diversity and identity; and language, meaning, and thought. It is a dynamic and progressive discipline that enriches and illuminates conventional <b>medical</b> <b>pedagogy</b> and, in particular, enhances the clinical encounter. It is also an exciting, vibrant, and rapidly evolving field, to which students respond positively and with enthusiasm...|$|E
40|$|When a {{biomedical}} {{curriculum is}} exported from the First World to the Third, what embedded cultural values come along? Do locally specific historical, political, religious, or socioeconomic associations of the “physician” as signifier shape the professional values students take on? Or is professional identity, {{like most of}} the rest of the curricular content, imported from the North? ^ To date, empirical research on professional socialization has been restricted almost completely to North America. In the twenty-first century, when biomedicine is learned and practiced worldwide, the universality of socializing processes cannot be assumed. The project described here was collaboratively designed to assess the socializing function of medical education in Malawi. This cross-sectional qualitative research explores the acquisition of professional identity in students at a new medical school in Malawi, documenting changes during medical training in the values and norms that make up professional identity. I used a sequential research method involving focus group discussions, interviews and a questionnaire, moving from open-ended and general to more specific questions. This method was supplemented by archival research and “observant participation” at the university 2 ̆ 7 s teaching hospital. ^ The homogenizing process of basic science education during the first two years of medical school in Malawi appears similar to that found by researchers in North America. When students reach their hospital training, however, their nascent scientist doctor identities crash into a clinical reality in which the tools of science are largely unavailable. Responding to the resulting crisis, they may preserve the Northern doctor-scientist identity by seeking a geographic or occupational location in which its execution is possible. They may also reject the identity of detached technocrat to claim instead the dual roles of political activist and loving witness to suffering. I address historical and economic conditions that shape these responses, and discuss their implications for health in Malawi, for <b>medical</b> <b>pedagogy,</b> and for anthropological research on identity in an era of globalization. I use Gramsci 2 ̆ 7 s notion of contradictory consciousness to show how discrepancies between hegemonic cognitive frameworks of identity and real conditions of work have the potential to create a revolutionary new consciousness among doctors working in poverty. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There is {{considerable}} ambiguity in the subjective dimensions that comprise {{much of the}} relational dynamic of the clinical encounter. Comfort with this ambiguity, and recognition of the potential uncertainty of particular domains of medicine (e. g. – cultural factors of illness expression, value bias in diagnoses, etc) is an important facet of medical education. This paper begins by defining ambiguity and uncertainty as relevant to clinical practice. Studies have shown differing patterns of students' tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty that appear to reflect extant attitudinal predispositions toward technology, objectivity, culture, value- and theory-ladeness, {{and the need for}} self-examination. This paper reports on those findings specifically related to the theme of uncertainty as relevant to teaching about cultural diversity. Its focus is to identify how and where the theme of certainty arose in the teaching and learning of cultural diversity, what were the attitudes toward this theme and topic, and how these attitudes and responses reflect and inform this area of <b>medical</b> <b>pedagogy.</b> Methods A semi-structured interview was undertaken with 61 stakeholders (including policymakers, diversity teachers, students and users). The data were analysed and themes identified. Results There were diverse views about what the term cultural diversity means and what should constitute the cultural diversity curriculum. There was a need to provide certainty in teaching cultural diversity with diversity teachers feeling under considerable pressure to provide information. Students discomfort with uncertainty was felt to drive cultural diversity teaching towards factual emphasis rather than reflection or taking a patient centred approach. Conclusion Students and faculty may feel that cultural diversity teaching is more about how to avoid professional, medico-legal pitfalls, rather than improving the patient experience or the patient-physician relationship. There may be pressure to imbue cultural diversity issues with levels of objectivity and certainty representative of other aspects of the medical curriculum (e. g. – biochemistry). This may reflect a particular selection bias for students with a technocentric orientation. Inadvertently, medical education may enhance this bias through training effects, and accommodate disregard for subjectivity, over-reliance upon technology and thereby foster incorrect assumptions of objective certainty. We opine {{that it is important to}} teach students that technology cannot guarantee certainty, and that dealing with subjectivity, diversity, ambiguity and uncertainty is inseparable from the personal dimension of medicine as moral enterprise. Uncertainty is inherent in cultural diversity so this part of the curriculum provides an opportunity to address the issue as it relates to pateint care. </p...|$|E
