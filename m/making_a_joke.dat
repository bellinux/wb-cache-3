5|$|In an {{interview}} with ABC News, Esch and Lefkow stated that {{they came up with}} the original idea for bacon products and their first invention, Bacon Salt, while <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about the subject over a meal at a diner. The money for their startup came from the $5000 that Lefkow had obtained while on America's Funniest Home Videos. The idea to make bacon spreadable came from a customer's request. Together, they created interest in their products by going to numerous sporting events dressed in bacon costumes and used social networking sites to raise awareness of their company.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Jeunet {{included}} an alternate {{version of the}} film on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set with different opening and closing credits, which were originally cut due to budget restrictions. The deleted scenes included references to the character Newt from Aliens, Vriess <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> to Call, Ripley's clone {{waking up in the}} middle of her operation, an extended conversation in the mess hall that reveals the details of Ripley's former employers, Weyland-Yutani, an extended dialogue between Call and Ripley's clone in the chapel and scenes of the Betty landing on Earth and the planet's landscape during the final dialogue between Ripley and Call, as they view the ruins of Paris. The special edition restores 13 minutes and 5 seconds worth of footage (including the new opening and ending), and is 7 minutes longer than theatrical version. Jeunet has stated that the special edition is not a director's cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut.|$|E
5|$|The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie {{breaks up}} with Ross {{to get back}} {{together}} with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together and decide {{it would be best}} to remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise of Monica and Chandler— a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the changes in his life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by Chandler, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> for the last time. The camera's last view is of all of the character's keys to the apartment on the counter table, finishing with a shot of the apartment door.|$|E

25|$|While it was {{a popular}} {{destination}} for tourists, businesses such as delivery and taxicab services would not serve residents living on Butt Hole Road, believing that the name was simply a prank. Those living on the street would also receive phone calls from pranksters <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about the street name, and the residents eventually had their phone number removed from public listings. The name of the street inspired authors Ed Hurst and Rob Bailey to create the book Rude Britain, a compilation of inappropriate place names in Great Britain, after reading an article about a couple who purchased {{a house on the}} street.|$|E
500|$|According to Gracey, {{a number}} of critics have {{compared}} Argento with the character of Peter Neal, speculating that he serves as an alter-ego for the director. Gracey refers to Tenebrae as a [...] "reflexive commentary on [...] earlier work." [...] The director himself saw the film in the same light, claiming it was a reaction to accusations that [...] " [...] was a misogynist... a criminal... a murderer." [...] Argento resolved to include all of these aspects of his previous films into Tenebrae. A scene {{in which a woman}} criticizes the lead character's books as [...] "sexist", featuring [...] "women as victims, cipers, male heroes [...] macho bullshit" [...] echoes criticisms of Argento's own work. Kim Newman calls the confrontation scene [...] "essentially autobiographical", and refuting these accusations Argento said that his films were instead an attempt to tackle his dark side, to [...] "let it speak". With Tenebrae in particular, he felt he was <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> or playing a game with his critics, creating a front or mystique about himself. Rostock also believes Argento is having fun and sending up this perception. Newman agrees that Argento used Tenebrae to address his own public image, the notion that someone who creates art as [...] "sick and twisted" [...] as his, must himself be sick and twisted. With Tenebraes reveal that the author is the killer, Newman argues that Argento is saying, [...] "What if I were?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E

2500|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{spectrum}} property rights was first proposed by Leo Herzel in 1951, {{who was a}} law student at the time preparing {{a critique of the}} US FCC policies in spectrum management. Ronald Coase, a Nobel Prize–winning economist, championed the idea of auctioning off spectrum rights as a superior alternative to the status quo in 1959. Coase argued that, though initial distributions may affect matters, property rights in a frequency will lead to the most efficient usage thereof. [...] When he first presented his vision to the FCC, he was asked whether he was <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{title was}} based on Elvis Presley song's title [...] "Love Me Tender". The chalkboard gag makes a {{reference}} {{to the fact that the}} episode aired against the series finale of Lost. The opening couch gag is a parody of the English puppet show, Punch and Judy. The ending of the episode features Jay Leno <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on The Jay Leno Show. Moe mistakes American Idol with Armenian Idol (Hay Superstar) which, he states, is his favourite show. Upon being informed he is to judge the American one, he inquires who stands for Egor Glumov (one of the judges of the Armenian version).|$|E
2500|$|In March 2009, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her Russian {{counterpart}} Sergey Lavrov symbolically {{pressed a}} [...] "reset" [...] button.

2500|$|The most remembered shot where Davis {{missed the}} fine {{cut into the}} corner pocket was {{unfortunately}} not discussed in detail. Davis states [...] "I was saying to myself, don't hit it thick" [...] and [...] "that's how you bottle it, by hitting it thick." [...] However he did not elaborate on whether {{he was forced to}} use side spin to avoid a possible in off foul stroke into the middle pocket (This would have cost him the match) or whether he played it with centre ball striking. He summarised: [...] "although I missed the black, it wasn't that shot which lost the match. There were other shots earlier in the frame." [...] In particular, Davis mentions how close he was to being able to pot a pink which he snookered himself on that changed the course of the match. David Vine closes the programme by asking both players their opinion regarding some voices claiming the match must have been fixed. This preposterous notion gives a fascinating insight into the prevailing naivety in some quarters with regard to Snooker in 1985, when it was still a comparatively young TV sport and reaching its zenith in popularity. Davis replies [...] "Well, its simple. They don't understand. If anyone ever {{came up to me and}} asked if the match was fixed, I would just say yeah it was, yeah. It's just not even worth arguing with people like that." [...] Davis allowed himself to joke about the defeat, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about being asked by a petrol station attendant if he wanted glasses (free tumblers) and has now admitted that he will probably be remembered more for the final he did not win in 1985 than for the six he did. But barely months after the final he states [...] "although I lost the match, it was great to be involved in. To be involved in something like that." [...] The programme was later released on DVD as [...] "The Greatest Snooker Final Of All Time" [...] by Retro Videos. Both players now commentate on BBC's snooker coverage and are often reminded of that match. The [...] finish was voted the ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.|$|E

5000|$|... "Bully," [...] as he {{was called}} by his contemporaries, {{is best known for}} his extravagant {{lifestyle}} and the racehorses he bred. On 8 September 1757 he married Lady Diana Spencer, elder daughter of the Duke of Marlborough after <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>joking</b> proposal to her in one of London's pleasure gardens. Bolingbroke's insistence on maintaining a bachelor's lifestyle (which included lavish spending, a string of mistresses, heavy drinking and gambling) after their marriage, coupled with verbal and, possibly, physical spousal abuse, led to a bitter separation between Bully and the popular and artistic Lady Diana. Bolingbroke brought divorce proceedings against his wife for her criminal conversation with Topham Beauclerk, with whom she bore a child. The Bolingbroke divorce is notable for being streamlined compared to similar proceedings and thus is credited with easing the way for noble divorces in the 19th century.|$|R
