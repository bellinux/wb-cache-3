40|$|The {{effects of}} 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP), citalopram, p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), cyproheptadine, {{lysergic acid diethylamide}} (LSD- 25), <b>metitepine</b> and NSD 1034 on nitrazepam-induced sleep were {{investigated}} in mice. Nitrazepam (1. 6 - 25. 6 mg kg- 1, i. p.) induced a dose-dependent sedative-hypnotic effect. 5 -HTP (8 - 128 mg kg- 1 i. m.) did not induce behavioural sleep but sedated mice and significantly potentiated nitrazepam-induced sleep. Similarly, 5 -HTP (4 - 32 mg kg- 1, i. m.) increased pentobarbitone sleeping time. Citalopram (2. 5 - 10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) significantly potentiated nitrazepam sleep. PCPA (300 - 400 mg kg- 1, i. p.) completely abolished nitrazepam sleep; 5 -HTP (32 mg kg- 1, i. m.) reversed this effect. NSD 1034 (75 - 150 mg kg- 1, i. p.) antagonized the potentiating effect of 5 -HTP (32 mg kg- 1, i. m.) on nitrazepam sleep. Cyproheptadine (5 - 10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) and LSD- 25 (2. 5 - 10 micrograms kg- 1, i. p.) partially antagonized nitrazepam sleep. Similarly, 5 -HTP-induced potentiation of nitrazepam sleep was antagonized by cyproheptadine and LSD- 25. <b>Metitepine</b> (4 - 8 mg kg- 1, i. p.) induced behavioural sleep and significantly potentiated nitrazepam sleep. Ro 15 - 1788 (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) effectively antagonized nitrazepam-induced sleep. These results indicate that enhancement of central 5 -HT neurotransmission may underlie nitrazepam-induced sleep in mice...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) on {{spontaneous}} and electrically-evoked release of [3 H]-acetylcholine (ACh) from guinea-pig myenteric plexus preparations preincubated with [3 H]-choline {{have been investigated}} {{in the absence of}} cholinesterase inhibitors. 5 -HT caused a transient increase in spontaneous release and an inhibition of the electrically-evoked release of [3 H]-ACh. The 5 -HT-induced contractions of the longitudinal muscle were clearly related to the increase in spontaneous release. The inhibitory effect was not due to activation of alpha-adrenoceptors since it was also observed in the presence of tolazoline and on strips from reserpine-pretreated guinea-pigs. After desensitization of the excitatory 5 -HT receptors with 5 -HT or metoclopramide the effects of 5 -HT on spontaneous [3 H]-ACh release were largely reduced. A variety of established antagonists at neuronal 5 -HT receptors (i. e. <b>metitepine</b> 0. 1 - 1 microM; methysergide 1 microM; ketanserin 0. 1 - 1 microM; MDL 72222 0. 1 microM; tropacocaine 1 microM) failed to block the excitation. The inhibition by 5 -HT of the electrically evoked [3 H]-ACh release was competitively antagonized by <b>metitepine</b> (pA 2 7. 6) and methysergide (pA 2 7. 0) but not by ketanserin. Tachyphylaxis to the inhibitory action of 5 -HT did not occur. The results suggest that the excitatory 5 -HT receptor ('M'-receptor) differs in its pharmacological properties from other neuronal 5 -HT receptors. The presynaptically located inhibitory receptor may roughly correspond to the 5 -HT 1 receptor subtype but probably differs from the 5 -HT autoreceptor...|$|E
40|$|In {{guinea pig}} airways, {{electrical}} field stimulation (50 V, 0. 5 msec, 8 Hz for 20 seconds) produces a rapid contraction, which {{is followed by}} a long-lasting contraction, at least in {{the lower part of the}} trachea and in the bronchi. The latter contraction is due to the release of neuropeptides from airway sensory nerves. Ketotifen fumarate has been demonstrated to inhibit the noncholinergic contraction in guinea pig airways in vitro, but no attempt has been made to identify the receptor type. Therefore we have performed an in vitro study to investigate which receptor is responsible for the inhibitory effects of ketotifen on noncholinergic contraction in guinea pig airways. Ketotifen (3 to 100 mumol/L) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the noncholinergic contraction, with a maximum inhibition of 74 % +/- 7 % at 8 Hz stimulation (p < 0. 001; n = 5). Pretreatment of the tissues with either cimetidine (10 mumol/L) or thioperamide (10 mumol/L) or phentolamine (10 mumol/L) did not prevent the inhibitory effect of ketotifen (10 mumol/L). Cetirizine (10 mumol/L), on the other hand, produced no inhibition of the noncholinergic contraction at all. <b>Metitepine</b> (0. 1 mumol/L) and methysergide (1 mumol/L), both 5 -HT 1 antagonists, attenuated the inhibitory effect of ketotifen (10 mumol/L). Ketanserin (a 5 -HT 2 antagonist, 10 mumol/L) and tropisetron (a 5 -HT 3 antagonist, 1 mumol/L) had no effect. Ketoifen (100 mumol/L) did not affect the cumulative dose-response relationship to exogenous substance P (0. 01 mumol/L to 10 mmol/L). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) status: publishe...|$|E
