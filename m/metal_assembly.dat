40|$|Sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{are often}} used as support {{structures}} in automobiles, airplanes and appliances. These structures not only provide a frame for other modules to be assembled, but also give the product its aesthetic form. All assembly processes are affected by part and process variation. For this reason, the dimension quality of the assemblies is analyzed in early design phases, {{to make sure that}} the product will function as planned and continuously keep the product cost low. Tolerance analysis, as conducted in most industries today, is normally based on the assumption of rigid parts and is thus not always valid for sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assemblies,</b> due to their compliance. The objective of this thesis is variation simulation of sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The scientific goal is to analyze, understand and built a mathematical model of how different configurations of input parameter affects variation in the final assembly geometry. To analyze this, there are two fundamental research questions that need to be answered: What parameters influence the final dimension quality of complaint assemblies? and How can the dimension quality be simulated and evaluated in early design phases? The nature of this research work is problem oriented and a problem-oriented scientific method has therefore been used. This method consists of problem identification, observation, modeling, verification, and characteristics & performance steps. The first three steps have been treated in this thesis. The results of this research work so far consist of three appended papers. The first paper identifies important parameters that influence the final geometry and variation of sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assemblies</b> and different criterias for which the assembly designs are evaluated against. Based on this, a suggested early evaluation method is presented. In the second paper, a deeper analysis of how different weld configurations affects the final geometry of the assembly is presented. A simulation model has been built to simulate how different weld gun types and weld sequences affect the final geometry. An important conclusion from the analysis is that it is difficult to find an optimum weld sequence that minimizes its effect on the final geometry, due to the interactions between other input parameters. In the third paper, the simulation model developed in the second paper was extended to include part and positioning variation. The aim of this, was to analyze the interactions between selected input parameters and output measures. Computer experiments and regression analysis were used to analyze the interactions and model building. These models can be used to analyze the effect the input parameters, correlated or uncorrelated, have on the final geometry...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} the {{stamping}} process has a direct effect on laser welded sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assembly.</b> The fixture {{plays an important role}} in the satisfactory metal fit-up that laser welding requires. The traditional ' 3 - 2 - 1 ' locating scheme will no longer suffice for the deformable laser sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assembly</b> process. Because of the often poor stamping quality, a complex die fixture has to be employed to meet the metal fit-up requirements. The die fixture corresponds to an 'infinite- 2 - 1 ' locating scheme where the tooling cost is very high and yet lacks flexibility. This limits the application of laser welding. In this paper, a new locating scheme with both total locating and direct locating for welds is proposed. A total locating scheme is used to locate the overall assembly, and a direct locating scheme is used to locate the weld location, which is critical for ensuring correct metal fit-up. A finite-element model and a prediction and correction method for the direct locator configuration are developed in this paper. A case study is used to show that the proposed method is effective for sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assembly</b> for laser welding...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} methodologies {{to be used to}} simulate complete manufacturing chains of sheet components and the study of how different mechanical properties propagate and influence succeeding component performance. Since sheet metal assemblies are a major constituent {{of a wide range of}} products it is vital to develop methodologies that enable detailed evaluation of assembly designs and manufacturing processes. The manufacturing process influences several key aspects of a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assembly,</b> aspects such as shape fulfilment, variation and risk of material failure. Developments in computer-aided engineering and computational resources have made simulation-based process and product development efficient and useful since it allows for detailed, rapid evaluation of the capabilities and qualities of both process and product. Simulations of individual manufacturing processes are useful, but greater benefits can be gained by studying the complete sequence of a product's manufacturing processes. This enables evaluation of the entire manufacturing process chain, as well as the final product. Moreover, the accuracy of each individual manufacturing process simulation is improved by establishing appropriate initial conditions, including inherited material properties. In this thesis, a methodology of sequentially simulating each step in the manufacturing process of a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assembly</b> is presented. The methodology is thoroughly studied using different application examples with experimental validation. The importance of information transfer between all simulation steps is also studied. Furthermore, the methodology is used as the foundation of a new approach to investigate the variation of mechanical properties in a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assembly.</b> The multi-stage manufacturing process of the assembly is segmented, and stochastic analyses of each stage is performed and coupled to the succeeding stage in order to predict the assembly's final variation in properties. Two additional studies are presented where the methodology of chaining manufacturing processes is utilised. The influence of the dual phase microstructure on non-linear strain recovery is investigated using a micromechanical approach that considers the annealing process chain. It is vital to understand the non-linear strain recovery in order to improve springback prediction. In addition, the prediction of fracture in a dual phase steel subjected to non-linear straining is studied by simulating the manufacturing chain and subsequent stretch test of a sheet metal component...|$|E

40|$|Automobiles are an {{integral}} part of modern society and its way of life. In addition, automotive manufacturers are important institutions in society, summing the work of a vast array of sub suppliers, employing many. The margins are however moderate and competition is fierce. The automotive industry furthermore faces shifts of paradigms regarding propulsion as well as styling. Fundamental technical innovations, primarily to meet environmental requirements, that are moreover not a trivial issue to foresee, will affect all parts of the operation. It is thus important that product realization can respond quickly and effectively to market impulses using no more resources than necessary. Today most aspects of development are conducted in a virtual environment. However, design decisions are still based on experience rather than mathematical analysis. In this work we target the car body, or the Body-in-White, which is perhaps the most defining part of any car, with a significant influence on safety, aesthetics, handling, fuel economy and top speed. In the automotive industry, sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assembly</b> design has moved in the past 20 years from a physical to a virtual engineering environment. Virtual models of products and processes are now developed long before any physical prototypes are built. However whereas product and process now are represented in a virtual environment, the design parameters are still separately determined based on experience rather than holistic mathematical analysis. Moreover, quality analysis is mainly separated from cost/capacity analysis, leading to either suboptimal quality or cost/capacity. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the prerequisites for holistic sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assembly</b> design, where influencing design parameters are treated together. This project aims at answering the following overall research question: What characterizes an effective, virtual sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assembly</b> development process, securing the key characteristics of geometrical quality and equipment utilization? The research question is primarily targeted by investigating how influencing design parameters should be optimized with respect to key characteristics. Moreover, supporting information flows and analytical tools enabling the process are identified. This work presents a chronological framework for virtual sheet <b>metal</b> <b>assembly</b> design. The chronological couplings between the design parameters are identified and discussed. The framework conveys the order in which design parameters that influence the key characteristics need to be introduced to the project, to ensure that prerequisite data from previous parameters are available in each subsequent parameter analysis. This work furthermore identifies the trade-offs between geometrical quality and equipment utilization. It is concluded that fixture geometries that are effective in terms of geometrical quality often constitute bulky obstacles that have a significant negative influence on station cycle time and equipment utilization. It is moreover found that welding concepts that favor geometrical quality usually entail longer robotic travel and require lower robot operating speeds. This work moreover presents a dynamic packing method and algorithm. At early project stages, product and process design are of an approximate nature and are subject to frequent design changes and part restriction volume conflicts. This inhibits the use of automatic path planning. Therefore, a method that suggests a minimal part geometry design change that results in a collision-free assembly path is developed and implemented...|$|E
