5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1962, the zoo {{has focused on}} animal {{conservation}} efforts. Programs at the Phoenix Zoo include captive breeding for reintroduction (for instance the Arabian oryx, black-footed ferret, <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf,</b> Ramsey Canyon leopard frog, and thick-billed parrot, sanctuary for animals that are no longer breeding (for instance the African painted dogs at the zoo), and rescue and rehabilitation (for instance lead poisoning treatments for the California condor).|$|E
5|$|The species' modern {{range in}} North America is mostly {{confined}} to Alaska and Canada, with populations also occurring in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and small portions of Washington, Idaho, northern Oregon, and Montana. A functional wolf population should exist in California by 2024 {{according to estimates}} by state wildlife officials. Canadian wolves began to naturally re-colonize northern Montana around Glacier National Park in 1979, and the first wolf den in the western U.S. in over half a century was documented there in 1986. The wolf population in northwest Montana initially grew {{as a result of}} natural reproduction and dispersal to about 48 wolves by the end of 1994. From 1995–1996, wolves from Alberta and British Columbia were relocated to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho. In addition, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf</b> (Canis lupus baileyi) was reintroduced to Arizona and New Mexico in 1998. The gray wolf is found in approximately 80% of its historical range in Canada, thus making it an important stronghold for the species.|$|E
25|$|Mammal species {{include the}} bobcat, coyote, black bear, black-tailed jackrabbit, desert cottontail, desert bighorn sheep, mule deer, white-tailed deer, gray fox, {{mountain}} lion, river otter, long-tailed weasel, western spotted skunk, pronghorn, raccoon, and Ord's kangaroo rat, {{all of which}} can be found in parts of every southwestern state. Elk are found in parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona. White-nosed coati, coati, and collared peccaryor javelinain the Southwest are normally found in southern areas of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas near the Mexican border. Jaguars {{can be found in the}} bootheel region of Southwestern New Mexico. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf</b> (Canis lupus baileyi) was reintroduced to Arizona and New Mexico in 1998. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study reported a minimum population of 109 Mexican wolves in southwest New Mexico and southeast Arizona at the end of 2014.|$|E
50|$|The five {{last known}} wild <b>Mexican</b> gray <b>wolves</b> were {{captured}} in 1980 {{in accordance with}} an agreement between the United States and Mexico intended to save the critically endangered subspecies. Between 1982 and 1998 a comprehensive captive breeding program brought <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolves</b> {{back from the brink}} of extinction. Over 300 captive <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolves</b> were part of the recovery program.|$|R

25|$|Mexico City {{has three}} zoos. Chapultepec Zoo, the San Juan de Aragon Zoo and Los Coyotes Zoo. Chapultepec Zoo {{is located in}} the first section of Chapultepec Park in the Miguel Hidalgo. It was opened in 1924. Visitors can see about 243 {{specimens}} of different species including kangaroos, giant panda, gorillas, caracal, hyena, hippos, jaguar, giraffe, lemur, lion, among others. Zoo San Juan de Aragon is near the San Juan de Aragon Park in the Gustavo A. Madero. In this zoo, opened in 1964, there are species that are in danger of extinction such as the jaguar and the <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf.</b> Other guests are the golden eagle, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, caracara, zebras, African elephant, macaw, hippo, among others. Zoo Los Coyotes is a 27.68-acre (11.2 ha) zoo located south of Mexico City in the Coyoacan. It was inaugurated on February 2, 1999. It has more than 301 specimens of 51 species of wild native or endemic fauna from the Mexico City. You can admire eagles, ajolotes, coyotes, macaws, bobcats, Mexican wolves, raccoons, mountain lions, teporingos, foxes, white-tailed deer.|$|E
25|$|The Chapultepec Zoo is {{the most}} visited {{attraction}} of the park, especially on Sundays. It is estimated that half of all park visitors come to the zoo. The zoo was established by Alfonso L. Herrera, a biologist, and opened in 1924. Herrera's intention was to reestablish the zoo tradition of the old Aztec emperors and improve upon it. He began with species native to Mexico and then added others {{from the rest of}} the world. He modeled the zoo after the Bioparco di Roma in Rome, Italy. Between 1950 and 1960, the zoo expanded and added new species. In 1975, the zoo obtained two pandas from China. Since then, at least eight panda cubs have been born at the zoo, making it the first institution outside of China to breed the species. From 1992 to 1994, the zoo was completely remodeled, categorizing exhibits by habitat rather than type of species. Some of the most important Mexican species at the facility include a rabbit native to only a few volcanoes in Mexico, zacatuche (or teporingo), the <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf,</b> ocelot, jaguar and ajolote. Today, it has 16,000 animals of 270 species, separated into four sections according to habitat: tropical forest, temperate forest, desert and grassland. About one third of the animals are native to Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Hybridization in {{the wild}} usually occurs near human habitations where wolf density is low and dogs are common. However, there were several {{reported}} cases of wolfdogs in areas with normal wolf densities in the former Soviet Union. Wild wolfdogs were occasionally hunted by European aristocracy, and were termed lycisca to distinguish them from common wolves. Noted historic cases (such as the Beast of Gévaudan) of large wolves that were abnormally aggressive toward humans, may be attributable to wolf-dog mating. In Europe, unintentional mating of dogs and wild wolves have been confirmed in some populations through genetic testing. As the survival of some Continental European wolf packs is severely threatened, scientists fear {{that the creation of}} wolfdog populations {{in the wild}} is a threat to the continued existence of European wolf populations. However, extensive wolf–dog hybridization is not supported by morphological evidence, and analyses of mtDNA sequences have revealed that such mating are rare. In 1997, during the <b>Mexican</b> <b>Wolf</b> Arizona Reintroduction, controversy arose when a captive pack at Carlsbad designated for release was found to be largely composed of wolfdogs by Roy McBride, who had captured many wolves for the recovery programme in the 1970s. Though staff initially argued that the animals' odd appearance was due to captivity and diet, it was later decided to euthanise them.|$|E
50|$|The Columbus Zoo {{also runs}} a {{breeding}} program for <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolves.</b> This program has {{the goal of}} having a population of at least 100 wolves living in what was once their natural range. <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolves</b> became extinct in the wild in the mid-20th century due to being trapped, poisoned, and shot. Since the zoo became involved in 1992, 29 pups have been born at their facility.|$|R

500|$|The Arizona Trail is {{designed}} to emulate the wildlife and plant life {{of the state of}} Arizona. It features several plants native to the Sonoran Desert including the saguaro cactus, and animals such as the coyote, collared peccary (more commonly known as the javelina), [...] cougar, bobcat, raven, turkey vulture, coati, thick billed parrot, Sonoran pronghorn, and the <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The fauna in {{the state}} is just {{as diverse as the}} flora and varies greatly due to the large {{contrast}} in climates. In the mountain zone of the state the most observed mammals are: Mexican fox squirrel (Sciurus nayaritensis), antelope jackrabbit (Lepus alleni), raccoon (Procyon lotor), hooded skunk (Mephitis macroura), wild boar (Sus scrofa), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer Odocoileus hemionus, American bison Bison bison, cougar (Puma concolor), eastern cottontail Sylvilagus floridanus, North American porcupine Erethizon dorsatum, bobcat Lynx rufus, <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf</b> Canis lupus baileyi, and coyote Canis latrans. American black bear Ursus americanus is also found but in very small numbers. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf,</b> once abundant, has been extirpated. The main cause of degradation has been grazing. Although there are many reptilian species in the mountains the most observed species include: Northern Mexican pine snake, Pituophis deppei jani, Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), rock rattlesnake (Crotalus lepidus), black-tailed rattlesnake [...] (Crotalus molossus), and plateau tiger salamander Ambystoma velasci, one of possibly many amphibians {{to be found in the}} mountains.|$|E

5000|$|Because of its {{overlapping}} range {{with the}} <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf,</b> {{along with the}} Texas wolf, it was proposed by biologists Bogan and Mehlhop for the Mogollon mountain wolf and the Texas wolf to be conglomerated under the same taxonomic name and subspecies as the <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf.</b> This was because the Mogollon mountain wolf was seen as merely a possible middle subspecies between the <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf</b> and the Southern Rocky Mountains wolf, thus making it unnecessary to distinguish taxonomically.

5000|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf</b> {{was listed}} as {{endangered}} under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1976, with the <b>Mexican</b> <b>Wolf</b> Recovery Team being formed three years later by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Recovery Team composed the <b>Mexican</b> <b>Wolf</b> Recovery Plan, which called for the reestablishment of at least 100 wolves in their historic range through a captive breeding program. Between 1977 and 1980, four males and a pregnant female were captured in Durango and Chihuahua in Mexico to act as founders of a new [...] "certified lineage". By 1999, {{with the addition of}} new lineages, the captive <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolf</b> population throughout the US and Mexico reached 178 individuals. These captive-bred animals were subsequently released into the Apache National Forest in eastern Arizona, and allowed to recolonize east-central Arizona and south-central New Mexico, areas which were collectively termed the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area (BRWRA). The Recovery Plan called for the release of additional wolves in the White Sands Wolf Recovery Area in south-central New Mexico, should the goal of 100 wild wolves in the Blue Range area not be achieved.|$|E

40|$|In 1998, <b>Mexican</b> gray <b>wolves</b> (Canis lupus baileyi) were {{introduced}} into the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area (BRWRA) that spans adjacent portions of Arizona and New Mexico. In 2009 we selected three mixed-conifer sites on the Apache National Forest, within the BRWRA of east-central Arizona, to characterize long-term age structure of aspen (Populus tremuloides) and to check for the possible occurrence of a tri-trophic cascade involving <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolves,</b> Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), and aspen. These mixed-conifer sites included (a) a refugium site, (b) an old-growth site, and (c) a site thinned in 1991 – 1992. The refugium site was inaccessible to elk and cattle whereas the old-growth and thinned sites were accessible to elk, but not cattle. Age structure results indicated that aspen recruitment (i. e., the growth of sprouts/seedlings into tall saplings, poles, and eventually trees) at the refugium site had been ongoing {{over a period of}} many decades. In contrast, aspen recruitment at the old-growth and thinned sites decreased significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) during the two most recent decades when elk populations, as indexed by annual harvest levels, were relatively “high”. From 2000 to 2008, only 2. 9 <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolves</b> per 1000 elk were present on the Apache National Forest compared to 9. 3 western gray wolves (Canis lupus occidentalis) per 1000 elk in Yellowstone National Park where tri-trophic cascades involving wolves, elk, and aspen have been reported. The low number of <b>Mexican</b> <b>wolves</b> relative to their primary prey (elk) suggests that an ecologically effective density of wolves has not become established in east-central Arizona. Furthermore, the lack of recent aspen recruitment in stands accessible to elk indicates an absence, to date, of a tri-trophic cascade...|$|R
