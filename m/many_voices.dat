Meanwhile, having failed in reaching agreement with Britain and other world powers, the USSR signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, to bide time before an inevitable war between the two.|$|E

25|$|On 27 May 1787, he derailed {{yet another}} Polish policy which seemed {{threatening}} to Russia. With few major {{wars in the}} past decades, {{the economy of the}} Commonwealth was improving, and its budget had a notable surplus. <b>Many</b> <b>voices</b> said that the money should be spent on increasing the size, and providing new equipment for, the Polish army. However, as a large Polish army could be a threat to the Russian garrisons controlling Poland, von Stackelberg ordered his proxies in the Permanent Council to spend the money on a different goal: for the huge sum of 1 million zlotys (representing most of the surplus), the Council bought the von Brühl's Palace – and promptly donated it to 'Poland's ally', Russia, to serve as Russia's new embassy.|$|E
25|$|A {{particular}} controversy involves {{allegations against}} the young Baconsky {{for the way}} in which he treated his colleagues. <b>Many</b> <b>voices</b> in the literary community have come to suspect that he was an informant for the Securitate secret police, and that his reports helped in the arrest of other writers. Crina Bud proposes that, if such accounts are true, Baconsky may have used the Securitate in order to silence those who competed with him for the approval of his teacher, philosopher Lucian Blaga. The accusations are traced by Cernat to two separate sources: Baconsky's adversaries in the Sibiu Literary Circle and Securitate general Nicolae Pleşiţă. During his early activities in Cluj, Baconsky is also alleged to have partaken in the marginalization of a less enthusiastic writer, Ion Dezideriu Sîrbu, who was later to become a political prisoner (in Sîrbu's memoirs, Baconsky is singled out as one of those who betrayed his confidence).|$|E

They added more vocals to the composition and during the chorus, decided on how <b>many</b> <b>voices</b> should be duplicated. According to Alle Benassi, Madonna [...] "has clear idea.

500|$|Historian Richard Hofstadter deemed Dunne through Dooley [...] "one of [...] shrewdest commentators". Louis Filler {{wrote in}} 1954 that [...] "any lively {{mention of the}} Progressive Era is bound to evoke {{recollections}} of Dooley, usually {{in the form of}} one of his aphorisms". Dunne is closely associated with that era, and worked with several of the muckrakers during {{the first decade of the}} 20th century. Scholars have not agreed on the extent to which Dunne through Dooley influenced the era: Ellis believed that the Dooley columns paved the way for public acceptance of the realistic writing of the muckrakers, but Filler disagreed, noting that Dunne's was one of <b>many</b> <b>voices</b> calling for reform in the 1890s. Journalism professor John M. Harrison argued that though Dunne's progressivism, of a non-Marxist sort, placed him at odds with others who urged change, [...] "he was as effective as any writer of his time in keeping before the public mind those issues and questions that were the moving forces in the Progressive movement".|$|E
500|$|In Germany, Messiah was not {{so often}} {{performed}} as in Britain; when it was given, medium-sized forces were the norm. At the Handel Festival held in 1922 in Handel's native town, Halle, his choral works were given by a choir of 163 and an orchestra of 64. In Britain, innovative broadcasting and recording contributed to reconsideration of Handelian performance. For example, in 1928, Beecham conducted a recording of Messiah with modestly sized forces and controversially brisk tempi, although the orchestration remained far from authentic. [...] In 1934 and 1935, the BBC broadcast performances of Messiah conducted by Adrian Boult with [...] "a faithful adherence to Handel's clear scoring." [...] A performance with authentic scoring was given in Worcester Cathedral {{as part of the}} Three Choirs Festival in 1935. In 1950 John Tobin conducted a performance of Messiah in St Paul's Cathedral with the orchestral forces specified by the composer, a choir of 60, a counter-tenor alto soloist, and modest attempts at vocal elaboration of the printed notes, in the manner of Handel's day. The Prout version sung with <b>many</b> <b>voices</b> remained popular with British choral societies, {{but at the same time}} increasingly frequent performances were given by small professional ensembles in suitably sized venues, using authentic scoring. Recordings on LP and CD were preponderantly of the latter type, and the large scale Messiah came to seem old-fashioned.|$|E

2500|$|Third, Bakhtin found a true {{representation}} of [...] "polyphony" [...] (i.e. <b>many</b> <b>voices)</b> in Dostoevsky's work.

[...] Most of the motets are for five voices, and like those of Gombert, use pervasive imitation with all the voices being equal; there are few rests, so there is little contrast between groups of high and groups of low voices, or groups of few versus groups of <b>many</b> <b>voices,</b> contrasts which were popular with composers of the previous generation (for example Josquin).|$|E

2500|$|Vinders' {{music has}} both {{progressive}} features, {{such as the}} pervasive imitation which was to characterize the compositions of the generation of Gombert and Clemens non Papa, and unusually conservative elements, such as use of the cantus-firmus technique, which had been old-fashioned since around 1500 or even before. [...] Sometimes he combined both the conservative and progressive elements {{together in the same}} work, such as in his mass based on the famous tune Fors seulement, which uses both cantus-firmus and parody together (parody technique was to be the favorite method of mass composition right up {{to the end of the}} century; it used <b>many</b> <b>voices</b> of a multi-voice model).|$|E
2500|$|Archaeologist Steven Mithen {{speculates that}} the Neanderthals possessed some such system, expressing {{themselves}} in a [...] "language" [...] known as [...] "Hmmmmm", standing for Holistic, manipulative, multi-modal, musical and mimetic.p.169-175 In Bruce Richman's earlier version of essentially the same idea, frequent repetition of the same few songs by <b>many</b> <b>voices</b> {{made it easy for}} people to remember those sequences as whole units. Activities that a group of people were doing while they were vocalising together— activities that were important or striking or richly emotional— came to be associated with particular sound sequences, so that each time a fragment was heard, it evoked highly specific memories. The idea is that the earliest lexical items (words) started out as abbreviated fragments of what were originally communal songs.|$|E
