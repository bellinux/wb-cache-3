500|$|As with Oasis' {{previous}} two albums, {{the songs on}} Be Here Now are generally anthemic. The structures are traditional, and largely follow the typical verse – chorus – verse – chorus – middle eight – chorus format of guitar-based rock music. Reviewing for Nude as the News, Jonathan Cohen noted that the album is [...] "virtually interchangeable with 1994's Definitely Maybe or its blockbuster sequel, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?", while Noel had previously remarked {{that he would make}} three albums in this generic style. Yet the songs on Be Here Now differ in that they are longer than previous releases; an extended coda brings [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] to almost eight minutes, while [...] "All Around the World" [...] contains three key changes and lasts for a full nine minutes. The tracks are more layered and intricate than before, and each contains multiple guitar overdubs. While Morris had previously stripped away layers of overdubs on the band's debut Definitely Maybe, during the production of Be Here Now he [...] "seemed to gleefully encourage" [...] such excess; [...] "My Big Mouth" [...] has an estimated thirty tracks of guitar overdubbed onto the song. A Rolling Stone review described the guitar lines as composed of [...] "elementary riffs." [...] There was some experimentation: [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] contains a slowed down loop from N.W.A's [...] "Straight Outta Compton", while [...] "Magic Pie" [...] features psychedelically arranged vocal harmonies and a mellotron. According to Noel, [...] "All I did was run <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> across the keys and this mad jazz came out and everyone laughed." [...] The album's production is dominated by top-end high frequency tones, and according to Uncuts Paul Lester, its use of treble is reminiscent of both late 1980s Creation Records bands such as My Bloody Valentine, and The Stooges' famously under-produced Raw Power.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Nogueira {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy on his elbows, hips and knees. Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject them in your joints. I did it on <b>my</b> <b>elbows,</b> my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so I decided to go for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. I wanted to come back at the TUF finale card, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. I'll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn't say which one, but I'm sure it'll be the one in Rio. I still don't have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can't comment on that. I don't have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, but I would like to face Frank Mir again {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|E
60|$|I raised {{myself on}} <b>my</b> <b>elbows,</b> and, {{in the light}} of the smoking lamp, saw that he was shaking all over.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard my}} name spoken, {{and turned to}} find White at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|R
60|$|I had {{got as far}} as {{that when}} {{there was a kind of}} gasping cry at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{seized on}} <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> and hobbled through the shop {{as fast as}} possible; the young ladies {{following}} her, laughing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must sit up straight. I mustn't sprawl with <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> on the table. It is only common, vulgar people behave that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{ties and}} {{ballasts}} leave me, <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> rest in sea-gaps, [...] I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents, [...] I am afoot with my vision.|$|E
60|$|He {{drew his}} chair nearer to my desk, and I leaned forward, with <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> on the table, the finger-tips {{of one hand}} in contact {{with those of the}} other.|$|E
60|$|It was Captain Hannock's voice. I {{started in}} alarm, {{and found the}} skipper of the Spitfire close at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{never came}} out of the entrance, of that I was certain; yet at the end of several minutes he chuckled at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b> Again I ran after him, and again he ran into the cave; but this time I stopped at the mouth. I dropped back a short {{distance}} and watched. He did not come out, yet, as before, he chuckled at <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> and was chased by me a third time into the cave.|$|R
6000|$|... "You ayre Engliss?" [...] said a {{voice at}} <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b> I almost bounded, so {{unexpected}} was the sound; so certain had I been of solitude.|$|R
60|$|I smiled enigmatically {{and spread}} <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> {{as if to}} begin writing again. But this grim, abject, specious, subservient, burr-like wreck of a man would not be shaken off. His {{forehead}} suddenly became shiningly moist.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} {{still for}} a time in the dark--silent; almost invisible. All at once he pinned <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> to my sides. I felt utterly powerless in his grip, and his voice, whispering in my ear, vibrated.|$|E
60|$|Then Quilla and {{the lady}} Mira came forward and, placing their hands beneath <b>my</b> <b>elbows,</b> {{assisted}} me {{to climb out of}} that balsa, which I think was the strangest way that ever a shipwrecked wanderer came to land.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, {{and looked}} round at my corner. I sat there quite immovable, with my tracts at <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> and with Miss Jane Ann Stamper on my lap.|$|R
60|$|Gom. Ay, {{and a man}} had need of them, Don Pedro; {{for here}} are the two old seducers, a wife and priest,--that's Eve and the serpent,--at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do they? I was {{not aware}} of that. I struck <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> last week so hard against the door of my aunt's mansion that I feel the ache now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{am always}} quite {{straightforward}} when I am {{dealing with a}} client who means business. I pushed aside the litter of papers in front of me, leaned <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> upon my desk, rested my chin in my hands, and said briefly: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had lost}} myself with <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> {{on my knees}} and my head in my hands, but I heard the words distinctly. I heard also the silence which ensued. I sat up and took the {{responsibility}} of the answer on myself.|$|E
6000|$|... “And {{whom have}} I {{to thank for}} this kindness?” I asked, when I stood {{completely}} arrayed, a tiny boy’s cap on my head, and for coat a dirty, striped cotton jacket which ended at the small of my back and the sleeves of which reached just below <b>my</b> <b>elbows.</b>|$|E
60|$|Here {{is another}} {{compliment}} by Albert Bigelow Paine, my biographer. He is writing four octavo volumes about me, {{and he has}} been at <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> two and one-half years.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the 'Bell,' sir, {{where we}} {{generally}} put up," [...] remarked Reynolds, at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b> [...] "You {{will have some}} lunch, sir, before {{we go into the}} town?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it's her eccentricity. We {{all have}} them; and she amuses the Prince. Now, nephew, keep close at <b>my</b> <b>elbow,</b> {{and have your}} eyes open and your mouth shut." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{whole world}} ain't {{a bit too}} big for me to spread <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> in, I can tell you--what's your name--Bessie--let alone a dam' parlour in a hutch. Marry! He wants me to marry and settle! And as likely as not he has looked out the girl too--dash my soul! And {{do you know the}} Judy, may I ask?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! that shews you're a--I mean, d'ye see, {{that the}} {{difficulty}} lies here, <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> are lashed so fast {{to my side}} that I can't use them to prop me up, but if Poopy will roll {{down the hill to}} my side, and shove her pretty shoulder under my back when I raise it, perhaps I may succeed in getting up. What say you, Kickup?" ...|$|E
60|$|After breakfast Jack and I {{retired to}} my room, where, the weather being {{unfavourable}} for our fishing excursion, I went {{all over it}} again in detail. After that I sent Jack off to amuse himself as he chose, and, seizing a quire of foolscap, mended a pen, squared <b>my</b> <b>elbows,</b> and began to write this remarkable account {{of the reason why}} I did not become a sailor.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Por Dios!' I {{heard the}} {{sergeant}} muttering at <b>my</b> <b>elbow,</b> 'I shall shoot {{him through the}} head now, {{and get rid of}} that trouble. He is a condemned man.' ...|$|R
60|$|I now raised {{myself on}} <b>my</b> <b>elbow,</b> and putting <b>my</b> hand to my forehead, {{found that it}} had been cut pretty severely, and that I had lost a good deal of blood.|$|R
6000|$|I had fished on {{for some}} hour or two; Claude had long since {{disappeared}} among the hills; I fancied myself miles from any human being, when a voice at <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> startled me ...|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{answered}} me, {{not even}} a stir behind the door. Jacobus's house might have been made empty {{for me to make}} myself at home in. I did not call again. I had become aware of a great discouragement. I was mentally jaded, morally dejected. I turned to the garden again, sitting down with <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> spread on the low balustrade, and took my head in my hands.|$|E
6000|$|Not {{only were}} my wrists bound, but the lasso had been wrapped round <b>my</b> <b>elbows,</b> holding them {{close to my}} body. Turning on my side, I found that I could not reach the knife--not by several inches. This was a bitter disappointment. I {{strained}} and heaved. In my effort to lift my body sidewise I pressed my face into the gravel. [...] "Hurry, Ken, hurry!" [...] cried Dick. [...] "Somebody's coming!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She lunches down-stairs on Sundays. We {{have her}} with us {{once a week}} to give her the {{opportunity}} of studying manners and behaviour. Milson had dropped in, and we were discussing politics. I was interested, and, pushing my plate aside, leant forward with <b>my</b> <b>elbows</b> on the table. Dorothea has a habit of talking to herself in a high-pitched whisper capable of being heard above an Adelphi love scene. I heard her say-- ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the mate}} moaning at <b>my</b> <b>elbow.</b> He was thunderstruck, {{and as it}} were {{deprived}} of the moral support of his whiskers. He clapped his hands and absolutely cried out, [...] "Lost!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lizzie {{is off to}} Southampton {{with her}} husband. As the {{carriage}} drove off behind two horses that could with difficulty pull it through the snow, Janet suddenly appeared at <b>my</b> <b>elbow</b> and remarked: ...|$|R
6000|$|Then I heard Mr. Dix at <b>my</b> <b>elbow,</b> {{saying in}} a soft voice: [...] "Now, my fine gentleman, is there any good reason why you should not ride to Bow Street with me?" ...|$|R
