Both experiments revealed specific relations between the examined source <b>monitoring</b> <b>performances</b> and the selected working memory performances, verbal abilities, theory of mind abilities and social factors. In zwei Experimenten habe ich überprüft, was günstige Bedingungen für frühe Quellenmonitoringleistungen sind und welche kognitiven, sozial-kognitiven und sozialen Faktoren relevant für frühe Quellenmonitoringleistungen sind. Experiment 1 ergab, dass eine Handlungsenkodierbedingung für 4 - und 5 -Jährige eine günstige Bedingung für Realitäts- und Externale Quellenmonitoringleistungen ist, jedoch nicht für 3 -Jährige. Experiment 2 ergab, dass die Vertrautheit mit der Personenquelle eine günstige Bedingung für jüngere und ältere 3 -, 4 - und 5 -Jährige ist. Experiment 2 ergab ebenfalls, dass multiple Quellenzuordnungen ab dreieinhalb Jahren möglich sind und dass die internale Quellenmonitoringinstruktion für ältere 3 -Jährige jedoch nicht für jüngere 3 -Jährige optimiert werden kann.

40|$|This {{research}} is about enhancement of PCA-based fault detection system through utilizing dissimilarity matrix. Nowadays, the chemical process industry is highly {{based on the}} non-linear relationships between measured variables. However, the conventional PCA-based MSPC is no longer effective because it only valid for the linear relationships between measured variables. Due in order to solve this problem, the technique of dissimilarity matrix is used in multivariate statistical process control as alternative technique which models the non-linear process and can improve the process <b>monitoring</b> <b>performance.</b> The conventional PCA system was run and the dissimilarity system was developed and lastly the <b>monitoring</b> <b>performance</b> in each technique were compared and analysed to achieve aims of this research.

As a conclusion, the dissimilarity system is comparable to the conventional method. Thus can be the other alternative ways in the process <b>monitoring</b> <b>performance.</b> Finally, it is recommended to use data from other chemical processing systems for more concrete justification of the new technique...|$|R
