500|$|I was {{surprised}} by how people reacted to [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] because when I did that song, to me, I was singing about how something made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> certain way—brand-new and fresh—and everyone interpreted it as I don't {{want to be a}} virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out! That's not what I sang at all. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was always absolutely ambiguous.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the track}} {{was a major}} hit for the band, Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of [...] "Lola", saying, [...] "In fact, when 'Lola' was a hit, it made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> bit uncomfortable. Because it was taking us out of a {{different}} sort of comfort zone, where we'd been getting into the work, and the writing and the musicality was more thought about. It did have that smell of: 'Oh blimey, not that again.' I found it a bit odd, that period. And then it got odder and weirder". Mick Avory said that he [...] "enjoyed the success" [...] the band had with [...] "Lola" [...] and its follow-up, [...] "Apeman".|$|E
500|$|When portraying Ellie, Johnson faced {{challenges}} in performing scenes {{that made her}} feel uncomfortable. [...] "There were some days when we would shoot things that even at my age made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> little uncomfortable," [...] Johnson described. Johnson feels that video games rarely feature strong female characters such as Ellie, and expressed her excitement to portray the role for this reason. When questioned about the inspiration for Ellie as a gameplay feature, Druckmann recalled when he and Straley were brainstorming ideas for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and created a mute character who would summon the player to follow them, creating a [...] "beautiful" [...] relationship through gameplay alone. Though this concept was never {{included in the final}} game, the idea was raised when the team were discussing a new project, ultimately inspiring Ellie. Druckmann also felt inspired by the wars that took place in Syria and Afghanistan when creating Ellie; he felt that conflict was a familiarity to the children in those countries, which is similar to Ellie's view.|$|E

After seven matches for the club, Cole spent three months on loan at Burnley where he scored six goals for the Championship club, including a hat-trick against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Reflecting on his time at Turf Moor, Cole stated, [...] "I went to Burnley and spoke to Owen Coyle and got a great vibe.

It's all about her. It's about , 'Listen, {{if you really want to}} get with me, you gotta make <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> certain way'... We're going back to basics and fundamental sounds of Janet. We're trying to target her fans [...] the records that her fans will embrace." [...] In October 2009, Universal Music Enterprises issued a press release stating [...] "Make Me" [...] would be included in Jackson's second greatest hits album, Number Ones, a compilation of her 33 global number one singles.|$|E
