5|$|The {{program was}} marred by various concerns, notably the safety of Mir {{following}} a fire and a collision, financial issues with the cash-strapped Russian Space Program and worries from astronauts about {{the attitudes of the}} program administrators. Nevertheless, a large amount of science, expertise in space station construction and knowledge in working in a cooperative space venture was gained from the combined operations, allowing the construction of the ISS to proceed much <b>more</b> <b>smoothly</b> than would have otherwise been the case.|$|E
5|$|While {{construction}} of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat <b>more</b> <b>smoothly</b> than the {{construction of}} the OTA, Lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer of 1985, {{construction of the}} spacecraft was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule. An MSFC report said that Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction.|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on June 8, 2015, at Apple's WWDC that the iPad 2 would support iOS 9. This makes the iPad 2 the first iPad and only iOS device to support six major versions of iOS. As with previous releases, though, many headline features are unavailable on the iPad 2, including predictive Siri, translucency effects, split-view, slide-over and picture-in-picture multitasking, Low Power Mode and the Health app. iOS 9 {{is said to}} feature performance improvements that may help the aging device function <b>more</b> <b>smoothly,</b> and initial tests suggest {{that it did not}} significantly impact available space. Other A5-based devices will also support iOS 9 including the iPhone 4S (five major iOS versions), the iPad Mini (four major iOS versions) and iPod Touch 5G (four major iOS versions).|$|E

5|$|In 1954, {{nuclear tests}} in the Pacific were causing {{radioactive}} rainstorms in Japan and one particular incident in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to nuclear fallout, with disastrous results. It is in this anxious atmosphere that Kurosawa's next film, Record of a Living Being, was conceived. The story concerned an elderly factory owner (Toshiro Mifune) so terrified of {{the prospect of a}} nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family (both legal and extra-marital) to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil. Production went much <b>more</b> <b>smoothly</b> than the director's previous film, but a few days before shooting ended, Kurosawa's composer, collaborator and close friend Fumio Hayasaka died (of tuberculosis) at the age of 41. The film's score was finished by Hayasaka's student, Masaru Sato, who would go on to score all of Kurosawa's next eight films. Record of a Living Being opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction, becoming the first Kurosawa film to lose money during its original theatrical run. Today, it is {{considered by many to be}} among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the steel cage crinoline in 1856 provided a means for expanding the skirt still further, and flounces gradually disappeared {{in favor of a}} skirt lying <b>more</b> <b>smoothly</b> over the petticoat and hoops.

50|$|In most types, {{the linear}} {{movement}} of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a connecting rod and a crankshaft or by a swashplate or other suitable mechanism. A flywheel {{is often used to}} ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un-powered part of the cycle. The more cylinders a reciprocating engine has, generally, the <b>more</b> vibration-free (<b>smoothly)</b> it can operate. The power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons' displacement.|$|R

25|$|Its main {{advantage}} is that it accelerates aircraft <b>more</b> <b>smoothly,</b> putting less stress on their airframes. Compared to steam catapults, EMALS also weighs less, is expected to cost less and require less maintenance, and can launch aircraft that are heavier or lighter. It uses far less fresh water, reducing the need for energy-intensive desalination.|$|E

25|$|As with yeast, oxygen can be {{considered}} a nutrient for LAB, but only in very small amount and only for microaerophilic species such as O. oeni. However, no evidence exists currently to suggest that malolactic fermentation runs <b>more</b> <b>smoothly</b> in aerobic conditions than in complete anaerobic conditions, and in fact, excessive amounts of oxygen can retard growth of LAB by favoring conditions of competing microbes (such as Acetobacter).|$|E

However, all drivers said that once they learned to like the system, they discovered that they could travel <b>more</b> <b>smoothly,</b> and learned to control almost all acceleration and braking events with one pedal. They also discovered, thanks to the display panel information, that they recovered energy proportional to their expertise with the single pedal.|$|E

25|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Thunderceptor was its unusual inverse tapered wing, in which the chord length {{increased}} along the wing span from the root to the tip, the opposite of conventional swept wing designs.

50|$|High-quality locks {{may be more}} {{vulnerable}} to bumping unless they employ specific countermeasures. More precise manufacturing tolerances within the cylinder make bumping easier because the mechanical tolerances of the lock are smaller, which means there is less loss of force in other directions and mostly pins move <b>more</b> freely and <b>smoothly.</b> Locks made of hardened steel are {{more vulnerable}} because they are less prone to damage during the bumping process that might cause a cheaper lock to jam.|$|R
25|$|In 2004 contraflow was {{employed}} ahead of Hurricane Charley in the Tampa, Florida area {{and on the}} Gulf Coast before the landfall of Hurricane Ivan; however, evacuation times there were no better than previous evacuation operations. Engineers began to apply {{lessons learned from the}} analysis of prior contraflow operations, including limiting exits, removing troopers (to keep traffic flowing instead of having drivers stop for directions), and improving the dissemination of public information. As a result, the 2005 evacuation of New Orleans, Louisiana, prior to Hurricane Katrina ran much <b>more</b> <b>smoothly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Train crews favored #2450 {{due to the}} {{superior}} riding qualities of its Blomberg trucks, which ran <b>more</b> <b>smoothly</b> than the original AAR Type-A switcher trucks; being several tons heavier than a typical GP7 imparted a higher tractive effort, which was helpful when switching long cuts of cars. The Beep spent many years in lease service performing switching duties for the Port Terminal Railroad Association in Houston. In August, 1974 the unit was re-designated as #1160 {{as part of a}} general locomotive renumbering scheme.
