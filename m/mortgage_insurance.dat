25|$|When {{homes for}} the new Levittown were first being sold in 1958, Levitt and Sons had a policy against sales to African Americans. W. R.

On June 29, 1958, an agent of Levitt and Sons {{told him that the}} new Levittown development would be an all-white community. James filed suit against the company challenging their policy. A friend of his, who worked at the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights, said that it was illegal in New Jersey to discriminate in federally-subsidized housing. At the time, de facto racial segregation in housing existed in many areas in the United States. Levittown was receiving <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> from the Federal Housing Administration.

Lender shall disclose to borrower at least three business days before closing the specifics of the amount required to be in the escrow account and the subsequent uses of the funds.

2500|$|The {{interpretation}} of a credit score will vary by lender, industry, and {{the economy as a}} whole. [...] While 640 has been a divider between [...] "prime" [...] and [...] "subprime", all considerations about score revolve around the strength of the economy in general and investors' appetites for risk in providing the funding for borrowers in particular when the score is evaluated. [...] In 2010, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) tightened its guidelines regarding credit scores to a small degree, but lenders who have to service and sell the securities packaged for sale into the secondary market largely raised their minimum score to 640 in the absence of strong compensating factors in the borrower's loan profile. [...] In another housing example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began charging extra for loans over 75% of the value that have scores below 740. [...] Furthermore, private <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> companies will not even provide <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> for borrowers with scores below 660. [...] Therefore, [...] "prime" [...] {{is a product of the}} lender's appetite for the risk profile of the borrower at the time that the borrower is asking for the loan.|$|E

2500|$|Landfill {{material}} from {{construction of the}} World Trade Center was used to add fill for the southern portion. Cellular cofferdams were constructed to retain the material. After removal of the piers, wooden piles and overburden of silt, the northern portion (north of, and including the marina) was filled with sand dredged from areas adjacent to Ambrose Channel in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as stone from the construction of Water Tunnel #3. By 1976, the landfill was completed. Seating stands for viewing the American Bicentennial [...] "Operation Sail" [...] flotilla parade were {{set up on the}} completed landfill in July 1976. Construction efforts ground to a halt in 1977, {{as a result of the}} city's fiscal crisis. That year, the presidential administration of Jimmy Carter approved <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> for 1,600 of the development's proposed units. In 1979, the title to the landfill was transferred from the city to the Battery Park City Authority, which financially restructured itself and created a new, more viable master plan, designed by Alex Cooper and Stanton Eckstut. By that time, only two of the proposed development's buildings had been built, and the $200 million bond issue was supposed to have been paid off the next year.|$|E
2500|$|From a {{political}} scope {{one can also}} consider redlining and mortgage lenders. Redlining is a discriminatory practice that forces more inreal estate and all that attributes to it, typically involving lenders that refuse to lend money or extend credit to borrowers in certain areas of town. Although segregation and informal discrimination had existed in the United States since the Civil Rights movement, the specific practice called [...] "redlining" [...] began with the National Housing Act of1934, which established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The Federal Housing Administration, generally known as [...] "FHA", provides <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> on loans made by FHA-approved lenders throughout the United States and its territories. In the 1960s, a sociologist named John McKnight coined the term [...] "redlining" [...] to describe the discriminatory practice of fencing off areas where banks would avoid investments based on community demographics. Areas most frequently discriminated against were blackinner city neighborhoods. Concentrated areas often suffer through {{the same type of}} discrimination based on other factors aside of color. Blacklistingis the action of a group or authority, compiling ablacklist(orblack list) of people, countries or other entities to be avoided or distrusted as not being acceptable to those making the list. Through the study of investigative reporterBill Dedmanshowed that banks would often lend to lower-income whites but not to middle- or upper-income blacks.The implementation of this federal policy aggravated the decay of minority inner city neighborhoods caused by the withholding of mortgage capital, and made it even more difficult for neighborhoods to attract and retain families able to purchase homes.In addition, the Fair HousingAct, {{which is part of the}} Civil RightsActof 1968,prohibitsdiscrimination against neighborhoods based on their racial composition. Following aNational Housing Conferencein 1973, a group of Chicago community organizations led by The Northwest Community Organization (NCO) formedNational People's Action(NPA), to broaden the fight against disinvestment and mortgage redlining in neighborhoods all over the country.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>Mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> may in some {{contexts}} {{refer to}} Private <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> (PMI), {{also known as}} Lenders <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance.</b> Private <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> protects the lender instead of the borrower, although its premiums are payable by the borrower. This type of insurance is compulsory in certain jurisdictions for mortgages started with low down payments.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of these}} {{suboptimal}} qualities of <b>mortgage</b> life <b>insurance,</b> the product has {{been subject to}} sharp criticism by financial experts and by the media across North America for over a decade. This has arguably led to fewer banks actively advertising this product in the recent years, although many still keep it in their portfolios. However, many critics fail to consider {{that in many cases}} where term life insurance is denied for health reasons, <b>mortgage</b> life <b>insurance</b> is still available. As such, <b>mortgage</b> life <b>insurance</b> can cover the biggest expense left by a deceased breadwinner - i.e. housing costs. Thus, it is simplistic to dismiss it out of hand as disadvantageous to borrowers.|$|R
25|$|Derivatives {{evolved from}} simple {{commodity}} future contracts into {{a diverse group}} of financial instruments that apply to every kind of asset, including <b>mortgages,</b> <b>insurance</b> and many more. Futures contracts, Swaps (1970s-), Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003-), forward contracts, etc. are examples. They can be traded through formal exchanges or through Over-the-counter (OTC). Commodity market derivatives unlike credit default derivatives for example, are secured by the physical assets or commodities.|$|R
50|$|The biggest {{advantage}} of traditional life <b>insurance</b> over <b>mortgage</b> life <b>insurance</b> {{is that the}} former maintains its face value throughout the lifetime of the policy, whereas the latter promises to pay out an amount equal to the client's outstanding mortgage debt {{at any point in}} time, which is inherently a decreasing sum. Hence, <b>mortgage</b> life <b>insurance</b> is extremely profitable for lenders and/or insurers and equally disadvantageous to borrowers.|$|R
50|$|To {{offset the}} risk of high LTV’s, the lender may require what is called <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance.</b> <b>Mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> insures the lender against losses that may occur when a {{borrower}} defaults {{on his or her}} mortgage. Typically, this is required on loans that have LTV’s that exceed 80%. The cost of the <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> is passed on to the borrower as an added expense to their monthly payment, but some banks allow what is called lender paid insurance, where the interest rate is higher in exchange for the lender paying the <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance.</b> All government loans such an FHA and VA require <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance,</b> regardless of the LTV.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Housing Administration {{has been}} {{continually}} changing the <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> rate it charges. The up front <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> premium and ongoing mortgage premiums the FHA charges are partially {{based on the}} loan to value (LTV) ratio of the loan as well as dependent {{on the number of}} loans the FHA has seen default. In this case, the FHA streamline refinancing program's PMI and up front <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> rates are set by factors borrowers cannot control. And the FHA changed its terms to make <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> last at least eleven years for those with a loan to value ratio of 90%, while those with a loan to value ratio greater than 90% will pay <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> over the entire life of the loan. The FHA loan changes that went into effect June 2013 mean that the <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> on these loans can no longer be cancelled when the borrower has reached 22% equity. The VA does not have the same <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> mandates as the FHA, though it does have closing costs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> became tax-deductible in 2007 in the US. For some homeowners, {{the new law}} made it {{cheaper to}} get <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> than to get a 'piggyback' loan. The MI tax deductibility {{provision}} passed in 2006 provides for an itemized deduction {{for the cost of}} private <b>mortgage</b> <b>insurance</b> for homeowners earning up to $109,000 annually.|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} for <b>mortgage</b> guaranty <b>insurance</b> companies to establish loss reserves conditioned on a dynamic risk characteristic, delinquency status, presents particular data issues. There {{is a need}} to collect, organize, warehouse, and analyze large data sets that contain loan-level detail over consecutive evaluation dates in order to measure the probability of claim, conditioned on delinquency status. The generally accepted methodology of reserving for <b>mortgage</b> guaranty <b>insurance</b> claim liabilities requires evaluation of dynamic risk characteristics because <b>mortgage</b> guaranty <b>insurance</b> companies need only reserve for loans currently delinquent, both known and IBNR. Because each loan’s delinquency status is usually revised monthly by the mortgage servicing company, the cohort of insured loans currently delinquent changes each month and therefore is dynamic with respect to time. Coincidentally, delinquency status {{has been found to be}} a strong predictor of future losses, so it is imperative for <b>mortgage</b> guaranty <b>insurance</b> companies to estimate reserves as a function of delinquency status, a dynamic risk characteristic. Maintaining historical economic factors in step with the historical delinquency and claim data can also enhance the reserving approach. ________________________________________________________________________ 1...|$|R
