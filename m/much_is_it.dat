2500|$|On 11 August 2014, Ibrahimović paid US$51,000 to {{send the}} Swedish {{national}} football team for the intellectually disabled to the INAS World Football Championships in Brazil. After teammates Johan Elmander, Kim Källström, Andreas Isaksson and Per Nilsson donated autographed jerseys to be auctioned off for the cause, Ibrahimović responded, [...] "What {{the hell are you}} going to do with a shirt? How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to go?".|$|E
6000|$|Pep gave a whoop. [...] "Hooray!" [...] he cried, with a wild fling of his arms. [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> As much as twenty--as fifty dollars?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came down}} for the trip," [...] said Miss Harris; [...] "that is all about it. There is nothing to make a fuss about. How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> Captain Gibbs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{your uncle}} himself, sir," [...] {{continued}} the other. [...] "Not only that, but we discounted {{a bill for}} him for--let me see--how <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> for, Mr. Bell?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> Aunt Matilda?" [...] asked Uncle Braddock, while Aunt Judy {{opened her}} eyes and her mouth, simply because she could not open her ears any wider than they were.|$|R
6000|$|... "So," [...] said Mary, [...] "I could but {{answer him}} as I did, Sadler and Somer being both nigh. I {{gave him my}} purse, with all there <b>was</b> therein. How <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> Andrew?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, really, Mr. Tudor, I {{would do}} more for you than any other young man that I know, if you were {{only a little more}} punctual. How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> you want now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's {{the only}} way I can talk when you ask me about this," [...] said he. Then {{he paused for a}} moment before he added, [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> you wish to give to your brother's widow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|How {{far from}} this idea are the great masses of our really wealthy and well-to-do Londoners? How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> needed, that wise men {{should try to}} re-awaken in them the sense of {{corporate}} life, and literally civilize them once more! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that I know of," [...] he declared. [...] "I {{have heard}} nothing from her. By the bye, I lost {{some money to}} you at bridge the other evening. How <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> Do you remember?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Simple non-emphatic clitic {{doubling}} with accusative clitics <b>is</b> <b>much</b> rarer. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> generally {{only found}} with: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see {{the article}} there," [...] said Mrs. Morony, poking {{at it with}} her parasol. Standing where she did she was just able to touch it in this way. [...] "That's the one I mane, with the price;--how <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> Miss Biles?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, well, I can soon settle his business," [...] the Professor {{said to the}} children, [...] "if you'll {{just wait}} a minute. How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> this year, my man?" [...] The tailor had come in while he was speaking.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to be {{feared that}} some towering professors, upon {{impartial}} self-examination, will find upon themselves some of these black spots; {{all of which are}} utterly inconsistent with that humility which is the proper and only becoming garb of a Christian.--Ryland--ED.|$|E
6000|$|... "Children," [...] said Mr. Meredith, [...] "I {{have heard}} {{something}} that has pained me very <b>much.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> true that you sat out in the graveyard all last Thursday evening and sang ribald songs while a prayer meeting was being held in the Methodist church?" ...|$|E
5000|$|HAYDN's new Overture <b>was</b> <b>much</b> applauded. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a fine {{mixture of}} {{grandeur}} and fancy... the second movement was encored.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis strange, most strange, {{that you}} should have gone into the lion's den, and have come out unscathed. Strange, indeed, that Glendower, who, as we know, is greatly in want of money, should have fixed your ransom at a low sum. How <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> Sir Oswald?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hutton felt ashamed. How <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> his own lack {{of sympathy}} that {{prevented}} her from feeling well every day? But he comforted himself by reflecting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only {{a case of}} feeling, not of being better. Sympathy does not mend a diseased liver or a weak heart.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing could seem safer then! No {{one could}} have guessed that young Mr. Greenleaf would be so {{careless}} without his father to keep {{him up to the}} mark, nor that Mr. Goodenough should alter so <b>much.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> very bad? Is there worse behind? Speculation, I suppose--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you are {{the mysterious}} young lady who has been staying here in the house this winter," [...] he exclaimed, {{as though it were}} a marvellous thing. [...] "I have heard Miss Merrill speak of you. She admires you very <b>much.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> true that you come from--Coniston?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bacri," [...] he said, sitting down, {{while the}} master of the house stood respectfully before him, [...] "thou knowest the object of my visit--eh? Come, it {{is not the first time}} thou hast had to do with such as I. The plot thickens, Bacri, and thou must play thy part, willing or not willing. Say, how <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to be?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The 802.16 model <b>is</b> <b>much</b> simpler. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{proposed}} in several 802.16 TG3 contributions. The {{idea is to}} define three basic models: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For an old woman? I am fifty-five. I {{have had}} many doctors. I {{would put them}} all in prison. How <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> you paid Dr. Stickney, in New York, Adolf? Five {{thousand}} dollars? And he did nothing--nothing. I'd rather be poor again, and work. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> well {{to make the best}} of it."...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{continued}} Bacri, stopping abruptly in {{his account}} of these matters, [...] "I must not waste more time on a subject which is incomprehensible. Indeed, I would not have said so <b>much</b> <b>were</b> <b>it</b> not that the hour is yet too early for the undertaking which I have in view for you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] he jubilated; [...] "not only do I feed better, {{and live}} more comfortable, and hold up my {{end with the}} fellows; but I'm {{actually}} saving money--or you are for me. Here I am, with furniture being paid for regular every month, and a little woman I'm mad over, {{and on top of}} it money in the bank. How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Business before pleasure. How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> Twelve dollars? For the {{privilege}} of suffocating in this compact little Black Hole? By my halidom, Comrade Gooch, that gentleman whose name you are so shortly to tell us has a very fair {{idea of how to}} charge! But who am I that I should criticise? Here are the simoleons, as our young friend, Comrade Maloney, would call them. Push me over a receipt." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sleight {{looked at}} his {{companion}} attentively. [...] "You might have said so at first, and let up on this camp-meetin' exhortation. Well then--admitting you've got {{the old man and}} the young girl on the same string, and that you've played it pretty low down in the short time you've been there--I suppose, Dick Renshaw, I've got to see your bluff. Well, how <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it!</b> What's the figure you and she have settled on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are surprised," [...] the {{stranger}} said; [...] "I do not wonder at <b>it.</b> Perhaps--you have <b>been</b> <b>much</b> engrossed, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said--you had even forgotten." ...|$|R
60|$|When Graham {{received}} the judge's note {{asking him to}} put up at Noningsby for the assize week, he <b>was</b> <b>much</b> astonished. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> very short.|$|R
50|$|Today's village lies {{south of}} {{original}} location and <b>is</b> <b>much</b> smaller. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{served by a}} small railway station. New Catholic church has been constructed there.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Bishop, in {{speaking}} of it to-day, told the boys {{that they ought}} not to do right to please him, {{but because it was}} right to please God; but I can't help thinking that pleasing the Bishop may and can help the other very <b>much.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> not right for a child to do right to please its parents, and for older children too to be helped by the thought that they are pleasing those they love and honour? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 4. How deeply {{is it to}} be regretted, how <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to be {{wondered}} at, that, in {{a country}} whose school of painting, though degraded by its system of meretricious coloring, and disgraced by hosts of would-be imitators of inimitable individuals, is yet raised by the distinguished talent of those individuals {{to a place of}} well-deserved honor; and the studios of whose sculptors are filled with designs of the most pure simplicity, and most perfect animation; the school of architecture should be so miserably debased! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will soon}} be cleared up," [...] she said, [...] "and then we shall feel quite dull. Of course all {{business}} men have these little ups and downs. Why, I suppose of all the men you meet upon 'Change, {{there is not one}} who has not some such story to tell. If everything was always smooth, you know, then of course every one would turn stockbroker, and you would have to hold your meetings in Hyde Park. How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that you need?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> not. But <b>it</b> told {{far more}} than <b>much</b> that <b>was.</b> <b>It</b> told {{strongly}} against Harold.|$|R
6000|$|... "I take it," [...] said Ford, [...] "that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{when you}} were there last, save that perchance {{there is a little}} less noise there." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Shag Bag, which, {{considering}} our peculiar sic present, has no motive, purpose, {{and dedicated}} aim, and is meant {{only to be}} amusing — which not very <b>much</b> <b>is</b> nowadays, <b>is</b> <b>it?,</b> with illustrations by Edward Malsberg (Boston: Little, Brown, 1972) ...|$|R
