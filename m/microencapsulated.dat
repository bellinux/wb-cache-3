2500|$|In the 1990s {{another type}} of {{electronic}} ink based on a <b>microencapsulated</b> electrophoretic display was conceived and prototyped {{by a team of}} undergraduates at MIT as described in their Nature paper. [...] J.D. Albert, Barrett Comiskey, Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded E Ink Corporation in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E ink subsequently formed a partnership with Philips Components two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to Prime View International. [...] “It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analogue of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1–5 mm), quite distinct from the [...] molecular-scale properties that govern the behaviour of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-lambertian viewing characteristic, result in an ‘ink on paper’ look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a <b>microencapsulated</b> electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} in efficient intestinal delivery of health-promoting substances is increasing. However, {{the delivery of}} vulnerable substances such as enzymes requires specific attention. The transit through the stomach, where the pH is very low, can be detrimental to the enzymatic activity of the protein to be delivered. Here, we describe the microencapsulation of the model enzyme bile salt hydrolase (Bsh) using whey protein-gum arabic <b>microencapsulates</b> for food-grade and targeted enzyme delivery in the proximal region of the small intestine. Furthermore, the efficacy of enteric coating <b>microencapsulates</b> for site-specific enzyme delivery was compared in vitro with living Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS 1 bacteria that endogenously produce the Bsh enzyme. <b>Microencapsulates</b> allowed highly effective protection of the enzyme under gastric conditions. Moreover, Bsh release under intestinal conditions appeared to be very efficient, although {{in the presence of}} pancreatin, the Bsh activity decreased in time due to proteolytic degradation. In comparison, L. plantarum appeared to be capable to withstand gastric conditions as well as pancreatin challenge. Delivery using encapsulates and live bacteria each have different (dis) advantages that are discussed. In conclusion, live bacteria and food-grade <b>microencapsulates</b> provide alternatives for dedicated enteric delivery of specific enzymes, and the choice of enzyme to be delivered may determine which mode of delivery is most suitable...|$|R

40|$|Red beet or {{red beet}} root (Beta vulgaris L) {{is widely used}} as food mixture because of its health benefit and nice purplish red color.

These pigments can be extracted and used in the form of liquid, paste, or powder. The powder one has advantages such as good stability, solubility, and low moisture content which prolongs its shelf life. The purpose of this research is to produce red beet powder by understanding the influence of using <b>microencapsulating</b> agents (gum arabic, and maltodextrin 10 DE) with different concentrations in red beet powder’s characteristics as food colorant that made using spray drying method. In this research, spray dryer was operated at 150 °C inlet temperature and 90 °C outlet temperature. Gum arabic, and maltodextrin 10 DE were added as <b>microencapsulating</b> agents. There were 2 different treatments for each <b>microencapsulating</b> agent which are A (40 % CA) and B (60 % CA). Then the red beet powder was chemically and physically analyzed.
