60|$|The Marquis {{then led}} {{me up the}} broad stairs, lined with lackeys, to our own suite of apartments, where I was to arrange my dress before being {{presented}} to Madame de Nidemerle, who begged me to excuse her not being present to greet me, as she had caught cold, and had a frightful <b>megrim.</b>|$|E

60|$|Popanilla, being thirsty, helped {{himself to}} a goblet of water, which was at hand. It was the most {{delightful}} water that he ever tasted. In a few minutes he {{found that he was}} a little dizzy, and, supposing this <b>megrim</b> to be occasioned by the heat of the room, he took another draught of water to recover himself.|$|E

6000|$|This was {{the first}} attack of the <b>megrims</b> that I remembered in my {{mistress}} since the {{time when she was}} a young girl. I went back to the [...] "boudoir."

6000|$|... "Wretch!" [...] {{said the}} secret voice within, [...] "darest thou exult in thy shame? Recollect how thy youth and fortune was wasted in those years, and triumph {{not in the}} {{enjoyment}} of an existence which levelled thee with the beasts that perish. Bethink thee how this poor man's vanity gave at least bread to the labourer, peasant, and citizen; and his profuse expenditure, like water spilt on the ground, refreshed the lowly herbs and plants where it fell. But thou! Whom hast thou enriched during thy career of extravagance, save those brokers of the devil--vintners, panders, gamblers, and horse-jockeys?" [...] The anguish produced by this self-reproof {{was so strong that}} I put my hand suddenly to my forehead, and was obliged to allege a sudden <b>megrim</b> to my attendant, in apology for the action, and a slight groan with which it was accompanied.|$|E
6000|$|... "You had best, I tell you, shake these <b>megrims</b> {{out of your}} brain," [...] said Mrs. Labadie; but she was in {{too great}} haste not to lose her share of the amusements to argue the point, and the two young women were left together.

60|$|Immune {{from the}} {{degrading}} punishments and privations of his fellow-convicts, he was enabled {{to keep his}} self-respect, and was treated without harshness even by the soulless planter to whom he had been sold.

60|$|MISS FOSTER. O do not make-believe. I am in {{love with}} him myself, and have been any time since Nelson and the Nile. As for you, Dolly, since he went away six months ago, you have been {{positively}} in the <b>megrims.</b> I shall date your loss of appetite from George Austin's vanishing. No, my dear, our family require entertainment: we must have wit about us, and beauty, and the bel air.|$|R
60|$|Mary {{paced the}} room with {{impatient}} misery, and in such a round the weary hours dragged by, only mitigated by one welcome thunderstorm, for seventeen days, whose summer length made them seem the more endless. Cicely, who had never before in her life been shut up in the house so many hours, was pale, listless, and even fretful towards the Queen, who bore with her petulance so tenderly as more than once to make her weep bitterly for very shame. After one of these fits of tears, Mary pleaded earnestly with Sir Walter Ashton for permission for the maiden to take a turn in the garden every day, but though the good gentleman's complexion bore testimony that {{he lived in the}} fresh air, he did not believe in its efficacy; he said he had no orders, and could do nothing without warrant. But that evening at supper, the serving-maid brought up a large brew of herbs, dark and nauseous, which Dame Ashton had sent as good for the young lady's <b>megrim.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{grieve for}} you, but my Suspicions were correct. We {{have all been}} {{completely}} hoodwinked by that old Villain, my Brother-in-law. I can give him no other Name, for his partial Aberration of Mind has only sharpened his natural Cunning. Would you believe it? He had obtained access to Delavie House, and had there hidden the unfortunate Object of your Search, while he pretended to be assisting you, and this Morning he carried her off in a Sedan. I have sent the good Doves to Bowstead in case he should have the Assurance {{to return to his}} old Quarters, but I suspect that they are on the Way to Dover. You had better consult with Hargrave on the means of confirming the strange Marriage Ceremony that has passed between them, since that affords the best Security for your Daughter's Maintenance and Reputation.

6000|$|The young heir of Castlewood was {{spoiled by}} {{father and mother}} both. He took their caresses as men do, and {{as if they were}} his right. He had his hawks and his spaniel dog, his little horse and his beagles. He had learned to ride and to drink, and to shoot flying: and he had a small court, the sons of the huntsman and woodman, as became the heir-apparent, taking after the example of my lord his father. If he had a {{headache}}, his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house: my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way—(indeed, ’twas on the day after New Year’s Day, and an excess of mince-pie)—and said with some of his usual oaths—“D——n it, Harry Esmond—you see how my lady takes on about Frank’s <b>megrim.</b> She used to be sorry about me, my boy (pass the tankard, Harry), and to be frightened if I had a headache once. She don’t care about my head now. They’re like that—women are—all the same, Harry, all jilts in their hearts. Stick to college—stick to punch and buttery ale: and never see a woman that’s handsomer than an old cinder-faced bedmaker. That’s my counsel.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Spare her?" [...] said Mrs. Poyser, {{placing a}} seed-cake {{on the table}} and then seating herself to pour out the tea. [...] "But we must spare her, it seems, and not for a husband neither, but for her own <b>megrims.</b> Tommy, {{what are you doing to}} your little sister's doll? Making the child naughty, when she'd be good if you'd let her. You shanna have a morsel o' cake if you behave so." ...|$|R
60|$|Calliope Catesby {{was in his}} humours again. Ennui {{was upon}} him. This goodly promontory, the earth--particularly that portion of it known as Quicksand--was to him {{no more than a}} pestilent {{congregation}} of vapours. Overtaken by the <b>megrims,</b> the philosopher may seek relief in soliloquy; my lady find solace in tears; the flaccid Easterner scold at the millinery bills of his women folk. Such recourse was insufficient to the denizens of Quicksand. Calliope, especially, was wont to express his ennui according to his lights.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{it was a}} pity {{she should}} take such <b>megrims</b> into her head, when she might ha' stayed wi' us all summer, and eaten {{twice as much as}} she wanted, and it 'ud niver ha' been missed. She made no odds in th' house at all, for she sat as still at her sewing as a bird on the nest, and was {{uncommon}} nimble at running to fetch anything. If Hetty gets married, theed'st like to ha' Dinah wi' thee constant." ...|$|R
6000|$|Next day we {{were all}} back in our places at the {{appointed}} hour, and, not greeting each other much, at once began to bring in bills. We brought them in, not quite so fast, as though some lurking <b>megrim,</b> some microbe of dissatisfaction with ourselves was at work within us. It was as {{if we wanted to}} throw one out, as if we felt our work too perfect. And presently it came. A case of defrauding one Sophie Liebermann, or Laubermann, or some such foreign name, by giving her one of those five-pound Christmas-card banknotes just then in fashion, and receiving from her, as she alleged, three real sovereigns change. There was a certain piquancy about the matter, and I well remember noticing how we sat a little forward and turned in our seats when they brought in the prosecutrix to give evidence. Pale, self-possessed, dressed in black, and rather comely, neither brazen nor furtive, speaking but poor English, her broad, matter-of-fact face, with its wide-set grey eyes and thickish nose and lips, made on me, I recollect, an impression of rather stupid honesty. I do not think they had told us in so many words what her calling was, nor do I remember whether she actually disclosed it, but by our demeanour I could tell that we had all realized what was the nature of the service rendered to the accused, in return for which he had given her this worthless note. In her rather guttural but pleasant voice she answered all our questions--not very far from tears, I think, but saved by native stolidity, and perhaps a little by the fear that purifiers of Society might not be the proper audience for emotion. When she had left us we recalled the detective, and still, as it were, touching the delicate matter with the tips of our tongues, so as not, being men of the world, to seem biassed against anything, we definitely elicited from him her profession and these words: [...] "If she's speaking the truth, gentlemen; but, as you know, these women, they don't always, specially the foreign ones!" [...] When he, too, had gone, {{we looked at each other}} in unwonted silence. None of us quite liked, it seemed, to be first to speak. Then our foreman said: [...] "There's no doubt, I think, that he gave her the note--mean trick, of course, but we can't have him on that alone--bit too irregular--no consideration in law, I take it." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>megrim</b> {{prefers a}} sandy or muddy sea floor. They are predators and eat small fish and squid and also consume crustaceans. In turn <b>megrim</b> are {{themselves}} prey for larger {{species such as}} sharks, seals and large cod. <b>Megrim</b> spawn in deep waters off Iceland and the west of Ireland, {{while there is a}} separate spawning population in the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|<b>Megrim</b> are commercially {{valuable}} and are caught {{by a number}} of nations around Europe. It is caught by bottom trawling and is directly targeted in some fisheries, whereas in others it is retained as a valuable bycatch. France and Spain are the largest consumers of this species with most of the <b>megrim</b> caught in British water being exported to these nations. However, there has been a drive in Britain to get people to eat more <b>megrim</b> as a way of taking pressure off overexploited fish such as cod and haddock.Megrim can be cooked {{in a number of different}} ways with grilling, baking, frying and poaching all effective ways of preparing this species. In the UK <b>megrim</b> is sometimes given an alternative name such as <b>megrim</b> sole and Cornish sole as a way of making this species more appealing to consumers.|$|E
60|$|Thumb and Nod {{crouched}} down beside Thimble, {{who was now}} awake and in his own mind. And they told him all that had happened since his <b>megrims</b> had come on. He was still weak and fretful, and turned his eyes hastily from sight of the mouldy cheese the Mountain-mulgars were nibbling. But he sucked a few old Ukka-nuts. Then they lifted him gently, and with an arm round Thumb's neck and a hand on Nod's shoulder, they walked him awhile quietly in the snow.|$|R

60|$|Anne was fain {{to accept}} the theory in silence, though {{it seemed to her}} strange that at a moment when she was for once not {{thinking}} of Peregrine, her imagination should conjure him up, and there was a strong feeling within her that it was something external that had flitted across the shadow, not a mere figment of her brain, though the notion was evidently accepted, and she could hear a muttering of Mrs. Labadie that this was the consequence of employing young wenches with their whims and <b>megrims.</b>|$|R
50|$|The four-spot <b>megrim</b> (Lepidorhombus boscii) is {{a species}} of {{flatfish}} in the Scophthalmidae family. It is found a depths between 7 and 800 m in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean.

40|$|Mislabelling of fish {{catch and}} {{commercial}} seafood products is relatively frequent worldwide and can affect fisheries management exploitation when stock estimates {{are based on}} landings.

A high proportion of mislabelling was detected, suggesting enormous underreported exploitation {{of one of the}} species, which can be endangered if the problem persists. These results highlight the urgency of applying currently available species-specific molecular tools in fisheries sciences for preventing biodiversity losses in exploited species...|$|R
60|$|It {{all came}} out with the vehemence of a {{reserved}} nature when the flood is loosed. 'Young Madam' had been more than usually peevish and exacting, jealous perhaps at Lucy's being the heroine of the day, and fretful over a cold which confined her to the house, how she worried and harassed all around her with her whims, <b>megrims</b> and complaints could only too well be imagined, and how the entire pleasure of the day was destroyed. Lucy was never allowed a minute's conversation with her friend without being interrupted by a whine and complaints of unkindness and neglect.|$|R
60|$|I {{can tell}} you little of the habit of reading manuscripts in society. Such things are {{certainly}} done, for I {{have been invited to}} be present on one or two occasions; but having a horror of such exhibitions, I make it a point to be indisposed, the choice lying between the <b>megrims</b> before or after them. Once, and once only, I have heard a poet recite his verses in a well-filled drawing-room; and though I have every reason to think him clever, my ear was so little accustomed to the language, that, in the mouthing of French recitation, I lost nearly all of it.|$|R
