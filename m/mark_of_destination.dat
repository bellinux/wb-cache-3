40|$|During {{the past}} three decades the process <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image {{formation}} occurred as a significant part in tourism research. Although many researchers have greatly contributed to this important research field, still several aspects <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image are not well understood and require attention. Level <b>of</b> satisfaction, <b>destination</b> choice decision-making process, after-decision-making behaviours, intention to revisit and willingness to recommend are indisputably dependent on destination image. This paper looks at the concept <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image and the instruments <b>of</b> measuring <b>destination</b> image. In particular, the process <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image formation and the factors that shape the destination image is highlighted. Afterwards, a short review of the ECC Event and a literature review of the methodologies existing in the literature regarding measurement <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image are presented. Finally, the research methodology that will be implemented in the measurement of the image improvement of Linz during the ECC Event in 2009 is shortly described. The rationale for undertaking this study is to provoke discussions whether the successful measurement <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image requires the implementation of both qualitative and quantitative approaches, wherein the qualitative approach precedes the quantitative method. Moreover, the combination of structured and unstructured methods presents a unique opportunity to analyse the multidimensional character <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image.

In the thesis are identified problem areas in the quality <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> based on the analysis of secondary data. Furthermore, is evaluated the satisfaction of respondents with particular quality factors using basic descriptive statistics. Is also assessed dependence of the overall satisfaction with destination on the particular quality factors.

The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on the}} meaning <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> management and creation <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> packages in tourism. In theoretical part are defined concepts which are connected to destination management (destination identity, destination and so on). Other components of the theoretical part are segmentation and marketing strategy which consist of marketing mix. Basic marketing mix refers to the process <b>of</b> creating a <b>destination</b> product, types <b>of</b> communication strategies, price planning and distribution. Marketing mix <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> is extended by partnership cooperation, packages, programming and people. The practical part is focused on application of theoretical knowledge into practice. This part is consisting of delimitation <b>of</b> selected <b>destination</b> and its analysis. Basic information about Eden centre, recent situation and analysis of its services. Based on the determined information and SWOT analysis is designed a strategy which consists <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> products proposal containing as a main attraction the services of the Eden centre to enhance the attractiveness <b>of</b> Vysočina <b>destination</b> and Bystřicko micro-region.

40|$|Many {{next-generation}} distributed applications, such as grid computing, {{require a}} single source {{to communicate with}} a group <b>of</b> <b>destinations.</b> Traditionally, such applications are implemented using multicast communication. A typical multicast session requires creating the shortest-path tree to a fixed number <b>of</b> <b>destinations.</b> The fundamental issue in multicasting data to a fixed set <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> is receiver blocking. If one <b>of</b> the <b>destinations</b> is not reachable, the entire multicast request (say, grid task request) may fail. Manycasting is a generalized variation of multicasting that provides {{the freedom to choose}} the best subset <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> from a larger set <b>of</b> candidate <b>destinations.</b> We propose an impairment-aware algorithm to provide manycasting service in the optical layer, specifically OBS. We compare the performance of our proposed manycasting algorithm with traditional multicasting and multicast with over provisioning. Our results show a significant improvement in the blocking probability by implementing optical-layer manycasting...|$|R

40|$|In {{traditional}} community type <b>of</b> <b>destinations,</b> {{destination management}} organizations (DMOs) provide local services for visitors and fulfill destination marketing functions. On the demand side, they focus their activities on image and reputation building, product bundling and sales and distribution management. On {{the supply side}} {{they are involved in}} various functions like information services, coordination among the tourist SME 2 ̆ 7 s, infrastructure operation or support as well as destination planning functions. Traditionally these local DMOs, often to be found in mature tourist destinations, are organized as more or less public administrations and authorities or as public-private-partnerships, mostly covering the territory and being responsible for services in one or more municipalities. As traditional community type <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> have to compete with company type <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> like resorts, theme parks or even cruise boats, the respective DMOs have to transform themselves into modern, market oriented service centers. The current challenges require a critical budget and product-oriented regions, with a rather centralized marketing and management. Therefore, the reach and boundaries <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> areas must be evaluated and in many cases redefined. With the aim of deepening the understanding <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> economics and delivering a structure for analyzing and organizing destination functions, this paper analyses the criteria for defining the boundaries <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> and consequently budgets for the respective DMOs by looking at the case of the Swiss canton of Grisons.
