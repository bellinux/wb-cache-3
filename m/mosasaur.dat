25|$|Mitchell {{reported}} {{the discovery of}} <b>mosasaur</b> fossils in the Navesink Formation of New Jersey. These were the first North American <b>mosasaur</b> remains to be documented in the scientific literature.|$|E
25|$|Williston {{published}} notable early {{observations on}} <b>mosasaur</b> biostratigraphy. He reported {{the first known}} <b>mosasaur</b> fossils from the Pteranodon beds and the apparent absence of Clidastes from the Rudistes beds of the lower chalk.|$|E
25|$|Gordon Bell and Mike Caldwell rediscovered the <b>mosasaur</b> snout {{fragment}} {{discovered by}} Harlan. Using {{photographs of the}} Goldfuss <b>mosasaur</b> skull by Takehito Ikejiri {{they were able to}} verify that the specimens did in fact come from the same individual.|$|E
50|$|In <b>mosasaurs</b> like Clidastes, {{once the}} {{functional}} tooth is lost, a new tooth pedicel develops for the replacement tooth. In {{the case of}} <b>mosasaurs</b> though, they differ from the thecodont dentition pattern of archosaur and mammals because <b>mosasaurs</b> show true ankylosis and not a fibrous tooth attachment via periodontal ligament that’s usually found in mammals and archosaurs.|$|R
25|$|Caldwell {{and others}} {{published}} {{a study on}} the tooth replacement patterns of <b>mosasaurs.</b> They found that <b>mosasaurs</b> replaced their teeth continuously throughout their lives, with each replacing being slightly larger than its predecessor.|$|R
2500|$|Russell {{published}} {{a paper on}} the <b>mosasaurs</b> of the Selma Formation, including those collected by the Zangerl expedition in 1945. The paper contained several taxonomic advances including {{the description of the}} new species Tylosaurus zangerli and the reclassification of [...] "Clidastes" [...] sternbergii in the genus Halisaurus. Russell considered the Mosasaurus species M. lemonnieri and M. conodon to be synonyms. Overall he concluded that the known <b>mosasaurs</b> of the Selma Formation were Clidastes propython, Halisaurus sternbergi, Globidens alabamaensis, Platecarpus, Prognathodon, and T. zangerli. He noted that the biostratigraphic distribution of <b>mosasaurs</b> in the Selma Formation were different than the <b>mosasaurs</b> of the Smoky Hill Chalk.|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of young <b>mosasaurs</b> {{in the formation}} suggests that <b>mosasaurs</b> were viviparous and gave birth hundreds of miles out to sea, as Niobrara {{was in the middle}} of the Western Interior Seaway at the time. Juveniles would have been vulnerable to predation by the many large mid-ocean predators, so it is likely that <b>mosasaurs</b> lived in groups rather than solitarily. Also, viviparous species tend to have much fewer offspring than egg-laying ones, so if there were few young that were born, they were most likely to have sought protection within groups in order to reach adulthood and thereby maintain the population of <b>mosasaurs.</b>|$|R
25|$|Early reconstructions showed <b>mosasaurs</b> with dorsal crests {{running the}} length of their bodies, which were based on misidentified remains of {{tracheal}} cartilage. By the time this error was discovered, depicting <b>mosasaurs</b> with such crests in artwork had already become a trend.|$|R
25|$|Tchernov {{and others}} {{dismissed}} the snakes Haasiophis and Pachyrhachis, {{which had been}} previously put forward as evidence that snakes were close relatives of <b>mosasaurs,</b> as red herrings that were irrelevant to understanding the origin of snakes or any potential evolutionary ties linking them to <b>mosasaurs.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Mosasaurs</b> are {{the most}} common marine {{reptiles}} in the Niobrara Chalk and the most successful ones in the sea at the time. Four different genera representing the four different subfamilies of Mosasauridae: the Tylosaurinae, Plioplatecarpinae, Mosasaurinae, and Halisaurinae, were present in Niobrara. They were the dominant carnivorous marine reptiles and ate cephalopods, fish, turtles, pterosaurs, birds, and even plesiosaurs. There is evidence of them consuming other smaller <b>mosasaurs.</b> Despite this, <b>mosasaurs</b> often fell prey to some of the large sharks at the time, such as Cretoxyrhina.|$|R
25|$|Georg Baur {{published}} {{a paper on}} <b>mosasaurs.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Mosasaurs</b> breathed air, were {{powerful}} swimmers, {{and were}} well-adapted {{to living in}} the warm, shallow inland seas prevalent during the Late Cretaceous period. <b>Mosasaurs</b> were so well adapted to this environment that they gave birth to live young, rather than returning to the shore to lay eggs as sea turtles do.|$|R
25|$|This {{timeline}} of <b>mosasaur</b> {{research is}} a chronologically ordered list of important fossil discoveries, controversies of interpretation, and taxonomic revisions of mosasaurs, {{a group of}} giant marine lizards that lived during the Late Cretaceous Epoch. Although mosasaurs went extinct millions of years before humans evolved, humans have coexisted with <b>mosasaur</b> fossils for millennia. Before the development of paleontology as a formal science, these remains would have been interpreted through a mythological lens. Myths about warfare between serpentine water monsters and aerial thunderbirds told by the Native Americans of the modern western United States may {{have been influenced by}} observations of <b>mosasaur</b> fossils and their co-occurrence with creatures like Pteranodon and Hesperornis.|$|E

25|$|A study {{published}} in 2016 by T. Lyn Harrell, Alberto Pérez-Huerta and Celina Suarez showed that <b>mosasaurs</b> were endothermic. The study contradicts a {{study published}} in 2010 saying that <b>mosasaurs</b> were ectothermic. The 2010 study did not use warm-blooded animals for comparison but analogous groups of common marine animals. Based on comparisons with modern warm-blooded animals and fossils of known cold-blooded animals from the same time period; the 2016 study showed that <b>mosasaurs</b> likely had body temperatures similar to those of contemporary seabirds and were able to internally regulate their temperatures to remain warmer than the surrounding water.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the food}} items of <b>mosasaurs</b> were ammonites, {{molluscs}} with shells {{similar to those of}} Nautilus, which were abundant in the Cretaceous seas. Holes have been found in fossil shells of some ammonites, mainly Pachydiscus and Placenticeras. These were once interpreted as a result of limpets attaching themselves to the ammonites, but the triangular shape of the holes, their size, and their presence {{on both sides of the}} shells, corresponding to upper and lower jaws, is evidence of the bite of medium-sized <b>mosasaurs.</b> Whether this behaviour was common across all size classes of <b>mosasaurs</b> is not clear.|$|R
50|$|A new fossil {{found in}} 2008 and {{described}} in 2013 {{belonging to a}} 1.8 m juvenile Prognathodon was found in Jordan's Harrana Site. The fossil was remarkable in that it preserved {{the outline of the}} <b>mosasaur's</b> tail fins, revealing that Prognathodon, like Platecarpus and later <b>mosasaurs</b> also had a bilobed tail fluke resembling a downturned shark's tail, the shape of which may have aided the creature in surfacing, as well as attacking prey. The discovery also lends evidence to the theory that later <b>mosasaurs</b> were even more well-adapted to the lifestyle first occupied by the ichthyosaurs.|$|R
25|$|Michael Everhart {{observed}} that young <b>mosasaur</b> fossils are actually fairly {{common in the}} Niobrara Chalk.|$|E
25|$|Mosasaurs had double-hinged {{jaws and}} {{flexible}} skulls (much {{like those of}} snakes), which enabled them to gulp down their prey almost whole. A skeleton of Tylosaurus proriger from South Dakota included remains of the diving seabird Hesperornis, a marine bony fish, a possible shark, and another, smaller <b>mosasaur</b> (Clidastes). <b>Mosasaur</b> bones have also been found with shark teeth embedded in them.|$|E
25|$|Russell also {{published}} additional information and speculation on <b>mosasaur</b> biostratigraphy. He reported {{the presence of}} <b>mosasaur</b> vertebrae up to 90 million years old among the Turonian fossils curated by the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. Another of this work's significant contributions to <b>mosasaur</b> biostratigraphy concerned the mosasaurs of the Smoky Hill Chalk. Russell devised two biostratigraphic zones based on the Chalk's <b>mosasaur</b> fossils. The lower zone was characterized by Clidastes liodontus, Platecarpus coryphaeus, and Tylosaurus nepaeolicus. The upper was home to Clidastes, Platecarpus ictericus, and Tylosaurus proriger. He regarded Platecarpus and Tylosaurus as deep water animals but concluded that the biostratigraphic evidence from the Smoky Hill mosasaurs suggested that the Chalk's depositional environment was becoming shallower and nearer to the ancient coastline over time. Russell also argued {{that by the end}} of the Late Cretaceous, mosasaurs were converging on the body plan that characterized the first ichthyosaurs during the Triassic period and gradually replacing these older marine reptiles.|$|E
