The Serbs soon launched a counterattack, and in support of their operations, launched air strikes with aircraft based at a former JNA military airport in Udbina, south of Bihać, located in the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The Serb aircraft dropped napalm and cluster bombs. Although most of the ordnance came from old, unreliable stocks and failed to explode, the attacks were a clear violation of the no-fly zone, and a challenge to NATO. NATO immediately looked for ways to respond, but its forces were not permitted to carry out operations in Croatian airspace, and due to Bihać's proximity to the border, Serb aircraft could attack into Bosnia, then cross back into Croatia before being intercepted. As such, NATO was powerless to stop the incursions.|$|E

In addition, the UNSC increased UNPROFOR's authorized strength to monitor weapons exclusion zones, but never actually altered the operation's mandate.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to identify and explain the causes of instability in Muslim-Croat relations in the period between 1990 - 1997. These two nations {{are supposed to be}} the main pillars of the new Bosnian state born in Dayton, Ohio on November 21, 1995. So far, the Serbs have eschewed all efforts of the International Community {{in the direction of the}} stronger integration of a Bosnian state, and there are no signs of possible improvement in the future. If the project of a <b>Muslim-Croat</b> <b>Federation</b> fails, the whole state is at stake. Muslim leadership, along with many historians and political analysts hold the Croats responsible for the deterioration of Muslim-Croat relations, but a number of important developments do not fit this assumption. The author will argue that although the Muslims and the Croats did not create their alliance in the Bosnian war in good faith, the main cause of deterioration of Muslim-Croat relations is the wavering policy of the international community toward the Yugoslav crisis[URL] Croatian Arm...|$|E
40|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggest that}} the transition to Bosnian ownership has been held back by the Dayton framework, which created a weak central state and a country divided into two separate Entities, the Republika Srpska and the <b>Muslim-Croat</b> <b>Federation,</b> with ten cantonal governments, {{as well as an}} autonomous region, Brcko. Ten years on, the idea that the post-war transition has been frustrated by a surfeit of Bosnian governing institutions, protected by their Dayton status, could not be further from the truth. Rather, the international powers of administration, under the Office of the High Representative, have been vastly increased, reducing the Bosnian institutions established by Dayton to administrative shells. There has been a transition away from Dayton, but this has been from the ad hoc regulatory controls of the self-selected ‘coalition of the willing’, the Peace Implementation Council, towards an expanded framework of European Union regulation, covering all aspects of the post-Dayton process. Dayton has created an ‘informal trusteeship’, with external institutions rewriting their mandates and powers. But despite the transformation in post-Dayton mechanisms, it is still too early to talk of any indications of a shift towards Bosnian ‘ownership’...|$|E
40|$|On {{the night}} of May 2, 1997, some twenty-five {{abandoned}} Serb houses were set on fire in the Croat-controlled municipality of Drvar, part of the <b>Muslim-Croat</b> <b>Federation</b> of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was clear from all the circumstances that Croats organized the arson of houses in Drvar to obstruct {{the return of the}} original Serb residents to the area. Croat authorities then made a concerted effort to resettle displaced Croats in Drvar in order to solidify a stretch of 2 ̆ 2 ethnically-pure 2 ̆ 2 territory adjacent to the Republic of Croatia. These displaced Bosnian Serbs {{are just a few of}} the estimated 2. 3 million Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) who left or were driven from their homes during and in the immediate aftermath of the Bosnian war. This dislocation resulted from the use of 2 ̆ 2 ethnic cleansing 2 ̆ 2 campaigns in which local, regional, and higher authorities acted according to a premeditated plan and seized or consolidated control over territory by forcibly displacing or killing members of opposing ethnic groups. Many of those who were driven from their homes through different techniques that often involved violence and intimidation are now being prevented from returning home through various forms of legal and bureaucratic obstruction by the parties to the conflict...|$|E
40|$|This is an ethnographic {{study of}} what it means to be a Muslim woman in post-war and post-socialist Bosnia and Herzegovina. Almost two decades after the end of inter-ethnic wars that led to the {{dissolution}} of socialist Yugoslavia in the 1990 s, Bosnia’s inhabitants are undergoing radical social, economic, political, and particularly religious transformations. This transformation, visible in both community and individual lives, can be discerned in all aspects of daily life. In this dissertation I examine the underlying reasons and motivations concerning the different ways in which one can practice and live Islam in Sarajevo and Zenica, two of the largest cities of the <b>Muslim-Croat</b> <b>Federation</b> of Bosnia. My study is situated in two women women-centered NGOs, one secular and one religious (Medica Zenica and Nahla), and from these sites I ascertain the role civil society plays in helping women combat the political, economic, and social marginalization that is part of being a woman in today’s Bosnia. This dissertation examines faith [vjera or iman] and practice (what women do) as it has evolved from traditional Bosnian Islam (a secularized form of Islam that developed during the communist period) and the way it compares to those practicing povratak Islamu (a return to Islam or reislamization). My research indicates that there are two primary ways in which one can be a Muslim in post-war and post-socialist Bosnia: conventional (obična or tradicionalna Bosanska Muslimanka) and pious (osvješćena/pobožna Muslimanka). Conventional and pious Muslim women share a number of commonalities, yet, how they understand themselves and their relationship to Islam, including their duties and obligations, is considerably different. Furthermore, this dissertation demonstrates different approaches to being a Bosnian Muslim woman by focusing on agency and the ways in which women adapt to Bosnia’s transforming economy and social structure. Finally, I also examine the role that civil society and civic engagement (both secular and religious) play in identity formation.
