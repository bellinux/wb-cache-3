500|$|Of {{the fifteen}} genera within the Liliaceae, the ten genera of the Lilioideae {{subfamily}} form one morphological {{group that is}} characterised by contractile bulbs and roots, and a Fritillaria-type embryo-sac (megagametophyte with four megaspores). Within the Lilioideae, Clintonia and the closely related Medeola form a subclade, and are now considered a separate tribe (Medeoleae). The other major grouping consists of the five genera constituting the Streptopoideae (including Scoliopus) and Calochortoideae (including [...] Tricyrtis) subfamilies characterised by creeping rhizomes, styles which are divided at their apices, and by megagametophyte development of the Polygonum-type (a simple <b>megaspore</b> and triploid endosperm) embryo-sac.|$|E
500|$|The sporocarps are {{functionally}} and developmentally modified leaflets, {{although they}} have much shorter stalks than the vegetative leaflets. Inside the sporocarp, the modified leaflets bear several sori, each of which consists of several sporangia covered by a thin hood of tissue (the indusium). [...] Each sorus includes a mix of two types of sporangium, each type producing only one of two kinds of spores. [...] Toward {{the center of each}} sorus and developing first are the megasporangia, each of which will produce a single large female <b>megaspore.</b> [...] Surrounding them {{at the edge of the}} sorus and developing later are the microsporangia, each of which will produce many small male microspores.|$|E
500|$|The five genera constituting the Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae subfamilies form another {{distinct}} group, previously characterised {{under the}} Calochortoideae alone. These have creeping rhizomes, styles divided at their apices, and an embryo-sac of the Polygonum-type {{with a simple}} <b>megaspore</b> and triploid endosperm. At times, these genera were considered as a separate family (Calochortaceae; e.g. Tamura) or even placed in the more heterogeneous Uvulariaceae sensu Dahlgren. However most of the latter had low morphological similarity to the Liliaceae, and Uvularia and Disporum are now classified in the Colchicaceae. Disporum [...] contained both Asian and North American species which had always been distinguishable. Following molecular analysis, the North American species were restored to the genus Prosartes and retained in Liliaceae, subfamily Streptopoideae, while the Asian species were moved to Colchicaceae.|$|E
5000|$|Microspores are {{land plant}} spores that develop into male {{gametophyte}}s, whereas <b>megaspores</b> develop into female gametophytes. The male gametophyte {{gives rise to}} sperm cells, which are used for fertilization of an egg cell to form a zygote. <b>Megaspores</b> are structures {{that are part of}} the alternation of generations in many seedless vascular cryptogams, all gymnosperms and all angiosperms. Plants with heterosporous life cycles using microspores and <b>megaspores</b> arose independently in several plant groups during the Devonian period. [...] Microspores are haploid, and are produced from diploid microsporocytes by meiosis.|$|R
5000|$|Megasporogenesis, {{formation}} of the <b>megaspores</b> in the megasporangium (nucellus) by meiosis ...|$|R
50|$|Microsporangia produce 32 microspores, each 71-101μm in diameter. Megasporangia produce 16 <b>megaspores,</b> each 163-183μm in diameter. Microspores {{produce a}} {{filamentous}} microgametophyte, which lacks rhizoids and gives rise only to antheridia. <b>Megaspores</b> produce spatulate megagametophytes with rhizoids, which produce archegonia. Megagametophytes may later produce antheridia, making them functionally bisexual. Development of gametophytes is not endosporic.|$|R
2500|$|The pollen grains are {{dispersed}} by {{the wind}} to the female, [...] ovulate cone that {{is made up of}} many overlapping scales (sporophylls, and thus megasporophylls), each protecting two ovules, each of which consists of a megasporangium [...] (the nucellus) wrapped in [...] two layers of tissue, the integument and the cupule, that were derived from highly modified branches of ancestral gymnosperms. [...] When a pollen grain lands close enough to the tip of an ovule, it is drawn in through the micropyle ( [...] a pore in the integuments covering the tip of the ovule) [...] often by means of a drop of liquid known as a pollination drop. The pollen enters a [...] pollen chamber close to the nucellus, and there [...] it may wait for a year before it germinates and forms a pollen tube that grows through the wall of the megasporangium (=nucellus) where fertilisation takes place. During this time, the <b>megaspore</b> mother cell divides by meiosis to form four haploid cells, three of which degenerate. The surviving one develops as a <b>megaspore</b> and divides repeatedly to form an immature female gametophyte (egg sac). Two or three archegonia containing an egg then develop inside the gametophyte. [...] Meanwhile, in the spring of the second year two sperm cells are produced by mitosis of the body cell of the male gametophyte. The pollen tube elongates and pierces and grows through the megasporangium wall and delivers the sperm cells to the female gametophyte inside. Fertilisation takes place when the nucleus of one of the sperm cells enters the egg cell in the megagametophyte’s archegonium.|$|E
2500|$|Three-year {{reproductive}} cycle: [...] Three of the conifer {{species are}} pine species (Pinus pinea, Pinus leiophylla, Pinus torreyana) which have pollination and [...] fertilization events {{separated by a}} 2-year interval. Female strobili initiated during late summer or autumn in a year, then overwinter until the following spring. Female strobili emerge then pollination occurs in spring of the 2nd year then the pollinated strobili become conelets in same year (i.e. the second year). The female gametophytes in the conelet develop so slowly that the <b>megaspore</b> does not go through free-nuclear divisions until autumn of the 3rd year. The conelet then overwinters again in the free-nuclear female gametophyte stage. Fertilization takes place by early summer of the 4th year and seeds mature in the cones by autumn of the 4th year.|$|E
50|$|A <b>megaspore</b> mother cell, or megasporocyte, is a diploid cell {{in plants}} in which meiosis will occur, {{resulting}} {{in the production of}} four haploid megaspores. At least one of the spores develop into haploid female gametophytes (megagametophytes). The <b>megaspore</b> mother cell arises within the megasporangium tissue.|$|E
5000|$|Megagametogenesis; {{development}} of the <b>megaspore(s)</b> into the megagametophyte(s) which contains the gametes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Megaspores</b> {{contain the}} female {{gametophyte}}s in heterosporic plant species. They develop archegonia that produce egg {{cells that are}} fertilized by sperm of the male gametophyte originating from the microspore. This results {{in the formation of}} a fertilized diploid zygote, that develops into the sporophyte embryo. While heterosporous plants produce fewer <b>megaspores,</b> they are significantly larger than their male counterparts.|$|R

The methods used for the illustrations (drawing, microphotography in refl ected or transmitted light, SEM microphotography) is given, as is whether they represent holotypes or neotypes.

50|$|As {{with all}} seed-plants, the lyginopteridalean ovules {{had just one}} {{functional}} seed <b>megaspore</b> within the nucellus. In some, however, three other, aborted megaspores were still present that together with the functional <b>megaspore</b> represented the remains of {{what would have been}} the tetrad of megaspores in the ancestral pre-seed plants.|$|E
50|$|This {{pattern is}} {{characterized}} by cell plate formation after meiosis 1 & 2, which results in four one-nucleate megaspores, of which three degenerate. The bisporic pattern {{is characterized by}} cell plate formation only after meiosis 1, and results in two two-nucleate megaspores, of which one degenerates. The tetrasporic pattern is characterized by cell plates failing to form after either meiosis 1 or 2, and results in one four-nucleate <b>megaspore.</b> Therefore, each pattern {{gives rise to a}} single functional <b>megaspore</b> which contains one, two, or four meiotic nuclei, respectively. The <b>megaspore</b> then undergoes megagametogenesis to give rise to the female gametophyte.|$|E

50|$|Megasporogenesis {{occurs in}} megastrobili in {{conifers}} (for example a pine cone) {{and inside the}} ovule in the flowers of flowering plants. A megasporocyte inside a megasporangium or ovule undergoes meiosis, producing four megaspores. Only one is a functional <b>megaspore</b> whereas the others stay dysfunctional or degenerate. The <b>megaspore</b> undergoes several mitotic divisions to develop into a female gametophyte (for example the seven-cell/eight-nuclei embryo sac in flowering plants).|$|E
50|$|In exosporic species, {{the smaller}} spores {{germinate}} into free-living male gametophytes {{and the larger}} spores germinate into free-living female gametophytes. In endosporic species, the gametophytes of both sexes are very highly reduced and contained within the spore wall. The microspores of both exosporic and endosporic species are free-sporing, distributed by wind, water or animal vectors, but in endosporic species the <b>megaspores</b> and the megagametophyte contained within are retained and nurtured by the sporophyte phase. Endosporic species are thus usually dioecious, a condition that promotes outcrossing. Some exosporic species produce micro- and <b>megaspores</b> in the same sporangium, a condition known as homoangy, while in others the micro- and <b>megaspores</b> are produced in separate sporangia (heterangy). These may both be borne on the same monoecious sporophyte or on different sporophytes in dioicous species.|$|R
50|$|Isoetes riparia (shore quillwort) is {{a species}} of quillwort in the Isoetaceae family. It {{can be found in}} rivers, creeks, and tidal mud flats in {{southern}} Quebec and southeastern Ontario, south to eastern New York.It has 5 to 35 long, erect bright green to yellow-green leaves, which are 6 to 35 centimeters long. The velum covers one fourth of the sporangium, which can be 7 millimeters long and 4 millimeters wide. The elongated ligule can grow to be 3 millimeters long. The spherical <b>megaspores</b> are 430 to 680 micrometers in diameter with closely set ridges. The kidney-shaped microspores are 24-35 micrometers long, and usually have spine-tipped tubercules. The <b>megaspores</b> can sometimes come to resemble that of either I. echinospora, if the <b>megaspores</b> become eroded and bear projections that could resemble spines, or I. macrospora, if the broken ridges take a certain shape.|$|R
50|$|Distinctive {{characteristics}} {{of this species}} include brown-spotted sporangial walls and <b>megaspores</b> with highly reticulate ridges, producing a spiny effect. The leaves are up to 40 cm long.|$|R
50|$|Heterosporic plants, {{as their}} name suggests, bear spores of two sizes - microspores and megaspores. These would {{germinate}} to form microgametophytes and megagametophytes, respectively. This system {{paved the way}} for ovules and seeds: taken to the extreme, the megasporangia could bear only a single <b>megaspore</b> tetrad, and to complete the transition to true ovules, three of the megaspores in the original tetrad could be aborted, leaving one <b>megaspore</b> per megasporangium.|$|E
50|$|The female megasporangiate {{is larger}} than the male. It {{contains}} bracts and megasporophylls, each of which contains two ovules, arranged in a spiral. These then develop a nucellus in which a mother cell if formed. Meiosis occurs and a <b>megaspore</b> is produced as the first cell of the megagametophyte. As cell division takes place the nucleus of the <b>megaspore</b> thickens, and cell differentiation occurs to produce prothallial tissue containing an ovum. The remaining undifferentiated cells then form the endosperm.|$|E
