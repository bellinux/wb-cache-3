5|$|Al-Balawi, 32, was a Jordanian {{doctor who}} worked at a clinic for Palestinian refugee women and {{children}} in the Marka refugee camp near Amman, Jordan. He was an al-Qaeda sympathizer from the town of Zarqa, the hometown of Jordanian militant Islamist Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi.</b> He was married and had two daughters. Islamist websites, as well as some newspapers, characterized the attacker as a triple agent, someone who is believed to be a double agent by the intelligence organization he infiltrates.|$|E

25|$|Abu Ayyub al-Masri's al-Qaeda {{movement}} in Iraq regularly releases short videos glorifying {{the activity of}} jihadist suicide bombers. In addition, {{both before and after}} the death of Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi</b> (the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq), the umbrella organization to which al-Qaeda in Iraq belongs, the Mujahideen Shura Council, has a regular presence on the Web.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} of ongoing Hezbollah contact or cooperation with al-Qaeda. Hezbollah's leaders denies links to al-Qaeda, present or past. al-Qaeda's leaders, such as former Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi,</b> consider Shia, which most Hezbollah members are, to be apostates, as do Salafi-jihadis today. However, the 9/11 Commission Report found that several Al-Qaeda operatives and top military commanders were sent to Hezbollah training camps in Lebanon in 1994.|$|E
50|$|Noting Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi's</b> {{interaction}} with bin Laden and the terrorist leader's association with Hassan Ghul, CIA agents then cite {{the importance of}} Abu Ahmed Al-Kuwaiti, a pseudonym for bin Laden's courier and his only point of contact to the outside world.|$|R
5|$|On 9 November 2005, Al-Qaeda under Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi's</b> {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured.

The most recent red X cover issue of Time was published on May 2, 2011, after the death of Osama bin Laden.|$|E
25|$|Following the U.S. {{invasion}} of Iraq {{as part of}} the George W. Bush administration's post 9/11 foreign policy, many foreign Mujahideen joined several Sunni militant groups resisting the U.S. occupation of Iraq. A considerable part of the insurgents did not come from Iraq but instead from many other Arab countries, notably Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Among these recruits was Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi,</b> a Jordanian national who would go on to assume the leadership of Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).|$|E
25|$|U.S. marines encircled Fallujah with an earth wall, {{trying to}} control access to the city, {{allowing}} only women and children to leave the city. On 19 June 2004, twenty two Iraqis, among them women and children, {{were killed in a}} U.S. air strike on a residential neighborhood. Allawi condemned the rebellion and called upon the city to surrender Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi,</b> the leader of the Tawhid-e-Jihad group who is alleged to be hiding in Fallujah, or face aerial bombing by the United States.|$|E

Koksal was freed on August 18, 2004.|$|R
50|$|Its leader, Ayatollah al-Hakim, {{was killed}} in a car bomb attack in the Iraqi city of Najaf on August 29, 2003. The car bomb {{exploded}} as the ayatollah was leaving a religious shrine (Imam Ali Mosque) in the city, just after Friday prayers, killing more than 85. According to Kurdish Intelligence officials, Yassin Jarad, allegedly Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi's</b> father-in-law, carried out the car bombing.|$|R
50|$|Iraq's deputy {{interior}} minister said in early February 2012 that weapons and Islamist militants were entering Syria from Iraq.The Quilliam Foundation reported {{that many of}} Nusra's members were Syrians {{who were part of}} Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi's</b> Islamist network fighting the 2003 American invasion in Iraq; Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari agreed to that in 2012. The British The Daily Telegraph stated in December 2012 that many foreign al-Nusra fighters were hardened veterans from conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|R
25|$|The US {{government}} {{presents the}} case differently. It says that U.S. military forces, operating in Iraq pursuant to U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1546 (2003) and 1637 (2004) {{as part of}} the Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), captured Omar during a raid on associates of Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi.</b> The government concluded that Omar was part of Zarqawi's network and that he facilitated terrorist activities both in and outside of Iraq. Four Jordanian foreign fighters and an Iraqi insurgent were captured along with Omar, and weapons and improvised explosive device (IED)-making materials were found in Omar's home.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Kurdish Islamist {{militant group}} Ansar al-Islam {{controlled}} a small section of northern Iraq {{in an area}} outside of Saddam Hussein's control. Ansar al-Islam had been fighting against secular Kurdish forces since 2001. At {{the time of the}} invasion they fielded about 600 to 800 fighters. Ansar al-Islam was led by the Jordanian-born militant Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi,</b> who would later become an important leader in the Iraqi insurgency. Ansar al-Islam was driven out of Iraq in late March by a joint American-Kurdish force during Operation Viking Hammer.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} no ricin had been found was known to some {{government}} departments very early on, but this information was not revealed to the public until after Bourgass's trial two years later, although in the interim it was cited as evidence for further terrorism laws, as well as featuring in US Secretary of State Colin Powell's 5 February 2003 speech to the UN to build {{the case for the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq, as part of the alleged Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi</b> global terrorist network. As late as February 2006, Chancellor Gordon Brown described it as a significant terrorism plot spanning 26 countries.|$|E
50|$|During {{the fall}} of 2005, insurgents, {{suspected}} to be mostly Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi's</b> al-Qaeda in Iraq launched {{a new round of}} massive suicide bombings against Shi'a populations, declaring an all-out war on the Shi'a majority. Hundreds of Shi'a workers, soldiers, and civilians were killed in several of these individual strikes. Shi'a anger was quelled by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who forbade revenge attacks and kept the Shi'a populace in line and in support of the government.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{captured}} by Jordanian 71st Counter Terrorism Battalion {{with the aid of}} Jordanian intelligence officers in May 2006, and accused of being Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi's</b> assistant which Karbouly denied. Karbouly told the tribunal that he was “innocent”. He also disputed the prosecution’s version that he {{was captured}} inside Iraq in a joint operation of the Jordanian army and intelligence on 10 May. He told the tribunal that he was instead kidnapped “from Lebanon on May 6.” ...|$|R
5000|$|According to the United States Department of the Treasury, Moumou {{traveled}} to Afghanistan {{in the mid-1990s}} {{to participate in the}} al-Qaeda-run Khalden training camp. According to TelQuel, Moumou was recruited in 1996 by Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi to serve as a [...] "sleeper agent" [...] in Stockholm. Moumou reportedly served, at some time in the past, as [...] "Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi's</b> representative in Europe for issues related to chemical and biological weapons". He reportedly maintained ties to [...] "al-Zarqawi's inner circle" [...] in Iraq.|$|R
25|$|Some Wahabi groups, often labeled as takfiri and {{sometimes}} linked to Al-Qaeda, have even advocated {{the persecution of}} the Shia as heretics. Such groups have been allegedly responsible for violent attacks and suicide bombings at Shi'a gatherings at mosques and shrines, most notably in Iraq during the Ashura mourning ceremonies where hundreds of Shias were killed in coordinated suicide bombings, but also in Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, in a video message, Al-Qaeda deputy Dr Ayman al-Zawahiri directed Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi,</b> of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, not to attack civilian targets but {{to focus on the}} occupation troops. His call seems to have been ignored, or swept away in the increasing tensions of Iraq under occupation.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Allen McChrystal (born August 14, 1954) is {{a retired}} United States Army general {{best known for his}} command of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) in the mid-2000s.

He previously served as Director, Joint Staff from August 2008 to June 2009 and as Commander of JSOC from 2003 to 2008, where he was credited with the death of Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi,</b> leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, but also criticized for his alleged role in the cover-up of the Pat Tillman friendly fire incident. McChrystal was reportedly known for saying and thinking what other military leaders were afraid to; {{this was one of the}} reasons cited for his appointment to lead all forces in Afghanistan. He held the post from June 15, 2009, to June 23, 2010.|$|E
500|$|American and Israeli {{counter-terrorism}} officials {{claim that}} Hezbollah has (or had) links to Al Qaeda, although Hezbollah's leaders deny these allegations. Also, some al-Qaeda leaders, like Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi</b> and Wahhabi clerics, consider Hezbollah to be apostate. But United States intelligence officials speculate {{that there has}} been contact between Hezbollah and low-level al-Qaeda figures who fled Afghanistan for Lebanon. However, Michel Samaha, Lebanon's minister of information, has said that Hezbollah has been an important ally of the government in the war against terrorist groups, and described the [...] "American attempt to link Hezbollah to al-Qaeda" [...] to be [...] "astonishing".|$|E

50|$|U.S. forces {{launched}} only occasional armored {{forays into}} Samarra and Baquba, while {{about half a}} dozen small forts were maintained by the U.S. Marines in Ramadi, with the surrounding territory in the city controlled by rebels. American ground forces remained outside of Fallujah, though regular air strikes were conducted on alleged safehouses of Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi's</b> followers in the city. With the battle for Fallujah over, the Sunni insurgency continued against the U.S. forces remaining outside these cities as the guerrillas resumed their tactics of using IED’s and mortars to attack U.S. forces indirectly, {{for the most part}} avoiding direct combat.|$|R
500|$|Attempting {{to emulate}} the {{perceived}} success in Fallujah, US commanders in Ramadi responded to the 28 June transfer of sovereignty from the CPA to the Iraqi Interim Government by pulling most forces back to camps outside the city and focusing on securing a highway that ran through its center. Fighting continued to escalate throughout Anbar Province. On 21 June, a four-man Scout Sniper team operating with 2nd Battalion 4th Marines in Ramadi was executed {{by a group of}} insurgents who had infiltrated their observation post. In mid-July, General Mattis predicted that Anbar would [...] " [...] to hell" [...] if the Marines could not hold Ramadi. On 5 August, Anbar Provincial Governor Abd al-Karim Barjas resigned following the kidnapping of his two sons by Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi.</b> Barjas appeared on television and publicly apologized for [...] "cooperation with the infidel". He was replaced by an interim governor until January 2005. The head of the Ramadi police force was subsequently arrested for complicity with the kidnappings.|$|E
500|$|Conditions in Anbar {{particularly}} favored an insurgency. The province was overwhelmingly Sunni, {{the minority}} religious group that lost {{its power and}} influence in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. Hussein was also very popular in the province {{than anywhere else in}} the country. Many did not fight during the invasion (allowing them to claim that they had not been defeated) and [...] "still wanted to slug it out", according to journalist Tom Ricks. Military service was compulsory in Saddam's Iraq and the Amiriyah area contained a sizeable portion of Iraq's arms industry. Immediately after Saddam fell, insurgents and others looted many of the 96 known munitions sites, as well as local armories and weapons stockpiles. [...] These weapons were used to arm the insurgents in Anbar and elsewhere. While only a small minority of Sunnis were initially insurgents, many either supported or tolerated them. Sympathetic Ba'athists and former Saddam officials in Syrian exile provided money, sanctuary, and foreign fighters to insurgent groups. Future al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu <b>Musab</b> <b>al-Zarqawi</b> spent part of 2002 in central Iraq, including Anbar Province, preparing for resistance. [...] Within several months of the invasion the province had become a sanctuary for anti-occupation fighters.|$|E

It was parodied by comedy group Moron Life titled [...] "Overplayed" [...] and was released on MySpace in August 2006. [...] "Bad Day" [...] was also covered by the fictional music group Alvin and the Chipmunks for their 2007 film Alvin and the Chipmunks.

5000|$|A {{compromise}} on April 30 was reached {{in order to}} ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the [...] "Fallujah Brigade", a unit that drew from former members of Iraq's Army, local volunteers, and even the insurgents themselves.

This unit was to act {{under the control of the}} Coalition Provisional Authority, patrol alongside the Iraqi Police and National Guardsmen but maintain its autonomy. The Fallujah Brigade had many former Saddam loyalists. From various reports, Brigade members re-integrated themselves into the insurgent outfits that dominated. http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&itemid=977 The city remained under the control of insurgent and rebel forces.
