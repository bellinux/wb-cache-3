40|$|In {{the search}} for retinoids active against Burkitt's {{lymphoma}} (BL), {{we found that the}} arotinoid <b>mofarotene</b> (Ro 40 - 8757) induced strong antiproliferative and apoptotic responses in most established BL cell lines as well as in primary BL cells. Ro 40 - 8757 -induced apoptosis is associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, activation of caspase- 3 and - 9, and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. These effects were related to a transient drop in intracellular ATP content, probably favored by a downregulation of NADH dehydrogenase subunit- 1, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) Complex I. Inhibition of MRC with thenoyltrifluoroacetone suppressed both the ATP recovery and apoptosis, confirming that the effects of Ro 40 - 8757 are mediated by changes in mitochondrial function. Compared to EBV-negative lines, EBV-carrying BLs were more resistant to Ro 40 - 8757 -induced apoptosis. EBV infection and ectopic LMP- 1 expression increased the resistance of BL cells to Ro 40 - 8757 -induced apoptosis, probably through bcl- 2 upregulation. Finally, we also show that 2 -methoxyoestradiol, an inhibitor of the scavenger enzymes superoxide dismutases, enhanced Ro 40 - 8757 -mediated apoptosis. These findings provide the rationale for evaluating the clinical efficacy of Ro 40 - 8757 in BL patients and suggest that the combination of Ro 40 - 8757 with inhibitors of scavenger enzymes may be a promising therapeutic approach for this aggressive lymphoma...|$|E
