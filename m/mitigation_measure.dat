25|$|Both GCRs and SPEs are {{of concern}} for CNS risks. The major GCRs are {{composed}} of protons, α-particles, and particles of HZE nuclei with a broad energy spectra ranging from a few tens to above 10,000 MeV/u. In interplanetary space, GCR organ dose and dose-equivalent of more than 0.2 Gy or 0.6 Sv per year, respectively, are expected. The high energies of GCRs allow them to penetrate to hundreds of centimeters of any material, thus precluding radiation shielding as a plausible <b>mitigation</b> <b>measure</b> to GCR risks on the CNS. For SPEs, the possibility exists for an absorbed dose of over 1 Gy from an SPE if crew members are in a thinly shielded spacecraft or performing a spacewalk. The energies of SPEs, although substantial (tens to hundreds of MeV), do not preclude radiation shielding as a potential countermeasure. However, the costs of shielding may be high {{to protect against the}} largest events.|$|E

[...] She said: [...] "We are also yet to assess the impact to level crossings on the corridors, because there is the capacity to actually reduce some of the number of level crossings, so grade separations are being considered as one <b>mitigation</b> <b>measure,</b> but it is yet to be determined whether they are included or not, and how many." [...] Her comments on grade separations were contradicted a month later by a government transport spokesman in a newspaper article on the traffic congestion at the level crossing on Murrumbeena Rd adjacent to Murrumbeena station. The spokesman, Bill Kyriakopoulos, said grade separation at Murrumbeena [...] "was not being considered as a long-term solution".|$|E

40|$|A {{scarcity}} of empirical {{research has been}} observed on risk <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> for those construction projects procured by guaranteed maximum price contracts (GMP) and target cost contracts (TCC) worldwide. This paper aims to seek and examine the risk <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> associated with GMP and TCC (GMP/TCC) construction projects through an industry-wide empirical questionnaire survey launched in Hong Kong. Survey respondents were invited to delineate their levels of agreement on 18 individual risk <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> identified from reported literature and in-depth interviews, and the views of client group were {{compared with those of}} contractor group. The survey results manifested that both the client group and contractor group are in general consistent in their views towards the risk <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> for GMP/TCC contracts. However, the Mann-Whitney U Test revealed that they held different perceptions on 4 out of the 18 risk <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures,</b> and the findings may stem from different roles involved in the projects. The research findings are useful in providing industrial practitioners with valuable pointers towards effective risk <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> of applying GMP/TCC schemes at an early stage of project delivery...|$|R

Thus, the main goal of the work here reported was the evaluation of <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> implemented in nursery and primary schools to improve air quality. Continuous measurements of CO 2, CO, NO 2, O 3, CH 2 O, total volatile organic compounds (VOC), PM 1, PM 2. 5, PM 10, Total Suspended Particles (TSP) and radon, as well as temperature and relative humidity were performed in two campaigns, {{before and after the}} implementation of low-cost <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures.</b> Evaluation of those <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> was performed through the comparison of the concentrations measured in both campaigns. Exceedances to the values set by the national legislation and World Health Organization (WHO) were found for PM 2. 5, PM 10, CO 2 and CH 2 O during both indoor air quality campaigns. Temperature and relative humidity values were also above the ranges recommended by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). In general, pollutant concentrations measured after the implementation of low-cost <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> were significantly lower, mainly for CO 2.

40|$|Avalanches pose {{a threat}} to {{settlements}} as well as industrial and recreational areas in the Alps. As a counter <b>measure,</b> technical <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> have been implemented since the 19 th century, resulting in a raise in value of formerly endangered areas. This increase in value can be considered as a benefit due to prevented damage. This paper compares the total costs and benefits of technical <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> in the municipality of Davos, Switzerland as a basis for evaluating their net social benefit. The benefit of avalanche defence structures is determined using two different approaches. First, the replacement value of buildings protected by <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> is quantified. Second, the number of protected persons is monetarily assessed by means of a human capital approach. The quantified benefit is compared with the present value of cumulative capital expenditures on avalanche <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures.</b> In addition, distributional effects of the public expenditures on technical <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> are discussed based on the average future tax revenues within protected areas. Depending on whether benefits are calculated in terms of protected buildings or protected persons, the results show a large range of cost-benefit ratios. Critical issues of cost-benefit analyses in the context of alpine natural hazards are highlighted, including problems related to the human capital approach and the sensitivity of results to how benefits are calculated. The applicability of cost-benefit analyses for evaluating avalanche <b>mitigation</b> <b>measures</b> is discussed...|$|R
