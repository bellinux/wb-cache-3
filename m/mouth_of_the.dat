5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Somme was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area, near the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Somme. This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E

Horizontal and temporal distributions of wedge sole (Dicologlossa cuneata) egg and larval abundances were analysed during this annual cycle in relation to environmental parameters. This area {{proved to be an}} important spawning and nursery ground for the species, which showed a winter-spring reproductive strategy with a long reproductive period lasting from autumn until early summer. Spawning areas were located in the shallowest waters (above 30 m depth) between <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rives Guadiana and Tinto-Odiel, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the coastal zone between <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rivers Tinto- Odiel and Guadalquivir. The spawning habitat was mainly determined by <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adults, the bathymetry and the temperature, and a preference for shallow and colder waters was observed. The inshore zone between <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rivers Tinto-Odiel and Guadalquivir is the main nursery ground, with the greatest larval concentration and productivity in the area, due to <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Guadalquivir. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> recruits in this area may be linked to these favourable conditions for larval growth and survival.

At 1500UTC on June24, the tropical storm warning was extended to the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Suwannee River. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch was issued from the Suwannee River to Anclote Key. These were all canceled at 1500UTC on June25, though a tropical storm warning was then implemented from Destin to Englewood, Florida. Early on June26, a tropical storm warning was issued from Mexico Beach to Englewood, Florida. By 2100UTC that day, the tropical storm warning was extended {{to the mouth of}} Steinhatchee River in Florida. This was discontinued after Debby became a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|As Hurricane Ida {{moved over}} the Yucatán Channel on November8, the NHC issued a {{hurricane}} watch for areas between Grand Isle, Louisiana and Mexico Beach, Florida.

The hurricane watch was also modified to encompass a smaller area, between Grand Isle and Pascagoula. A hurricane warning was also issued from Pascagoula to Indian Pass.

5|$|At 05:00 on 13 April Stopford {{gave the}} order for the inshore {{squadron}} to withdraw back to Gambier's fleet. Cochrane was again furious, and even suggested taking Imperieuse and Indefatigable on a desperate attack on the still-grounded Océan. Captain John Tremayne Rodd on the latter refused. Frustrated, Cochrane remained in the anchorage, joined by Pallas and the smaller vessels as the larger ships returned to more open waters. At 08:00 he ordered a renewed attack on the remaining grounded ships at the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Charente, and by 11:00 the small vessels were in position and opened fire on the French flagship. Although Aetnas gun split, forcing her withdrawal, the barrage otherwise continued throughout the day, although to little effect. It was not until 16:00 when the battered Océan and Régulus, most of their stores thrown overboard, were able to safely retreat towards the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Charente.|$|E
