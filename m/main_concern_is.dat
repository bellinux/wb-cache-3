5|$|One {{year after}} the events of , Agent Peggy Carter is {{now a member of}} the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR). She faces sexism from her boss, Agent John Flynn, who treats her condescendingly and keeps her {{compiling}} data and code breaking while assigning field cases to the male agents. The SSR's <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> the mysterious Zodiac, which they have been unable to recover for some time.|$|E
5|$|The {{drilling}} {{project has}} been opposed by some environmental groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact. The <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> that the lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from refreezing. Scientists of the United States National Research Council have taken the position {{that it should be}} assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.|$|E

25|$|Some {{have criticized}} the American government's {{promotion}} of milk consumption. Their <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> the financial interest that the American government has taken in the dairy industry, promoting milk as the best source of calcium. All United States schools that {{are a part of}} the federally funded National School Lunch Act are required by the federal government to provide milk for all students. The Office of Dietary Supplements recommends that healthy adults between ages 19 and 50 get about 1,000mg of calcium per day.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} issue related to {{human gene therapy}} is safety, particularly for the gene therapy of non-fatal diseases such as OA. The <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> the high immunogenicity of certain viral vectors. Retroviral vectors integrate into the chromosomes of the cells they infect. There will be always a chance of integrating into a tumor suppressor gene or an oncogene, leading to virulent transformation of the cell. In general, gene transfer to humans is considered as a safe therapeutic method, despite recent events that have provided examples of random adverse events.|$|E
25|$|The boxer or out-fighter {{tends to}} be most {{successful}} against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds {{in an attempt to}} achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.|$|E

25|$|Georgia has {{indicated}} {{that the need for}} fresh water to use for human consumption is its primary concern in the issue. Experts in the metro Atlanta area assert that the people of metro Atlanta require and can safely extract 705 million gallons of fresh water per day from a number of reservoir and water basins around northern Georgia until the year 2030. Georgia states the water from Lake Allatoona and the Etowah River in North Georgia could sustain the water needs of the metro Atlanta area. Georgia's <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> whether or not they have the capability to supply over 5.6 million people in the metro Atlanta area with potable water.|$|E
25|$|This {{is often}} highly {{emphasized}} by spectators and novice vaulters, {{but it is}} arguably the easiest phase of the vault and {{is a result of}} proper execution of previous phases. This phase mainly consists of the vaulter pushing off the pole and releasing it so it falls away from the bar and mats. As the torso goes over and around the bar, the vaulter is facing the bar. Rotation of the body over the bar occurs naturally, and the vaulter's <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> making sure that their arms, face and any other appendages do not knock the bar off as they go over. The vaulter should land near the middle of the foam landing mats, or pits, face up.|$|E
25|$|In the ASEAN region, Indonesia is {{the second}} largest market for Japanese food, after Thailand. Japanese cuisine has been {{increasingly}} popular as {{the growth of the}} Indonesians middle-class expecting higher quality foods. This is also contributed to the fact that Indonesia has large numbers of Japanese expatriates. The <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> the halal issue. As a Muslim majority country, Indonesians expected that Japanese food served there are halal according to Islamic dietary law, which means no pork and alcohol allowed. Japanese restaurant in Indonesia often offer set menu which include rice served with array of Japanese favourite in a single setting. A set menu might include a choice of yakiniku or sukiyaki, including sample of sushi, tempura, gyoza and miso soup. Quite authenthic Japanese style izakaya and ramen shops can be found in Little Tokyo (Melawai) area in Blok M, South Jakarta, serving both Japanese expats and locals clientele. Today, Japanese restaurants can be found in most of Indonesian major cities, with high concentration in Greater Jakarta area, Bandung, Surabaya and Bali.|$|E

25|$|A hernia is the {{abnormal}} exit {{of tissue}} or an organ, {{such as the}} bowel, through {{the wall of the}} cavity in which it normally resides. Hernias come {{in a number of different}} types. Most commonly they involve the abdomen, specifically the groin. Groin hernias are most common of the inguinal type but may also be femoral. Other hernias include hiatus, incisional, and umbilical hernias. Symptoms are present in about 66% of people with groin hernias. This may include pain or discomfort especially with coughing, exercise, or going to the bathroom. Often it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down. A bulging area may occur that becomes larger when bearing down. Groin hernias occur more often on the right than left side. The <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> strangulation, where the blood supply to part of the bowel is blocked. This usually produces severe pain and tenderness of the area. Hiatus or hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.|$|E
25|$|According to Janes {{the navy}} is badly underfunded {{and much of}} its {{equipment}} {{is in need of}} maintenance; as a consequence it is scarcely able to carry out its tasks, with operations often delayed or cancelled. The navy's patrol craft are barely effective; fuel costs and maintenance problems mean that often only one boat is available for sea duty at any time, while the heavy landing craft have high upkeep costs and are nearing the end of their service life. Although the patrol boats may be at times serviceable, the task of patrolling such a large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is too great and they are heavily reliant for information about the presence of foreign ships on daily reports supplied by US satellite surveillance. The <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> illegal tuna fishing by Japanese vessels. The navy would like larger vessels as the Pacific class experiences difficulties in deep ocean conditions and is exploring the possibility of procuring a 2,000 tonne multipurpose vessel, or the conversion of a merchant vessel, for patrol duties.|$|E
500|$|Carter has {{described}} [...] "Gethsemane" [...] as a [...] "big ideas episode", noting that its <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> debating [...] "the existence of God". The {{title of the}} episode is an allusion to the biblical garden of Gethsemane where Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot. The character Michael Kritschgau was named after a former drama teacher of Gillian Anderson. The tagline for this episode is [...] "Believe the lie", changed from the usual [...] "The truth is out there". This episode marks the first appearance of one of Scully's brothers since a flashback in the season two episode [...] "One Breath". Section Chief Scott Blevins makes his first appearance since the fourth episode of the first season, [...] "Conduit".|$|E

500|$|Inequality issue: A <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> the {{possibility}} of undesirable distribution repercussions because {{of the diversity of}} road users. The use of the tolled road depends on the user's level of income. [...] Where some cannot afford to pay the congestion charge, then this policy is likely to privilege the middle-class and rich. The users who shift to some less-preferred alternative are also worse off. The less wealthy are the more likely to switch to public transit. Road space rationing is another strategy generally viewed as more equitable than congestion pricing. However, high-income users can always avoid the travel restrictions by owning a second car and users with relatively inelastic demand (such as a worker who needs to transport tools to a job site) are relatively more impacted.|$|E
500|$|In {{conversation}} with Woods, Biko {{insisted that the}} BCM would not degenerate into anti-white racism [...] "because it isn't a negative, hating thing. It's a positive black self-confidence thing involving no hatred of anyone". He acknowledged that a [...] "fringe element" [...] may retain [...] "anti-white bitterness"; he added: [...] "we'll {{do what we can}} to restrain that, but frankly it's not one of our top priorities or one of our major concerns. Our <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> the liberation of the blacks." [...] Elsewhere, Biko argued that it was the responsibility of a vanguard movement to ensure that, in a post-apartheid society, the black majority would not seek vengeance upon the white minority. He stated that this would require an education of the black population in order to teach them how to live in a non-racial society.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke {{felt that}} Ellen brought a [...] "maternal energy" [...] to the series, and {{described}} the character as [...] "a lioness, which is tough and badass and 'You touch my children, I will kill you.'" [...] Likewise, actress Samantha Ferris described her as a [...] "gun-toting, beer-slinging, bar-owning broad" [...] with a [...] "very maternal core". Ferris also feels that, despite Ellen having gone through a lot in her life, she is cautious rather than jaded, and is [...] "very protective {{of the things she}} has in her life", especially her daughter Jo and the Winchesters. Thus, her <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> Jo's safety, which prompts her to forbid her daughter from going on hunts. When she realizes that she can no longer stop Jo from doing what she wants, Ellen becomes her hunting partner, deciding it {{is the best way to}} look after her. By the time of Ellen's final appearance, actress Alona Tal came to view their characters more as equals rather than mother and daughter.|$|E

În 1860 {{he was appointed}} Minister of the Navy, holding his position for 14 years. His <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> the modernization of the Russian navy. His <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> the naval artillery and he {{was instrumental in the}} building of the Obukhovsky Steel Foundry (now Obukhov State Plant) for the production of naval guns. He also started modernizing the fleet from wooden vessels to metal plated ships and from sailing ships to ships equipped with steam engines. He also made the arrangement for Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich's visit the United States.|$|R

2500|$|The {{cleaning}} solution {{should be prepared}} using distilled water. [...] If that is unavailable, softened water may be substituted. [...] The <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> to avoid hard water, which will leave deposits of minerals in the fibres. [...] The solution should {{be placed in a}} container large enough for the textile to lie flat in. [...] For large pieces, {{it may be necessary to}} construct a temporary basin outside or in a large room: [...] Putnam and Finch suggest using boards or bricks to constrict a frame, then lining it with a large piece of plastic, weighted on the sides, and strong enough to support the water that will be poured into it. [...] If a smaller basin is used, it should be of ceramic, stainless steel or a stable plastic.|$|E
2500|$|Mexican {{journalist}} Raymundo Riva-Palacio criticized (on his {{columns of}} October 21 and October 23) the privileges {{given by the}} Calderón administration to American intelligences agencies and billateral cooperation in general, and wrote: [...] "...It {{can be argued that}} Washington mocked him and betrayed him..." [...] Mr. Riva-Palacio wrote that American intelligence agencies coordinated field operations and even interrogated the detainees before Mexican authorities could do their own. According to Mr. Riva, this privileges led to the illegal spying which enabled American intelligence agencies to make a map of the Mexican political world, which (according to him) is demonstrated in many documents where the <b>main</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> the political stability and future of Mexico, and the subsequent spying carried on Mr. Peña while he was running for office. He then criticized Mr. Calderón request to Mr. Peña to investigate the spying carried on his e-mail and his cabinet members e-mails and declared that Calderón should have done that when the first allegations of illegal spying came out in 2009-2010. On October 22, 2013, CNNMéxico published on its website that Calderón avoided sending sensitive information through his e-mail, to outsmart spies, and when realized phone calls with other cabinet members, spoke in code. On October 23, 2013, the Secretary of the Interior, Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong, announced that, by presidential mandate, a profund investigation would be carried on the illegal spying done towards Calderón.|$|E
