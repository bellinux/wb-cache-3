40|$|BACKGROUND: Helplessness <b>and</b> <b>mastery</b> in {{childhood}} <b>and</b> {{in response to}} the events that trigger onset are implicated in the development of eating disorders. However, no studies have yet explored how these are linked and whether the effects are additive or mediated. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews (Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse; Life Events and Difficulties Schedule; Coping Strategies Interview) were used to assess helplessness <b>and</b> <b>mastery</b> {{in childhood}} <b>and</b> in response to a provoking agent in 15 eating disordered and 19 non-eating disordered women. RESULTS: Helplessness <b>and</b> <b>mastery</b> in childhood were related to helplessness <b>and</b> <b>mastery</b> {{in response to the}} events and difficulties that triggered onset of the eating disorder. However, only the presence of helplessness and the lack of mastery in response to this provoking agent predicted onset. CONCLUSION: Helplessness <b>and</b> <b>mastery</b> are vulnerability <b>and</b> protective factors but only in those women who develop an eating disorder in the context of later life events. It is suggested that helplessness <b>and</b> <b>mastery</b> in childhood act via their influence on the adequacy of coping in response to later life events. (Eat.

50|$|Drift and Mastery: An Attempt to Diagnose the Current Unrest is {{the second}} book by American {{journalist}} and political thinker Walter Lippmann. Published in the Fall of 1914, Drift <b>and</b> <b>Mastery</b> argues that rational scientific governing can overcome forces of societal drift. Lippmann argued that due to the profound social and economic change old ideas and institutions lacked relevance. Specifically, Drift <b>and</b> <b>Mastery</b> warns against a reliance on broad theories and the framework of competition and self-interest. Democracy and society at large, he argued, was unable to address problems because it was adrift, lacking intentionality and discipline. Lippmann's prescription in Drift <b>and</b> <b>Mastery</b> was deliberate <b>and</b> scientific governing, what he termed mastery. This forward-looking progressive vision sought a better society through rational, scientific order, while rejecting Marxist, Utopian and traditionalist thinking. Drift <b>and</b> <b>Mastery</b> received enormously positive reviews, establishing Lippmann as an important public intellectual and figure within the progressive movement. Although Lippmann later lost faith in the promise of science and rationality in government, Drift <b>and</b> <b>Mastery</b> was <b>and</b> is regarded as an important document of the progressive movement.|$|R

25|$|These {{issues have}} been tied to {{grammatical}} processing performance by testing native speakers of English on the same tasks under stressful conditions: there is shown to be difficulty in grammatical agreement when memory capacity is curtailed, important cues in the language when given noisy input, and processing important structures when not given enough time to process input. This shows that knowledge cannot always be automatically and consistently applied under stressful situations without having processing difficulties. However, these issues are not necessarily independent of each other, as low decoding ability of structure could affect processing speed. Overall, individual differences in L2 working memory and decoding ability are correlated to grammaticality judgment accuracy and latencies. However, there is no correlation between speed of processing measure and grammaticality judgment performance, age of arrival correlates with syntactic <b>mastery,</b> <b>and</b> knowledge of vocabulary probably drives grammaticality performance.|$|E

25|$|Clubs: Multi-piece {{clubs are}} the most popular clubs. The club is built along an {{internal}} rod, providing a base on which a handle made of polyolefin plastic is wrapped, providing an airspace between it and the internal rod. This airspace provides flex, cushioning impact, making the club softer on the hands. Foam ends and knobs further cushion the club. Multi-piece clubs are made in both a thin European style or larger bodied American style and in various lengths, generally ranging from 19 to 21 inches (480 to 530mm). The handles and bodies are typically wrapped with decorative plastics and tapes.

25|$|Berlioz's {{work as a}} {{conductor}} was highly influential and brought him fame across Europe. He was considered by Charles Hallé, Hans von Bülow and others {{to be the greatest}} conductor of his era. Berlioz initially began conducting due to frustrations over the inability of other conductors– more used to performing older and simpler music– to master his advanced and progressive works, with their extended melodies and rhythmic complexity. He began with more enthusiasm than <b>mastery,</b> <b>and</b> was not formally trained, but through perseverance his skills improved. He was also willing to take advice from others, as evidenced by Spontini criticising his early use of large gestures while conducting. One year later, according to Hallé, his movements were much more economical, enabling him to control more nuance in the music. His expert understanding of the way the sound of each instrument interacts with each other (demonstrated in his Treatise on Instrumentation) was attested to by the critic Louis Engel, who mentions how Berlioz once noticed, amidst an orchestral tutti, a minute pitch difference between two clarinets. Engel offers an explanation of Berlioz's ability to detect such things as in part due to the sheer nervous energy he was experiencing during conducting.|$|E
25|$|Within the Big Five {{model of}} personality, need for {{cognition}} {{has been found}} to relate positively to openness to experience most strongly and to a more moderate extent to conscientiousness, particularly the competence and achievement striving facets, and to relate inversely to an extent to neuroticism. Regarding Cloninger's temperament traits, need for cognition has been related negatively to harm avoidance and positively to persistence and was unrelated to reward dependence or novelty seeking. Need for cognition has only a weak positive relationship with sensation seeking, specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales. Need for cognition has a modest inverse correlation with negative affect. NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect, although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity, interest, and alertness. Need for cognition has been positively related to other, theoretically unrelated, personality characteristics such as self-esteem, masculine sex-role attitudes, and absorption. It is also negatively related to social anxiety (more strongly in females than males). It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of <b>mastery,</b> <b>and</b> hence greater self-esteem, although {{it is also possible that}} higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking. Need for cognition may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality. Regarding absorption, people high in need for cognition may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks. Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Understanding {{the goals}} of {{achievement}} and educational self-efficacy of the students might lead to their more engagement and then, higher learning and academic scheivement. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the mediating role of academic engagement in a relation to the achievement goals with academic self-efficacy. Instrument & Methods: In the correlational study, 360 female and meale medical, nursing, midwifery, and paramedical students of Kerman Shahid Bahonar University of Medical Sciences were studied in 2015. The subjects were selected via cluster random sampling. Data was collected using acheivemnet goals, academic self-efficacy, and academic engagement questionnaires. To investigate the causal model of caheivement goals, academic engagement, and salf-efficacy, correlative descarptive (by SPSS 20 and Amos 22 softwares) and path analysis (based on structural equations modeling) methods were used. Findings: There were significant effects between <b>mastery</b> approach <b>and</b> <b>mastery</b> avoidance approach <b>and</b> academic engagement and academic self-efficacy (p< 0. 05). There was a correlation between the goal of positively <b>mastery</b> approach <b>and</b> motivational, cognitive, and behavioral engagements.
