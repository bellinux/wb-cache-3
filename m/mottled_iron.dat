40|$|An {{examination}} of the erosion resistance of materials utilized {{in the construction of}} alumina pumps was carried out. This included laboratory research and, for the purpose of verification, investigation under actual service conditions. In this paper the effect of material properties on erosion resistance is considered. In the second paper the influence of phase properties and conditions of multiphase materials on material erosion resistance will be described. The results from studies of the seven most frequently utilized and recommended materials show that the erosion resistanceof candidate materials increases to a maximum and, then, decreases with decreasing material hardness. Surface examination reveals that ductile and brittle erosion mechanisms operate on the eroded surfaces of ductile and brittle materials respectively. Fracture toughness is a dominant factor for brittle materials, while hardness is a main factor for ductile materials. Under certain external conditions pump materials should be hard enough to resist material loss by ductile erosion mechanisms and should have sufficient fracture toughness to resist material loss by brittle erosion mechanisms. On the basis of the present work a schematic drawing is constructed to explain irregular patterns in the relation between resistance to material erosion and material hardness in previous works through simultaneous {{examination of}} hardness and fracture toughness. The first part of this work Erosion of materials by alumina slurry - part 1 has stated that the erosion resistance of materials in alumina pumps is connected with material properties such as hardness and fracture toughness. Part 2 investigates the erosion mechanisms of multiphase materials. Research into the erosion mechanisms of eroded surfaces as well as microstructural change below the eroded surface led to more thorough analysis of two characteristic wear-resistant materials (Norihard, Fonte 30 %Cr) and a relatively less resistant material, <b>mottled</b> <b>iron.</b> Material removal processes in different phases of multiphase materials are different, asynchronous and interactive. The erosion mechanisms of material removal from the matrices of different materials differ owing to their dependence on the matrix-phase properties and microstructure of the material. The modes of material removal of <b>mottled</b> <b>iron</b> and Norihard are established. A model of the erosion rate of material with a multiphase microstructure was proposed. In the case of pump elements for alumina slurry in an alkaline medium, a ductile matrix with sufficient hardness is important for higher erosion resistance. The erosion resistance is also affected by the size, shape and proportion of other microstructural components...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{role of the}} {{chemical}} composition of cast irons for mill rolls in tendencies of diffusionless transformations in the matrix was determined. The investigations of {{the chemical}} composition, microstructure and hardness influence on tribological properties of <b>mottled</b> cast <b>iron</b> {{is presented in the}} paper. Design/methodology/approach: The research stand is generally used in the tribological tests, and the counter sample of the material also common in such tests. Bearing steel 100 Cr 6, of a hardness of 57 HRC, was applied as a counter sample. The tribological tests were performed at a load of 100 N. Samples for tests were taken from seven mill rolls made by various producers. Mottled cast irons had a different chemical composition. Findings: The role of individual alloying elements in a tendency of the diffusionless transformations in the matrix, hardness, wear resistance and friction coefficient of <b>mottled</b> cast <b>irons</b> used for the mill rolls was estimated. The hardness increase rather increases the wear resistance of the investigated cast irons. Research limitations/implications: The possibility of designing the chemical composition of <b>mottled</b> cast <b>iron</b> {{in such a way as}} to obtain the low tribological wear at retaining, at the same time, the high friction coefficient was found. The relationship between the hardness resulting from the chemical composition and the wear resistance of the investigated <b>mottled</b> cast <b>irons</b> was presented. Practical implications: The obtained results can be utilised in designing the chemical compositions of the cast iron mill rolls and to obtain materials characterised by the high wear resistance at the assumed friction coefficient. Originality/value: Surprisingly, the increased chromium content seems to decrease the wear resistance of the investigated cast irons and the wear resistance of the investigated <b>mottled</b> cast <b>irons</b> is rather decreasing when the coefficient of friction increases...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{particle}} abrasive sizes on wear resistance of <b>mottled</b> cast <b>iron</b> with different retained austenite contents were studied. Abrasive wear tests using a pin test on alumina paper were carried out, using abrasive sizes between 16 mu m and 192 mu m. Retained austenite {{content of the}} matrix was determined by X-ray diffraction. The wear surface of samples and the alumina paper were examined by scanning electron microscopy for identifying the wear micromechanism. The results show that at lower abrasive sizes the mass loss was similar for the iron with different austenite contents. However, at higher abrasive sizes the samples with higher retained austenite content presented higher abrasion resistance. For lower abrasive sizes tested, samples with higher and lower retained austenite content both presented microcutting. On the other hand, the main wear micromechanism for the samples with higher retained austenite content and higher abrasive sizes was microploughing. The samples with lower retained austenite content presented microcutting and wedge formation at higher abrasive sizes. Higher abrasive size induced more microcutting in samples with lower retained austenite. The iron with lower retained austenite content presented wider grooves for the different abrasive sizes measured. SEM on the abrasive paper used on samples with higher retained austenite showed continuous and discontinuous microchips and the samples with lower retained austenite showed discontinuous microchips at 66 and 141 mu m. This research demonstrates the relation between abrasive size, wear resistance, groove width and wear micromechanism for <b>mottled</b> cast <b>iron</b> with different retained austenite contents.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} tempering temperatures (300 - 600 degrees C) on abrasive wear resistance of <b>mottled</b> cast <b>iron</b> were studied. Abrasive wear tests {{were carried out}} using the rubber-wheel test on quartz sand and the pin test on Al(2) O(3) abrasive cloths. The retained austenite content of the matrix was determined by X-ray diffraction. The wear surface of the specimens was examined by scanning electron microscopy for identifying the wear micromechanism. Bulk hardness and matrix hardness {{before and after the}} tests were measured. The results showed that in the two-body (pin-on-disc test) system, the main wear mechanism was microcutting and high matrix hardening was presented. The wear rates presented higher correlation with the retained austenite than with the bulk and matrix hardness. In the three-body system (sand-rubber wheel), the wear surfaces presented indentations due to abrasive rolling. The wear rates had better correlation with both the bulk and matrix hardness (before and after the wear test) than with the retained austenite content. There are two groups of results, high and low wear rates corresponding to each tribosystem, two-body abrasive wear and three-body abrasive wear, respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Samples of a {{low alloy}} Cr-Ni-Mo <b>mottled</b> cast <b>iron</b> were melted using CW CO 2 laser radiation. The laser treated layer {{presents}} severe defects, mainly cracks and pores. The amount of defects depends on the laser treatment technique, on the exact choice of operating parameters, {{as well as on}} the cast iron elaboration procedure. The best results were obtained using moderate power density, long interaction times, a moderate overlap between consecutive tracks and preheating the samples. The size of the graphite lamellae and the impurity content must be restricted to reduce the density of pores. The microstructure of the resolidified material depends also on the laser treating parameters. When the scanning speed is low, the solidification structure contains primary austenite dendrites in a ledeburitic matrix. During cooling, austenite transforms partially into martensite. An increase in the scanning speed leads to a decrease in the fraction of ledeburite and to a increase in the fraction of retained austenite. When the scanning speed exceeds a limit which depends on the power density, normal lamellar ledeburite disappears and a solidification structure consisting of long austenite dendrites with a interdendritic film of cementite forms. No martensite was detected in this case...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} a defective microstructure of a mill roll. For this purpose, {{a piece of a}} broken roll was collected. That roll was made of <b>mottled</b> cast <b>iron.</b> Its microstructure consisted of modular graphite, transformed ledeburite and a matrix composed of bainite and martensite. Metallographic investigations were performed nearby the fracture in the roll. Observations were conducted on polished sections, first not etched, and then etched, which allowed us to trace carefully the propagation of the fracture. There was found a strict correlation between the microstructure of the roll and the progress occurring in the crack. It was ascertained that the basic reason for the damage to the roll was banded precipitations of ledeburitic cementite. In addition, cementite formed a continuous network. Another microstructure defects of that roll are also precipitations of secondary carbides on the boundaries of former grain of austenite as well as the occurrence of upper bainite in its matrix. The results obtained hereunder allow broadening the data base relative to the genesis of damages to mill rolls, which in future will permit one to design a proper microstructure of cast iron mill rolls. Proper microstructure of cast iron mill roll should be shaped at the stage of designing the chemical composition, conditions of crystallization or heat treatment if any...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Purpose of this paper: This work {{supplements}} {{the knowledge}} concerning {{formation of the}} white layer {{on the surface of}} the tools being utilized in high temperature metal forming processes. Eight iron-based materials were tested: 3 ledeburitic cast steels, 2 hypereutectoid cast steels, normalized and stress relief annealed steel, hardened and tempered steel and nodular <b>mottled</b> cast <b>iron.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The exploitation tests were performed on the hot rolling mills for selected rolled sections, rolling stands and roll passes. The samples were cut out of the roll in such a way that they contained the roll working surface and were used for metallographic observations of the subsurface zone. Findings: It was found, that uniform distribution of dispersed precipitates of hypereutectoid cementite in the alloy matrix prevents the formation of the white layer {{on the surface of the}} rolls. Research limitations/implications: The white layer definition was given. An influence of the microstructure of iron base alloys on the susceptibility to form the white layer on their surface due to tribological contact was also determined. Practical implications: The procedure for obtaining rolled products of better quality as well as for restricting the probability of roll cracking was proposed. Obtained results should allow proper design of the microstructure of the materials for tools. Originality/value: This work contains several new aspects, which are: the unique tribological conditions for performing the tests, wide range of investigated materials, and combining the microstructure of the material with the susceptibility of the formation of the white layer on its surface. The results of this research may be used by the producers of tools for high temperature metal forming...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} particle hardness on the transition from mild to severe abrasive wear. White cast iron with 1. 9 wt% Cr with austenitic and martensitic matrices, white cast iron with 13. 8 wt% Cr and 24. 4 wt% Cr and <b>mottled</b> cast <b>iron,</b> and four types of abrasive with different hardness were used in pin-on-abrasive paper tests at 4. 6 N of load. The microstructure of the alloys was characterized by optical microscopy and the micromechanisms of abrasive wear were characterized using scanning electron microscopy. The hardnesses of both the abrasive and the alloys were selected to obtain a HA/H range ratio (in which HA is the hardness of the abrasive and H is the alloys' hardness) much wider than the one {{reported in the literature}} until now. The relationship between wear rate and friction coefficient versus HA/H ratio was analyzed. The results show that when the HA/H ratio is less than 1. 9, an increase in abrasive hardness produces significant increase in wear rate. However, when the ratio HA/H is more than 1. 9, increasing the abrasive hardness has little effect on the wear rate. Comparing these results with the ones from the literature for homogeneous materials and hard second phase materials, the regions found in this study correspond to the severe wear region, the mild–severe wear transition, and a small mild wear region. A correlation between the friction coefficient and the HA/H ratio was found: the friction coefficient increases proportionally with the increase of HA/H to achieve a HA/H ratio of about 3. 3. For HA/H values above 3. 3 the friction coefficient is relatively constant. FAPES...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{investigate}} tensile strength, hardness, density and wear resistance of the permanent mold cast iron. To carry out this experiment, suitable casting conditions, with which grey iron should be taken in the as-cast condition, were picked out, and the test pieces, JIS 8 C type tensile strength test pieces, were casted using two kinds of cast iron mold which has respectively mold ratio 6. 5 and 9. 0. The mold were coated with two layers of coating material, diatomaceous earth and soot. Irons, about 3 kg, were melted in a high frequency induction furnace at about 1450 ℃ with alumina crucible and were poured into the mold at 1300 ℃, after　being　inoculated　at　 1450 ℃ with 0. 3 % Ca-Si. Chemical composition of irons was adjusted to have required the degree of eutectic saturatio (Sc), 0. 85 to 1. 05, by the addition of low carbon steel to the base iron containing 3. 79 %C, 2. 20 %Si, 0. 44 %Mn, 0. 12 %P, 0. 05 %S. For purpose of reference, test pieces with same type were casted into green sand mold. The results obtained are as follows: (1) The microstructure of the permanent mold cast iron with a grey fracture in the as-cast condition is composed of ferritic and pearlitic matrix containing eutectic and fine flaky graphite, and higher Sc is, more the ferrite among the matrix becomes. (2) Strength of the permanent mold cast iron is better than that of the sand mold casting with same Sc:the tensile strength and the hardness of the permanent mold cast iron is respectively 24 to 32 kg/mm＾ 2) and 220 to 260 Hv(20). Density of the permanent mold cast iron is higher than that of green sand mold cast iron. (3) In case of grey iron permanent molding,it is necessary to select the chemical composition and the cooling conditions to keep away from tending to be white or <b>mottled</b> cast <b>iron,</b> and hence it tends to have similar structure and mechanical properties. Therefore,it will be recommended,in case of permanent mold casting,to controll strictly the casting conditions using the iron with higher Sc which has less chilling tendency. (4) Owing to the ferritic structure included in the matrix,wear resistance of the permanent mold cast iron is inferior to that of green sand mold cast iron, and higher Sc is, lower the wear resistance becomes...|$|R
