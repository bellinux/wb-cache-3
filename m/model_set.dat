Teachers encourage children in the first two age groups to use their senses to explore and manipulate materials in their immediate environment. Children in the last age group deal with abstract concepts based on their newly developed powers of reasoning, imagination, and creativity.|$|E

500|$|Carpenter was {{interested}} in creating two distinct looks for the movie. [...] "One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers.

As Snake pilots the glider into the city, there are three screens on his control panel displaying wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation.

500|$|Following {{the example}} of his mentor, T. W. Robertson, Gilbert strove {{to ensure that the}} costumes and sets were as {{realistic}} as possible. When preparing the sets for H.M.S. Pinafore, Gilbert and Sullivan visited Portsmouth in April 1878 to inspect ships. Gilbert made sketches of H.M.S. Victory and H.M.S. St Vincent and created a <b>model</b> <b>set</b> for the carpenters to work from. This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama, in which naturalism was still a relatively new concept, and in which most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged. This attention to detail was typical of Gilbert's stage management and would be repeated in all of his Savoy Operas. Gilbert's focus on visual accuracy provided a [...] "right-side-up for topsy-turvydom", that is, a realistic point of reference that serves to heighten the whimsicality and absurdity of the situations. Sullivan was [...] "in the full swing" [...] of work on the piece by the middle of April 1878. The bright and cheerful music of Pinafore was composed during a time when Sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone. The cast began music rehearsals on 24 April, and at the beginning of May 1878, the two collaborators worked closely together at Sullivan's flat to finalise the piece.|$|E
500|$|One of Gilbert's {{most notable}} innovations, first found in Thespis and {{repeated}} in Trial by Jury {{and all of}} the later Savoy operas, is the use of the chorus as {{an essential part of the}} action. [...] In most earlier operas, burlesques, and comedies, the chorus had very little impact on the plot and served mainly as [...] "noise or ornament". [...] In the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, however, the chorus is essential, taking part in the action and often acting as an important character in its own right. [...] Sullivan recalled, [...] "Until Gilbert took the matter in hand choruses were dummy concerns, and were practically nothing more than a part of the stage setting. [...] It was in 'Thespis' that Gilbert began to carry out his expressed determination to get the chorus to play its proper part in the performance. [...] At this moment it seems difficult to realise that the idea of the chorus being anything more than a sort of stage audience was, at that time, a tremendous novelty." [...] Another Gilbert innovation, following the example of his mentor, T. W. Robertson, was that the costumes and sets were made as realistic as possible: [...] Gilbert based the scenery for the production on the Clerkenwell Sessions House, where he had practised law in the 1860s. [...] The costumes were contemporary, and Angelina and her bridesmaids were dressed in real wedding attire. [...] This attention to detail and careful creation of realistic sets and scenes were typical of Gilbert's stage management and would be repeated in all of Gilbert's work. [...] For instance, when preparing the sets for H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), Gilbert and Sullivan visited Portsmouth to inspect ships. [...] Gilbert made sketches of H.M.S. Victory and H.M.S. St Vincent and created a <b>model</b> <b>set</b> for the carpenters to work from.
