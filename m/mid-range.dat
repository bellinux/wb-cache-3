5|$|While {{considered}} compelling {{by critics}} for a <b>mid-range</b> phone {{due to its}} display quality and its optional use of stock Android beneath the default Facebook Home overlay, the HTC First was panned by critics for its poor camera and lack of removable storage, and was also affected by the similarly underwhelming reception faced by the Facebook Home software. AT, the exclusive U.S. carrier of the First, only reportedly sold over 15,000 units of the device, while both ReadWrite and Time named it among the biggest failures in the technology industry for 2013.|$|E

5|$|On 23 May 2013, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that {{sales of the}} HTC One had reached around 5 million since its launch in March. By comparison, the iPhone 5 sold 5 million units within its first three days of availability and the Galaxy S4 shipped 10 million units within its first month of availability. While not quoting any further numbers, Mark Woodward, president of HTC’s North American division, considered the HTC One’s launch {{to have been the}} most successful in the company’s history. In response to its success, HTC released two other HTC One-branded devices throughout 2013 that extended traits and design elements from the device into other form factors, including the <b>mid-range</b> HTC One Mini, and HTC One Max phablet.|$|E
5|$|As 1989 wore on, Prost {{continually}} {{claimed his}} Honda V10s were not producing {{the same amount}} of power as those in Senna's car. It actually {{got to the point where}} Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's <b>mid-range</b> where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality). An example of Prost's claims came during the Mexican Grand Prix. Despite his car running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came of the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than the Brazilian and also had the benefit of a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.|$|E
5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the <b>mid-range</b> SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E

25|$|A <b>mid-range</b> {{speaker is}} a {{loudspeaker}} driver that reproduces {{a band of}} frequencies generally between 1–6kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). <b>Mid-range</b> driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be compression drivers (rather like some tweeter designs). If the <b>mid-range</b> driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the {{throat of a horn}} for added output level and control of radiation pattern.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{previous}} {{and future}} generations of the Porsche 911, there were several variants of the car manufactured, varying in body style, engines, drivetrains and included equipment. Whereas the Porsche 964 produced 247 horsepower, the model year 1995 993 produced 272, and this was increased again in the model year 1996-1998 911s {{with the addition of}} the Varioram system, which added additional power, particularly in the <b>mid-ranges,</b> and also resulted in a more throaty noise at higher revs; as a consequence, the 1996-1998 Varioram 993s put out 285 horsepower.

For the wider panel of countries and more recent data, we find that government expenditures and trade have positive effects on financial development for countries that are in the <b>mid-ranges</b> of economic development as measured by their per capita incomes, but have little effect for poor countries and strongly negative effects for the wealthiest ones. ...|$|R

5000|$|Boston: {{made for}} the general <b>mid-ranged</b> piano market at lower prices than Steinway's name brand. Boston pianos are {{manufactured}} at the Kawai piano factory in Hamamatsu, Japan.

Upright piano models are UP-118 PE, UP-126 PE, and UP-132 PE. Boston pianos incorporate some of the features of Steinway pianos such as a wider tail design (a feature of the Steinway piano models A-188, B-211, C-227, and D-274) resulting in a larger soundboard area than conventionally shaped pianos of comparable sizes, a maple inner rim, and Steinway's patented Octagrip pinblock.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the input}} {{has been sent}} to the hidden layer from the input layer, the hidden node may then send an output to the output layer. The output of any given node depends on the {{activation}} of that node and the response function of that node. In the case of a three-layer backpropagation network, the response function is a non-linear, logistic function. This function allows a node to behave in an all or none fashion towards high or low input values and in a more graded and sensitive fashion towards <b>mid-ranged</b> input values. It allows the nodes the result in more substantial changes in the network when the node activation is at the more extreme values.

Among airsofters, these are commonly called middle priced electric guns (MPEGs). Sometimes, MPEGs are copies or 'clones' of designs by full-price manufacturers like Tokyo Marui. As of late 2008 a small number of MPEG brands such as Echo-1/Jing Gong, and CYMA are considered by many to approach the quality and match the performance of the originals, at less than half the price. [...] "Fully compatible" [...] MPEGs imitate the Marui or Classic Army originals so precisely that standard upgrade parts will work with them, making it possible to hot-rod an MPEG to well beyond stock out-of-the-box AEG performance.|$|R
