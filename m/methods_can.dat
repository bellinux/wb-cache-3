If {{the resolution of the}} data is better than 1.4 Å (140 pm), direct <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> be used to obtain phase information, by exploiting known phase relationships between certain groups of reflections.|$|E

5|$|Certain species form {{communities}} called microatolls, {{which are}} colonies whose top {{is dead and}} mostly above the water line, but whose perimeter is mostly submerged and alive. Average tide level limits their height. By analyzing the various growth morphologies, microatolls offer a low resolution record of sea level change. Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using Radiocarbon dating. Such <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> help to reconstruct Holocene sea levels.|$|E

5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback {{to keep in mind}} is that these <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E
5|$|Methods in {{programming}} language are {{the members of}} a class in a project, some methods have signatures and some don't have signatures. <b>Methods</b> <b>can</b> be void or can return something like string, integer, double, decimal, float and bool.

5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is related}} to several other methods for determining atomic structures. Similar diffraction patterns can be produced by scattering electrons or neutrons, which are likewise interpreted by Fourier transformation. If single crystals of sufficient size cannot be obtained, various other X-ray <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> be applied to obtain less detailed information; such methods include fiber diffraction, powder diffraction and (if the sample is not crystallized) small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).|$|E

5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> detect sensitive markers, {{these tests}} are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a glassy material known as faience, which they treated {{as a type of}} artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.|$|E
5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary, and using them to directly simulate {{the motion of the}} boundary, rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> also be used to simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E

The main {{difference}} between the POST and the PATCH method is that the POST <b>method</b> <b>can</b> only be used {{when it is written}} to support the applications or the applications support its semantics whereas the PATCH <b>method</b> <b>can</b> be used in a generic way and does not require application support. If the outcome of using the PATCH method is not known then the POST method is preferred.|$|R
5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to determine}} their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E

Spencer {{showed that}} Doppler {{ultrasonic}} <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers, and Dr Andrew Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation. In 1981 D.E. Yount described the Varying Permeability Model, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other bubble models followed. The pathophysiology of DCS {{is not yet}} fully understood, but decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Mixed breathing gases are used to reduce {{the effects of the}} hyperbaric environment on ambient pressure divers.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component should fail, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E

The resulting shape consists of circular arcs (at most as many as sides of the polygon), can be constructed algorithmically in linear time, and can be drawn with compass and straightedge. Although the regular-polygon based Reuleaux polygons all have an odd number of circular-arc sides, it is possible to construct constant-width shapes based on irregular polygons that have an even number of sides.|$|E
5|$|There {{is no one}} way to do Archaeoastronomy. The {{divisions}} between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E

5|$|Typically, such {{models are}} based on the idea of compactification. Starting with the ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime of string or M-theory, {{physicists}} postulate a shape for the extra dimensions. By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles, usually supersymmetric partners to analogues of known particles. One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold. This is a special kind of geometric object named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau. Calabi–Yau manifolds offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory. Other similar <b>methods</b> <b>can</b> be used to construct models with physics resembling to some extent that of our four-dimensional world based on M-theory.|$|E
