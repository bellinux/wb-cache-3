5000|$|Jerboas are {{adapted to}} live in deserts {{therefore}} are called xerocole animals. They are nocturnal and {{spend most of their}} day burrowed under sand to avoid the heat. [...] Burrowing under the sand, they evade the heat from the sun, minimizing water loss and avoiding dehydration. By decreasing activity during the day they require less water intake. The jerboas build large burrow systems, underground tunnels, to stay in during the day. These underground burrows have a higher <b>moisture</b> <b>concentration</b> than at the surface level and help reduce body water loss. Specific species of jerboas plug burrow entrances with soil to retain moisture and keep hot air from entering burrows.

40|$|Within {{the finite}} element framework, a {{commonly}} accepted indirect approach employs {{the concept of}} normalized concentration to compute <b>moisture</b> <b>concentration.</b> It {{is referred to as}} “wetness” approach.
