50|$|If {{we choose}} to <b>measure</b> <b>the</b> angle, the final error is {{proportional}} to the measurement error.

5|$|Another {{parameter}} that <b>measures</b> <b>the</b> {{quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is {{the maximum number of}} edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E

5|$|CryoSat-2 {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot carrier rocket was unable to achieve orbit, resulting in the loss of the satellite. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which <b>measures</b> <b>the</b> height difference between the upper surface of floating ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E
5|$|Diamond's thermal {{conductivity}} is {{made use of}} by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other <b>measures</b> <b>the</b> temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the number}} of {{navigation}} algorithms calculating simultaneously to provide all the information in real time, {{research has been conducted}} to improve the computation time of some numerical methods using field-programmable gate arrays.

5|$|Outer {{space is}} a {{convenient}} setting {{for measuring the}} speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum. Typically, one <b>measures</b> <b>the</b> time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the solar system, such as the radius of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units.
