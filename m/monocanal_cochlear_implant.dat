40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the proportion of planned simultaneous <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> operations that do not result in simultaneous <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> on the day of surgery. The frequency with which this occurs has not been reported in the literature, and such information is important for parents' pre-operative decision making. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of pediatric <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> operations performed in the period January 2007 -July 2010 at the Melbourne <b>Cochlear</b> <b>Implant</b> Clinic. The number of planned simultaneous <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> procedures and the results of these surgeries were catalogued. Reasons for not proceeding with simultaneous <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> as planned were also identified. RESULTS: In the time period examined, there were a total of 50 planned simultaneous <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> operations. Of these planned simultaneous operations, 22 % did not result in bilateral <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> on the day of surgery, with all children involved receiving a first-side <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> only. In the majority of cases, the reason for a first-side <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> only was otitis media. CONCLUSION: In the time period examined, a considerable proportion of planned simultaneous <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> operations did not result in simultaneous bilateral implantation on the day of surgery. It is important that the likelihood of this outcome is discussed with families during pre-operative counseling as it may influence their decision making. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE:To {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} life of children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> from the perspective of their parents. METHODS:A clinical and cross-sectional study was conducted with 15 parents of children using <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> of both genders aged between 2 and 12 years old. Parents of these children answered the questionnaire "Children with Cochlear Implants: Parental Perspective" (CCIPP). Data related to auditory category and time of <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> use were collected from medical records of the children. The percentages of responses on the CCIPP domains were tabulated and descriptively and inferentially analyzed. RESULTS:The <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> had a positive effect on {{the quality of life}} of children in the self-reliance (58. 9 %) and social relationships (56. 7 %) domains. No correlation was observed between the time of <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> activation (months) and any of the CCIPP domains.

40|$|International audienceMost {{cochlear}} implantations are unilateral. To {{explore the}} benefits of a binaural <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant,</b> we used water-labelled oxygen- 15 positron emission tomography. Relative cerebral blood flow was measured in a binaural implant group (n = 11), while the subjects were passively listening to human voice sounds, environmental sounds non-voice or silence. Binaural auditory stimulation in the <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> group bilaterally activated the temporal voice areas, whereas monaural <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> stimulation only activated the left temporal voice area. Direct comparison of the binaural and the monaural <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> stimulation condition revealed an additional right temporal activation during voice processing in the binaural condition and the activation of a right fronto-parietal cortical network during sound processing that has been implicated in attention. These findings provide evidence that a bilateral <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> stimulation enhanced the spectral cues associated with sound perception and improved brain processing of voice stimuli in the right temporal region when compared to a monaural <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> stimulation.

In 1961, Dr. William House began work on the predecessor for today's <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant.</b> William House is an Otologist and is the founder of House ear institute in Los Angeles, California. This groundbreaking device, which was manufactured by 3M company was approved by the FDA in 1984.

The way a <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> works is sound is received by the <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant's</b> microphone, which picks up input that needs to be processed to determine how the electrodes will receive the signal. This is done on the external component of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> called the sound processor. The transmitting coil, also an external component transmits the information from the speech processor through the skin using frequency modulated radio waves. The signal is never turned back into an acoustic stimulus, unlike a hearing aid. This information is then received by the <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant's</b> internal components. The receiver stimulator delivers the correct amount of electrical stimulation to the appropriate electrodes on the array to represent the sound signal that was detected. The electrode array stimulates the remaining auditory nerve fibers in the cochlea, which carry the signal on to the brain, where it is processed.|$|R

Use of <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> can improve auditory inputs. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the reading skills of children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> and comparing that with normal ones. &nbsp; Materials and Methods: This descriptive - analytic study was done on 24 children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> and 24 normal ones that was selected from second and third grades students of Tehran primary schools. Children's reading performance was assessed by Nama reading test and the data were analyzed using T-test, linear regression and Pearson correlations. &nbsp; &nbsp; Results: The results showed that the means of reading scores of normal children were significantly greater than the <b>cochlear</b> <b>implanted</b> ones (P&lt; 0. 01). Also, there was a significant relationship between reading skills and period of <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> (P&lt; 0. 01). &nbsp; Conclusion: <b>Cochlear</b> <b>implanted</b> children showed weaker performance in reading skills than normal ones due to less access to auditory and Phonological information. It seems that early surgery and <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> before the age of language learning can be partially compensated reading defects of deaf children. &nbsp; Key words: Reading skills, Cochlear implantation, Second and third grade. &nbsp...|$|R
