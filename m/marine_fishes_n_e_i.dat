40|$|Organotins, {{especially}} tributyltins (TBT) {{are highly}} toxic to many marine organisms. These compounds are introduced {{in marine waters}} by ship trafficking, ship scrapping activities, as antifouling compounds and sewage disposal. <b>Marine</b> <b>fishes,</b> crustaceans and molluscans are easily prone to organotins contamination. In View of this, a baseline monitoring {{study was conducted in}} order to establish the levels of organotins in edible <b>marine</b> <b>fishes</b> (<b>n</b> = 35), bivalves (n = 9), shrimps (n = 3), squids (n = 2) and crabs (n = 3) collected from Mumbai, Goa and Karwar on the west coast of India. At these locations average organotin concentration found in fishes, clams, shrimps, squids and crabs was 108 ng Sn g- 1 dw, 852 ng Sn g- 1 dw, 179 ng Sn g- 1 dw, 70 ng Sn g- 1 dw and 89 ng Sn g- 1 dw respectively. In all the samples butyltins dominated over phenyltins. The levels of organotins suggest that all the organisms were contaminated with organotins and their consumption may pose health problems to humans especially the clams...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAquarium {{fish trade}} has {{strongly}} {{increased in the}} past decades {{to become one of}} the most popular hobbies globally. Historically, all aquarium fish traded were wild-caught. Then, an increasing number of fish species have been produced in captivity. The main goal of the present study is to apply the concept of domestication level to the hundred most popular aquarium fish species in Europe and North America. The levels of domestication of freshwater aquarium <b>fish</b> species (<b>n</b> = 50) ranged from 0 to 5, with 20 species classified at the level 5 (selective breeding programmes are used focusing on specific goals) and only three species at the level 0 (capture fisheries) and 1 (first trials of acclimatization to the culture environment). In contrast, the levels of domestication of <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> species (<b>n</b> = 50) ranged from 0 to 3, implying that the production of all <b>marine</b> aquarium <b>fish</b> species is based either entirely or partly on the capture of wild-caught specimens. Based on this new classification, the main advantages and drawbacks of fisheries and aquaculture are discussed...|$|R

The study attempts to provide forecasts of <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> production in Bangladesh for the year of 2008 - 09 to 2012 - 13. The magnitude of instability in <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> production was attempted by computing the coefficient of variation (CV) and the percentage deviation from three years moving average values.

For the three components of <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> production the growth rates were different over different time points.

40|$|It is {{valuable}} {{to study the}} bioavailability of trace metal in <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> for their ecological and commercial importance. A series of experiments were conducted to investigate the trace metal (Cd, Zn, and Se) biokinetics in two <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> Acanthopagrus schlegeli and Terapon jarbua. Waterborne and dietary metal uptake was examined under different conditions to investigate the effects of chemical and physiological factors on the bioavailability of metals to <b>marine</b> <b>fish.</b> The metal bioaccumulation in <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> was predicted by applying the bioenergetic-based kinetic model. The different pattern of metal uptake by <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> from freshwater fish was expressly concerned. <b>Marine</b> <b>fish</b> were found to take up waterborne metal through the gills and the gastrointestinal tracts and the latter one played predominant role. The uptake conformed to the first-order model {{over a wide range}} of ambient metal concentrations. The intestine had higher metal binding affinity and capacity than the gills. The surface-binding metal after short-term waterborne exposure was abundant. The waterborne uptake of trace metals in <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> could be affected by many factors, including Cd and Zn pre-exposure, body size, water composition, and salinity. Ambient salinity influenced waterborne metal uptake, by changing both geochemical and physiological aspects, resulting in the major difference of metal uptake between <b>marine</b> and freshwater <b>fish.</b> The assimilation efficiency of dietary metals was observed to be influenced by the subcellular metal distribution in the preys and the feeding process of the fish. Body size influenced both the assimilation efficiency and ingestion rate significantly. The metal bioaccumulation was a gross result of waterborne and dietary metal uptake and metal efflux in <b>marine</b> <b>fish,</b> which was successfully predicted by the bioenergetic-based kinetic model. Dietary metal dominated the overall metal accumulation; efflux was the key process to the metal homeostasis in <b>marine</b> <b>fish.</b> Body size is also an important factor in metal bioaccumulation, and subsequently, metal trophic transfer in <b>marine</b> <b>fish.</b> The tissue specific and subcellular metal distributions revealed the strategies of <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> handling trace metals...|$|R

50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>fish</b> {{that are}} sold as {{tropical}} fish are generally sourced from the wild, usually from the coral reefs around the world. This is because {{only a few}} species of <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> have been successfully bred in captivity with any regularity. The price of <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> coupled with the difficulty in keeping them alive in aquaria makes them less of a popular choice for aquarists to keep.
