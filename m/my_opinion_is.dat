Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, {{it will probably be}} admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.|$|E

Other than making {{vegetarian}} choices, he actively campaigned against dissection studies and experimentation on live animals (vivisection) {{in the name}} of science and medical studies.

500|$|Hugh Trevor-Roper, {{writing for}} The New York Review of Books, was highly {{critical}} of the [...] "encyclopedic" [...] detail in Brown's writing: [...] "He piles on the illustrative (or irrelevant) detail. He cannot leave anything out. Every person mentioned must have a potted biography. Every place must be equipped with atmosphere, furniture, associations." [...] Roper also criticised the material, writing that Brown had inserted [...] "a novel thesis", that Allied deception during the war was controlled by MI6, [...] "which, in <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> <b>is</b> quite wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally 11 Melbury Road, {{the house}} was renumbered as 31 Melbury Road in 1967. It was the second of two houses in Melbury Road {{designed}} by Shaw, the first, 8 Melbury Road, was designed for another painter Marcus Stone. Fildes and Stone were artistic rivals and each naturally regarded their own Shaw-designed house as superior. Of the construction of Woodland House Fildes wrote in November 1876 that [...] "The house is getting on famously and looks stunning... It {{is a long way}} the most superior house of the whole lot; I consider it knocks Stone's to fits, though of course he wouldn't have that by what I hear he says of his, but <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> the universal one." [...] Fildes moved into the house in October 1877 and it remained his home until his death there in February 1927. Fildes was survived by his wife and six children. [...] In 1959 the London County Council commemorated Fildes at Woodland House with a blue plaque.|$|E

500|$|Klepacki {{has said}} that the most {{rewarding}} part of composing video game music is working with a team—which he compares to chemistry between band members—and knowing he is part of a greater cause. He believes that game music could improve if artists focused on quality and derived inspiration from playing games. He has expressed interest in having Electronic Arts sell his soundtracks in retail stores, preferably next to video games in electronic departments. He advises those wishing to get in the video game business to attend conventions and investigate developer companies. He also noted in 2008 that [...] "composition and engineering skills are now required," [...] advising upstart composers to ensure their work is film-quality. Klepacki is happy to see older games offered on the Wii, hoping that gamers are [...] "recognizing once again that simple, short fun experiences are just as good as...long, huge-production experiences." [...] Klepacki listed several influences for his style of composition: [...] "John Williams naturally for my love of Star Wars and his style in general, Michael Kamen for his composing diversity, Metallica for sparking my metal influence, Vince Dicola who in <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> way under-rated for his great work, Sly & The Family Stone for inspiring funk, syncopation, and positive energy, Larry Graham for inspiring me to play funk bass, Nine Inch Nails for their unique uses of mangled sound, and Rob Zombie for combining music with a theme and persona." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian of Education was {{the first}} {{periodical}} to take the reviewing of children's books seriously. Trimmer's over four hundred reviews constituted a set of distinct and identifiable criteria regarding what was valuable in this new genre. As a high-church Anglican, she was intent on protecting Christianity from secularism as well as evangelicalism, particularly as the latter manifested itself in Methodism. Her reviews also reveal {{her to be a}} staunch monarchist and opponent of the French Revolution. As Grenby puts it, [...] "her initial questions of any children's books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy". Religion was Trimmer's first priority and her emphasis on the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy illustrated her fundamentalism. She wrote to a friend: [...] "I will only say, that the more I reflect on the subject, the more I am convinced that it is not right to supersede the figurative style in which they speak of God and divine things, <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>is,</b> that whoever attempts to teach the truths of divine revelation, should follow the method of the inspired writers as nearly as possible" [...] For Trimmer, the truth of the Bible was not only in its content, but also in its style, and some of her harshest reviews were written against texts that altered both the style and the substance of the Bible.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{commenced}} composing [...] "White Horse" [...] {{almost a}} year before the release of Fearless, weeks after composing Fearless lead single [...] "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered on recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: [...] "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> <b>is</b> the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that moment when you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." [...] About the difference in themes between [...] "White Horse" [...] and [...] "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{the area}} was {{agricultural}} and was noted for its rich cereal production.

2500|$|Teresa {{is one of}} the {{foremost}} writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology is unique. In all her writings on this subject she deals with her personal experiences. Her deep insight and analytical gifts helped her to explain them clearly. Her definition was used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church: [...] "Contemplative prayer [...] in <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with him who we know loves us." [...] She used a metaphor of mystic prayer as watering a garden throughout her writings.|$|E

[...] However, Keynes did not think Hayek's philosophy was of practical use; this was explained later in the same letter, commenting: [...] "What we need therefore, in <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> <b>is</b> not a change in our economic programmes, which would only lead in practice to disillusion {{with the results of}} your philosophy; but perhaps even the contrary, namely, an enlargement of them.

2500|$|Although such occurrences were commonplace on the Eastern Front {{from both}} sides, {{they were a}} rarity in the West, and the outraged Americans were {{determined}} to prosecute all those with responsibility for this massacre. Here Rundstedt's problem was his reputation. The Ardennes offensive was known to the Allies as [...] "the Rundstedt offensive", and the Allied press routinely described him as being in charge of it. The British commander in Europe, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, said on 7 January 1945: [...] "I {{used to think that}} Rommel was good, but <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> that Rundstedt would have hit him for six. Rundstedt is the best German general I have come up against."
