5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E

To dissolve ThO2 in acids, it is heated to 500–600°C; heating above 600°C produces a very resistant to acids and other reagents form of ThO2.

40|$|Metal–organic {{frameworks}} (MOFs) containing ZrIV‐based secondary building units (SBUs), {{as in the}} UiO‐ 66 series, {{are receiving}} widespread research interest due to their enhanced chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilities.</b> We report the synthesis and extensive characterisation, as both bulk microcrystalline and single crystal forms, of extended UiO‐ 66 (Zr and Hf) series MOFs containing integral unsaturated alkene, alkyne and butadiyne units, which serve as reactive sites for postsynthetic modification (PSM) by halogenation. The water stability of a Zr–stilbene MOF allows the dual insertion of both −OH and −Br groups in a single, aqueous bromohydrination step. Quantitative bromination of alkyne‐ and butadiyne‐containing MOFs is demonstrated to be stereoselective, {{as a consequence of}} the linker geometry when bound in the MOFs, while the inherent change in hybridisation and geometry of integral linker atoms is facilitated by the high <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the MOFs, allowing bromination to be characterised in a single‐crystal to single‐crystal (SCSC) manner. The facile addition of bromine across the unsaturated C−C bonds in the MOFs in solution is extended to irreversible iodine sequestration in the vapour phase. A large‐pore interpenetrated Zr MOF demonstrates an I 2 storage capacity of 279 [*]% w/w, through a combination of chemisorption and physisorption, which is comparable to the highest reported capacities of benchmark iodine storage materials for radioactive I 2 sequestration. We expect this facile PSM process to not only allow trapping of toxic vapours, but also modulate the mechanical properties of the MOFs. Io‐dining out: The combined chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilities</b> of Zr and Hf metal–organic frameworks facilitate their stereoselective postsynthetic halogenation across integral unsaturated bonds, in some cases reversibly, leading to a material that can ingest 279 [*]% w/w I 2 by a combination of chemi‐ and physisorption...|$|R

5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E

This thesis {{is focused on the}} novel approach for modification {{of cellulosic materials}} by the combination of adsorption of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) onto cellulose surface and the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) “click” reaction. The literature part gives an overview on the basics of cellulose chemistry, chemical functionalization of cellulose, as well as explains the principle of the chemical conjugation of carboxylic groups obtained by formation of amide bonds. The chapter continues with the phenomenon of the polyelectrolyte adsorption onto cellulose, {{takes a look at the}} viscose production process and, finally, it introduces the novel field of “click” chemistry. In the experimental part, methods and techniques applied are described. The experimental part focuses on the evaluation of the adsorption efficiency of CMC and its derivatives onto viscose in different reaction conditions, as well as on examination of chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the modification. CMC functionalization was analyzed with spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis. The effect of various reaction conditions on adsorption was studied and quantified by means of the phenol-sulphuric acid method for the estimation of total adsorbed carbohydrates. Chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the modified CMC and fibres were studied by the alkaline and wet frictional treatments, respectively. The main findings revealed that chemically modified viscose fibres (cellulose II) behave differently from cellulose wood pulp and cotton (cellulose I) in respect of polysaccharide adsorption. The functionalization of CMC resulted in clear changes in the molecular structure of CMC, appearing as an increase in nitrogen content. In addition, spectroscopic analyses revealed characteristic signals of alkyne, azide and amide bonds indicative of successful grafting reactions. Adsorption of CMC onto viscose fibres was studied with Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and revealed changes on the surface of the viscose. The click reaction was demonstrated via fluorescent labelling. Moreover, the study on chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilities</b> showed reasonable results. In general, combination of polysaccharide adsorption and click chemistry can be considered as a promising method for introducing new functionalities to the viscose fibres...|$|R
