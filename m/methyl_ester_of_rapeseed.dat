Combustion process analysis was done on relatively low load level that corresponds to the mean effective pressure of three bars and at constant engine speed for both fuels.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the activity {{as a catalyst}} of sodium phosphate compounds to produce <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapeseed</b> oil. The {{research shows that the}} transesterification <b>of</b> <b>rapeseed</b> oil by methyl alcohol could be efficiently catalyzed by both anhydrous and hydrated trisodium phosphate, while polytrisodium phosphate has only a negligible catalytic activity. Trisodium phosphate catalysts are less active than sodium hydroxide due to the lower ability to form sodium methoxide. However, these catalysts can lead to decreasing the number of technological stages and the amount of unwanted waste products. The experimental data are interpreted by using a kinetic model showing that a first-order reaction with respect to glycerides concentration is adequate to describe the reaction. This paper also indicates that under the selected experimental conditions, the chemical reaction is the main factor affecting the rate-determining step...|$|R

40|$|In {{the degree}} that costs and demand of crude oil rise, {{diminish}} the economical disadvantages for alternative Diesel fuels, resulting {{in a variety of}} feasible substitutes. Diesel fuel substitutes have deviating exhaust emissions from conventional fuel. The <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapeseed</b> oil (known as RME/Biodiesel) is receiving increasing attention as an alternative fuel for Diesel engines. RME is a non-toxic, biodegradable, and renewable fuel with the potential to reduce engine exhaust emissions [1]. The main disadvantage for RME is its vaporisation and self ignition characteristics at low load conditions. Engine experiments were carried out at 4 bar IMEP with Euro Diesel fuel (EDF) as reference and RME. During these engine experiments EGR and injection pressure were varied. As a result, differences in exhaust emissions due to EGR, injection pressure and fuel type were observed. The objective of this work was to find answers for fuel dependent differences in indicated load and exhaust gas emissions. As combustion and emission formation of RME has not been fundamentally explained yet [2], a detailed analysis approach based on explanation models for fuel characteristics was chosen to explain the observed differences...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{compression}} ignition engine powered by different fuels requires, for ecological reasons, adjusting the engine work to the injected fuel type. This paper presents a methodology for building classifiers that recognize the type of fuel injected to engine cylinders to accuracy sufficient in practical engine applications. These classifiers were developed using various computational intelligence methods: non-fuzzy classification trees, the proposed method combining several non-fuzzy classification trees into one fuzzy rule-based system, and another method that uses swarm algorithms to optimize classification tree parameters. Analysis of the in-cylinder pressure data measured for the engine running at full load allows calculating the angle at which maximum heat is released. The classifiers were built based on this angle and on other descriptors of pressure changes in the cylinder. Compared features included classifier accuracy, clearness and response time. The methods proposed required developing learning data sets based on experimental data. The measurement data from the tests conducted on an engine test bench were for the engine powered by five different fuels: diesel, fatty acid <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> <b>rapeseed</b> oil, and three blends of these two fuels. The minimum number of consecutive engine cycles necessary to recognize the fuel type was discussed...|$|R

40|$|The work {{involved}} here was undertaken {{as an attempt}} to extract, purify, fractionate, separate, and identify the endogenous gibberellins in the etiolated broad bean (Vicia faba) seedling. Following a series of preliminary experiments, it was decided to extract the gibberellins in each organ of the seedling separately by ice-cold absolute methanol and fractionate this solvent extract into three fractions, for rough separation of the gibberellins, as follows: i. Free gibberellins or acidic ethyl acetate-soluble fraction. ii. Conjugated-gibberellins or acidic butanol-soluble fraction. iii. Bound-gibberellins or water-soluble fraction. Both the conjugated-gibberellins and the bound-gibberellins were released by acid hydrolysis. The term bound-gibberellin is used here for those gibberellins which appear neither in the acidic ethyl acetate-soluble fraction nor in the acidic butanol-soluble fraction and which are extracted by ethyl acetate at low pH upon hydrolysis. The term does not imply that I have any proof of binding to specific molecules or cell particles. The studies carried out in this thesis revealed that PVP slurries, PVP column chromatography followed by TLC of the gibberellins recovered from the columns effluents are satisfactory tools for the purification and separation of the endogenous gibberellins in the different organs of the etiolated Vicia seedling. During the study, use has been made of both bioassay and GLC following TLC. Peaks with retention time corresponding to the <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> gibberellins A 7, A 9, A 13, A 15, A 17, and A 24 were detected in the acidic ethyl acetate-soluble fraction obtained from the radicle tissue extracts after raethylation; that obtained from the plumule tissue extracts gave peaks with retention time corresponding to the <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> gibberellins A 12, A 13, iso-A 13, A 24; while the acidicethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the cotyledons tissue extracts gave peaks with retention time corresponding to the <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> gibberellins A 3, A 5, A 6, A 7, A 12, A 13, iso-A 13, A 14, and A 15. The free gibberellins released by acid hydrolysis of the conjugated-gibberellins in radicle extracts after methylation gave peaks with retention time corresponding to the <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> gibberellins A 9, A 12, A 13, A 14, A 20, and A 24; those released from the conjugated-gibberellins of the plumule gave peaks v/ith retention time corresponding to the <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> gibberellins A 8 and A 15; while the free gibberellins released {{in the case of the}} cotyledons tissue extracts gave peaks with retention time corresponding to the <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> gibberellins A 13 and A 14. On the other hand, acid hydrolysis of the bound-gibberellins in the radicle tissue extracts released gibberellins which after methylation gave peaks with retention time corresponding to the <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> gibberellins A 7, A 9, A 17, and A 24 those released from extracts of the plumule tissue gave peaks with retention time corresponding to the <b>methyl</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> gibberellins A 7, A 8, A 9, A 12, and A 24 while the free gibberellins released by acid hydrolysis of the cotyledons bound-gibberellins gave peak with retention time corresponding to the <b>methyl</b> <b>ester</b> <b>of</b> gibberellin A 13.
