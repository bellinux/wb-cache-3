500|$|During live shows, {{some members}} of the group (other than Bemis) sing backing vocals. Bemis often sings parts he wrote, but which were sung by guest vocalists on studio recordings. In recent years, Bemis has {{switched}} up the lineup of performing musicians, using some permanent members of the groups, while rotating other musicians {{in and out of the}} live lineup. Beginning on the [...] "All <b>My</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>Are</b> Enemies - Rarities Tour," [...] Bemis added drummer Reed Murray, and bassist Garron DuPree. In summer of 2014 on the Hebrews tour, Bemis recruited ex-Taking Back Sunday member Fred Mascherino, Moneen guitarist Kenny Bridges, and Moving Mountains vocalist Greg Dunn to replace the Jake and Jeff Turner and Parker Case, who were at the time performing with their band XO.

[...] Ament said, [...] "In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Hail, Hail" [...] refer to two people in a troubled relationship struggling to hold it together.

500|$|The New World said, [...] "Everyone {{reads the}} Poem and praises it... justly, we think, for {{it seems to}} us full of {{originality}} and power." [...] The Pennsylvania Inquirer reprinted it with the heading [...] "A Beautiful Poem". Elizabeth Barrett wrote to Poe, [...] "Your 'Raven' has produced a sensation, a fit o' horror, here in England. Some of <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>are</b> taken by the fear of it and some by the music. I hear of persons haunted by 'Nevermore'." [...] Poe's popularity resulted in invitations to recite [...] "The Raven" [...] and to lecture– in public and at private social gatherings. At one literary salon, a guest noted, [...] "to hear [...] repeat the Raven... is an event in one's life." [...] It was recalled by someone who experienced it, [...] "He would turn down the lamps till the room was almost dark, then standing {{in the center of the}} apartment he would recite... in the most melodious of voices... So marvelous was his power as a reader that the auditors would be afraid to draw breath lest the enchanted spell be broken." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>are</b> prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E
2500|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I found Munch with divided loyalties, as he stated, [...] "All <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>are</b> German {{but it is}} France that I love." [...] In the 1930s, his German patrons, many Jewish, lost their fortunes and some their lives during {{the rise of the}} Nazi movement. Munch found Norwegian printers to substitute for the Germans who had been printing his graphic work. Given his poor health history, during 1918 Munch felt himself lucky to have survived a bout of the Spanish Flu, the worldwide pandemic of that year.|$|E

Dr. Sheffield thinks it better for the work that I return home now than wait a little longer and make my class reunion in 1902.|$|E

In October 1801 a preliminary peace agreement between Britain and France was published and Fox was delighted. In a speech to his constituents on 10 October Fox said: [...] "We have not, I acknowledge, obtained the objects for which the War was undertaken—so much the better—I rejoice that we have not. I like the Peace the more on this very account". Many of his friends were shocked at such open language, but as Fox said in his reply to a remonstrance from Grey: [...] "...the truth is, I am gone something further in hate to the English Government than perhaps you and the rest of <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>are,</b> and certainly further than can with prudence be avowed. The triumph of the French Government over the English does in fact afford me a degree of pleasure which {{it is very difficult to}} disguise".|$|E

All <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>are</b> all middle class and grey, but I live in a museum, so I'm okay." [...] Walter is [...] "fat and married", Davies remembers [...] "how we said we'd fight the world so we'd be free" [...] and goes on believing that [...] "one day we'll be free". Like Johnny Thunder he has [...] "vowed that he would never, ever end up like the rest". His memory connect him to his ideals {{as well as his}} individuality, his creativity, his natural life, even if it leaves him [...] "appallingly out of sync with the times", in which the trend was to speak of {{sweeping}} away the entire social system, taking a nuanced view, [...] "preserving the old things", as well as [...] "protecting the new", yet still condemning the worst of the new – skyscrapers and office blocks – as well as the old. This theme would be further developed in the following album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire).|$|E
