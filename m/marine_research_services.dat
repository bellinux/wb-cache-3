Established in 1960, IOC promotes international cooperation and coordinates programs in <b>marine</b> <b>research,</b> <b>services,</b> observation systems, hazard mitigation, and capacity development in order to learn more about and to better manage the nature and resources of ocean and coastal areas. Through the application of this knowledge, the Commission aims to improve the management practices and decision-making processes of its Member States (which now number more than 100), to foster sustainable development, and to protect the marine environment. Oceanography readers may remember that the first IOC Secretary was Warren Wooster, retired Professor of Oceanography at the University of Washington and one of the founding fathers of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) ...|$|E
40|$|The Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) {{program was}} a 10 -year {{international}} climate research effort carried out between 1985 and 1994 {{under the auspices of}} the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). TOGA’s goals were to determine the predictability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system in the tropics on seasonal-to-interannual time scales, to understand the mechanisms responsible for that predictability, and to establish an observing system to support climate prediction. The US contribution to TOGA focused mainly on the El Niño/Southern Oscillation phenomenon, which is the most prominent climate signal on seasonal-to-interannual time scales. One of TOGA’s great strengths was that it forged the three fields of observation, theory, and modeling into a coherent program. TOGA also included climate impact studies from the very beginning by collaborating with scientists outside the field of physical climate research. In this article we highlight some key successes of TOGA and assess its legacy from a perspective of progress over the past 15 years. We also celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), established within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to promote international cooperation in <b>marine</b> <b>research,</b> <b>services,</b> and observations. IOC, together with the World Meteorological Organization and the International Council of Science, cosponsored not only TOGA, but also antecedent and follow-on climate research programs under WCRP. The continuity of these research programs over the time span of decades is one of the reasons for their long-term successes...|$|E

40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>research</b> {{tourism is}} defined as marine {{ecotourism}} where <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> {{is an important part}} of the tourism attraction (adapted from Benson, 2005). <b>Marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism is also a form of volunteer tourism (Benson, 2005). This paper reports on results from research that aimed to further understand the views of key stakeholders about potential opportunities for both <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> key stakeholders and tourists in Australia. (2009). For this paper, key Australian <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism (<b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism) stakeholders include marine researchers, marine managers, marine conservation groups, marine education groups, and marine tour operators from Australia and elsewhere (adapted from Coghlan, 2007, Cuthill, 2000, Musso and Inglis, 1998). Furthermore, a <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism product must last for one or more days, be advertised publicly, take paying tourists or paying volunteers, and operate on a commercial basis (adapted from Ellis, 2003 a). An online survey and subsequent analysis of 49 key stakeholder views was undertaken. Stakeholders were asked their views about who are potential <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists, what are likely activities and programs for <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists, issues that affect the involvement of volunteers in <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism, and stakeholder opportunities to provide <b>services</b> to <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists. Survey results indicate that survey respondents consider potential <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists to include marine wildlife tourists, repeat <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists, ecotourists, scientists, volunteers, adventure tourists and SCUBA divers. Additionally, potential <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists in Australia are more likely to be from countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, Germany and New Zealand. Such information provided a foundation for the assessment of the preferences of potential <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists for different <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism products as undertaken by Wood and Zeppel (2008). With some exceptions, research outcomes suggests that opportunities for <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism in Australia should focus mainly on ‘popular’ <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> topics whales, dolphin, turtle, seals, sharks, dugongs, penguin, coral reef, sea dragon, coral reef spawning and ship wreck research programs. The research programs that survey respondents appear to have some ambivalence (i. e. maybe or no) about are ship wreck, coral spawning and sea dragon research. Broader suggestions also included research related to climate change, and coastal clean ups. A survey respondent suggested that <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> program that provides a simple mechanism for tourists to get involved and actually participate in the research process is a potential <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> program for <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism. Simple <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> activities such as undertaking bleach watch, coral watch, fish counts, taking notes, plankton sampling, using cameras and video, temperature measurements, habitat restoration, and data input into a computer are also highlighted as suitable for inexperienced <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists. Such results indicate that opportunities to involve inexperienced volunteer minded tourists in active volunteer tourism roles on <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism ventures that need advanced <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> skills are limited. However, it is suggested that less active but still inexperienced tourists can be catered by quality interpretation, close observation of <b>marine</b> <b>research,</b> and closer interaction with marine researchers. Survey respondents considered that there are many existing marine tourism ventures such as SCUBA diving, snorkelling, live aboards, aquariums, day cruises, fishing boats, intertidal walks, and coastal based research tours, that can be adapted to <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism. Furthermore, much of the Australian coastline and marine areas have been identified as likely <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism destinations. The main reasons for excluding parts of the Australian marine environment were considered to be relative closeness to population centres and tourism infrastructure, and have relatively comfortable coastal and ocean environments. Special emphasis is placed on World Heritage and marine parks as suitable <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism attractions. Much interest was placed on the increased role of Indigenous Australians in <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism in Australia. In summary, this information indicates the potential range of <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism attraction across Australia. However, to further ascertain the full potential of <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism in Australia, there needs to be a study of the preferences of the potential <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism market for different types of <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism ventures as undertaken by Wood and Zeppel, (2008). A likely hindrance to development of <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism in Australia is acknowledged difficulty for marine researchers to supervise volunteer tourists. A <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism guide role is suggested to interpret the <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> to tourists, and ensure that the needs of marine researchers, managers and tourists are met. While a majority of key stakeholders would likely consider this to be good idea, the research suggests that some marine researchers would be hesitant about this suggestion. Factors that would influence the supervision of volunteer tourists are said to include the role of the personalities of researchers and tourists, quality communication, research complexity, training protocols, and time available to the volunteer tourist. Many marine researchers may also be reticent to encourage the development of <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> programs that involve tour guides, operators and tourists. Furthermore, many marine researchers and managers appear to have an ambivalent view towards the helpfulness of actively involving the tourist within the <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> activity. Most key stakeholders groups also appear to have warranted concerns about any training schemes for potential <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists. Together these results indicate that that many marine researchers and managers are concerned about the involvement of tourism and tourists in <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism. Such views and other stakeholder views are further assessed in Wood and Rumney, (2009). Research outcomes can be used by entrepreneurial MRT stakeholders to identify and develop MRT. Results are also intended to be directly relevant to <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism in Australia, <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism stakeholders from other locations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>research</b> {{tourism is}} a form of marine tourism whereby <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> is an {{important}} part of the tourism attraction. Research was undertaken to further understand the preferences of potential <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists for different <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism products and benefits. Such information can be used to identify suitable markets, develop effective promotional campaigns, and design effective and different products. To achieve the research goal, an online survey (n= 311) and benefit segmentation approach was used. Different <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism products (n= 12) were devised from a typological assessment of forty two <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism ventures. Benefits (n= 26) were devised from an assessment of related tourism types and discussions with key stakeholders. Results indicate that potential <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourists who regularly watch nature documentaries, volunteer, are a member of a conservation group, have a natural sciences background, SCUBA dive, snorkel or cetacean watch, have notably higher interest in more <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism products. Furthermore, females and international survey respondents had notably higher interest in more <b>marine</b> <b>research</b> tourism products.
