5000|$|Millions of <b>meteors</b> {{occur in}} Earth's {{atmosphere}} daily. Most meteoroids that cause <b>meteors</b> {{are about the}} size of a grain of sand. <b>Meteors</b> may occur in showers, which arise when Earth passes through a stream of debris left by a comet, or as [...] "random" [...] or [...] "sporadic" [...] <b>meteors,</b> not associated with a specific stream of space debris. A number of specific <b>meteors</b> have been observed, largely by members of the public and largely by accident, but with enough detail that orbits of the meteoroids producing the <b>meteors</b> have been calculated. All of the orbits passed through the asteroid belt. The atmospheric velocities of <b>meteors</b> result from the movement of Earth around the Sun at about 30 km/s (18 miles/second), the orbital speeds of meteoroids, and the gravity well of Earth.|$|R

When a couple of con artists arrive in Smallville promoting miracle cures created by the <b>meteor</b> rocks, Lex becomes interested in what they are really after, as he believes their plans could hinder the research he is doing on the <b>meteor</b> rocks. After Jacobi and Wolfe's con is realized, Lex uses a dummy corporation to steal all of the <b>meteor</b> rocks Jacobi's Ascendence Foundation has collected. In Smallville: Dragon, Lex throws a party at his mansion for the local teenagers, that is ultimately crashed by a repitilian creature that {{was created by the}} <b>meteor</b> rocks. He is also visited by an old flame, Renata, who shows up looking to rekindle their relationship. Lex quickly discovers that she has an ulterior motive when she propositions him to fund a drug deal, which prompts Lex to realize that she was really sent by his father as some test for Lex.|$|E

5000|$|The shower usually peaks {{on around}} April 22 {{and the morning}} of April 23. Counts {{typically}} range from 5 to 20 <b>meteors</b> per hour, averaging around 10. As a result of light pollution, observers in rural areas will see more than observers in a city. Nights without a moon in the sky will reveal the most <b>meteors.</b> April Lyrid <b>meteors</b> are usually around magnitude +2. However, some <b>meteors</b> can be brighter, known as [...] "Lyrid fireballs", cast shadows {{for a split second}} and leave behind smokey debris trails that last minutes.|$|R

5|$|Phoenix is {{the radiant}} of two annual <b>meteor</b> showers. The Phoenicids, {{also known as}} the December Phoenicids, were first {{observed}} on 3 December 1887. The shower was particularly intense in December 1956, and is thought related to the breakup of the short-period comet 289P/Blanpain. It peaks around 4–5 December, though is not seen every year. A very minor <b>meteor</b> shower peaks around July 14 with around one <b>meteor</b> an hour, though meteors can be seen anytime from July 3 to 18; this shower {{is referred to as the}} July Phoenicids.|$|E
5|$|The Microscopids are a minor <b>meteor</b> shower {{that appear}} from June to mid-July.|$|E
5|$|The Perseids are a {{prominent}} annual <b>meteor</b> shower {{that appear to}} radiate from Perseus from mid-July, peaking in activity between 9 and 14 August each year. Associated with Comet Swift–Tuttle, they have been observed for about 2,000 years. The September Epsilon Perseids, discovered in 2012, are a <b>meteor</b> shower with an unknown parent body in the Oort cloud.|$|E
40|$|The writer {{obtained}} real {{paths of}} 24 <b>meteors</b> from the observations made by several observers in August 1952, {{in the former}} paper. In this paper, from the visual observations of <b>meteors</b> made by more than 43 observers, including students of Yokohama National University and members of Japan Astronomical Study Association, in August 1950, 1952, 1953 and 1954, real paths of 79 <b>meteors</b> have been determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectra of}} 25 <b>meteors,</b> {{recorded}} {{with an image}} orthicon technique in December 1969, are studied in relation to similar records made in August of the same year. Of 19 Geminid <b>meteors</b> in the absolute visual magnitude range 0 to + 2, only one showed any evidence of the forbidden line of oxygen at 5577 A, while all Perseid <b>meteors</b> recorded in August exhibited the oxygen line, {{a result of the}} large difference in geocentric velocity between the two showers. Atoms identified in faint Geminid <b>meteors</b> include neutral iron, magnesium, calcium and sodium. The molecular bands of nitrogen are also observed...|$|R
5000|$|The Spring and Autumn Annals, a Chinese book of records, {{mentions}} that on December 24 {{of this year}} there were five <b>meteors</b> in the sky. It was the first Chinese observation of <b>meteors.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} <b>meteor</b> showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid <b>meteor</b> shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German <b>Meteor</b> expedition aboard the German research vessel <b>Meteor</b> (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E
5|$|Circinus is {{the radiant}} of an annual <b>meteor</b> shower, the Alpha Circinids (ACI). First {{observed}} in Queensland in 1977, the meteors {{have an average}} velocity of 27.1km/s and {{are thought to be}} associated with a long-period comet. In 2011, Peter Jenniskens proposed that the debris trail of comet C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth's orbit and generate a <b>meteor</b> outburst coming from a radiant close to Beta Circini. The ACI shower peaks on 4 June, the day it was first observed.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, W. L. Elkin built two {{batteries}} of cameras equipped with rotating shutters for obtaining the velocities {{as well as}} the heights of <b>meteors,</b> pioneering work in the study of <b>meteors.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 1982, E. A. Reznikov {{discovered}} that the 1916 outburst was caused by material released from the comet in 1819. Another outburst of the June Bootids was not observed until 1998, because Comet Pons-Winnecke's orbit {{was not in a}} favorable position. However, on June 27, 1998, an outburst of <b>meteors</b> radiating from Boötes, later confirmed to be associated with Pons-Winnecke, was observed. They were incredibly long-lived, with trails of the brightest <b>meteors</b> lasting several seconds at times. Many fireballs, green-hued trails, and even some <b>meteors</b> that cast shadows were observed throughout the outburst, which had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 200–300 <b>meteors</b> per hour.|$|R
5|$|During November, the Taurid <b>meteor</b> shower {{appears to}} radiate {{from the general}} {{direction}} of this constellation. The Beta Taurid <b>meteor</b> shower occurs during the months of June and July in the daytime, and is normally observed using radio techniques. Between 18 and 29 October, both the Northern Taurids and the Southern Taurids are active; though the latter stream is stronger. However, between November 1 and 10, the two streams equalize.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk <b>meteor</b> and the impact feature <b>Meteor</b> Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E
