50|$|The Acts caused Britain's {{shipping}} {{industry to}} develop in isolation. However, it had the advantage to English shippers of severely limiting the ability of Dutch ships {{to participate in the}} carrying trade to England. By reserving British colonial trade to British shipping, the Acts may have significantly assisted in the growth of London as a major entrepôt for American colonial wares at the expense of Dutch cities. The maintenance of a certain level of merchant shipping and of trade generally also facilitated a rapid increase in the size and quality of the Royal Navy, which eventually (after the Anglo-Dutch Alliance of 1689 limited the Dutch navy to three-fifths {{of the size of the}} English one) led to Britain becoming a global superpower, which it remained until the mid-20th century. That naval might, however, never limited Dutch trading power — because the Dutch enjoyed enough leverage over overseas markets and shipping resources (combined with a financial power that was only overtaken by Britain during the 18th century) to enable them to put enough pressure on the English to prevent them from sustaining naval campaigns long enough to wrest <b>maritime</b> <b>concessions</b> from the Dutch.|$|E

She has two Caterpillar main engines, two Caterpillar generators, bow thruster for manoeuvrability in lakes and rivers and an emergency generator that is located above the waterline in the forward deckhouse.

50|$|While {{the origins}} of Dispute Review Boards {{are found in the}} {{construction}} industry, their ambit is far wider than construction and Dispute Review Boards are now found in the financial services industry, the <b>Maritime</b> Industry, long-term <b>concession</b> projects, operational and maintenance contracts. The scope for Dispute Review Boards is substantial. The emergence of the International Chamber of Commerce as an active supporter of Dispute Boards, as well as the Dispute Board Federation and the Dispute Resolution Board Foundation, makes it highly probable that dispute boards will be established in a range of industries that, until now, have not used adjudication to any great extent.|$|R
40|$|The paper aims at {{giving a}} clear and {{systematic}} presentation of the new Con-cessions Act, {{with the emphasis on}} the <b>maritime</b> domain <b>concessions.</b> The basic changes of the Act refer to a different regulation of the concession granting proce-dure, which further significantly reflects on the efficiency of the concession award-ing process. Certain provisions slow down the decision-making process and extend the competent jurisdiction to a number of ministries, and giving the Ministry of Finances a higher competence in the concession award system. The authors analyse the reasons for passing the Act {{in view of the fact}} that the compliance of national acts and regulations with their EU counterparts should not be done hastily. Legal regulations adopted in such a way question the efficien-cy of the concession system by prolonging the procedure period as the main factor of evaluation and of the efficient managing of the maritime domain and decrease the importance of decentralising the public administration. The public administration in Croatia is characterised by an authoritative management and conventional information flow. Because of the significance that the sea and coastal resources have for an efficient and sustainable economic de-velopment, such type of management, with permanent modifications of the law...|$|R

40|$|With {{containerized}} shipping, {{maritime transport}} has changed profoundly. Among other things, it {{has shifted from}} labor-intensive to more capital-intensive activities, including larger specialized ships that require substantial investments in port infrastructure and equipment. Integrated transport chains have reduced transport costs so much that a shipper may find a distant port cheaper than a closer one. Modern ports must be competitive on times and prices for their services. Seaports must be integrated within logistical chains to serve their many functions. An efficient seaport requires infrastructure, superstructure, equipment, adequate connections to other modes of transport, a well-motivated management, and qualified employees. The public sector {{has been an important}} port organizer in the past, but private participation in port operations and infrastructure could make ports significantly more competitive. The authors provide an overview of changes in <b>maritime</b> activity, discuss <b>concession</b> contracts (a key instrument of privatization), and analyze how regulatory mechanisms affect such factors as seaport tariffs, port congestion, port safety, the quality of cargo handling, and relevant indicators of performance, finances, and factor productivity. They describe how an optimal seaport system should allocate tasks between the various institutions involved, including the port authority. The degree of a seaport's decentralization, they conclude, depends on a country size, the number of ports it has, and its legal tradition. Among several national governments in Latin America [...] Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela [...] there is an evident trend toward decentralization and greater autonomy for port authorities.
