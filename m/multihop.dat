25|$|Cooperative {{diversity}} is a cooperative multiple antenna technique for improving or maximising total network channel capacities {{for any given}} set of bandwidths which exploits user diversity by decoding the combined signal of the relayed signal and the direct signal in wireless <b>multihop</b> networks. A conventional single hop system uses direct transmission where a receiver decodes the information only based on the direct signal while regarding the relayed signal as interference, whereas the cooperative diversity considers the other signal as contribution. That is, cooperative diversity decodes {{the information from the}} combination of two signals. Hence, {{it can be seen that}} cooperative {{diversity is}} an antenna diversity that uses distributed antennas belonging to each node in a wireless network. Note that user cooperation is another definition of cooperative diversity. User cooperation considers an additional fact that each user relays the other user's signal while cooperative diversity can be also achieved by multi-hop relay networking systems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ionosphere}} is {{a region}} of the upper atmosphere, from about 80km to 1000km in altitude, where neutral air is ionized by solar photons and cosmic rays. When high frequency signals enter the ionosphere obliquely, they are back-scattered from the ionized layer as scatter waves. If the midlayer ionization is strong enough compared to the signal frequency, a scatter wave can exit {{the bottom of the}} layer earthwards as if reflected from a mirror. Earth's surface (ground or water) then diffusely reflects the incoming wave back towards the ionosphere. Consequently, like a rock [...] "skipping" [...] across water, the signal may effectively [...] "bounce" [...] or [...] "skip" [...] between the earth and ionosphere two or more times (<b>multihop</b> propagation). Since at shallow incidence losses remain quite small, signals of only a few watts can sometimes be received many thousands of miles away as a result. This is what enables shortwave broadcasts to travel all over the world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} limited reconfigurable optical networks when <b>multihopping</b> is used. <b>Multihopping</b> is achieved by dropping a wavelength at an intermediate node and transmitting on another wavelength at that node (O-E-O). A route can consist of several such hops each obeying the wavelength continuity constraint individually. Considering that a receiver and a transmitter are used for add/drop at a node, <b>multihopping</b> is restricted {{by the number of}} transponders and their tunabilities. We develop a dynamic routing strategy based on the availability and tunability of transponders as well as the wavelength availability. We adopt a Share-Per-Link model for the usage of transponders within a reconfigurable node, and each node is assumed to be equipped with a ROADM which can add/drop any wavelength to any of the ports. We show that the proposed routing strategy improves the blocking performance significantly compared to fixed routing with or without <b>multihopping</b> or alternate routing methods without <b>multihopping.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The goodput of TCP flow over <b>multihops</b> ad hoc {{networks}} varies enormously {{with the}} increase of hops number between the sender and receiver. This jitter leads to the TCP instability and impediments the web applications in <b>multihops</b> ad hoc networks. This paper points out and verifies that the TCP instability comes from the hidden terminal problem due to the MAC layer collisions through the analysis of the tracing data in extensive simulations. The hidden terminal will produce large volumes of packet collisions and retransmission failures at MAC layer, which results in packet dropping and consequently destroy s the TCP stability. The formalized description of the TCP instability problem and the hidden terminal ratio estimation are also given for providing TCP sending policy. An end-to-end TCP enhancement solution, including both the limitation of the size of TCP sending window and the strategy of delayed ACK, is proposed and evaluated, which is effective to maintain the TCP stability with the available goodput at the same time.

40|$|Dense {{wireless}} {{networks are}} a promising solution {{to meet the}} huge capacity demand in 5 G wireless systems. However, there are two implementation issues, namely the interference and backhaul issues. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel network architecture called the backhaul-limited cached dense wireless network (C-DWN), where a physical layer (PHY) caching scheme is employed at the base stations (BSs) but {{only a fraction of}} the BSs have wired payload backhauls. The PHY caching can replace the role of wired backhauls to achieve both the cache-induced MIMO cooperation gain and cache-assisted <b>Multihopping</b> gain. Two fundamental questions are addressed. Can we exploit the PHY caching to achieve linear capacity scaling with limited payload backhauls? If so, how much cache is needed? We show that the capacity of the backhaul-limited C-DWN indeed scales linearly with the number of BSs if the BS cache size is larger than a threshold that depends on the content popularity. We also quantify the throughput gain due to cache-induced MIMO cooperation over conventional caching schemes (which exploit purely the cached-assisted <b>multihopping).</b> Interestingly, the minimum BS cache size needed to achieve a significant cache-induced MIMO cooperation gain is the same as that needed to achieve the linear capacity scaling.

40|$|Several institutes for {{the fourth}} {{generation}} wireless networks have been discussing about <b>multihopping</b> to improve performances, area coverage and energy consumption. This paper proposes a hybrid wireless network scheme for emergency communications, which combines ad hoc networks with a centralized network to maintain connections. In a natural disaster or an emergency, some links of the centralized network are not maintained due to damage to facilities or an interruption on wireless channels. To make matters worse, communication congestions may occur and interrupt network access. Whereby, emergency communication services cannot work normally, even though they should be given priority over others. In the proposed scheme, a terminal operating in cellular mode under normal circumstances, switches to ad hoc mode to access a base station (BS) by way of <b>multihopping</b> when a link between BS and the terminal is disconnected. The route discovery manner of the scheme is capable of building a route by monitoring communications without route request used by other ad hoc routing protocols. The simulation results show that 90 % of terminals in a cell can access BS within three hops with the proposed hybrid network in the circumstances where only 20 % of terminals are able to reach the BS directly...|$|R

Likewise in a natural resource monitoring application a mobile base-station could periodically broadcast a set of instructions to all sensor devices in a region in a single-hop fashion. In such networks <b>multihopping</b> may not even be desirable (for possible reliability and energy reasons).
