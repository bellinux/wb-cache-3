40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the character of}} engagement between UK police forces and <b>Muslim</b> <b>communities</b> and citizens. It examines, {{from the perspective of}} police personnel, a range of factors that prevent police organisations from ‘breaking out’ of constraints that currently hinder their engagement with <b>Muslim</b> <b>communities,</b> limit police officers from ‘breaking in’ to <b>Muslim</b> <b>communities</b> in ways that would improve engagement, and facilitate police officers in ‘breaking through’ barriers between them and <b>Muslim</b> <b>communities.</b> The aim of the article is to offer a critical insight into engagement between police officers and <b>Muslim</b> <b>communities</b> and citizens that may aid and enhance such engagement in the future. Enhancing positive engagement between the police service and Muslim citizens is vital in the context of contemporary concerns about <b>Muslim</b> <b>communities</b> being the focus of a multiplicity of counter-terrorism and counter-extremism strategies and, as a result, Muslims citizens retreating from participation in public life...|$|R

5|$|Chinese {{who married}} local Javanese women and {{converted}} to Islam created a distinct Chinese Muslim Peranakan community in Java. Chinese rarely had {{to convert to}} Islam to marry Javanese abangan women but {{a significant amount of}} their offspring did, and Batavian Muslims absorbed the Chinese <b>Muslim</b> <b>community</b> which was descended from converts. Adoption of Islam back then was a marker of peranakan status which it no longer means. The Semaran Adipati and the Jayaningrat families were of Chinese origin.|$|E

The <b>Muslim</b> <b>community</b> has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|E

5|$|The Bosnian Muslims' {{dissatisfaction with}} the Ustaše rule of the NDH and their need for {{protection}} were combined with nostalgia {{for the period of}} Habsburg rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian <b>Muslim</b> <b>community</b> which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich.|$|E
