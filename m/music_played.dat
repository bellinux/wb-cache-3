5|$|Kong's New York stage {{appearance}} {{looks very}} much like a re-enactment of the 1933 film's sacrifice scene, including the posts the 'beauty' is tied to and the nearly identical performance and costumes of the dancers. In addition, the <b>music</b> <b>played</b> by the orchestra during that scene is Max Steiner's original score for the 1933 film.|$|E
5|$|<b>Music</b> <b>played</b> in-game has a {{synthetic}} feel with increased pace and introduction of strings during tense moments, with a looping style endemic to video games.

5|$|During the 20th century both choral and organ musical {{components}} {{developed to}} a high standard and were integral to the liturgy at St James'. In addition, music was offered to the wider community {{in the form of}} recitals, often in ways that elucidate the liturgy and take advantage of church acoustics and sacred settings. Weekday recitals, such as the organ recitals given in 1936 of music by Bach, continued in addition to the <b>music</b> <b>played</b> on Sundays.|$|E

5|$|In 1735, George Frideric Handel {{wrote the}} opera Samson, with a {{libretto}} by Newburgh Hamilton, based on Samson Agonistes. The opera {{is almost entirely}} set inside Samson's prison and Delilah only briefly appears in Act II. In 1877, Camille Saint-Saëns composed the opera Samson and Delilah with a libretto by Ferdinand Lemaire in which the entire story of Samson and Delilah is retold. In the libretto, Delilah is portrayed as a seductive femme fatale, but the <b>music</b> <b>played</b> during her parts invokes sympathy for her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff faced Smackdown General Manager Theodore Long (with Palmer Canon). Two referees from each show officiated the match. Theodore Long, began by {{avoiding}} Eric's attacks. As Canon climbed on the apron, and distracted the referees, Bischoff used his obi to choke Long. Bischoff continued choking Long and applied the sleeper hold. Cannon distracted the referees again as Long hit Bischoff with his shoe. The Boogeyman's <b>music</b> <b>played</b> with Bischoff sending the referees {{up the ramp}} to stop him. The Boogeyman delivered a pumphandle slam to Bischoff and Long pinned Bischoff to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The <b>music</b> <b>played</b> {{during the}} {{broadcast}} of the 1939 radio speech at {{the climax of the}} film is from the 2nd movement (Allegretto) of Beethoven's 7th Symphony; it was added by Tariq Anwar, the editor. When Desplat later joined the team to write the music, he praised and defended Anwar's suggestion. Hooper further remarked that the stature of the piece helps elevate the status of the speech to a public event.|$|E

5|$|Though less commercially {{successful}} {{than the rest}} of the Big Four, Slayer released one of the genre's definitive records: Reign in Blood (1986) was credited for incorporating heavier guitar timbres, and for including explicit depictions of death, suffering, violence and occult into thrash metal's lyricism. Slayer attracted a following among far-right skinheads, and accusations of promoting violence and Nazi themes have dogged the band. Even though Slayer did not receive substantial media exposure, their <b>music</b> <b>played</b> a key role in the development of extreme metal.|$|E
5|$|Whether playing Dixieland, bebop, or avant-garde jazz, in big bands or {{in small}} groups, Manne's self-professed goal {{was to make the}} music swing. His fellow musicians attested to his {{listening}} appreciatively to those around him and being ultra-sensitive to the needs and the nuances of the <b>music</b> <b>played</b> by the others in the band, his goal being to make themand the music as a wholesound better, rather than calling attention to himself with overbearing solos.|$|E
5|$|For the film, Lang {{commissioned}} a composer {{for the first}} time. Hans Erdmann created the opening theme and the <b>music</b> <b>played</b> during Professor Baum's madness. The soundtrack in the film is deceptive. As in Lang's M, the film's music and sound are a subtle mix of actual silence with accompanying music and more or less realistic sound effects. Lang worked with his German editor Conrad von Molo directly on the post-production process. Lang was known for making very long films and to suit foreign fashions, editor Lothar Wolff was contracted to shorten the French-language version. This version deletes parts from the romantic sub-plot between Lilli and Kent.|$|E

5|$|Fred Frith was a classically-trained violinist {{who turned}} to playing blues guitar while at school. In 1967 {{he went to}} Cambridge University where he and fellow student, Tim Hodgkinson formed the English avant-rock group Henry Cow. Frith and Hodgkinson {{remained}} with the band until its demise in 1978. After the release of Henry Cow's second album in May 1974, Frith recorded his debut solo album, Guitar Solos (1974), which featured unaccompanied and improvised experimental rock <b>music</b> <b>played</b> on prepared guitars by Frith without any overdubbing. Guitar Solos was well received by music critics, and was voted {{one of the best}} albums of 1974 by NME.|$|E
5|$|Seven Halo soundtracks {{have been}} released. The Halo Original Soundtrack {{contains}} most of Combat Evolveds music. Due to the varying nature of gameplay, the music present {{was designed to}} use the game's dynamic audio playback engine. The engine allows for the mood, theme, and duration of <b>music</b> <b>played</b> to change according to gameplay. To afford a more enjoyable listening experience, O'Donnell rearranged portions of the music of Halo into standalone suites, which follow the narrative course of the game. The soundtrack also contains music not used in the game, including {{a variation on the}} Halo theme that was first played at Halos debut at Macworld 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{last piece}} of live <b>music</b> <b>played</b> in the hall, on 14 February 1982, was a {{performance}} by the Glossop School Band, who were {{taking part in the}} North West Amateur Brass Band Championship in front of a crowd of 1,700. The hall had been sold 18 months earlier to a development company, Espley Tyas Development Group, and was by then scheduled for demolition to allow the site to be redeveloped. News of the sale had triggered the formation of local action groups, who organised a petition signed by 50,000 people in an unsuccessful effort to save the hall. The exhibition halls were sold to Mullet Ltd. in 1983, but competition from the newly opened G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to their closure. The site was sold to the British Car Auction Group in 1987, and the buildings demolished {{to make way for a}} large car auction centre.|$|E

5|$|The <b>music</b> <b>played</b> at coronations {{has been}} {{primarily}} classical and religiously inspired. Much of the choral music uses texts from the Bible {{which have been}} used at coronations since King Edgar's coronation at Bath in 973 and are known as coronation anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King's Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is Zadok the Priest by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for GeorgeII's coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 coronation of CharlesII and Thomas Tomkins for CharlesI in 1621.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} is postponed {{and the parents}} are out looking for work when a prospective tenant appears.

Mrs. O'Brien puts the children out onto the street where they dance to the <b>music</b> <b>played</b> by an organ grinder. The organ grinder earns more money from their dancing and he entices the children to return to his hovel and teaches them to dance. The organ grinder instructs them to dance for money. The children are rescued by a theater manager and finds them a place in the theater program.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{with their}} {{previous}} albums, the group produced Sons of Soul entirely themselves. They utilized both vintage and contemporary recording gear in the album's production, including a Hammond B-3, Clavinet, ARP String Ensemble, and Korg and Roland synthesizers. Riley viewed that hearing <b>music</b> <b>played</b> {{from the older}} instruments affected their songwriting. For his vocals, Raphael recorded with Neumann U87 and AKG C12A condensor microphones, {{as well as a}} vintage RCA Type77-DX microphone. He used a custom five-string bass from a guitar and bass repair shop in San Francisco, as well as a Minimoog analog synthesizer for other bass lines on the album. D'wayne used a Microtech Gefell UM70 for his lead vocals and an AKG 414 for his background vocals. He played a vintage Gibson L6-S and a Fender Coronado guitar, modified with Gibson burst bucker pickups. Aside from his drumming, Riley played both Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos.|$|E
