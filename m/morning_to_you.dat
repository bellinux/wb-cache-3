2500|$|The American {{copyright}} {{status of}} [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] began to draw more attention {{with the passage}} of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act in 1998. When the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Act in Eldred v. Ashcroft in 2003, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer specifically mentioned [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] in his dissenting opinion. American law professor Robert Brauneis, who extensively researched the song, concluded in 2010 that [...] "It is almost certainly no longer under copyright." [...] In 2013, based in large part on Brauneis's research, Good <b>Morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> Productions, a company producing a documentary about [...] "Good Morning to All", sued Warner/Chappell for falsely claiming copyright to the song. In September 2015, a federal judge declared that the Warner/Chappell copyright claim was invalid, ruling that the copyright registration applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song, and not to its lyrics and melody. In 2016, Warner/Chappell settled for US $14 million, and the court declared that [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] was in the public domain.|$|E
2500|$|On June 13, 2013, {{documentary}} filmmaker Jennifer Nelson filed a putative {{class action}} suit {{in federal court}} for the Southern District of New York against Warner/Chappell {{in the name of}} her production company, Good <b>Morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> Productions. As part of a documentary she was making about the song and its history, she had paid 1,500 to secure the rights. Her complaint relied heavily on Brauneis's research, seeking not only the return of her money but all royalties collected by the company from other filmmakers since 2009. A week later a similar case was filed in the Central District of California, Rupa Marya v. Warner Chappell Music Inc, Case No. 2:13-cv-04460. Five weeks later, Nelson refiled the case there, and the cases were combined. As of April 2014, Warner's motion to dismiss had been denied without prejudice, and discovery began under an agreed plan with respect to Claim One, declaratory judgment as to whether [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] is in the public domain. [...] The Motion Cut-Off as to Merits Issues on the Claim One deadline was November 7, 2014. After that, the court was expected to rule on the motion for summary judgment as to the merits issues on Claim One. A jury trial was requested.|$|E

6000|$|... "I see {{no change}} whatever," [...] Mrs. Barker said. [...] "He is conscious, {{but does not}} speak much. He asked me, this <b>morning,</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> and all your friends how deeply he feels indebted to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I {{have had}} a {{delightful}} <b>morning,</b> thanks <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and these roses are lovely. Supposing I should feel that my gratitude still requires some expression, where could I write you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Romayne {{answered}} with evident reluctance. [...] "I don't know why," [...] he said--"but the dread of hearing it again has oppressed me all this <b>morning.</b> <b>To</b> tell <b>you</b> the truth, I {{came here in}} the hope that the change might relieve me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, the car; and if {{the girls}} come all that way out of their road in the <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> pick <b>you</b> up, it will be only civil that you should go back by Castle Richmond, and you would enjoy an evening there with the girls very much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, it is true, and I dare him to deny it. It is an {{absolute}} fact, Doctor Clay, and we have come here this <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> inform <b>you</b> that {{we can no longer}} attend a school where he is a teacher," [...] went on Dave, firmly.|$|R
6000|$|...

6000|$|Upon this Mr. Dockwrath {{jumped from}} his chair, {{and took up}} his hat.

6000|$|... "Good <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> daughter," [...] he said. [...] "How {{have you}} slept after your long journey?"
