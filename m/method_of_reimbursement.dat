40|$|As we {{venture into}} the 21 st century, we reflect on the changes in healthcare. The {{fee-for-service}} system has been replaced with managed care, and today healthcare systems across the United States are trying to maintain quality while struggling for fiscal survival. Even so, healthcare dollars account for a growing percentage {{of the gross domestic}} product. (1) Because nursing salaries account for a sizable part of healthcare costs, nurses are challenged to articulate their value as healthcare professionals in this cost-contained environment. Nursing, however, has yet to describe the experience of quality care or find a way to succinctly and reproducibly measure such care. (2) Now is the time to link nursing practice to patients ' needs by using a language that is universally understood across the healthcare system, especially to payers of nursing services. In this article, we describe a project in which the Synergy Model was used to link nursing care to diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), the basis of the established <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> and the language used by payers...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if the payment method influenced the likelihood of selected obstetrical process measures and pregnancy outcome indicators among Medicaid women. DATA SOURCE/STUDY SETTING: Data from the live birth certificates computer file for 1993 from the State of California. The computer files contain information about the {{demographic characteristics of the}} mother, her medical conditions prior to delivery, medical problems during labor and delivery, delivery method, newborn and maternal outcomes, and expected principal source of payment for prenatal care and for hospital delivery. STUDY DESIGN: The study sample consisted of singleton live births to women in the California Medi-Cal program residing in one of two counties in which a mixed-model managed care plan was the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> or in one of three counties in which fee-for-service was the payment method. The study and control counties were matched in terms of geographic proximity and sociodemographics. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among Medi-Cal women, the likelihood of low birth weight (LBW) was lower in the capitated payment group than in the fee-for-service payment group even when controlling for maternal and newborn characteristics and adequacy of prenatal care. There was no difference in either the adequacy of prenatal care, the cesarean birth rate, or the likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes other than LBW between the two payer groups. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this "natural experiment" suggest that enrollment of pregnant Medi-Cal beneficiaries in capitated healthcare services through a primary care case management system in a county-organized health system/health insuring organization can have a beneficial effect on low birth weight and provide care comparable to a fee-for-service system...|$|E

A DRG system is primarily a financial tool with the aim of promoting efficiency and improving utilization of resources. However, {{there are a variety of}} ways in which this system is used for funding the activity of centres implanting CIEDs.

The variety in reimbursement also affects how in-office checks of CIEDs are covered and, above all, the possibility to pay for remote follow-up of CIEDs. In the field of medical devices, refinement of DRG systems and adoption of new strategies and policies are needed to sustain and enhance those effective technological innovations that may be beneficial for specific patient populations.

40|$|Objective: The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to determine General Practitioners' attitudes to National Health Insurance (NHI) and to capitation as a mechanism of reimbursement. The study also aimed to explore determinants of these attitudes. Design: The methodology utilised a cross-sectional survey using telephone interviews and four focus group discussions. Setting: The study area was the Cape Peninsula area in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Participants: 174 general practitioners (GPs) were randomly sampled from a total population of 874 GPs in the Cape Peninsula area. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measures were GPs' acceptance of NHI and of capitation as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> Main results: Sixty three percent of GPs (63, 3 %) approved of NHI. More than 81 % approved of NHI if GPs were to maintain their independent status, for example their own premises and working hours. Eighty two percent (82, 3 %) said NHI would be a more equitable system of health care than the system that existed at that time, 88 % approved of the fact that NHI would make care by GPs more accessible and 73 % said they had the capacity to treat more patients. However, 61, 3 % of GPs disapproved of capitation as a form of reimbursement. The most common conditions cited by GPs for support of NHI were retention of professional autonomy, fee for service reimbursement and adequate levels of reimbursement. Conclusions: Most GPs in the Cape Peninsula were amenable to some form of NHI. However, approval of NHI is to some extent conditional to details of the NHI system, such as payment mechanisms, workload, income and effects on professional autonomy. The implications of GPs' preferences concerning the reimbursement mechanism for the feasibility of implementing a NHI in South Africa requires serious consideration by policy makers. While this research demonstrates broad ideological and conceptual support for some form of NHI or SHI, further research is required to provide more detailed quantitative information on the trade-offs that GPs would be prepared to make for them to support the introduction of a new socially based insurance system.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The role {{of primary}} care {{professionals}} in lifestyle counseling for smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet is receiving attention {{at the national level}} in many countries. The U. S. and Sweden are two countries currently establishing priorities in these areas. A previously existing international research collaboration provides a unique opportunity to study this issue. METHODS: Data from a national survey in Sweden and a study in rural Upstate New York were compared to contrast the perspectives, attitudes, and practice {{of primary care}} professionals in the two countries. Answers to four key questions on counseling for tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and eating habits were compared. RESULTS: The response rates were 71 % (n[*]=[*] 180) and 89 % (n[*]=[*] 86) in the Sweden and the U. S. respectively. U. S. professionals rated counseling "very important" significantly more frequently than Swedish professionals for tobacco (99 % versus 92 %, p[*]<[*]. 0001), physical activity (90 % versus 79 %, p[*]=[*]. 04), and eating habits (86 % versus 69 %, p[*]=[*]. 003). U. S. professionals also reported giving "very much" counseling more frequently for these same three endpoints than did the Swedish professionals (tobacco 81 % versus 38 %, p[*]<[*]. 0001, physical activity 64 % versus 31 %, p[*]<[*]. 0001, eating 59 % versus 34 %, p[*]=[*]. 0001). Swedish professionals also rated their level of expertise in providing counseling significantly lower than did their U. S. counterparts for all four endpoints. A higher percentage of U. S. professionals expressed a desire to increase levels of counseling "very much", but only significantly so for eating habits (42 % versus 28 %, p[*]=[*]. 037). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates large differences between the extent that Swedish and American primary care professionals report being engaged in counseling on lifestyle issues, how important they perceive counseling to be, and what expertise they possess in this regard. Explanations might be found in inter-professional attitudes, the organization of healthcare, including the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement,</b> traditions of preventive healthcare, and cultural differences between the two countries.

The lack of referral from the physician is a common reason that patients give for not seeking CR. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare factors affecting CR referral by cardiologists. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 122 cardiologists, including 89 general cardiac specialists and 33 fellows in cardiology from 11 major cardiology training centers in Iran, was done in 2010. They responded to the 14 - item investigator-generated survey, examining the physician&rsquo;s attitudinal and knowledge factors affecting CR referral. Results: 47. 9 % of the subjects reported having available CR centers but only 6. 6 % reported continuous medical education on the topic. 90. 7 % of the physicians reported that less than 15 % of patients are referred to CR centers. The main factor affecting the low referral rate was limited general knowledge about CR programs (79. 5 %) such as program attributes and benefits, <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> Lack <b>of</b> insurance coverage, unavailability of CR centers in the community and low physicians&rsquo; fee were other factors reported by the physicians.

40|$|The {{trend towards}} the {{privatisation}} {{of health services}} in South Africa reflects a growing use of private sources of finance and the growing proportion of privately owned fee-for-service providers and facilities. Fee-for-service <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> aggravate the geographical maldistribution of personnel and facilities, and the competition for scarce personnel resources aggravates {{the difference in the}} quality of the public and private services. Thus the growth in demand for these types of providers may be expected to increase inequality of access in these two respects. The potential expansion of medical scheme coverage is shown to be limited to well under 50 % of the population, leaving {{the majority of the population}} without access to private sector health care. Even for members of the medical schemes, benefits are linked to income, thus clashing with the principle of equal care for equal need. The public funds needed to overcome financial obstacles to access to private providers could be more efficiently deployed by financing publicly owned and controlled health services directly. Taxation also offers the most equitable <b>method</b> <b>of</b> financing health services. Finally, attention is drawn to the dilemma resulting from the strengthening of the private health sector: while in the short term this can offer better care to more people on a racially non-discriminatory basis, in the long term, health care for the population as a whole may become more unequal and for those dependent on the public sector it may even deteriorate.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the system used by Caterpillar Corporation (CAT) in Peoria, Illinois, to reimburse surgeons. The CAT system assures access for Caterpillar employees {{and their families}} to a selection of qualified surgeons, while achieving cost savings through improvements in processing of surgical claims and negotiation of selected fees. CPT- 4 codes are recorded for greater accuracy, when indicated, surgical services that have been incorrectly unbundled are rebundled, and the appropriateness of surgical assistant charges is reviewed. A "degree of difficulty" relative value scale (DODRVS) of surgical services is periodically revised as technology changes. The DODRVS multiplied by a regional factor, determined by local market research, establishes the fee that CAT will pay the surgeon. Balance billing is permitted if the patient (1) is informed in advance by the surgeon that the fee will be higher than CAT will pay, and (2) knows that the service {{can be obtained from}} other local surgeons who will accept the CAT fee. The goal <b>of</b> the CAT <b>method</b> <b>of</b> surgeon <b>reimbursement</b> is to gain physician support for an access-oriented, market-driven negotiated fee schedule.

This treatment is considered costly and the level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by health insurance has been decreasing in many countries for several years. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the real cost of treating spasticity with BoNTA and to compare this with the level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by the national health insurance in France in 2008 and with a new fee, specific to the {{injection of}} BoNTA in ambulatory services. MethodA single-center, retrospective study using the 2008 database from a French secondary-care day-hospital unit (treating spasticity in adults with sequelae of stroke, multiple sclerosis or traumatic brain injuries). The level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by the French ministry of health for BoNTA treatment for adults with spasticity constituted the “calculated cost” and corresponded to the hospital's “budget”. The “real cost” (incurred by the hospital) included the sum of staffing and material costs as well as the number of toxin vials used. The calculated costs for 2009 and 2013 were based on the levels <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> during those years. The difference between real and calculated cost for 2009 and 2013 was estimated considering that the real cost of 2008 was stable. ResultsIn 2008, 364 patients received BoNTA, resulting in 870 day-hospital admissions. The calculated cost was 459, 056 €/year and the real cost was 567, 438 €/year (equivalent to 4. 27 €/day/patient). The total budget deficit (hospital income minus hospital costs) was 108, 383 €. The deficit was estimated at 222, 892 € in 2009 and 241, 188 € in 2013.
