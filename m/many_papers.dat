Some paper sons even went as far as adopting the American lifestyle by not teaching their children their home dialects and forgetting any Chinese cultural aspects such as their cultural foods and rituals.|$|R

25|$|Loeb is {{best remembered}} nationally for his alleged role in attacking Edmund Muskie through The Union Leader {{in what is}} known locally as the Canuck letter, derailing the Maine senator's 1972 presidential bid.

Muskie's emotional defense of himself in front of the Union Leader offices in Manchester was seen as a sign of weakness and instability. Muskie later claimed that there were not tears in his eyes, as <b>many</b> <b>papers</b> reported, but rather snowflakes (as it had been snowing that evening).|$|E
