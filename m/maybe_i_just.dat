500|$|James Montgomery from MTV News {{reviewed}} the video for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] positively. Montgomery commented on how simple the song's video was but noted that wasn't a negative, he commented, [...] "like {{pretty much everything}} 3OH!3 do, there's an undeniable charm to both the song and the video. Perhaps it's the power-tool chorus, or the [...] "ooh-ooh-ooh" [...] vocal harmonies. Maybe it's Kesha's sexy ass. Or <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> like watching {{a whole bunch of}} people lock lips. The whole thing is a lot of fun. It gets in your head. And hey, it's the summer — school's out, and gleefully stupid is in." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone said {{a number}} of Cartman's {{characteristics}} which have endured throughout the South Park series started in [...] "Damien". Specifically, his voice took on a higher-pitch that was more nasally and whiney than in previous episodes; Stone {{described it as a}} [...] "self-indulgent accent". Some of his regular vocal mannerisms were also developed in the episode, including his use of the sound [...] "Nyah" [...] while saying the word [...] "Here", and the way he says [...] "Hey you guuuuuuys" [...] while talking to his friends. Parker, who provides the voice of Cartman, said the characteristics came about naturally while filming the episode: [...] "This show for some reason, for whatever reason, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> lost interest, but I was trying all these messed up things with him and all these things sort of stuck." ...|$|E

5000|$|But the {{director}} confirmed the mixed reaction of audiences. [...] "I went incognito {{to a movie}} theater and observed the audience. I didn't expect such a strong reaction. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> too optimistic that homophobia in Thai society had subsided." ...|$|R

5000|$|Miller {{was also}} quite {{stressed}} on the court. For example, she said: “A {{lot of the}} girls are friends {{with each other and}} have friends but the way I feel, and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> take everything too personally, is that there is somehow not enough total separation.” ...|$|E
5000|$|While still a child, Rothstein {{began to}} indulge in gambling, {{but no matter how}} often his father scolded him for {{shooting}} dice, Rothstein would not stop. In 1921, Rothstein was asked how he became a gambler, [...] "I always gambled. I can't remember when <b>I</b> didn't. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> gambled <b>just</b> to show my father he couldn't tell me what to do, but I don't think so. I think I gambled because I loved the excitement. When I gambled, nothing else mattered." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cooper, in an {{interview}} with The Wall Street Journal, insisted that Jesse hasn't completely lost his faith, more so struggling with it, as he stated, [...] "... struggling with it because of this silence ... he's deafened by the silence because he's made the decision to leave the life of crime he'd been leading and to remember what was important to him, and the memory of his father. But he's getting no direction, he's getting no help. He's feeling alone. There's all of these wonderful bits of writing that keep coming about. “We are who we are.” And it’s like, “Actually, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> am <b>just</b> this piece of crap who can't change." ...|$|R
5000|$|Coppola {{lives in}} Bedford-Stuyvesant. A private person, she also admits to {{struggling}} with the modern demands for artist accessibility in the music world, with such demands as online interviews and video blogs. In making choices in her own life, she has stated that she is torn between respect and resentment at the legacy left by her parents, explaining, [...] "My parents are both artists and we starved, {{we went through a}} lot of difficulty growing up because of their choices in life... When it comes down to making important decisions about my life and my foundation, you know, their artistic side haunts me. Like <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> should <b>just</b> do what they did." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{know of no}} {{path that}} is better marked than the study of music. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> think so because it's the path I'm on. There's the old {{question}} [...] "How come there's never enough {{time to do it}} right, but there's always enough time to do it over." [...] Well, here's an answer. Settle down. Do it right. However long it takes. That's the direct route to the fast lane! ...|$|E
5000|$|In August {{they issued}} their second digital single, [...] "Prairie", which Dom Alessio of Who the Hell {{described}} as [...] "returning to their Canadian music influences, building a bombastic tune not alike that of Arcade Fire but compressing their multi-layered sound into more standard song structure fare. It's build nicely, there's plenty of textured harmonies, {{but at the}} time of writing this, the song hasn't grabbed me just yet - and I'm a fan of these guys. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> have to give it time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie guide {{gave the}} episode a mixed review writing [...] "Though it has {{something}} of a rehashed feel - an impression that we’ve seen this episode before - “Hungry” still manages to be fairly effective. Chock full of laughs? No, but the show has its moments. Or <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> like it because it’s {{the origin of the}} word “hungy”, which I used for many years. I forgot I stole it from this episode!" [...] Judge Mac McEntire of DVD Verdict said of the episode that the best moment was pretty much any scene with Duffman.|$|E

In March 2010, Murray appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and talked about his return to Ghostbusters III, stating [...] "I'd do it only if my character was killed off in the first reel."

5000|$|In 2004, Hawking {{announced}} that he was conceding the bet, and that he now believed that black hole horizons should fluctuate and leak information, in doing so providing Preskill with a copy of Total Baseball, The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia. [...] Comparing the useless information obtainable from a black hole to [...] "burning an encyclopedia", Hawking later joked, [...] "I gave John an encyclopedia of baseball, but <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> should <b>just</b> have given him the ashes." [...] Thorne, however, remained unconvinced of Hawking's proof and declined to contribute to the award. As of 2008, Hawking's argument that he has solved the paradox has not yet been accepted by the community, and a consensus has not yet been reached that Hawking has provided a strong enough argument that this is in fact what happens.|$|R

5000|$|Morris, for his part, recalled: [...] "When he got out, {{he became}} very {{angry at the}} fact that he had signed a release giving me rights to his life story. And he felt as though I had stolen {{something}} from him. Maybe I had, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't understand what it's like to be in prison for that long, for a crime you hadn't committed. In a certain sense, the whole crazy deal with the release was fueled by my relationship with his attorney.

But then that's moved to January ’09 … we hadn’t seen one another [...] and we’re seeing each other for some European dates, and a festival date here and there. We’re moving on a U2 time frame. ...We have a ton of material to use and we have to structure the stuff, pick up instruments and find songs.

5000|$|Based on {{the work}} of Arthur Koehler at the Forest Products Laboratory, the State {{introduced}} photographs demonstrating that part of the wood from the ladder matched a plank from the floor of Hauptmann's attic: the type of wood, the direction of tree growth, the milling pattern, the inside and outside surface of the wood, and the grain on both sides were identical, and four oddly placed nail holes lined up with nail holes in joists in Hauptmann's attic. Additionally, Condon's address and telephone number were written in pencil on a closet door in Hauptmann's home. Hauptmann admitted to police that he had written Condon's address: [...] "I must have read it in the paper about the story. I was a little bit interested and keep a little bit record of it, and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> on the closet, and was reading the paper and put it down the address." [...] But he said, [...] "I can't give you any explanation about the telephone number." ...|$|R
2500|$|On January 2, 2006, an {{explosion}} at Sago mine in West Virginia trapped several miners underground. The following day, Browne {{was a guest}} on the radio program Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. At {{the start of the}} broadcast, it was believed that 12 of 13 miners trapped by the disaster had been found alive and, when Noory asked Browne if the reported lack of noise from inside the mine might have led her to think the men had died, she replied, [...] "No; I knew {{they were going to be}} found." [...] Later in the program, it was discovered that the earlier news reports had been in error; Browne said, [...] "I don't think there's anybody alive, <b>maybe</b> one... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't think they are alive", adding, subsequently, that she [...] "didn't believe that they were alive... I did believe that they were gone." ...|$|R
5000|$|Each Other, {{released}} on January, 22, 2016, was created despite several obstacles including his bassist's health issues and his drummer leaving to finish school.

And that seems really dramatic for me to say that now, but at the time it really felt like, 'Oh, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> kind of hang up the towel here.' We had already spent the time and already spent the money on recording it so we would have needed a bunch more money to produce the songs and release the record and all, so maybe we cut out losses?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Henry said {{producer}} Patrick McCarthy, who {{had worked}} with U2 and Robbie Robertson, helped reshape his approach to songwriting and production. [...] "When you begin a career in music, people hear where you are and assume that that's all you are. And if you're not careful, you might start assuming the same thing. I did, for a while, hear my 'voice' as a writer, producer and singer, and believe it was all that was available to me. And it's funny in retrospect to think that I could have been frustrated to the point of quitting without thinking first that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> ought to learn a new way to work. But once someone put my nose in it—that someone being my new co-producer Patrick McCarthy—I felt liberated for the first time; the recording process now becoming as much 'a process' as writing had always been.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} from November 1998, Costello said [...] "Everyday I Write the Book" [...] was [...] "a song I wrote {{in ten minutes}} almost {{as a challenge to}} myself. <b>I</b> thought, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> could write <b>just</b> a simple, almost formula song and make it mean something. I was quite happy with it and I tried {{to do it in a}} kind of lovers-rock type arrangement and I wasn't happy with it and then ended up putting this other kind of rhythm to the song, which was written originally as a kind of Merseybeat knock off...I invested less emotionally in it than any other songs from that time yet it's the one that everyone warmed to." ...|$|R
5000|$|Haim and Feldman {{capitalized}} on their fanbase in {{a slew of}} buddy films together, becoming an A-list team driven by teen love for their personae. Next came License to Drive, co-starring Feldman and Heather Graham, in which Haim played the lead role of Les, whose love life is crippled {{by a lack of}} a car, and who achieves his wish-fulfillment fantasy of turning his life around on one wild night. [...] "There were some shenanigans behind the scenes," [...] remarked director Greg Beeman of the pair's indulgences. [...] "They would disappear sometimes, but they always showed up for work." [...] At the time of the shoot, 16-year-old Haim only had a learner's permit, necessitating an adult to be concealed {{in the back seat of}} the Cadillac he drove in the movie. He did however own a car of his own, a grey 1988 Subaru XT6. The film featured Haim's signature ad-libbing at its height, of which he said: [...] "It's one of my special things that <b>I</b> feel <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> born with. <b>I</b> can turn a 'Hey, nice to see you' into 'Hey, what's up? What's goin' down, man? Good to see you' and kind of make it more real." ...|$|R

In the October issue of Vanity Fair, Aykroyd gave an update on the status of the Ghostbusters III script, written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, writer-producers of The Office: [...] "I’m working on the script now and those two—Stupnitsky and Eisenberg, wrote Bill the comic role of a lifetime, and the new Ghostbusters and the old are all well represented in it...we have a strong first draft that Harold Ramis and I will take back, and I’m very excited about working on it." [...] Shortly after that interview, at the Spike TV Scream Awards, Murray appeared on the show to accept an award for Zombieland. He arrived on stage in full Ghostbusters gear, giving no statements regarding the film except, [...] "I'm sorry; I don't mean anything by this, it's just all that was left that was clean." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song's origins date to 1998 {{or early}} 1999, {{when it was}} first written, {{although}} the mandolin riff first appeared on the song [...] "Labor of Love" [...] on Joe Gruscheky's 1995 album [...] "American Babylon" [...] that Springsteen played on. [...] It came during the close of a decade in which Springsteen had parted ways with the E Street Band, gotten married again and had children, and had released very little new music in a rock vein. [...] He later said, [...] "I {{was having a hard time}} locating my rock voice. I knew I didn't want it to be what it was, but I didn't know ... I'd made some records over the past years, I made one in '94 that I didn't release. Then I made a series of demos, kind of in search of that voice. And I was having a hard time finding it. And there was a point I said: 'Well, gee, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't do that now. Maybe that's something that I did.'" [...] But after writing [...] "Land of Hope and Dreams", he felt it was [...] "as good as any songs like this that I've ever written. It was like, there's that voice I was looking for." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reutter {{competed in}} the semifinals for the 3000 m relay with {{teammates}} Alyson Dudek, Allison Baver and Kimberly Derrick. The U.S. team qualified for the final in second place behind South Korea {{with a time of}} 4:15.376. Reutter finished in fourth place in the 1500 m final, behind Zhou Yang of China, with Lee Eun-Byul of South Korea in second, and Park Seung-Hi of South Korea in third. Reutter got tangled up with Wang Meng in the semifinal, causing both skaters and Cho Ha-Ri of South Korea to fall, resulting in Meng being disqualified from the final. Reutter repeated the same move in the final, bumping into Park, and later expressed remorse for both mistakes, stating [...] "I think the room was there but <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> wasn't there. I don't know. But … I messed up and messed up some people around me, which I'm very sorry for." [...] In the heats of the 1000 m, Reutter set an Olympic record and finished first overall in the heats. About {{an hour and a half}} later, Reutter {{competed in the}} 3000 m relay (with Allison Baver, Alyson Dudek, Lana Gehring) and won bronze behind China and Canada due to the disqualification of South Korea. In the final of the 1000 m, Reutter was edged out for the gold medal by Wang Meng, finishing behind her 1:29.324 to 1:29.213.|$|E

But it's quite possible that I have survived just because of that. It brought me the opportunity to spend the whole winter wrapped on a hospital bed. I had already left with sequelae of malnutrition. I can say that before the release, I was practically laying next to dead men, just like the old age end weakenings.
