The <b>manganiferous</b> iron ore probably occurs as irregular replacement bodies in Cambrian or Precambrian mudstone but more detailed geology of the area is given in the above mentioned reports. The surface outcrop of the <b>manganiferous</b> are is poor except in the road cutting; <b>manganiferous</b> scree covers approximately one tenth of the leased area and about half of this scree-covered area is probably outcrop.

40|$|<b>Manganiferous</b> soil concretions {{have been}} located in {{pineapple}} and sugar cane plantations of the Schofield Plateau, Oahu, and black <b>manganiferous</b> coatings {{on the surface}} of soils have been observed on the crests of embankments next to pineapple plantations on Oahu, Molokai, and Lanai. The concretions and coatings are found inoxisols derived from volcanic parent material. The moisture regime of the soils is characterized by alternate wet and dry periods. This alternation facilitates remobilization and reprecipitation of manganese and to a much lesser extent iron and associated trace metals in the soils. Optimum conditions for <b>manganiferous</b> soil concretion development are encountered on the Schofield Plateau, where mean annual rainfall exceeds 1000 mm/year but where there is a net evaporation loss from the soils during the dry period (May through October). Remobilization of manganese is less pronounced in the oxisols of Molokai and Lanai, where mean annual rainfall is lower. Thin <b>manganiferous</b> coatings rather than concretions therefore form in these islands. The contents of Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ni of the soils on which Hawaiian concretions form are higher than those of New Zealand soils in which manganese soil concretions are found. This is reflected by the much redder color of the Hawaiian concretion-bearing soils compared with their New Zealand counterparts. Rare earths show an enrichment sequence: parent rock [...] -+ soil [...] -+ soil concretion. A small positive Ce anomaly is noted in the soil and is more marked in the concretions.

They reflect a syn-sedimentary, volcanic exhalative origin and in many areas, e. g. the Leinster egion in southeast Ireland, they are intimately associated with, inter alia, base metal mineralization and with tourmalinite. However, though the metamorphic coticule is common, the pre-metamorphic coticule precursor has proved ifficult o recognize. <b>Manganiferous</b> ironstone r cks of coticule aspect are a distinctive feature in parts of the Manx Group exposed along the west coast of the Isle of Man.
