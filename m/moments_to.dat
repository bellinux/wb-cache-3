25|$|As archbishop, Anselm {{maintained}} his monastic ideals, including stewardship, prudence, and proper instruction, prayer and contemplation. Anselm continued to agitate for {{reform and the}} interests of Canterbury. As such, he repeatedly took advantage of expedient <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> press the English monarchy for concessions and support of the reform agenda. His principled opposition to royal prerogatives over the church, meanwhile, twice led to his exile from England.|$|E
25|$|His {{first major}} {{scientific}} contribution was {{the application of}} the concept of dipole moment to the charge distribution in asymmetric molecules in 1912, developing equations relating dipole <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> temperature and dielectric constant. In consequence, the units of molecular dipole moments are termed debyes in his honor. Also in 1912, he extended Albert Einstein's theory of specific heat to lower temperatures by including contributions from low-frequency phonons. See Debye model.|$|E
25|$|A ferromagnet, like a {{paramagnetic}} substance, has unpaired electrons. However, {{in addition}} to the electrons' intrinsic magnetic moment's tendency to be parallel to an applied field, there is also in these materials a tendency for these magnetic <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> orient parallel to each other to maintain a lowered-energy state. Thus, {{even in the absence of}} an applied field, the magnetic moments of the electrons in the material spontaneously line up parallel to one another.|$|E

Unlike the detective fiction methods of the previous Robot novels where Baley assembles the clues to a crime that had been committed, in Robots and Empire, a murderous conspiracy developing against the Earth, and its discovery by the robots, keep pace with each other right up through the final confrontation with Amadiro on the Earth. Then, the robots have only <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> spare in terminating Amadiro's evil plan for a quick death to all Earthlings.|$|E
25|$|Charging a {{capacitor}} (due to a voltage between the capacitor plates) causes an electric field {{to be applied}} to the dielectric between the electrodes. This field exerts a torque on the molecular dipoles, causing the directions of the dipole <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> align with the field direction. This change in the molecular dipoles is called oriented polarization and also causes heat to be generated, resulting in dielectric losses (see dissipation factor). The orientation of the dipoles does not follow the electric field synchronously, but is delayed by a time constant that depends on the material. This delay corresponds to a hysteresis response of the polarization to the external field.|$|E
25|$|The last match saw two US {{champion}}s the 2006 champion Maria Sharapova and {{the current}} champion Samantha Stosur. Stosur, the No.7 seed at the year-end finale, turned the tables {{on one of the}} most lopsided head-to-heads in the upper echelon of the women's game, coming out like a house on fire then surviving some tense <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> close out a No.2-ranked, No.2-seeded Sharapova in straight sets 6–1, 7–5. Having lost her last 11 sets in a row to Sharapova, Stosur stormed through the opening set in just 28 minutes, then rallied from 3–0 down in the second set, with Sharapova missing a backhand return on match point. Both players had a similar number of winners throughout the match – Stosur 18, Sharapova 17 – but Sharapova's 30 unforced errors far outweighed Stosur's 17 miscues.|$|E

On 5 December 2012, Cahill scored his first UEFA Champions League goal, coming against Nordsjælland in a 6–1 home rout. On 16 December 2012, Cahill was sent-off against Corinthians in Chelsea's 1–0 2012 FIFA Club World Cup Final defeat after a clash with Emerson. On January 2013, Cahill did not feature in the league match against Stoke City due to the birth of his son, Leo. On 15 May, he started the 2013 UEFA Europa League Final against Benfica and made a vital last-ditch tackle and clearance in the final <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> ensure that Chelsea won the match 2–1.|$|E
25|$|History was {{repeated}} on 4 October 2015 when {{for only the}} second time in the NRL's history, no NSW team was in the grand final and for the first time ever, it was a Queensland derby in the final between Brisbane and North Queensland. 82,758 people, many of whom had travelled down from various parts of Queensland, witnessed one of the all-time great grand finals when the game went into Golden Point time courtesy of a Kyle Feldt try in the dying <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> level the scores at 16 all. But the game would be remembered for Ben Hunt's dropped ball from the kick-off to extra time which led to Johnathan Thurston's field goal that gave North Queensland their first ever premiership in the NRL since being admitted into the competition in 1995. Apart from games involving national teams, the crowd is the largest ever in NSW not to involve a team based in the state.|$|E
25|$|Lozada and {{her partner}} split up while chasing the suspect. She chased him to a nearby {{abandoned}} lot located {{at the intersection of}} Central Avenue and Chauncey Street and waited at the lot which was heavily weeded and was loaded with junk. When confronted by the suspect she pretended to be looking for a lost dog with the intention that the suspect would not suspect her real motives. The suspect then turned around to look for the dog and Lozada pulled out her service gun. As Lozada attempted to handcuff the suspect, he turned and took her gun. According to Jeter, Lozada pleaded for her life to no avail. The suspect then shot her twice in the face. The first time Jeter fired, the bullet passed through her cheek. He then walked a short distance only to return after a few <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> shoot her in the face, killing her. Lozada's body was found three hours later in the lot; she was the first female officer to be killed {{in the line of duty}} in New York City.|$|E

25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{structure of}} a-hematite {{was the subject}} of considerable discussion and debate in the 1950s because it appeared to be ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of around 1000 K, but with an extremely tiny magnetic moment (0.002 µB). Adding to the surprise was a transition with a decrease in temperature at around 260 K to a phase with no net magnetic moment. It was shown that the system is essentially antiferromagnetic, but that the low symmetry of the cation sites allows spin–orbit coupling to cause canting of the moments when they are in the plane perpendicular to the c axis. The disappearance of the moment with a decrease in temperature at 260 K is caused by a change in the anisotropy which causes the <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> align along the c axis. In this configuration, spin canting does not reduce the energy. The magnetic properties of bulk hematite differ from their nanoscale counterparts. For example, the Morin transition temperature of hematite decreases with a decrease in the particle size. The suppression of this transition has also been observed in some of the hematite nanoparticles, and the presence of impurities, water molecules and defects in the crystals were attributed to the absence of a Morin transition. Hematite is part of a complex solid solution oxyhydroxide system having various contents of water, hydroxyl groups and vacancy substitutions that affect the mineral's magnetic and crystal chemical properties. Two other end-members are referred to as protohematite and hydrohematite.|$|E
25|$|Ching Leung – Leung is a 27-year-old renowned lawyer. He is Sum’s boyfriend {{towards the}} middle of the series. He is a moody but {{vigilant}} and caring figure who forever strives to do his best. Although he is a kind person, he has an inability to stay faithful and succumbs. At one point he had an affair with Sheung Joi Sum's best friend Shui Mak Mak, but he kept it quiet and reconciled with Sheung Joi Sum without admitting anything about the matter. Eventually information would slip and Sheung Joi Sum actively demands to know who was the other woman, but Ching felt exposing this matter would ruin everything and insists for her to drop the matter since he admitted his mistakes and assures Sheung Joi Sum it would never happen again. Sheung Joi Sum wasn't satisfied with such an answer and whenever he tries to comfort her, Tong Chi On would be around and he becomes jealous. After the big secret was exposed, everyone parted ways for some time and Leung would try to patch things between him and Sheung Joi Sum. Despite the fact that they broke up, Leung continues to love Sum. This is shown when he continues to write in his blog, Days without Sheung Joi Sum, three years after the break-up. He also helps Sheung Joi Sum think of ideas to defend Ling Lei. He eventually dies of a car crash in the end, because he was thinking about Sheung Joi Sum's decision to forgive him or not. Although he could be saved, he refuses to go to the hospital, using his final <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> tell Sheung Joi Sum ways to defeat Wong Sau-Kam. Sheung Joi Sum, who forgave Leung and is willing to renew their relationship, was greatly sadden by his death.|$|E
25|$|Kyo is {{the heir}} to the Tengu Clan. It is {{revealed}} that Kyo is not human but a powerful demon. When he is in his demon form, his hair grown longer, has black wings, and wears a mask that looks like a crow's beak. Perverted and cocky to many, but he treats Misao with a combination of kindness and coldness depending on his mood. Kyo met Misao during their childhood; they quickly developed a strong bond and {{he fell in love with}} her. They also made a promise that she would be his bride, which he is determined to fulfill. His older brother, Sho, was supposed to be clan leader, but Kyo surpassed him for Misao's sake (as only a clan leader may seek her as their bride). In order to stay close to Misao, he moved back to his house next door to hers and took a job as a math teacher at her school. He is always protecting her and healing her wounds, also finding <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> steal a kiss. While he cares deeply for Misao, Kyo has deep attachments to those close to him: such that he took Taro under his wings to train him and make him stronger after Taro was abused by Shou. Kyo has deep disdain towards his brother (for his abusive ways) and his father (whom he suspected of murdering his mother). After Sho's death, Kyo learns that Misao is pregnant with his child, a powerful demon child. He is initially happy of the news, but when he learns that the children of the Immortal Fruit will feed on their mothers after childbirth, he wants her to abort the pregnancy but she refuses. When Misao tells him that she loves the baby and it loves her, he comes to care for the baby. Misao gives birth to a boy, whom they name Sou. Misao, by miracle, survives and Kyo is able to live happily with her and Sou.|$|E
