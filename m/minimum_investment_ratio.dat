40|$|The {{relationship}} between dividend policy and investment is a controversial {{area and the}} {{relationship between}} these two may differ depending on the company's priorities. The study examines this more closely by studying dividend policy's impact on investment and how it differs depending on the company’s market capitalization. The study is based on companies listed on the OMX Stockholm within the segments Large Cap and Small Cap, during the period between 2003 - 2012. Secondary data was obtained from each company's annual reports where relevant data was used to operationalized into measurable variables. The variable for measuring investment was the <b>investment</b> <b>ratio</b> and the dividend policy was represented by the dividend payout <b>ratio.</b> The <b>investment</b> <b>ratio</b> was acting as dependent and payout ratio as the independent variable. The results showed that the payout ratio has a weak negative impact on the <b>investment</b> <b>ratio.</b> This negative relationship existed with safety within Large Cap.

When comparing the <b>investment</b> <b>ratio</b> in relation to the dividend payout ratio, it was found that small cap prioritizes investments in higher degree than large cap...|$|R
40|$|Sex <b>investment</b> <b>ratios</b> in {{populations of}} {{bumblebees}} are male biased, which contradicts theoretical predictions. Male-biased <b>investment</b> <b>ratios</b> in eusocial Hymenoptera {{are assumed to}} be non-stable for both the queen and her workers. In this paper, we show that male-biased sex allocation does not necessarily decrease fitness in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. A male-biased <b>investment</b> <b>ratio</b> can be the result of an optimal allocation of resources when resources are scarce if (i) there is a large cost difference between male and female production, (ii) there is uncertainty about the amount of resources a colony can invest, and (iii) only a proportion of the investment made in an individual can be reused. This resource allocation then leads to split sex ratios depending on the amount of resources available to a bumblebee colony: colonies under low resource conditions will show a male-biased <b>investment</b> <b>ratio,</b> whereas colonies under high resource conditions allocate more resources towards females. However, the extent to which bumblebee populations show a male-biased sex allocation cannot be explained by cost differences between male and female production alone. In a recent paper, A. F. G. Bourke argued that male-biased <b>investment</b> <b>ratios</b> in bumblebee populations are a by-product of the occurrence of protandry (males emerge before females). Here we will extend Bourke's argument and show that within a protandrous population, both protandrous and protogynous (females emerge before males) colonies exist. The existence of protandrous and protogynous colonies results in split sex ratios in time, because protogynous colonies rely on males produced by protandrous colonies (partial protandry) ...|$|R
