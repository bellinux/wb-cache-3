25|$|Research In Motion Limited {{was founded}} in March 1984 by Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin. At the time, Lazaridis was an {{engineering}} student at the University of Waterloo while Fregin was an engineering student at the University of Windsor. In 1988, RIM became the first wireless data technology developer in North America and the first company outside Scandinavia to develop connectivity products for <b>Mobitex</b> wireless packet-switched data communications networks. In 1990, RIM introduced the DigiSync Film KeyKode Reader. In 1991, RIM introduced the first <b>Mobitex</b> protocol converter. In 1992, RIM introduced the first <b>Mobitex</b> point-of-sale solution, a protocol converter box that interfaced with existing point-of-sale terminal equipment to enable wireless communication. In 1993, RIM introduced the RIMGate, the first general purpose <b>Mobitex</b> X.25 gateway. In the same year, RIM launched Ericsson Mobidem AT and Intel wireless modem containing RIM modem firmware. In 1994, RIM introduced the first <b>Mobitex</b> mobile point-of-sale terminal. In the same year, RIM received the Emmy Award for Technical Innovation and the KPMG High Technology Award. In 1995, RIM introduced Freedom, the first Type II PCMCIA radio modem for <b>Mobitex.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, RIM {{introduced}} the Inter@ctive Pager, the first two-way messaging pager, and the RIM 900 OEM radio modem. The company worked with RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson [...] {{to turn the}} Ericsson-developed <b>Mobitex</b> wireless data network into a two-way paging and wireless e-mail network. Pivotal in this development was {{the release of the}} Inter@ctive Pager 950, which started shipping in August 1998. About the size of a bar of soap, this device competed against the Skytel two-way paging network developed by Motorola.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mobitex</b> is now marketed {{worldwide}} by <b>Mobitex</b> Technology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mobitex</b> is a packet-switched, narrowband, data-only {{technology}} {{mainly for}} short burst data. <b>Mobitex</b> channels are 12.5 kHz wide. In North America, <b>Mobitex</b> runs at 900 MHz, while in Europe it uses 400 - 450 MHz. The modulation scheme used is GMSK {{with a slotted}} aloha protocol at 8000 bit/s, although user throughput is typically around half of that.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mobitex</b> {{is offered}} on over 30 {{networks}} on five continents. In Canada {{it was first}} introduced in 1990 by Rogers Cantel, and in 1991 by carrier RAM Mobile Data. However, , it is primarily used in the USA and Canada. European <b>Mobitex</b> networks almost completely withered {{in the shadow of}} the overwhelming success of GSM there in the early 1990s. Exceptions to this are <b>Mobitex</b> networks in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mobitex</b> is an OSI based open standard, {{national}} public access wireless packet-switched data network. <b>Mobitex</b> puts great emphasis on safety and reliability with its use by military, police, firefighters and ambulance services. It {{was developed in}} the beginning of the 1980s by the Swedish Televerket Radio. From 1988 the development took place in Eritel, a joint-venture between Ericsson and Televerket, later on as an Ericsson subsidiary. <b>Mobitex</b> became operational in Sweden in 1986.|$|E
50|$|RAM Mobile Data {{was sold}} and renamed BellSouth Wireless Data in 1995 {{and later became}} Cingular Interactive when BellSouth and SBC Communications formed Cingular Wireless. The <b>Mobitex</b> {{division}} within Cingular Wireless was sold to an investment company in 2005 and became Velocita Wireless. Velocita Wireless was purchased by Sprint Nextel and became a Sprint Nextel Company in early 2006. Today RAM Mobile Data is the exclusive operator of <b>Mobitex</b> in the Netherlands. With headquarters in Utrecht (NL) and a daughter in Brussels (BE), they are running the entire <b>Mobitex</b> operations throughout the BeNeLux. Furthermore, RAM has a business unit RAM track-and-trace and since 2010 a daughter in IT services Ram Infotechnology.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 BT Transcomm {{announced}} {{the closure of}} the <b>Mobitex</b> Network in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|DataTac {{is an open}} {{standard}} for point to point wireless data communications, similar to <b>Mobitex.</b> Like <b>Mobitex,</b> it is mainly used in vertical market applications. One of the early DataTac devices was the Newton Messaging Card, a two-way pager connected to a PC card using the DataTac network. The original BlackBerry devices, the RIM 850 and 857 also used the DataTac network.|$|E
50|$|In Sweden the <b>Mobitex</b> {{network was}} finally shut down {{permanently}} on December 31st 2012 after 25 years.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mobitex</b> in the UK was marketed by RAM Mobile Data, the UK part {{of which}} became Transcomm and was then {{purchased}} by BT (British Telecom) in 2004. The largest use of <b>Mobitex</b> in the United Kingdom is within the vehicle recovery business. Nearly all breakdowns passed to UK breakdown service agents are sent using Turbo Dispatch, a Mobitex-based gateway software developed in the early nineties by Ian Lane and Andy Lambert.|$|E
50|$|The Inter@ctive Pager, {{introduced}} in 1996 by Research In Motion (RIM), allowed users to receive and send messages {{over the internet}} via a wireless data network known as <b>Mobitex.</b> The US Operator of <b>Mobitex,</b> RAM Mobile Data operated the network and introduced the Inter@ctive Pager service as RAMfirst Interactive Paging(sm). The product was named the 1997 Top Product by Wireless for the Corporate User Magazine. The Inter@ctive Pager was {{also known as the}} RIM-900.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} <b>Mobitex</b> gained {{consumer}} popularity by providing two-way paging network services. It {{was the first}} wireless network to provide always on, wireless push email services such as RadioMail and Inter@ctive Paging. It is also used by the first model of Research in Motion's BlackBerry, and PDAs such as the Palm VII. During 9/11 and the 2005 hurricane rescue and clean-up operations, <b>Mobitex</b> proved itself {{to be a very}} reliable and useful system for first responders.|$|E
5000|$|RadioMail was {{introduced}} in 1992 to allow users to receive and send messages over the internet via a wireless data network known as <b>Mobitex.</b>|$|E
50|$|Velocita Wireless is a {{national}} wireless-telecommunications service provider that is based in Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States. Known by several names over the years, Velocita Wireless has been in existence for over 17 years as the operator of the <b>Mobitex</b> network in the United States. Previously known as Cingular Interactive, L.P., BellSouth Wireless Data and prior to that RAM Mobile Data, Velocita Wireless carved a market for itself with the acquisition of the <b>Mobitex</b> network from Cingular and rebranding itself overall as Velocita in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mobitex</b> {{networks}} in North America have been marketed under several names, including RAM Mobile Data, BellSouth Wireless Data, Cingular Interactive, Cingular Wireless and Velocita Wireless, and Rogers Wireless in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Andrew Fitton is a {{telecoms}} specialist, {{and part}} owner and {{former chairman of}} Swindon Town F.C..He works currently for Transcomm plc. as chief executive.He also worked with <b>Mobitex</b> and United Wireless Holdings.|$|E
50|$|BellSouth Mobility {{operated}} wireless networks using {{many different}} wireless communication standards. The {{most widely used}} of these technologies is called Digital AMPS, or D-AMPS. Data services were provided by BellSouth Wireless Data, and used the pre-2.5G <b>Mobitex</b> standard.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{reliability}} of delivery needed {{it was decided that}} <b>Mobitex</b> should be used. In the UK there was only one provider of <b>Mobitex,</b> namely RAM Data, which later became a subsidiary of BT called Transcomm. This is why many users still refer to RAMing jobs. Ian Lane of Motor Trade Software (MTS) designed and wrote the protocols along with the gateway software. Much pioneering work was carried out during early 1995. In the autumn of 1995 Green Flag and Delta Rescue were the first motoring organisations to start experimenting with transmissions to the garages, with the first genuine job being sent to Southbank Garage {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
5000|$|RAM Mobile Data {{was founded}} by RAM Broadcasting Corporation as American Mobile Data Communications, Inc. in 1988. [...] The name of the company was changed to Ram Mobile Data in 1989. RAM Mobile Data was the U.S. Operator of the <b>Mobitex</b> network.|$|E
50|$|Developed in {{the early}} 1990s, CDPD was large on the horizon as a future technology. However, it had {{difficulty}} competing against existing slower but less expensive <b>Mobitex</b> and DataTac systems, and never quite gained widespread acceptance before newer, faster standards such as GPRS became dominant.|$|E
50|$|Construction was {{commenced}} on 13 January 2015 {{and finished}} between 15-25 July 2015. SGP Pomgrad company {{was the main}} contractor, Nafta strojna company responsible for steel constructions and <b>Mobitex</b> company for producing steel construction as part of GOI works. Atrij company from Odranci was the supervisor.|$|E
5000|$|The RIM-900 {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{wireless}} data devices, marketed as a two-way pager. It operated on the <b>Mobitex</b> network. It was a clam shell device that could fit on your belt. It had a small QWERTY keyboard for sending and receiving email and interactive messages.|$|E
50|$|This {{solution}} {{became known}} as a pure ALOHA, or random-access channel, and {{was the basis for}} subsequent Ethernet development and later Wi-Fi networks. Various versions of the ALOHA protocol (such as Slotted ALOHA) also appeared later in satellite communications, and were used in wireless data networks such as ARDIS, <b>Mobitex,</b> CDPD, and GSM.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, the company's <b>Mobitex</b> network {{proved to}} be {{effective}} in communications in Manhattan during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Most other cellular and wireless telecommunications services were knocked-out or overloaded in New York City. The effectiveness of the network led to Velocita developing a small 'following' amongst emergency responders in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Mob-I-Mail was {{the first}} Dutch service to allow sending and {{receiving}} of email messages by using GSM and <b>Mobitex</b> networks. It was launched by Harold Wiegers, Rob de Reeper and Robert van Alphen. In 1996 the service working under the mobimail.com domain became available for subscribers of the Dutch KPN and RAM mobile data networks.|$|E
50|$|The Palm VIIx was a {{personal}} digital assistant made by Palm, Inc. The device featured an antenna used for wireless data communication. Connectivity was provided through the <b>Mobitex</b> network under the now defunct Palm.net service. Web Clipping applications used the network to process data. The cost of service was $14.95 per month and allowed {{a limited number of}} web pages to be viewed.|$|E
50|$|Typically, the {{recovery}} operator job logging and invoicing system is based around a personal computer. This will {{be connected to}} the <b>Mobitex</b> data network by a Masc. radio modem (sometimes called a Mobidem) using one of the PC's RS-232 communication ports. Job transmission will entail the motoring organisation's computer using {{the recovery}} operator's unique Mobidem number to call his computer.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} notes {{describe the}} method of automatically transferring job details from a motoring organisation (or club’s) computer into their recovery operator's computer using the <b>Mobitex</b> data network. Since each of the motoring organisations {{is likely to have}} its own unique computer system and working practices, it is not practical to attempt to define how automatic job transfer would be best achieved for them. Consequently, only a typical recovery operator’s computer installation is defined below.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, RIM {{introduced}} the Inter@ctive Pager, the first two-way messaging pager, and the RIM 900 OEM radio modem. The company worked with RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson {{to turn the}} Ericsson-developed <b>Mobitex</b> wireless data network into a two-way paging and wireless e-mail network. Pivotal in this development was {{the release of the}} Inter@ctive Pager 950, which started shipping in August 1998. About the size of a bar of soap, this device competed against the Skytel two-way paging network developed by Motorola.|$|E
5000|$|The Tungsten W {{focused more}} on its PDA half as opposed to its {{cellular}} telephony half, {{the focus of the}} succession of the Palm i705 and Palm VII. Unlike either the Palm i705 and the Palm VII (which both could only make data connections over the <b>Mobitex</b> pager network), downloads and uploads were done using comparatively-fast GPRS connections. It didn't have a microphone and the speaker couldn't be used for phone calls; instead, an included ear bud and microphone loopset was used for voice calls.|$|E
50|$|Palm.net was a {{wireless}} data communication service enabling limited wireless access of the World Wide Web, provided for certain Palm, Inc. Personal Digital Assistants. Connectivity was provided through the <b>Mobitex</b> network. Web Clipping applications {{made use of}} the network to process data. The cost of service was $14.95 per month, and allowed {{a limited number of}} web pages to be viewed. The initial Palm model to be capable of using the service was the Palm VII, which made it the first standalone PDA to be capable of wireless internet access. Later models included the Palm VIIx and Palm i705. The service started in 1999 and was discontinued on August 31, 2004.|$|E
50|$|Uniquely in the UK and Ireland the {{motoring}} organisations and {{the recovery}} operators {{have worked together}} to form a common standard for the communication of job details. The system is called Turbo Dispatch and was introduced in 1995. It uses a combination of <b>Mobitex</b> data radios and the Internet to communicate. Its main advantage is that it does away with the need for the information to be re-keyed into all the different computers in use and eliminates most of the delays associated with 'job taking'. If the information is put in correctly at the start, it will still be correct when the invoice is raised.|$|E
50|$|A WWAN often {{differs from}} {{wireless}} {{local area network}} (WLAN) by using mobile telecommunication cellular network technologies such as LTE, WiMAX (often called a wireless metropolitan area network or WMAN), UMTS, CDMA2000, GSM, cellular digital packet data (CDPD) and <b>Mobitex</b> to transfer data. It can also use Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) or Wi-Fi to provide Internet access. These technologies are offered regionally, nationwide, or even globally and are provided by a wireless service provider. WWAN connectivity allows a user with a laptop and a WWAN card to surf the web, check email, or connect to a virtual private network (VPN) from anywhere within the regional boundaries of cellular service. Various computers can have integrated WWAN capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The Palm VII was a {{personal}} digital assistant made by the Palm Computing division of 3Com. The device featured an antenna used for wireless data communication, a first for a Palm device. Connectivity was provided through the <b>Mobitex</b> network, under the now defunct Palm.net service. Web Clipping applications, also known as Palm Query Applications (PQAs) made use of the network to request and post web data. The devices also provided PQA developers with the user's position, {{in the form of}} a zipcode, making the Palm VII the first web-enabled Location-Based Services mobile platform. The cost of service was $14.95 per month, and allowed a limited number of web pages to be viewed.|$|E
