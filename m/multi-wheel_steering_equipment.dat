50|$|The basic hull {{design of}} most hydroplanes has {{remained}} relatively unchanged since the 1950s: two sponsons in front, {{one on each}} side of the bow; behind the wide bow, is a narrower, mostly rectangular section housing the driver, engine, and <b>steering</b> <b>equipment.</b> The aft part of the vessel is supported in the water by the lower half of the propeller, which is designed to operate semi-submerged at all times. The goal is to keep as little of the boat in contact with the water as possible, as water is much denser than air, and so exerts more drag on the vehicle than air does. Essentially the boat 'flies' over the surface of the water rather than actually traveling through it.|$|R

50|$|Rhino TRU (the SPV in Anderson's earlier series): The Rhino TRU (Tactical Response Unit) is a {{heavy-duty}} attack vehicle, with an ultra-tough full armour. The Rhino {{is capable of}} high speed {{with the help of}} twin ram air booster jets at the rear. Built with ten wheels (two front sets, three rear sets), as well as with variable ride-height suspension, it is equipped with a <b>multi-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system. This makes this cumbersome-looking vehicle easy to manoeuvre, on any kind of normal road as well as giving it good off-road performance. The Rhino is armed to the teeth with a large arsenal; two front mounted twin cannons firing explosive tipped rounds, armour piercing missiles, harpoon guns and magnetic clamp guns. There are also extendable battering rams on the front and rear. It is also equipped with evasive action anti-missiles launched from the rear. The Rhino is a sealed armoured vehicle, and access to the cabin is gained from the hatches on the vehicles sides. Retractable seats face the hatch openings to receive either the driver and/or passenger, which swing into position in front of the control panel. The vehicle can be driven from either side, the steering sliding into position to whoever wishes to drive it. Other hatches are situated on top of the vehicle and underneath it. The drivers cabin has a number of control screens, which act as the drivers eyes, as there is no window. Equipped with all manner of computerised equipment needed for Spectrum work, the Rhino also comes with a security device allowing the driver to lock the vehicle by password and voice command, thus avoiding theft of the Rhino by an enemy if it should be left by itself. Whenever a Rhino is needed on a given mission, Spectrum will use the Albatross to transport the vehicle. The Albatross will land and the hatch beneath will open, a lift lowering to the ground to deposit the Rhino - with driver inside - ready to perform its mission.|$|R
2500|$|The Fairmont Ghia {{offered a}} {{combination}} of luxury and performance, which was emphasised most effectively by making use of the six-cylinder engine fitted to the XR6, with the V8 remaining optional. Due {{to the implementation of}} a quieter exhaust, the Ghia suffered from a slight loss in output compared to the XR6. Limited slip differential provided better handling than the Fairmont, as did improved variable ratio power <b>steering.</b> <b>Equipment</b> wise, the Fairmont Ghia gained a more powerful, nine-speaker stereo system, a passenger airbag, thicker [...] side glass for better sound absorption, wood-grain trim, chrome door handles and accents as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel, handbrake handle and leather upholstery. Externally, to differentiate the Fairmont from the Fairmont Ghia, the centre bar of the chrome front grille was colour-coded to the exterior paint, and 15-inch eight-spoke alloy wheels were fitted.|$|R

500|$|Sydney {{closed to}} a {{distance}} of [...] before turning to a parallel course with Emden. The German cruiser opened fire first, and [...] the Australian vessel with her third salvo. Emdens gunners were firing rapidly, with a salvo every ten seconds; Müller hoped to overwhelm Sydney with a barrage of shells before her heavier armament could take effect. Two shells hit Sydney, one of which disabled the aft fire control station; the other failed to explode. It took slightly longer for Sydney to find the range, and in the meantime, Emden turned toward her opponent {{in an attempt to}} close to torpedo range. Sydneys more powerful [...] guns soon found the range and inflicted serious damage. The wireless compartment was destroyed and the crew for one of the forward guns was killed early in the engagement. At 09:45, Müller turned his ship toward Sydney in another attempt to reach a torpedo firing position. Five minutes later, a shell hit disabled the steering gear, and other fragments jammed the hand <b>steering</b> <b>equipment.</b> Emden could only be steered with her propellers.

However, the NTSB found that the second officer, the senior watch officer on the bridge, disengaged the automatic steering mode of the vessel’s integrated navigation system after it put the ship into what the officer felt was an unusually hard turn to port and took manual control of the steering. The second officer turned the wheel first to port and then from port to starboard several times, eventually causing the vessel to list even more, to a maximum angle of about 24° to starboard. The severe listing tumbled passengers, crew members, pool water, and everything else not secured about the decks.|$|R

40|$|Many {{different}} {{technologies are}} used to track {{the movement of the}} sun to both enable concentration of its energy and maximize the yearly energy capture. Their present main limitations are the cost, size, visual impact and wind loading, particularly for applications involving mounting to a building. A parabolic concentrator, for example, along with its <b>steering</b> <b>equipment</b> is heavy and bulky, and is not suitable for rooftop applications. Instead, thin and flat solar concentration devices are required for hassle-free rooftop applications. The use of electrowetting-controlled liquid lenses has emerged as a novel approach for solar tracking and concentration. By steering sunlight using thin electrowetting cell arrays, bulky mechanical equipment is not required. The basic concept of this technology is to change the shape of a liquid interface that is formed by two immiscible fluids of different refractive indices, by simply applying an electric field. An important challenge in electrowetting beam steering devices is the optimization of the design and fabrication process for each of their main constituent components, to maximize optical efficiency. In this paper, we report on the state-of-the-art fabrication methods for electrowetting devices for solar beam steering. We have reviewed the present status of different components types and related fabrication methods, and how they affect the efficiency and performance of such devices. The work identifies future prospects in using electrowetting beam steering devices for solar energy applications.

40|$|Abstract: Five {{eighteenth-century}} medical men, {{like many}} of their contemporaries, achieved renown for their medical skills and research abilities. They lived during an exciting period marked by the questioning of many traditional beliefs. Coeval scientific achievements increased knowledge of the challenging natural world around them. Outside medicine, John Wall (1708 – 1776) established the fashionable spa of Malvern, known for the purity of its water, and co-founded the prestigious Worcester Porcelain Company. Erasmus Darwin (1731 – 1802) had a remarkably inventive mind ranging over many interests, including canal construction, <b>steering</b> <b>equipment</b> for carriages and a copying machine for documents. Edward Jenner (1749 – 1823) was interested in bird migration, and researched the brood parasitism of the cuckoo. His vacci-nation of cowpox to prevent smallpox {{eventually led to the}} elimination of the disease in 1980. Caleb Parry (1755 – 1822) practised medicine in Bath and was admired for his knowledge and integrity. He was interested in sheep and produced high-quality merino wool. Since boyhood he had hunted for fossils with his friend, Edward Jenner. John MacCulloch (1773 – 1835) produced the first geological map of Scotland, published posthumously in 1836. A prolific writer, his book on the Western Isles (1819) is considered a classic. This author’s interest in medical history stemmed partly from her husband’s career as a Warwickshire general practitioner and academic. In addition she developed an interest in the early seventeenth-century doctor, John Hall (1575 – 1635), who lived and worked in Stratford-upon-Avon and married Susanna, elder daughter of William Shakespeare (1564 – 1616). She was working on John Hall’s detailed case notes and became aware that perhaps she had something in common with Susanna and her concern for her husband’s patients. As an intel-ligent, caring woman, Susanna ‘wept with all that wept, yet set herself to chere them up with comforts cordial’.
