25|$|In 2008 {{there were}} 3,208 officially {{registered}} industrial enterprises in Bogor employing 54,268 people, {{more than half}} (32,237) of whom worked at the 114 largest companies. The {{outskirts of the city}} contain about 3,466 hectares of agricultural area, including 111 hectares of water bodies used for fishery and fish farming. The main crops are rice (1165 hectares as of 2007, the annual harvest in 2003 was 9,953 tonnes), various vegetables (772 acres, 8,296 tonnes), corn (382 acres, 6,720 tonnes) and sweet potato (480 acres, 3,480 tonnes). The livestock sector has 25 registered companies (as of 2007) mostly breeding cows (more than 1000 animals yielding more than 2.61 million liters of <b>milk),</b> <b>sheep</b> (about 12,000), chickens (more than 642,000) and ducks (ca. 8,000).|$|E

60|$|On the 6th December, we arose late {{to avoid}} the cold morning air, and at 7 A.M. set out over rough ground, hoping to ascend the Ghauts that day. After {{creeping}} about two miles, the camels, unable to proceed, threw themselves upon the earth, and we unwillingly called a halt at Jiyaf, a basin below the Dobo [10] fiumara. Here, white flocks dotting the hills, and the scavengers of the air warned us {{that we were in}} the vicinity of villages. Our wigwam was soon full of fair-faced Gudabirsi, mostly Loajira [11] or cow-herd boys, who, according to the custom of their class, wore their Tobes bound scarf-like round their necks. They begged us to visit their village, and offered a heifer for each lion shot on Mount Libahlay: unhappily we could not afford time. These youths were followed by men and women bringing <b>milk,</b> <b>sheep,</b> and goats, for which, grass being rare, they asked exorbitant prices,--eighteen cubits of Cutch canvass for a lamb, and two of blue cotton for a bottle of ghee. Amongst them was the first really pretty face seen by me in the Somali country. The head was well formed, and gracefully placed upon a long thin neck and narrow shoulders; the hair, brow, and nose were unexceptionable, there was an arch look in the eyes of jet and pearl, and a suspicion of African protuberance about the lips, which gave the countenance an exceeding naivete. Her skin was a warm, rich nut-brown, an especial charm in these regions, and her movements had that grace which suggests perfect symmetry of limb. The poor girl's costume, a coif for the back hair, a cloth imperfectly covering the bosom, and a petticoat of hides, made no great mystery of forms: equally rude were her ornaments; an armlet and pewter earrings, the work of some blacksmith, a necklace of white porcelain beads, and sundry talismans in cases of tarnished and blackened leather. As a tribute to her prettiness I gave her some cloth, tobacco, and a bit of salt, which was rapidly becoming valuable; her husband stood by, and, although the preference was marked, he displayed neither anger nor jealousy. She showed her gratitude by bringing us milk, and by assisting us to start next morning. In the evening we hired three fresh camels [12] to carry our goods up the ascent, and killed some antelopes which, in a stew, were not contemptible. The End of Time insisted upon firing a gun to frighten away the lions, who make night hideous with their growls, but never put in an appearance.|$|E

East Friesians crossed with the Lacaune breed have been a success in the Wisconsin environment.East Friesians were not introduced into North America until the 1990s, but since then, on account of their high milk yield, they have rapidly become the breed of choice among commercial sheep milk producers, although generally not in purebred form.|$|E

40|$|The optimum {{conditions}} {{for the production of}} coprecipitate from <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> were studied. The best percentage of calcium chloride added to milk was 0. 2 %, which resulted in a recovery of 97. 5 % of milk proteins.

The optimum heating temperature to obtain coprecipitate from <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> was 85 – 95 °C. The functional properties of the <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> coprecipitate were studied. At pH values higher than 6, there were no differences between the solubility of <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> coprecipitate and <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> sodium caseinate, but the solubility of coprecipitate at pH values lower than 5 was relatively higher than those of the caseinate.

The railway was abandoned in favour of the first trucks then the mines became too expensive to operate and they were abandoned in 1930.
