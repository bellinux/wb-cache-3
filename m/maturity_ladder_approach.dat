40|$|This article posits two {{approaches}} to blues tonal space: the networked <b>approach</b> and the <b>laddered</b> <b>approach.</b> The first is underpinned by the cyclical potential of equal temperament and is characterised by descending chromatic motions. The second is underpinned by the harmonic series and is characterised by microtonal shaping of pitch content {{within the framework}} of a ladder that approximates an equally-tempered major minor-seventh chord. 	Having explained the detail of these approaches to tonal space with reference to an early blues recording of Alberta Hunter and Fats Waller, the article goes on to examine Muddy Waters’ use of the <b>laddered</b> <b>approach</b> to tonal space, but also develops novel ways of referencing the networked approach and of finding synergies between networked and <b>laddered</b> <b>approaches.</b> Analysis of key songs from Waters’ repertoire offers insight into the interchange between networked and laddered tonal space in blues music. This interchange holds the major minor-seventh chord to be structurally significant due to the weight afforded by the sonority of the minor third and the affinity between microtonal and semitonal melodic motions...|$|R

This is achieved largely through implementing effective maintenance program(s). However implementing such program(s) is often not straightforward due to lack of a structured decision making framework. This article proposes a generic asset maintenance maturity model as a structured guide to maintenance process maturity. The proposed model aims at assessing the maintenance decision making capabilities within organizations. A weighted maintenance performance assessment score is proposed that facilitates performance measurement and benchmarking.

40|$|Previous {{research}} in organisational sociology {{has focused on}} how organisational forms are evolved, transformed and sustained. This paper continues in this line of enquiry and tests the role of IT in organisational transformation. The transformation of an organisation can be gauged by observing key organisational attributes {{that are likely to}} feature in transformed (new) organisations. Following a review of previous literature, three major factors, that is, business strategy, IT strategy, IT strategic alignment were hypothesised to influence the dimensions of new organisational forms (NOFs). To test this model, data were collected from a survey of 312 Australian businesses. Structural equation modelling was employed to test the research hypotheses. Results from this study uncovered that the level of strategic alignment was significantly associated with the attributes of NOFs. This implies that organisations that have progressed well in the IT-business alignment <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder</b> are likely to change their structure and control mechanisms.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{research on}} project maturity in organisations. The {{purpose is to}} {{develop an understanding of}} what project maturity is and to investigate the level of project maturity in organisations today. The hypothesis is that project maturity develops through a <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder</b> where the ladder steps are proposed to be project management, program management, and portfolio management. Maturity itself is measured along three dimensions. They are knowledge (capability to carry out different tasks), attitudes (willingness to carry them out), and actions (actually doing them). The different dimensions of maturity are further divided into sub-concepts, which should provide a good understanding of the project maturity of an organisation. A questionnaire is developed based on a preliminary understanding of project maturity, and an initial survey has been conducted. The survey gives some support to the ladder construct, and shows that attitudes and knowledge are stronger than the actions taken. Further work on the questionnaire and surveys are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Because {{publicly}} available measures of deposit runoff risk are scarce, regulators’ models to measure {{interest rate risk}} in the banking book are based on very coarse assumptions about the allotment of non-maturity deposits within the regulatory <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder.</b> Using well-established statistical approaches, we address this issue by developing a methodology that considers deposits’ actual behavior {{in terms of both}} price sensitivity to changes in market rates and volume stability over time. Our model extends the current knowledge of public measures of interest rate risk and can be applied to {{publicly available}} data in a manner replicable by those outside of banking institutions. We find that the use of different allotment criteria affects not only the size of the risk indicator but also the nature of banks’ risk exposure, determining the risk inversion phenomenon—that is, banks exposed to an increase in interest rates can experience a reduction in their equity economic value if interest rates decrease. Overall, our results confirm the importance of accurate non-maturity deposits modeling for estimating interest rate risk in the banking book...|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} of demand loans and deposits {{is crucial in}} measuring a bank’s actual exposure to the interest rate risk in the banking book. The repricing gap model, the most popular approach to measure this kind of risk, {{is based on a}} maturity/repricing schedule, according to which interest-sensitive assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions are allotted into different time bands, based on their maturity or time remaining to their next repricing. Due to the possibility for the depositor (borrower) to withdraw (drain) the money without any notice, these accounts should be allotted in the “at sight” time band. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that bank interest rates are characterized by a sluggish and sometimes asymmetric reaction to changes in the market rates. To overcome this limit, we first develop an error correction model to study the interest rate pass-through for the Italian banking system, with specific regard to the retail bank interest rates on the sight deposits and on the overdraft accounts; then, we translate the response dynamic of the interest rates of these two items into coefficients that we use to allot them in the regulatory <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder,</b> thus making the distribution process much more realistic...|$|R

The door closes, and then opens again to let the front of the ladder pass through. At a later time, the back of the ladder passes through the entrance door, which closes and then opens.

This paper aims to diagnose UK’s construction industry to develop a clear understanding about BIM adoption and to form an imperative step of consolidating collective movements towards wider BIM implementation and to provide strategies and recommendations for the UK construction industry for BIM implementation. Through comprehensive literature review, the paper initially establishes BIM maturity concept, which paves {{the way for the}} analysis via qualitative and quantitative methods: interviews are carried out with high profile organisations in Finland to gauge the best practice before combining the results with the analysis of survey questionnaire amongst the major contractors in the UK.

The results (ladders) of these semi-qualitative interviews are coded, aggregated and presented in a set of hierarchical structured value maps. Consumer cognitive structures at different level of experience are reported and discussed. Even if organic products are perceived as difficult to find and expensive, most of consumers judge them positively. All consumers associate organic products to health at different levels of abstraction and want good, tasty and nourishing products, because pleasure and well-being are their most important values. Results show that differences exist between groups of consumer with respect to their frequency of use (experience) of organic products and level of information (expertise) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{changing}} {{banking environment}} {{has led to}} financial innovation {{which has led to}} the development of new financial instruments, some of which are complicated and highly volatile; thus, exposing banks to new or higher risks. This exposure to new risks does not only affect individual banks but the whole banking system (Schoenmaker, 1996). With internationalization, the possibility of contagion has risen as seen from the 1997 Asian financial crisis (Greuning & Bratanovic, 2000). The change in banks' ways of doing business has amplified the necessity for risk management. This research assesses the extent to which South African banks practice risk management techniques in dealing with different types of risks. In this research, questionnaires are used to assess risk management approaches adopted by four South African banks; Standard Bank of South Africa (SBSA), First National Bank (FNB), Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (ABSA) and Nedbank Limited. Furthermore, the research uses accounting ratios and other risk management quantitative techniques such as Gap analysis and <b>Maturity</b> <b>ladder</b> to analyze credit risk, market risk and operational risk. The research found that the banks chosen for this research are to a large extent efficient in all aspects of risk management such as Understanding risk and Risk Management (URM), Risk Identification (RI), Risk Assessment and Analysis (RAA), Risk Monitoring and Control (RMC) and Risk Management Practices (RMP). The research also provides a risk management framework to assist key role players in South African banking industry in establishing policies, standards and practices in risk management The research is of value to those interested in the banking industry, specifically on risk management. It is also the first of its kind in assessing risk management practices on three major types of risks in South African banks.

40|$|Ontologies {{have been}} widely {{accepted}} as the primary method of representing knowledge in the Semantic Web. Knowledge Elicitation (KE) is usually {{one of the first}} steps in building ontologies. A number of ontology editors such as Protégé have been developed to assist users in building ontologies efficiently. However, traditional KE techniques, such as card sorting and laddering, are not yet supported, but performed manually and outside of such tools. In this paper we present a methodology and a corresponding plug-in for Protégé that allows graphical ellicitation knowledge from documents using card sorting and <b>laddering</b> <b>approaches.</b> Our aim is to seamlessly integrate the KE techniques into the ontology building process to make ontology building more efficient and less error-prone. As a side-effect the persistent storage of card sorting and laddering results allows for later traceability of ontology development. KE largely depends on user interaction with the plug-in, therefore we employed user-centred design principles to capture requirements. After implementation, the plug-in was evaluated thoroughly against the requirements. The evaluation shows that this KE plug-in meets many of the user’s expectations and indeed saves them considerable time when building ontologies...|$|R

For the rapidly growing area of ethical clothing, this study explores consumers' desired consumption outcomes and personal values that drive ethical product preferences. Analysis of data obtained through a semi-qualitative <b>laddering</b> <b>approach</b> (n[*]=[*] 98 ethical clothing consumers) reveals five dominant perceptual patterns relating not only to environmental and altruist ethical concerns, but also more individual motives of value for money, personal image, and well-being. Further analysis shows that consumers have to compromise and balance between their conflicting end-goals. The study augments previous findings in ethical clothing research, as researchers can better understand how specific attributes of products relate to the emotional and symbolic aspects and link back to consumer values. Though limited in scope by its exploratory character, the study contributes towards a deeper understanding of ethical consumer behaviour.

An exploratory empirical study uses a hard <b>laddering</b> <b>approach</b> which also allows us to compare the expectations of large and small companies to understand size-effects. The research indicates that complaining companies perceive disruptions of their supplier relationships {{in the context of the}} business network within which they are embedded, especially vis-à-vis the benefits associated with long-term supplier ties. However, these network concerns are more pronounced for large companies. Issues of effective complaint management in business-to-business settings therefore need to be addressed not just as isolated managerial activities with limited benefits for the parties involved, but should be seen as being part of a wider activity set of strategic networking activities with an impact on whole business systems. Thus, the findings enrich the existing limited stock of knowledge on the context of complaint management in business relationships and networks...|$|R

Such an approach greatly increases the number of distance measurements that can be utilized to check for systematic distance errors and the types of estimators that can be compared. Here we compare distances obtained using SN Ia, Cepheids, surface brightness fluctuations, the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch, circumnuclear masers, eclipsing binaries, RR Lyrae stars, and the planetary nebulae luminosity functions. We find no significant discrepancies (differences are < 2 sigma) between distance methods, although differences at the ~ 10 % level cannot yet be ruled out. The potential exists for significant refinement because the data used here are heterogeneous B-band magnitudes that will soon be supplanted by homogeneous, near-IR magnitudes. We illustrate the use of FM distances to 1) revisit the question of the metallicity sensitivity of various estimators, confirming the dependence of SN Ia distances on host galaxy metallicity, and 2) provide an alternative calibration of H_ 0 that replaces the classical <b>ladder</b> <b>approach</b> in the use of extragalactic distance estimators with one that utilizes data over a wide range of distances simultaneously.
