5|$|In April 1934, {{following}} the moving of the Richard Johnson, Clapham and Morris Ltd firm to Trafford Park, the playing grounds were {{offered to the}} Parks Committee of the Manchester Corporation for £2,400. At the time, the ground was described as being fenced all round with iron railings, containing bowling greens, a number of tennis courts and a cricket pitch, together with two well-built pavilions. For many years the land was used for community events including football and funfairs. A cycle speedway track was built during the 1980s. In 2005, a 2.4 m green powder coated weld <b>mesh</b> <b>fence</b> with gates was erected at {{the perimeter of the}} fields. Moston Juniors Football Club secured a lease for the site in 2007, with a view to future development.|$|E

25|$|As of January 2008, {{the number}} of dingoes on the island was {{estimated}} to be 120 to 150, and sightings have become less common. A University of Queensland researcher, Nick Baker, claims the dingoes on Fraser Island have adopted unusual behaviour. Rather than hunt in small packs, Fraser Island dingoes had developed a tolerance for each other and work together in one big hunting pack. Dingo-proof fences, consisting of metals bars across a concrete pit and a 1.8m high <b>mesh</b> <b>fence</b> were built around nine island settlements in 2008, to keep the dingoes out of the townships.|$|E

2500|$|On May 1, 1947, 23-year-old Evelyn McHale {{leapt to}} her death from the 86th floor {{observation}} deck and landed on a limousine parked at the curb. Photography student Robert Wiles took a photo of McHale's oddly intact corpse {{a few minutes after}} her death. The police found a suicide note among possessions that she left on the observation deck: [...] "He is much better off without me.... I wouldn’t make a good wife for anybody". The photo ran in the edition of May 12, 1947 of Life magazine and {{is often referred to as}} [...] "The Most Beautiful Suicide". It was later used by visual artist Andy Warhol in one of his prints entitled Suicide (Fallen Body). A [...] <b>mesh</b> <b>fence</b> was put up around the 86th floor terrace in December 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three-week span in October and November of that year. By then, sixteen people had died from suicide jumps.|$|E
2500|$|Woven {{mesh wire}} is safer but more {{expensive}} than strands of smooth wire. [...] It {{is more difficult to}} install, and has some visibility issues, but horses are less likely to become tangled in it or be injured if they run into it. [...] Adding a top rail of wood or synthetic material increases visibility of the fence and prevents it from being bent by horses reaching over it. [...] A strand of electric fence may also keep horses from pushing on a <b>mesh</b> <b>fence.</b> [...] Mesh fencing needs to be heavy-gauge wire, woven, not welded, and the squares of the mesh should be too small for a horse to put a foot through. [...] "Field fence" [...] or [...] "no-climb" [...] fence are safer designs than more widely woven [...] "sheep fence." [...] Chain link fence is occasionally seen, but horses can bend chain link almost as easily as a thinner-gauge wire, so the additional expense is often not justified by any gain over good-quality woven wire.|$|E

40|$|Conventional fencing methods V-mesh wire, {{square mesh}} wire and wood panels are {{compared}} to experimental methods - 15 wire hightensile wire fences; electric high-tensile wire fences of three designs; baited electric fences; hog panel fences; plastic <b>mesh</b> <b>fences</b> and visqueen wrapped haystacks. Total cost of materials, cost per ft. /yr. and comments concerning estimates of efficacy are discussed. The V-mesh wire, hog panel and plastic <b>mesh</b> <b>fences</b> {{all have a}} very high cost per ft. and cost per ft. /yr. rating and should probably not be used. High-tensile and square <b>mesh</b> wire <b>fences</b> are effective and cheaper alternatives. Modern high-tensile wire electric fences can be an effective alternatives in some situations. Results from tests using visqueen wrapped haystacks and baited electric fences are encouraging and more experimentation is needed. Wood panels should only be used as an emergency game damage prevention method...|$|R

40|$|Fog {{moisture}} on Santa Rosa Island {{plays an}} integral role in its ecosystems. It {{is important to}} understand how fog patterns could potentially effect the flora and fauna. I hypothesized that north facing side of the ridge will have more potential fog moisture due to the predominant wind direction coming from the north. This study used Fog capturing Screens to determine relative amount of fog on the north and south sides of the main ridge of the island. Three locations along the ridge had two Fog Screens placed on the north and south side of the ridge at similar elevations. Fog Screens are 12 gauge 1 ” by 1 ” wire <b>mesh</b> <b>fencing</b> with 40 % shade cloth attached to the <b>mesh</b> <b>fencing.</b> Each Fog Screen is 1 meter long by 0. 5 meter high supported a wooden and metal structure. The amount of moisture collected by a Fog Screen was recorded by a HOBO Rain Gauge Data Logger #RG 3 -M. I found that more moisture was collected on the north facing slopes of the ridge compared to the south facing slopes, supporting my hypothesis. With more moisture on the north facing slope, there is more potential to see wetter local conditions for plants and animals...|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, ShopVille {{became a}} drug-dealing hub, {{due to its}} {{proximity}} to the Autonomen Jugendzentrum Zürich ("Autonomous Youth Center Zürich"). Its low point was reached {{at the end of}} the decade, when travellers avoided all parts of it other than the concourse and the tram stop. Consequently, there were several night-time closures by <b>mesh</b> <b>fences.</b> However, the solution to this problem was foreseeable, as the people had agreed on 29 November 1981 to the construction of the Zürich S-Bahn and the extension of the Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn to the Hauptbahnhof.|$|R
