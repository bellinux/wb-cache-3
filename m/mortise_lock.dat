50|$|The {{cylindrical}} lock {{was invented}} by Walter Schlage in 1923. The bored cylindrical lock arose from {{a need for a}} more cost-effective method of locking doors. The previous norm, the <b>mortise</b> <b>lock,</b> is a more complex device, and its higher manufacturing cost as well as its more labor-intensive installation make the bored cylindrical lock an ideal substitute, both in price and functionality. Because the <b>mortise</b> <b>lock</b> has a larger lock case, a larger and more complex volume must be removed from the door before it can be installed, but the <b>mortise</b> <b>lock</b> may offer additional functions compared to a cylindrical lock; for instance, the <b>mortise</b> <b>lock</b> may include a deadbolt in a single unit, while the cylindrical lock would require separate face bores for a deadbolt and doorknob. The 1923 patent evolved from an earlier Schlage patent filed in 1920 for a lock whose installation required a face bore and surface rabbet, which simplified door preparation compared to a <b>mortise</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although the {{installation}} of a <b>mortise</b> <b>lock</b> actually weakens {{the structure of the}} typical timber door, it is stronger and more versatile than a bored cylindrical lock, both in external trim, and functionality. Whereas the latter mechanism lacks the architecture required for ornate and solid-cast knobs and levers, the <b>mortise</b> <b>lock</b> can accommodate a heavier return spring and a more solid internal mechanism, making its use possible. Furthermore, a <b>mortise</b> <b>lock</b> typically accepts a wide range of other manufacturers' cylinders and accessories, allowing architectural conformity with lock hardware already on site.|$|E
50|$|Eli Whitney Blake, Sr. (January 27, 1795 - August 18, 1886) was an American inventor, {{best known}} for his <b>mortise</b> <b>lock</b> and stone-crushing machine, the latter of which earned him a place into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.|$|E
50|$|They {{produce a}} range of {{residential}} lock products, including tubular locks, key locking hardware sets, electronic keyless <b>locks,</b> deadbolts, and <b>Mortise</b> <b>locks.</b> They also provide cabinet and drawer pulls for interior spaces like Kitchen cabinets and bathroom cabinets.|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the most}} common {{manufacturers}} of <b>mortise</b> <b>locks</b> in the United States are Accurate, Arrow, Baldwin, Best, Corbin Russwin, Emtek Products, Inc, Falcon, Penn, Schlage, Sargent and Yale Town & Lock. Also, many European manufacturers whose products had been restricted to [...] "designer" [...] installations have recently gained wider acceptance and use.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mortise</b> <b>locks</b> {{may include}} a {{non-locking}} sprung latch {{operated by a}} door handle. Such a lock is termed a sash lock. A simpler form without a handle or latch is termed a 'dead lock'. Dead locks are commonly used as a secure backup to a sprung non-deadlocking latch, usually a pin tumbler rim lock.|$|R

50|$|The {{installation}} of a <b>mortise</b> <b>lock</b> can be undertaken by the average homeowner with a working knowledge of basic woodworking tools and methods. Many installation specialists use a mortising jig which makes precise cutting of the pocket a simple operation, but the subsequent {{installation of}} the external trim can still prove problematic if the installer is inexperienced.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mortise</b> <b>lock</b> (mortice lock in British English) is a lock that {{requires}} a pocket—the mortise—to be cut into the door or piece of furniture into which the lock is to be fitted. In {{most parts of the}} world, mortise locks are found on older buildings constructed before the advent of bored cylindrical locks, but they have recently become more common in commercial and upmarket residential construction in the United States. They are widely used in domestic properties of all ages in Europe.|$|E
50|$|All {{the doors}} are 1 ¾” solid core wood doors. The entry door is {{supported}} with a <b>mortised</b> <b>lock</b> hardware system, which provide much higher quality and security to the locking exterior door. Instead of doorways that enter right on to the hallway, most units have a small recessed entry alcove for added privacy and security.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mortise</b> <b>locks</b> have historically, {{and still}} {{commonly}} do, use lever locks as a mechanism. Older locks {{may have used}} warded locks. This {{has led to a}} popular confusion between the two; the term 'mortice lock' is widely known and used, but usually in reference to lever keys. In recent years the Euro cylinder lock has become common, using a pin tumbler lock in a mortice housing.|$|R
50|$|The guns {{broke down}} easily in combat, {{especially}} in the wood of the stock around the <b>lock</b> <b>mortise.</b> The <b>lock</b> mechanism and breech were larger than the stock could withstand with rough use. All surviving military Fergusons feature a horseshoe-shaped iron repair under the lock to hold the stock together where it repeatedly broke around the weak, over-drilled out mortise.|$|R
50|$|Interchangeable cores can be {{extracted}} from one lock type (bored cylindrical lock, <b>mortise</b> <b>lock,</b> padlock and so forth) and then installed into another without requiring the removal or disassembly of any single component. These units are readily adapted for master keying systems {{and can be}} set up with spare cores and keys for quick replacement when security is compromised, such as when a key is lost or stolen or when a personnel change takes place. Extracted cores can then be recombinated without urgency and placed back into maintenance storage for future use.|$|E
50|$|Leaving {{employment}} with Western Electric Company in 1920, Schlage {{opened a}} shop in San Francisco in the present-day financial district. The Schlage Lock Company was incorporated with a starting capital of $30. In the same year, {{he applied for}} a patent for a lock that could be drilled into a door with only two holes. This new cylindrical lock had a single plate, serving as both escutcheon and striker plate, wrapping around the door's edge. It was mostly used on interior doors, where it replaced the older <b>Mortise</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
50|$|The parts {{included}} in the typical US <b>mortise</b> <b>lock</b> installation are the lock body (the part installed inside the mortise cut-out in the door); the lock trim (which may be selected from any number of designs of doorknobs, levers, handle sets and pulls); a strike plate, or a box keep, which lines {{the hole in the}} frame into which the bolt fits; and the keyed cylinder which operates the locking/unlocking function of the lock body. However, in the United Kingdom, and most other countries, mortise locks on dwellings do not use cylinders, but have lever mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|By 1878, Yale Lock had {{purchased}} Shepardson's company, The United States Lock Company, {{as well as}} Felter's American Lock Manufacturing Company. For the next 35 years, production of wafer tumbler locks languished in the U. S. And while Felter and Shepardson had designed their wafer tumbler locks {{for a variety of}} applications such as drawer and desk locks as well as padlocks and door locks, the wafer tumbler locks made during this era were mainly used for doors in <b>mortise</b> <b>locks</b> and night-latches.|$|R
2500|$|In Europe one of {{the oldest}} DIN {{standard}} applies: DIN 107 [...] "Building construction; identification of right and left side" [...] (first 1922-05, current 1974-04) defines that doors are categorized from the side where the door hinges can be seen. If the hinges are on the left, it is a DIN Left door (DIN links, DIN gauche), if the hinges are on the right, it is a DIN Right door (DIN rechts, DIN droite). The DIN Right and DIN Left marking are also used to categorize matching installation material such as <b>mortise</b> <b>locks</b> (referenced in DIN 107). The European Standard DIN EN 12519 [...] "Windows and pedestrian doors. Terminology" [...] includes these definitions of orientation.|$|R
50|$|Electric <b>mortise</b> and {{cylindrical}} <b>locks</b> are drop-in {{replacements for}} door-mounted mechanical locks. An additional hole must be drilled {{in the door}} for electric power wires. Also, a power transfer hinge {{is often used to}} get the power from the door frame to the door. Electric <b>mortise</b> and cylindrical <b>locks</b> allow mechanical free egress, and can be either fail unlocked or fail locked. In the US, UL rated doors must retain their rating: in new construction doors are cored and then rated. but in retrofits, the doors must be re-rated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the wafer tumbler lock in the United States is the patent in 1868 by Philo Felter. Manufactured in Cazenovia, New York, it used a flat double-bitted key. Felter's lock was patented only three years after Linus Yale, Jr. received a patent for his revolutionary pin tumbler <b>mortise</b> <b>lock,</b> {{considered to be the}} first pin tumbler lock of the modern era. That lock featured a flat steel key, referred to as a [...] "feather key" [...] because of the marked contrast with the heavy bit keys of the day. Just two years later, Hiram S. Shepardson produced a different type of wafer tumbler lock, which used a single-bitted flat steel key, similar to Yale's feather key.|$|E
5000|$|Schlage's first {{shop was}} at 229 Minna Street, {{and he moved}} to 461 Bush Street, where many of his key patents were developed. The first factory (in 1923) was at 49 Shotwell Street. Because the bored {{cylindrical}} lock had a decided ease of installation advantage over the contemporary <b>mortise</b> <b>lock,</b> demand for the Schlage-designed lock rose and the company would purchase land in Visitacion Valley in 1925, which would eventually become the company's Bayshore factory and administration complex. Eight buildings were eventually erected at the Bayshore complex, the first two of which (the Old Office and Plant 1) were dedicated in a ceremony on June 25, 1926 attended by dignitaries including Mayor James [...] "Sunny Jim" [...] Rolph.|$|E
60|$|She felt {{over the}} wall with both hands, wildly and clumsily, for the button which {{she had seen the}} doctor press when he was showing the room to the visitors. Twice she missed it. The third time her eyes helped her hands; she found the button and pressed on it. The <b>mortise</b> of the <b>lock</b> inside fell back, and the door yielded to her.|$|R
60|$|It was plainly {{useless to}} call her back. Anne's first impulse when she was alone again was to secure the door. She not only locked it, but bolted it at top and bottom. The <b>mortise</b> of the <b>lock</b> and the staples of the bolts, when she tried them, were firm. The lurking treachery--wherever else it might be--was not in the {{fastenings}} of the door.|$|R
5000|$|The Schlage Manufacturing Company {{was founded}} by {{inventor}} Walter Schlage in 1920 {{with the help of}} three businessmen who each contributed $10 to become equal partners. Walter Schlage had already secured several patents dating back to 1909, when he patented a doorknob that would also complete an electrical circuit so that, for instance, the lights would turn on when the door was opened. However, Schlage's key invention was the bored cylindrical lock, which evolved through several iterations, including a 1917 filing for a <b>mortise</b> mechanism which <b>locked</b> when the knob was tilted; two filings in 1920 (in April for a lock requiring one hole and a surface rabbet rather than a complex mortise pocket and October for a <b>mortise</b> with the <b>lock</b> mechanism activated by a button coaxial to the knob). This series would ultimately culminate in , filed in 1923, which was sold commercially as the Schlage [...] "A" [...] series lock. Schlage would later make a 1925 filing for a push button cylindrical lock fusing the two 1920 patents with the 1923 patent.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new joining by forming process for fixing {{longitudinally}} in position two metal sheets (or plates) perpendicular to one another, at room temperature. The proposed process employs a counterbored {{variant of the}} ‘mortise-and-tenon’ joint that eliminates the protrusion of the tenon beyond the <b>mortise</b> after mechanical <b>locking</b> by plastic deformation. The presentation draws from the workability limits and material stress-strain characterization to validation by joining and destructive pull-out testing. Results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} new proposed process for producing flat joint surfaces, which are advantageous over typical ‘mortise-and-tenon’ protruded surfaces in most applications. info:eu-repo/semantics/acceptedVersio...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{ladies and}} gentlemen," [...] he proceeded, [...] "that my patient {{has just come}} in. His mind is one mass of nervous fancies and caprices, which his friends (with the best {{possible}} intentions) have been ignorantly irritating at home. They have been afraid of him, for instance, at night. They have forced him to have somebody {{to sleep in the}} room with him, or they have forbidden him, in case of accidents, to lock his door. He comes to me the first night, and says: 'Mind, I won't have anybody in my room!'--'Certainly not!'--'I insist on locking my door.'--'By all means!' In he goes, and locks his door; and there he is, soothed and quieted, predisposed to confidence, predisposed to sleep, by having his own way. 'This is all very well,' you may say; 'but suppose something happens, suppose he has a fit in the night, what then?' You shall see! Hallo, my young friend!" [...] cried the doctor, suddenly addressing the sleepy little boy. [...] "Let's have a game. You shall be the poor sick man, and I'll be the good doctor. Go into that room and lock the door. There's a brave boy! Have you locked it? Very good! Do you think I can't get at you if I like? I wait till you're asleep--I press this little white button, hidden here in the stencilled pattern of the outer wall--the <b>mortise</b> of the <b>lock</b> inside falls back silently against the door-post--and I walk into the room whenever I like. The same plan is pursued with the window. My capricious patient won't open it at night, when he ought. I humor him again. 'Shut it, dear sir, by all means!' As soon as he is asleep, I pull the black handle hidden here, {{in the corner of the}} wall. The window of the room inside noiselessly opens, as you see. Say the patient's caprice is the other way--he persists in opening the window when he ought to shut it. Let him! by all means, let him! I pull a second handle when he is snug in his bed, and the window noiselessly closes in a moment. Nothing to irritate him, ladies and gentlemen--absolutely nothing to irritate him! But I haven't done with him yet. Epidemic disease, in spite of all my precautions, may enter this Sanitarium, and may render the purifying of the sick-room necessary. Or the patient's case may be complicated by other than nervous malady--say, for instance, asthmatic difficulty of breathing. In the one case, fumigation is necessary; in the other, additional oxygen in the air will give relief. The epidemic nervous patient says, 'I won't be smoked under my own nose!' The asthmatic nervous patient gasps with terror at the idea of a chemical explosion in his room. I noiselessly fumigate one of them; I noiselessly oxygenize the other, by means of a simple Apparatus fixed outside in the corner here. It is protected by this wooden casing; it is locked with my own key; and it communicates by means of a tube with the interior of the room. Look at it!" ...|$|R
