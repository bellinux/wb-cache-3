5|$|The {{walk back}} to Bear Valley was very slow; at one point, Reed sent ahead {{two of the men}} to {{retrieve}} the first cache of food, expecting the third relief to come at any <b>moment,</b> <b>a</b> small party led by Selim E. Woodworth. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner's feet were badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to get up and move, not having eaten for days. The relief party {{had no choice but to}} leave without them.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Morgan Lawley, was released through Black's YouTube channel on July 18, 2011, and a behind-the-scenes video was uploaded the day after. The video opens with Black in a studio, finishing the song recording with a studio band; guitarist Kellen McGee, bassist Jeremy Steel, and keyboardist Jourdan Steel. The video intercuts {{scenes of the}} studio with footage of Black making TV appearances, walking on red carpets, driving around Hollywood and greeting fans. Next, the singer is seen on a makeup chair and rehearsing several dance steps. She then starts the full choreography with So You Think You Can Dance finalists Robert Roldan and Kent Boyd. So You Think You Can Dances Allison Holker and Lauren Gottlieb also appear in the dance sections of the video. The video ends with Black at the premiere of My <b>Moment,</b> <b>a</b> fictional film about her.|$|E
5|$|When the {{battered}} fleet returned to Venice, {{news of the}} defeat spread throughout the city to mixed reactions. Though some were willing to forgive the defeat considering the circumstances, many others needed someone {{to blame for the}} loss that was considerable not only in human and material terms, but also symbolically. The people of Venice had been humiliated by an upstart nation with practically no naval experience. Though Guiscard would die the next year and the Norman threat would quickly disappear, a scapegoat was needed at that <b>moment.</b> <b>A</b> faction of influential Venetians, possibly led by Vitale Faliero based on later writings, led a popular revolt to depose Selvo, and in December 1084 they succeeded. Selvo apparently did not make a great effort to defend himself and was sent off to a monastery. He died three years later in 1087, and was buried in the loggiato of St. Mark's Basilica.|$|E
50|$|The overall dipole <b>moment</b> of <b>a</b> {{molecule}} may be approximated as a {{vector sum}} of bond dipole <b>moments.</b> <b>As</b> a vector sum {{it depends on}} the relative orientation of the bonds, so that from the dipole moment information can be deduced about the molecular geometry.|$|R

25|$|The Hafsid dynasty (1230–1574) succeeded Almohad rule in Ifriqiya, {{with the}} Hafsids {{claiming}} {{to represent the}} true spiritual heritage of its founder, the Mahdi Ibn Tumart (c. 1077 – 1130).

25|$|Analog meters {{are also}} useful where {{the trend of}} a {{measurement}} {{is more important than}} an exact value obtained at a particular <b>moment.</b> <b>A</b> change in angle or in a proportion is easier to interpret than a change in a digital readout. For this reason, digital multimeters often approximate this with a bargraph (typically with a more rapid reading response than the primary readout); the most effective of these are arranged in an arc, to simulate the pointer of an analog meter.|$|E
