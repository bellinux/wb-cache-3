50|$|In 1969 Paetsch invented defibrillators and {{temperature}} control devices for truck refrigeration. He also sold {{mutual funds and}} water conditioners. As {{president and general manager}} of the firm American Instrumentation Corporation he developed and produced scientific test instruments that were to be used in supersensitive temperature and humidity control devices. These included gun detection devices and new concepts for burglar alarm and fire alarm systems. In cooperation with the Federal grassland studies, he developed a plant growth chamber for photosynthesis measurements, together with an automatic solid state multi-channel gas separator to study gas emissions from plants under natural, yet precisely controlled conditions. Among other biological and physiological instruments ready for production was the first solid state laboratory stimulator to study nerve potentials and intercellular potentials of cardiac cells for physiological research, pacemakers for heart stimulators, cardiac defibrillators and micro electrode pullers for making both glass micro-electrodes with points from 1 to 3 microns and <b>micro-glass</b> tips for embryo-logical research.|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} modified with fillers {{have been}} explored extensively {{to understand their}} behavior under various loading conditions such as quasi-static, fatigue, and impact. However, the study of repeated impact behavior of nano/micro-modified composite materials is relatively limited. In this work, the effect of <b>micro-glass</b> bubble concentration on impact resistance of glass-fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites subjected to repeated impacts was studied. Three impact energy levels {{with a minimum of}} four specimens per case were experimentally tested. Each sample was subjected to 40 repeated impacts or up to perforation. The impact response was evaluated in terms of evolution of the peak force, bending stiffness, visual damage evolution observations and optical transmission imaging at critical stages as a function of number of impacts. Also, Damage Degree (DD) was calculated to monitor the damage evolution process in the laminates. As expected, impact response of GFRP composites varied based on the presence of <b>micro-glass</b> bubbles and the applied impact energy. The presence of <b>micro-glass</b> bubbles introduces novel phenomena that change the damage progression under repetitive impacts and was verified by our visual and thermography images. A better understanding of these phenomena (crack-bridging, tortuosity) and their contribution to both enhancements in impact behavior and type of damage propagation can lead to better design of novel structural composite...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} an experimental procedure for constructing integrated lipid, carbohydrate, and protein microarrays. In essence, it prints liposomes on nitrocellulose-coated <b>micro-glass</b> slides, a biochip substrate for spotting protein and carbohydrate microarrays, and the substances that can form liposomes (homo-liposomes) {{or can be}} incorporated into liposomes (hetero-liposomes) are suitable for microarray construction using existing microarray spotting devices. Importantly, this technology allows simultaneous detection of serum antibody activities among the three major classes of antigens, i. e., lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins. The potential of this technology is illustrated by its use in revealing a broad-spectrum of pre-existing anti-lipid antibodies in blood circulation and monitoring the epitope spreading of autoantibody reactivities among protein, carbohydrate, and lipid antigens in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMEMS-based microgrippers with {{integrated}} {{force sensor}} have proved their efficiency to perform dexterous micromanipulation tasks through gripping forces sensing and control. For force control, knowledge based models are more relevant and gives better physical significance than {{the use of}} black box models. However this approach is often limited by many problems commonly encountered in the MEMS (micro electromechanical systems) structures such as: complex architectures, nonlinear behaviors and parameters uncertainties due to fabrication process at the micrometer scale. For these reasons theoretical approaches must be compared with experiments. This paper describes a modelling approach of a MEMS-based microgripper with integrated force sensor while handling <b>micro-glass</b> balls of 80 μm diameter. Therefore, a state space representation is developed to couple both {{the dynamics of the}} actuation and sensing subsystems of the gripper through the stiffness of the manipulated object. A knowledge based model is obtained for small displacements {{at the tip of the}} gripper arms (small gripping forces) and is compared with experimental approaches. Good agreements are observed allowing interesting perspectives for the control...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMicrogrippers with {{integrated}} force sensors {{are very}} efficient tools for dexterous manipulation {{of objects in}} the microworld (size less than 100 µm). In this paper, we first propose a modeling approach of a nonlinear electrostatic microgripper with integrated force sensor while handling calibrated <b>micro-glass</b> balls of 80 µm diameter. Limit of the linear operating range of the microgripper is investigated and a nonlinear model is proposed and validated experimentally for large displacements. We then propose the design of an optimal force feedback controller to ensure reliable handling operations with appropriate gripping forces. To overcome the limitation caused by the {{low signal to noise}} ratio provided by the sensor, a Kalman filter is used to estimate the states of the process from noise measurements. The control law is implemented and validated using real time experiments for 10 µN gripping force reference with a noise level (peak-to-peak magnitude of the noise) reaching 8 µN in the worst case. The effectiveness of the optimal filter is proven by comparison with external interferometric measurements...|$|E
40|$|Light {{optical and}} {{scanning}} electron microscope studies were conducted to characterize the erosion resistance of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polycarbonate (PC), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and ultra-high-molecular-weight-polyethylene (UHMWPE). Erosion {{was caused by a}} jet of spherical <b>micro-glass</b> beads at normal impact. During the initial stages of damage, the surfaces of these materials were studied using a profilometer. Material buildup above the original surface was observed on PC and PMMA. As erosion progressed, this buildup disappeared as the pit became deeper. Little or no buildup was observed on PTFE and on UHMWPE. UHMWPE and PTFE are the most resistant materials and PMMA the least. Favorable properties for high erosion resistance seem to be high values of ultimate elongation, and strain energy and a low value of the modulus of elasticity. Erosion-rate-versus-time curves of PC and PTFE exhibit incubation, acceleration and steady state periods. A continuously increasing erosion rate period was observed however for PMMA instead of a steady state period. At early stages of damage and at low impact pressure material removal mechanisms appear to be similar to those for metallic materials...|$|E
40|$|Leukocyte-endothelial {{interactions}} are early and critical events in acute and chronic inflammation and can, when dysregulated, mediate tissue injury leading to permanent pathological damage. Existing conventional assays allow {{the analysis of}} leukocyte adhesion molecules only after the extraction of leukocytes from the blood. This requires the blood to undergo several steps before peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) can be ready for analysis, which in turn can stimulate PBLs influencing the research findings. The autoperfused micro flow chamber assay, however, allows scientists to study early leukocytes functional dysregulation using the systemic flow of a live mouse while having the freedom of manipulating a coated chamber. Through a disease model, the functional expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules can be assessed and quantified in a <b>micro-glass</b> chamber coated with immobilized endothelial adhesion molecules ex vivo. In this model, the blood flows between the right common carotid artery and left external jugular vein of a live mouse under anesthesia, allowing the interaction of native PBLs in the chamber. Real-time experimental analysis is achieved {{with the assistance of}} an intravital microscope as well as a Harvard Apparatus pressure device. The application of a flow regulator at the input point of the glass chamber allows comparable physiological flow conditions amongs...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} (oil) mists from air streams is {{important}} in many industrial applications, such as machining and cutting operations, engine closed crankcase ventilation, and compressed gas cleaning. Filters {{are by far the}} most efficient device for removing such particles, however, the filtration of liquid aerosol particles differs so greatly from dust filtration that it is almost a field in itself, and there remain many questions which have not been fully resolved. This is predominantly due to the ability of the (liquid) aerosol particles to coalesce into droplets (and often liquid columns) within the filter, and then drain from or flow through the filter, under the influence of airflow and gravitational forces. This work details the development of a capillary-based model for the prediction of saturation in (oil) mist filters. Experiments were conducted to determine steady-state saturation and pressure drop values in commonly used oleophillic <b>micro-glass</b> fibre media, using a range of different combinations of face velocity and number of layers of media within the filter element. A novel capillary-based model was developed and fitted to experimental data, {{with the aid of a}} genetic algorithm. The model predicts filter equilibrium saturation, if the fibre diameter, packing density, and pressure drop across the filter are known. The model showed a very good agreement with experimental data, when a small correction factor was added to the model...|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{electronics}} are {{the next}} generation of sensors for mobile health and implantation. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an emergent strategy for pre-clinical drug development and toxicity testing. To address the confounding effects from sedation of fish and removal from the aquatic habitat for micro-electrocardiogram (µECG) measurements, we developed waterproof and wearable sensors to uncover the circadian variation in heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) (Massin et al., 2000). The parylene-C based ECG sensor consisted of an ultra-soft silicone integrated jacket designed to wrap around the fish during swimming. The Young’s modulus of this silicone jacket matched with the fish surface, and an extended parylene cable connected the underwater chest electrodes with the out-of water electronics. In addition, embedded <b>micro-glass</b> spheres in the silicone effectively reduced the effective density of the jacket to ~ 1 g cm^(− 3). These innovations enabled physiological ECG telemetry in the fish’s natural habitat without the need for sedation. Furthermore, a set of non-linear signal processing techniques filtered out the breathing and electromagnetic artifacts from the recorded signals. We observed a reduction in mean HR and an increase in HRV over 24 h at 10 dpa, accompanied by QT prolongation as well as diurnal variations, followed by normalization in mean HR and QT intervals at 26 days post ventricular amputation (dpa). We revealed Amiodarone-mediated QTc prolongation, HR reduction and HRV increase otherwise masked by sedation. The novel features of the flexible silicon jacket for µECG telemetry unraveled the biological clock and normalization of QT intervals at 26 dpa, providing the first evidence of new physiological phenomena during cardiac injury and repair as well as cardiac drug-mediated aberrant rhythms. Thus, the light weight and waterproof design holds promise to advance {{the next generation}} of mobile health and drug discovery...|$|E
40|$|Isomers of {{conjugated}} {{linoleic acid}} from 7 t 9 c through 12 t 14 t can be induced by thermal treatment of triacylglycerol samples of 9 c 11 t or 10 t 12 c fatty acids in glass tubes. The formation of {{conjugated linoleic acid}}s (CLAs) has been observed during thermal induction of the above-mentioned triacylglycerols at 250, 280 and 320 A degrees C. The concentrations of isomers formed in the mixture varied depending on the temperature and duration of the heating experiments. The objective {{of this study was}} to find a suitable thermal induction temperature and time that can produce most of the isomers of CLAs from the above-mentioned triacylglycerols. Such a mixture would give researchers a reference standard that can be used in the identification of CLAs in GC analyses of relevant samples. Fifteen-microlitre portions of the triacylglycerol samples containing 9 c 11 t/ 10 t 12 c fatty acid were placed in <b>micro-glass</b> ampoules, sealed under nitrogen and then subjected to thermal treatment. The glass ampoules were removed at regular time intervals, cut open, and part of the samples was analysed by infrared spectroscopy using attenuated internal reflectance technique. The remainder of the samples was subjected to derivatisation into their methyl esters. The methyl esters of the isomerised fatty acids were then analysed by gas chromatography after appropriate dilution in heptane. The results show that the thermally induced glyceride samples of 9 c 11 t/ 10 t 12 c fatty acids gave CLA profiles containing isomers ranging from 7 t 9 c to 12 t 14 t. However, the concentrations of the isomers are different depending on the duration of the thermal induction. It appears that [1, 5] sigmatropic rearrangements and positional isomerisations take place in the heated mixtures.

40|$|Hemodynamic {{shear stress}} is intimately linked with endothelial {{metabolic}} effects, regulating key mechanisms in endothelial function, homeostasis, and repair. In-vivo modulation of shear stress signaling pathways in the zebrafish model allows for identification of mechanisms with potential therapeutic implications. The following studies combine in-vivo zebrafish models with in-vitro shear stress studies {{to characterize the}} mechanisms whereby shear stress regulates vascular development and repair. 	We investigated shear stress-modulated genes via microarray, and identified Angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2), a well known regulator of angiogenesis and vascular development, as a potential target for further mechanistic study. Oscillatory shear stress (OSS) induced Ang- 2 mRNA expression in a Wnt-signaling dependent manner. Inhibition of Wnt signaling or Ang- 2 expression supressed endothelial cell migration and tube formation, which were rescued by human recombinant Ang- 2 treatment. These results were recapitulated in the embryonic zebrafish model using heat-shock inducible transgenic Tg(hsp 70 l:dkk 1 -GFP) and Tg(kdrl:GFP) embryos injected with Ang- 2 morpholino. Inhibition of Wnt signaling with IWR- 1 also impaired vascular repair after tail amputation, which was rescued by injection of zAng- 2 mRNA. Taken together, this data demonstrated shear stress activated Ang- 2 via canonical Wnt signaling in vascular endothelial cells, and recapitulated shear stress-Wnt-Ang- 2 signaling vascular repair in the zebrafish model. 	Shear stress-modulated gene- and protein-based mechanisms result in significant changes at the metabolomic level. In {{the second part of}} my thesis, we examined the role of emerging mechano-sensitive metabolic pathways in vascular repair. Metabolomic analysis revealed both pulsatile shear stress (PSS) and OSS significantly increased endothelial glycolytic metabolites, but decreased gluconeogenic metabolites. Additionally, both OSS and PSS up-regulated the expression of PKCɛ. We therefore tested whether shear stress modulates endothelial metabolomics to promote vascular repair via PKCɛ-mediated glycolytic metabolites. Treatment with pro-glyocolytic metabolites in-vitro rescued tube formation following treatment with siPKCɛ. To recapitulate vascular repair in transgenic Tg(flk 1 :GFP) zebrafish embryos, we decreased viscosity and fluid shear stress by micro-injection of GATA- 1 a morpholino oligonucleotide (MO). In the zebrafish tail amputation model, GATA- 1 a MO impaired and delayed vascular repair. Co-injection of PKCɛ mRNA with GATA- 1 a MO rescued this phenomenon. Injection of epo mRNA to increase viscosity resulted in enhanced tail repair. Overall, our studies revealed that shear responsive VEGFR- PKCɛ-metabolomic signaling modulates glycolytic metabolites to influence vascular repair. Mitochondria are the metabolic center of the cell, and mitochondrial state is intimately linked to endothelial function. To further investigate the effect of shear stress on endothelial metabolic function, we examined the effect of physiological pulsatile shear stress (PSS) on mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and the role of Mn-SOD expression on ΔΨm. PSS induced a dynamic increase in ΔΨm, while silencing Mn-SOD attenuated PSS-mediated ΔΨm increase. Mn-SOD mimetic MnTMPyP increased ΔΨm to the similar extent as induced by PSS. Our findings suggest that PSS modulates mitochondrial function by increasing mitochondrial ΔΨm, in part, via Mn-SOD up-regulation. In addition to using the embryonic zebrafish model to investigate vascular repair, we worked to develop technologies enabling the use of the adult zebrafish as a model for genetic and chemically-induced cardiomyopathies. To address the confounding effects from sedation of fish and removal from the aquatic habitat for micro-electrocardiogram (?ECG) measurements, we developed waterproof and wearable flexible electronic sensors to uncover the circadian variation in heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV).
