2500|$|During a 1995 Ryder Cup match, Tom Lehman was {{critical}} of Faldo for not clearly telling him to pick his ball up {{when it was a}} foot away from the hole. Lehman said: [...] "Faldo <b>mumbled</b> <b>something,</b> then made a gesture to me." [...] This angered the American who said: [...] "I told him to speak clearly. He stretched his arms out as if to say, 'Put the ball in your pocket, you idiot.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly {{was to be}} hanged on 11 November 1880 at the Melbourne Gaol. Earlier that day, Mr. Castieau, the {{governor}} of the gaol, informed the condemned man that the hour of execution had been fixed at ten o'clock. Kelly's leg-irons were removed, and after a short time he was marched out. He was submissive on the way, and when passing the gaol's flower beds, he remarked [...] "what a nice little garden", but said nothing further until reaching the Press room, where he remained until the arrival of chaplain Dean Donaghy. Accounts differ about Kelly's last words. Some newspaper reporters wrote that his last words were [...] "Such is life", while other newspapers recorded that this was his response when the warden told him of the intended hour of his execution, earlier that day. The Argus wrote that Kelly's last words were, [...] "Ah, well, I suppose it has come to this", as the rope was placed round his neck. According to another account, Kelly intended to make a speech, but [...] "made no audible sound." [...] The warden later wrote that Kelly, when prompted to say his last words, <b>mumbled</b> <b>something</b> that was too quiet to discern.|$|E
2500|$|According to the investigations, Oswald hid {{and covered}} the rifle with boxes after the attack and descended through the rear stairwell. About 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Oswald {{encountered}} police officer Marrion L. Baker, who had his gun drawn, [...] in the second-floor lunchroom. The patrolman was accompanied by Oswald's supervisor, Roy Truly. Baker let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald {{did not appear to}} be [...] "nervous" [...] or [...] "out of breath." [...] Truly said that Oswald look [...] "startled" [...] when Baker pointed his gun directly at him. Mrs. Robert Reid—a clerical supervisor at the depository who returned to her office within two minutes after the shooting—said that she saw Oswald [...] "was very calm" [...] on the second floor with a coke in his hands. As they walked past each other, Mrs. Reid said to Oswald, [...] "The President has been shot" [...] to which he <b>mumbled</b> <b>something</b> in response, but Reid did not understand him. Oswald was believed to have left the depository through the front entrance just before police sealed it off. Truly later pointed out to officers that Oswald was the only employee that he was certain was missing.|$|E

60|$|One side, {{close to}} the door, was {{occupied}} by a lean, withered old man, very shabbily dressed in black, who sat eternally <b>mumbling</b> <b>something</b> between his toothless jaws.

"But don't {{tell him}} my name all at once, Duchess darling," [...] she whispered entreatingly; [...] "let him {{fall in love}} with me without knowing that I am his affianced bride--for that might {{prejudice}} him against me.

50|$|One day she {{discovered}} her old friend Elliott {{on his knees}} {{in the middle of}} a grocery store aisle.

At first Elliott would not explain what had happened to him in the grocery store; he eventually invited her into his circle of friends and into the world of Edannair.|$|R

'I {{was just}} going to have told my uncle I was good for nothing to-day, when I heard old Johns <b>mumbling</b> <b>something</b> to him about Mr. More being unwell, and looking up, I saw that cold grey eye {{twinkling}} at me, as much as to say he was proud to see how soon an Irishman could be beaten. So what could I do but give him look for look, and go on with eight and seven, and five and two, as unconcerned as he was.' ...|$|R
60|$|But as {{the junior}} mates were hurrying {{to execute the}} order, a pale man, with a bandaged head, arrested them--Radney the chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but <b>mumbling</b> <b>something</b> about his being {{willing and able to}} do what the captain dared not attempt, he {{snatched}} the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.|$|R

His legs from his knees down bore huge lumps so sore to the touch that Ken winced even at gentle rubbing. But he did not mind the pain. All the darkness seemed to have blown away from his mind.|$|R

Belknap appeared visibly upset or ill, <b>mumbling</b> <b>something</b> about protecting his wives' honor and beseeching Grant to accept his resignation [...] "at once."

500|$|After she {{graduated}} from high school, Sanders left her foster parents' home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy's alma mater. She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood {{at the train station}} crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to <b>mumble</b> <b>something,</b> but the words would not come out.

40|$|One {{quality that}} makes {{biological}} systems appear intelligent is their robustness to difficult circumstances. Robustness {{is crucial to}} intelligent behavior and important to AI research. We distinguish between antefailure and post-failure robustness for causal tasks. Ante-failure robust systems resist failure, whereas post-failure systems incorporate the ability to recover from failure once it happens. We point out the power of post-failure robustness in AI problems, closely examining one example in visual motion tracking. Finally, we raise theoretical issues and argue for greater effort towards building post-failure robust systems. Introduction How {{many of us have}} heard, "What happens if I do [...] . this?" usually accompanied by a mischievous grin and some flick of the wrist intended to wreak havoc on an otherwise "perfect" system? The ensuing moment involves us manually reinitializing a crashed system, while we <b>mumble</b> <b>something</b> about how the theory assumes that certain situations will n [...] ...|$|R
