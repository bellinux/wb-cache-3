5|$|Because he had wrongly {{described}} significant evidence (including {{the car and}} DeSimone's clothes), {{police had}} dismissed his statement, filing it along with six other confessions to the crime. Hodgson's legal team was never <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of its existence.|$|E
5|$|Lothringen {{was present}} during the fleet cruise to Norway in July 1914, which {{was cut short}} by the {{assassination}} of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and subsequent rise in international tensions. On 25 July the ship's crew was <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia; Lothringen left Norway to rendezvous {{with the rest of}} the fleet the following day.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} September 13, {{residents}} were <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> that a storm might strike parts of Ireland with hurricane-force winds. Two days later, forecasters believed the storm {{would take a}} more southerly course towards France. This forecast was later withdrawn as the storm failed to turn eastward. Consequently, gale warnings were issued for much of western Ireland {{on the morning of}} September 16, hours before the brunt of the storm arrived. Fearing building collapses, officials in County Galway closed markets {{for the duration of the}} storm.|$|E

5|$|Between 2003 and 2004, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines {{received}} several reports of increased INR {{and risk of}} haemorrhage in people taking warfarin and cranberry juice. Data establishing a causal relationship is still lacking, and a 2006 review found no cases of this interaction reported to the FDA; nevertheless, several authors have recommended that both doctors and patients be <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of its possibility. The mechanism behind the interaction is still unclear.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of these plans and actions. Thus, it would be impossible for them to later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies had indicated {{that they were going to}} pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the planned genocide.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013 the {{investigation}} board was <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of that two passengers had each their Mobira NMT-450 mobile telephone {{with them on}} the flights. As this had not been mentioned in the original report, AIBN conducted a review of the issue and especially if the telephones could have influenced the vertical navigation. They concluded in December that this was not the case, as there were no indications of interferences and that there are no instances where electromagnetic interference has been a contributing cause to an aviation accident.|$|E

He accepted the offer to be announcer of the program. Stage assistants also appeared on-camera on Double Dare, initially only assisting {{in setting up}} physical challenges and obstacles, but expanding the role as the series continued to sometimes interacting with Summers, demonstrating challenges, and modeling prizes. Robin Marrella and Dave Shikiar were the two permanent stage assistants when the program began.|$|E
5|$|Sheindlin {{passed the}} New York state bar {{examination}} in 1965, {{the same year}} as her graduation, and was hired as a corporate lawyer for a cosmetics firm. Within two years she became dissatisfied with her job and left to raise her two children. She was soon <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of a position in the New York court system as a prosecutor in the family courts. In her role as a lawyer, Sheindlin prosecuted child abuse cases, domestic violence and juvenile crime.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{military}} began targeting {{food crops}} in October 1962, primarily using Agent Blue; the American public was not <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> {{of the crop}} destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the State Department in March 1966.|$|E

Bamber's parents' estate included land and buildings occupied by Bamber's cousins, who were <b>made</b> <b>aware,</b> after the murders, that Bamber intended to sell them. It {{was one of those}} cousins who found the silencer in the gun cupboard after the murders, with the flecks of blood and paint that proved pivotal to the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Then, whilst {{the army}} was camped in Macedon, the Brygians, a local Thracian tribe, {{launched}} a night raid against the Persian camp, killing many of the Persians, and wounding Mardonius. Despite his injury, Mardonius made sure that the Brygians were defeated and subjugated, before leading his army back to the Hellespont; {{the remnants of the}} navy also retreated to Asia. Although this campaign ended ingloriously, the land approaches to Greece had been secured, and the Greeks had no doubt been <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of Darius's intentions for them.|$|E

When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and not to move to Nashville.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} two decades, art {{educators}} have been <b>made</b> more <b>aware</b> {{of the influence of}} ideologies in both art and education. We have seen, for example, as with Berger 2 ̆ 7 s Ways of Seeing (1972), and recent feminist art and scholarship, the degree to which art has been complicit in the stereotyping of women. We have been <b>made</b> increasingly <b>aware</b> of the broader social and political dimensions of art and art education and of the art of different ethnic groups. This journal is partly responsible for that shift of understanding...|$|R

5|$|With {{some people}} unable {{to believe that}} the Japanese would be so ruthless, rumours began to spread almost {{immediately}} after news of the attack was made public. The most common rumour was that Centaur had been carrying munitions or commandos {{at the time of her}} sinking, with the Japanese <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of this prior to her departure. This stemmed from an incident involving the ambulance drivers' weapons during loading in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Alejo Carpentier {{grew up in}} Havana, Cuba and {{was born}} on December 26, 1904 in Lausanne, Switzerland. He {{subsequently}} moved to France in 1933 (at the age of 29) and returned to Cuba six years later, in 1939. Once in Cuba, Carpentier joined {{a group of young}} writers whose goal was to establish a literature faithful to the New World, by recovering origins, history, and tradition. In 1943, he travelled to Haiti, where he was <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of Dominique Hyppolyte's play, Le Torrent, about the Haitian Revolution, which features a character named Ti Noel. As The Kingdom of This World coincides with Carpentier's return to Cuba, it is very much influenced by the author's re-encounter with himself and his origins.|$|E
5|$|British {{military}} forces in Kenya were <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of the revolution at 4:45am on 12 January, and following a request from the Sultan were put on 15 minutes' standby to conduct an assault on Zanzibar's airfield. However, the British High Commissioner in Zanzibar, Timothy Crosthwait, reported no instances of British nationals being attacked and advised against intervention. As a result, the British troops in Kenya were reduced to four hours' standby later that evening. Crosthwait decided not to approve an immediate evacuation of British citizens, as many held key government positions and their sudden removal would further disrupt the country's economy and government. To avoid possible bloodshed, the British agreed a timetable with Karume for an organised evacuation.|$|E

5|$|Derfflinger {{also took}} part in the {{bombardment}} of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25April 1916. Hipper was away on sick leave, so the German ships were under the command of Konteradmiral Friedrich Boedicker. Derfflinger, her newly commissioned sister ship , and the veterans Moltke, Seydlitz and Von der Tann left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 on 24 April. They were supported by a screening force of 6 light cruisers and two torpedo boat flotillas. The heavy units of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Admiral Reinhard Scheer, sailed at 13:40, with the objective to provide distant support for Boedicker's ships. The British Admiralty was <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of the German sortie through the interception of German wireless signals, and deployed the Grand Fleet at 15:50.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of the problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon {{found that it was}} an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E
5|$|He inaugurated {{his career}} as a {{legislator}} under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of Dincă, an educated Roma cook who had murdered his French wife and then killed himself after being <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> {{that he was not going}} to be set free by his Cantacuzino masters.|$|E
