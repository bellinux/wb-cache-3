There is something different about today. The sun is out, the breeze is chilly but a nice relief, and the air smells like freshly fallen rain. I take all of this in—I allow myself to absorb the entire experience. Then a feeling begins to creep in. A slow churning in my stomach, a distant rumbling from somewhere right on the outskirts of my consciousness, a pause, and then a thought: What makes me...|$|E
