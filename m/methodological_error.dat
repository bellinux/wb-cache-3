Studies have not been conducted to determine whether people of different racial backgrounds receive differing levels of social support. If there is a difference, this could act as a confounding variable in studies correlating race and SLE.

Racial differences in lupus progression have not been found in studies that control for the socioeconomic status [...] of participants.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} <b>methodological</b> <b>errors</b> that arise when firm {{valuation}} {{is carried out}} in practice. Violation of assumptions underlying the valuation models are examples of <b>methodological</b> <b>errors.</b> We analyze valuation spreadsheets from five Danish financial institutions (i. e., stockbrokers and corporate finance departments) in order to trace if firm valuation models are properly applied. We conclude the following: (i) <b>Methodological</b> <b>errors</b> often cause valuation models to generate estimates that differ significantly from the theoretically correct value; and (ii) Firm value estimates were biased due {{to a variety of}} <b>methodological</b> <b>errors.</b> The implications of those errors may be significant.

5000|$|Embodied energy {{analysis}} {{is interested in}} what energy goes to supporting a consumer, and so all energy depreciation is assigned to the final demand of consumer. Different methodologies use different scales of data to calculate energy embodied in products and services of nature and human civilization. International consensus on the appropriateness of data scales and methodologies is pending. This difficulty can give a wide range in embodied energy values for any given material. In {{the absence of a}} comprehensive global embodied energy public dynamic database, embodied energy calculations may omit important data on, for example, the rural road/highway construction and maintenance needed to move a product, human marketing, advertising, catering services, non-human services and the like. Such omissions can be a source of significant <b>methodological</b> <b>error</b> in embodied energy estimations. [...] Without an estimation and declaration of the embodied energy error, it is difficult to calibrate the sustainability index, and so the value of any given material, process or service to environmental and human economic processes.|$|E

To use Victoria’s own words, he has “left the realm of ‘objective scholarship’ to pursue a partisan agenda”. True to this claim, the bulk of Victoria’s article traces a trajectory of progressively essentialist language that by implication would invalidate not only the heterodoxical views expressed by Zen militarists during World War II but also nullifies many orthodox systems of Mahāyānist philosophy that developed in Northern India, Nepal, and Tibet...Victoria’s presentation speaks rather as a categorical indictment of the whole of Mahāyāna Buddhism. Analogically, this {{would be like a}} Dominican priest arguing that all Catholics regardless of their historical, cultural, or doctrinal orientation had fundamentally misunderstood the concept of the Holy Spirit. The <b>methodological</b> <b>error</b> appears in Victoria’s argument when he attempts to use militant Zen in the context of wartime Japan to illustrate what he sees as pervasive doctrinal errors throughout the history of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This reformist approach noticeably contrasts with the other essays in Buddhist Warfare, which consistently maintains a high level of academic rigor regardless of any subjective biases.|$|E

50|$|In {{understanding}} how GCA is associated job performance, several researchers concluded that GCA affects acquisition of job knowledge, {{which in turn}} improves job performance. In other words, people high in GCA are capable to learn faster and acquire more job knowledge easily, which allow them to perform better. Conversely, lack of ability to acquire job knowledge will directly affect job performance. This is due to low levels of GCA. Also, GCA has a direct effect on job performance. In a daily basis, employees are exposed constantly to challenges and problem solving tasks, which success depends solely on their GCA. These findings are discouraging for governmental entities in charge of protecting rights of workers. Because of the high correlation of GCA on job performance, companies are hiring employees based on GCA tests scores. Inevitably, this practice is denying {{the opportunity to work}} to many people with low GCA. Previous researchers have found significant differences in GCA between race / ethnicity groups. For instance, there is a debate whether studies were biased against Afro-Americans, who scored significantly lower than white Americans in GCA tests. However, findings on GCA-job performance correlation must be taken carefully. Some researchers have warned the existence of statistical artifacts related to measures of job performance and GCA test scores. For example, Viswesvaran, Ones and Schmidt (1996) argued that is quite impossible to obtain perfect measures of job performance without incurring in any <b>methodological</b> <b>error.</b> Moreover, studies on GCA and job performance are always susceptible to range restriction, because data is gathered mostly from current employees, neglecting those that were not hired. Hence, sample comes from employees who successfully passed hiring process, including measures of GCA.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{automated}} near real time science analysis {{performed at the}} INTEGRAL Science Data Centre. The structure of the Quick-Look Analysis pipeline and individual analysis stages are detailed. The stage performing pattern recognition for two-dimensional coordinate lists, i. e. source identification, is tested in-depth. The lists contain sources located in a randomly selected 9 ÌŠ by 9 ÌŠ area of the sky. Using the current live version and default parameters; a simulated new source was correctly identified 98 % of the time, fields with no new sources produced false detections 8 % of the time. The testing reveals two separate flaws; a code error and a <b>methodological</b> <b>error.</b> The sensitivity of recognizing that a new source has been detected is reduced because of the code error. The <b>methodological</b> <b>error</b> causes the algorithm to report the detection of previously unknown sources where none exists. A possible solution is presented. New source detection was improved to well above 99 % and false detections reduced below 2 % with the new solution. A second <b>methodological</b> <b>error</b> causes the algorithm used to correct for the pointing error of the instrument to produce unreliable results. Fortuitously this problem is serious only for small pointing errors where the source matching algorithm is able to compensate for it...|$|E
