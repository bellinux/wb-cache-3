50|$|The {{country is}} also {{famous for its}} gelato, or {{traditional}} ice-cream often known as Italian ice cream abroad. There are gelaterias or ice-cream vendors and shops all around Italian cities, {{and it is a}} very popular dessert or snack, especially during the summer. Sicilian granitas, or a frozen dessert of flavored crushed ice, more or less similar to a sorbet or a snow cone, are popular desserts not only in Sicily or their native towns of Messina and Catania, but all over Italy (even though the Northern and Central Italian equivalent, the gratta checca, commonly found in Rome or Milan is slightly different from the traditional granita siciliana). Italy also boasts an assortment of desserts. The Christmas cakes pandoro and panettone are popular in the North (pandoro is from Verona, whilst panettone is milanese), however, they have also become popular desserts in other parts of Italy and abroad. The Colomba Pasquale is eaten all over the country on Easter day, and is a more traditional alternative to chocolate easter eggs. Tiramisu is a very popular and iconic Italian dessert from Veneto which has become famous worldwide. Other Italian cakes and sweets include cannoli, the cassata siciliana, fruit-shaped <b>marzipans</b> and panna cotta.|$|R

25|$|The aromas {{and flavor}} notes of Chenin blanc often include the {{descriptors}} of minerally, greengage, angelica and honey. Chenin wines produced from noble rot will often have notes of peaches and honey that develop into barley sugar, <b>marzipan,</b> and quince as they age. Dry or semi-sweet Chenin blanc from the Loire will often have notes apple, greengage, and chalky minerals that develop into more honey, acacia, and quince aromas. New World styles of Chenin, {{such as those}} of South Africa, are more often made to be consume young and exhibit rich tropical fruit notes such as banana, guava, pear, and pineapple. The alcohol level for dessert styles Chenin rarely goes above 12%, which keeps the wines more in balance. Drier styles of Chenin {{are more likely to be}} around 13.5%.|$|E

500|$|In {{northern}} France, a wide {{assortment of}} {{waffles and wafers}} was eaten with cheese and hypocras or a sweet malmsey as issue de table ("departure from the table"). The ever-present candied ginger, coriander, aniseed and other spices were referred to as épices de chambre ("parlor spices") and were taken as digestibles {{at the end of}} a meal to [...] "close" [...] the stomach. Like their Muslim counterparts in Al-Andalus|Spain]], the Arab conquerors of Sicily introduced a wide variety of new sweets and desserts that eventually found their way to the rest of Europe. Just like Montpellier, Sicily was once famous for its comfits, nougat candy (torrone, or turrón in Spanish) and almond clusters (confetti). From the south, the Arabs also brought the art of ice cream making that produced sorbet and several examples of sweet cakes and pastries; cassata alla Siciliana (from Arabic qas'ah, the term for the terra cotta bowl with which it was shaped), made from <b>marzipan,</b> sponge cake and sweetened ricotta and cannoli alla Siciliana, originally cappelli di turchi ("Turkish hats"), fried, chilled pastry tubes with a sweet cheese filling.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "dessert" [...] {{comes from}} the Old French desservir, [...] "to clear a table", {{literally}} [...] "to un-serve", and originated during the Middle Ages. It would typically consist of dragées and mulled wine accompanied by aged cheese, and by the Late Middle Ages could also include fresh fruit covered in sugar, honey or syrup and boiled-down fruit pastes. Sugar, from its first appearance in Europe, was viewed {{as much as a}} drug as a sweetener; its long-lived medieval reputation as an exotic luxury encouraged its appearance in elite contexts accompanying meats and other dishes that to modern taste are more naturally savoury. There was a wide variety of fritters, crêpes with sugar, sweet custards and darioles, almond milk and eggs in a pastry shell that could also include fruit and sometimes even bone marrow or fish. German-speaking areas had a particular fondness for krapfen: fried pastries and dough with various sweet and savory fillings. <b>Marzipan</b> in many forms was well known in Italy and southern France by the 1340s and is assumed to be of Arab origin. Anglo-Norman cookbooks are full of recipes for sweet and savory custards, potages, sauces and tarts with strawberries, cherries, apples and plums. The English chefs also had a penchant for using flower petals such as roses, violets, and elder flowers. An early form of quiche can be found in Forme of Cury, a 14th-century recipe collection, as a Torte de Bry with a cheese and egg yolk filling. [...] Le Ménagier de Paris ("Parisian Household Book") written in 1393 includes a quiche recipe made with three kinds of cheese, eggs, beet greens, spinach, fennel fronds, and parsley.|$|E

2500|$|Chardonnay {{is one of}} the {{dominant}} grapes in Burgundy, though Pinot noir vines outnumber it by nearly a three-to-one ratio. In addition to Chablis, Chardonnay is found in the Côte d'Or (largely in the Côte de Beaune), as well as the Côte Chalonnaise and Mâconnais. It is grown in eight grand cru vineyards; The [...] "Montrachets"-Montrachet, Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet, Bâtard-Montrachet, Chevalier-Montrachet, and Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet, as well as Charlemagne, Corton-Charlemagne, and Le Musigny. In addition to being the most expensive, the Burgundy examples of Chardonnay were long considered the benchmark standard of expressing terroir through Chardonnay. The Montrachets are noted for their high alcohol levels, often above 13%, as well as deep concentration of flavors. The vineyards around Chassagne-Montrachet tend to have a characteristic hazelnut aroma to them, while those of Puligny-Montrachet have more steely flavors. Both grand cru and premier cru examples from Corton-Charlemagne have been known to demonstrate <b>marzipan,</b> while Meursault wines tend to be the most round and buttery examples.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{earliest}} days of MGP operations, coal tar was considered a waste and often disposed into the environment in and around the plant locations. While uses for coal tar developed by the late-19th century, the market for tar varied and plants that could not sell tar at a given time could store tar for future use, attempt to burn it as fuel for the boilers, or dump the tar as waste. Commonly, waste tars were disposed of in old gas holders, adits or even mine shafts (if present). Over time, the waste tars degrade with phenols, benzene (and other mono-aromatics – BTEX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons released as pollutant plumes that can escape into the surrounding environment. Other wastes included [...] "blue billy", which is a ferroferricyanide compound—the blue colour is from Prussian blue, which was commercially used as a dye. Blue billy is typically a granular material and was sometimes sold locally with the strap line [...] "guaranteed weed free drives". The presence of blue billy can give gas works waste a characteristic musty/bitter almonds or <b>marzipan</b> smell which is associated with cyanide gas.|$|E
2500|$|Many Italian staples {{and internationally}} {{recognized}} favorites were invented and refined during the Late Middle Ages {{and the early}} Renaissance; pasta was on everyone's dinner plate by the 13th century, though it was commonly made out of rice flour rather than durum wheat; pizza, the medieval Italian term for [...] "pie", and tortes came in many varieties {{with a wide range}} of toppings, ranging from <b>marzipan,</b> and custards to chicken, eel, or even hemp; polenta made from French green lentils or barley; risotto; and a myriad of local or regional variants of sausage and cheese which was eaten by more or less everyone. As early as the Middle Ages, the cheeses, in particular, appear to have been highly specialized, from a fresh Tuscan to an aged Milanese from Tadesca, wrapped and shipped in tree bark. Medieval Italians also used eggs to a higher degree than many other regions, and the recipe collections describe herb omelettes (herboletos) and frittatas. Grapes as tasty morsels and lemons as a cooking ingredient was ubiquitous and, of course, olive oil of every conceivable kind was the cooking fat of choice in all regions, including the north, for dressing salads, frying, seasoning, marinading and preserving meats.|$|E
2500|$|The cuisine of the Jews of {{the city}} was a variant of the Judeo-Spanish cuisine, which is itself {{influenced}} by the large ensemble of Mediterranean cuisine. It was influenced by the Jewish dietary rules of kashrut, which include prohibitions on the consumption of pork and mixtures of dairy and meat products, and religious holidays that require the preparation of special dishes. However, its key feature was its Iberian influence. Fish, abundant in this port city, was consumed in large quantities and in all forms: fried, baked ("al orno"), marinated or braised ("abafado"), and was often accompanied by complex sauces. Seen as a symbol of fertility, fish was used in a marriage rite called dia del peche ("day of fish") {{on the last day of}} wedding ceremonies, in which the bride stepped over a large dish of fish that was then consumed by the guests. Vegetables accompanied all the dishes, especially onions; garlic was on hand but was not used, since the Ashkenazic synagogues were major consumers of garlic and had been given the nickname [...] "El kal del ajo," [...] "the garlic synagogue." [...] Greek yogurt, widely consumed in the Balkans and Anatolia, was also highly appreciated, as well as cream. In anticipation of Shabbat, hamin was prepared. A Judeo-Spanish variant of the Ashkenazi cholent and the North African dafina, chamin was a meat stew with vegetables (wheat, chickpeas, white beans) that were let simmer until the Saturday midday meal. In preparation for Passover, housewives filled locked chests with sweets, figs and dates stuffed with almonds, <b>marzipan</b> and the popular chape blanche (white jam), which consisted of sugar water and lemon. Wine was reserved for religious rituals, but Sephardim, like their Greek and Muslim neighbors, were major consumers of raki. They also favored sugary drinks made of prune, cherry and apricot syrup, which they drank at the end of the large festive meal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Marzipan</b> - A typical {{treat for}} Christmas, <b>marzipan</b> is enjoyed year round and also exported. <b>Marzipan</b> in Denmark is {{typically}} less sweet {{and with a}} higher amount of almonds than what you will find elsewhere. The largest and best known exporter is perhaps the company of Anthon Berg. In Denmark, only Ægte Marcipan (True <b>Marzipan)</b> is required to contain almonds only and for ordinary <b>marzipan,</b> apricot kernels are widely used as substitutes {{for some of the}} more expensive almonds. <b>Marzipan</b> made with pistachios and walnuts is also sold but is not as common.|$|E
50|$|Persipan is a similar, yet less {{expensive}} product, {{in which the}} almonds are replaced by apricot or peach kernels. Many confectionery products sold as <b>marzipan</b> are made from {{less expensive}} materials, such as soy paste and almond essence. To control and detect the authenticity of <b>marzipan,</b> polymerase chain reaction methods can differentiate almonds from substitutes and adulterants at concentrations less than 1%. German <b>marzipan</b> is made by grinding whole almonds with sugar and partially drying the paste, and French <b>marzipan</b> (called 'massepain') is made by combining ground almonds with sugar syrup. Some <b>marzipan</b> is flavoured with rosewater. Spanish <b>marzipan</b> is made without bitter almonds. Sugar free <b>marzipan</b> {{can be made by}} replacing sugar with polyols such as maltitol.|$|E
5000|$|Under EU law, <b>marzipan</b> {{must have}} [...] a minimum almond oil content of 14% {{and a maximum}} {{moisture}} content of 8.5%. Optional additional ingredients are rosewater, honey, pistachios, preservatives, and sometimes hazelnut. In the U.S., <b>marzipan</b> is not officially defined, but it is generally made with a higher ratio of sugar to almonds than almond paste. One brand, for instance, has 28% almonds in its <b>marzipan,</b> and 45% almonds in its almond paste. However, in Sweden and Finland almond paste refers to a <b>marzipan</b> that contains 50% ground almonds, a much higher quality than regular <b>marzipan.</b> In Germany, Lübecker <b>Marzipan</b> {{is known for its}} quality. It contains 66% almonds. The original manually produced Mozartkugeln are made from green pistachio <b>marzipan.</b>|$|E
