5|$|Harveys Creek and its {{tributary}} Pikes Creek {{are used}} by the Pennsylvania American Water Company Ceasetown as a water supply for part or all of 15 municipalities and communities, including Wilkes-Barre, Nanticoke, Shickshinny, and others. As of 2002, the creeks supply 67,500 people with water. Pennsylvania American Water Company Ceasetown is permitted to take 16 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> per day from them.|$|E
5|$|Service on {{the subway}} system is {{occasionally}} disrupted by flooding from rainstorms, even minor ones. Rainwater can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified third rail to be shut off. Every day, the MTA moves 13 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{when it is not}} raining. Since 1992, $357 million has been used to improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 4.03 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> per day are {{withdrawn}} from Toby Creek and its tributaries. 3.38 million gallons per day (84 percent) are removed by registered water suppliers and 0.51 million gallons per day (13 percent) are removed for {{commercial and industrial}} purposes. 0.10 million gallons per day (2 percent) are removed for mineral purposes and 0.04 million gallons per day (1 percent) are removed for residential purposes.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of wetland {{complexes}} in the watershed of Stafford Meadow Brook. These include Bear Swamp (which is at the stream's headwaters), Simerson Marsh, and Little Virginia. The first of these is a Pocono wetland bog. Lakes in the watershed include Lake Scranton, the District Number Fifty-Nine Reservoir, the Williams Bridge Reservoir, and Hazard Pond. Lake Scranton and the Williams Bridge Reservoir are used as a water supply, with the former providing 22 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> per day. Together with Roaring Brook and Spring Brook, it provides {{a substantial portion of the}} water supply of the Lackawanna Valley. Downstream of Lake Scranton, the watershed contains a lake used by the Montage Mountain Ski Resort for snowmaking.|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{production}} at the plant was halted after a combined FBI and EPA raid in 1989. Due {{to the end of}} the Cold War, changes in nuclear weapons policy, and years of protests, the Rocky Flats Plant was shut down, with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site. The site's mission then changed to cleanup. The Rocky Flats Plant was declared a CERCLASuperfund site in 1989 and began its transformation to a cleanup site in February 1992. Removal of the plant and surface contamination was largely completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with federal and state agency support and stakeholder input. The cleanup effort decommissioned and demolished over 800 structures; removed over 21 tons of weapons-grade material; removed over 1.3 million cubic meters of waste; and, treated more than 16 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Four groundwater treatment systems were also constructed. The site achieved regulatory closure in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Bird, {{the eldest}} son of Premier Vere Bird, first entered {{politics}} in 1981 when he served as an unelected security official during the general election. In the following election in 1984, Bird and his brother Lester were both elected to the House of Representatives after the Antigua Labour Party, led by their father, took 16 of the 17 House seats. Bird himself was victorious over George Walter, leader of the Progressive Labour Movement and former Premier of Antigua and Barbuda, gaining 912 votes to Walter's 358. Upon election, with his father as Prime Minister, {{he was given the}} Ministry of Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities. As Minister he visited Dominica {{at the head of a}} four-person delegation that was dispatched to reach a deal on selling Antigua and Barbuda, a country lacking natural supplies, water. This business was concluded on 16 July 1984, when it was announced that Dominica would sell Antigua and Barbuda 2 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> every 10 days, at a cost of around 3 US dollars per thousand gallons.|$|E

5|$|Filming was set {{to begin}} in October 2003, but it was pushed back. Principal {{photography}} for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events began on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and the ruins of the Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for A Series of Unfortunate Events ended on May 29, 2004.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to private development, several joint-development affordable housing projects {{have recently been}} constructed along the Metrorail line {{with the intent of}} increasing ridership through transit-oriented development. These projects include Santa Clara apartments, Brownsville Transit Village, and The Beacon, which is located near Historic Overtown/Lyric Theater Station in Downtown Miami. The headquarters of Miami-Dade Transit, also located next to Historic Overtown/Lyric Theater Station, is known as the Overtown Transit Village. Brownsville Transit Village, opening in March 2012, was visited by the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lisa P. Jackson, on January 5, 2012 to tour the 490-unit development, which will save an estimated five <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and $50,000 annually in utility bills due to environmentally sustainable plumbing fixtures. Nonetheless, by 2016, Brownsville and Santa Clara were still the lowest ridership stations, the only ones to regularly post ridership numbers below 1,000 daily. In general, stations to the north of Civic Center see much lower ridership, on average one-third of stations from Civic Center south. They are mostly in industrial areas with low population density and little development, as well as stagnant or declining populations, such as Gladeview and Brownsville. Additionally, stations to the north of Earlington Heights are only served by one line, giving them much longer headways.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E

25|$|Not all of {{the water}} removed from the river by the swallow holes is {{returned}} to the channel at Leatherhead. The chalk aquifer also feeds the springs {{at the southern end}} of Fetcham Mill Pond, which have never been known to run dry. A survey in March 1883 estimated that the Fetcham springs were producing about 3.6 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> (16,000 m3) every day. A second survey in 1948 estimated that the same springs were yielding about 5 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> (22,000 m3) a day. The water table in the chalk of the Wey Gap is significantly higher than might be expected from natural rainwater percolation alone. It has been suggested that a proportion of the excess water originates from the Mole Gap.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Peterborough {{experienced}} a flood which caused much damage {{for the city}} and surrounding areas.

25|$|The Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, which {{supplies}} 270 to 315 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> per {{day to the}} City of San Francisco {{and other}} Bay Area communities, directly crosses the Hayward Fault in Fremont. A 2002 report by the Bay Area Economic Forum suggests that a breakdown in the aqueduct due to an earthquake could cut off Hetch Hetchy water to the Bay Area for 60 days. In addition to depriving 85% of San Francisco residents of their drinking water, this would cut off supplies for firefighting and water-intensive industry, causing economic damage of $17.2–28.7 billion. Extensive reconstruction work at the Hayward Fault crossing includes a multi-sectioned tunnel structure to allow shear without collapse, this is to contain a section of water pipe with ball joints and a slip joint.|$|E
25|$|The International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a {{joint project}} of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s {{following}} substantial environmental studies, treats 25million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped {{across the border from}} the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.|$|E

25|$|In April 2015, {{the city}} of Cascade Locks, Oregon and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which is using water for a salmon hatchery, applied with the Oregon Water Resources Department to {{permanently}} trade their water rights to Nestlé; an action which {{does not require a}} public-interest review. Nestlé approached them in 2008 and they had been considering to trade their well water with Oregon's Oxbow Springs water, a publicly owned water source in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, and to sell the spring water at over 100 <b>million</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> per year to Nestlé. The plan has been criticized by legislators and 80,000 citizens. The 250,000-square-foot, $50 million Nestlé bottling plant in Cascade Locks with an unemployment rate of 18.8 percent would have 50 employees and would increase property-tax collections by 67 percent. The Oregon Water Resources Department was expected to issue a proposal in 2015, that would allow Nestlé to utilise spring water for its bottling operation.|$|E
