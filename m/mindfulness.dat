5|$|A 2014 study {{examined}} the effects of combined NVC and <b>mindfulness</b> training on 885 male inmates of the Monroe Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washington. The training was found to reduce recidivism from 37% to 21%, and the training was estimated as having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs. The training was found to increase equanimity, decrease anger, and lead to abilities to take responsibility for one's feelings, express empathy, and to make requests without imposing demands.|$|E
5|$|It {{is claimed}} that yoga {{can be an}} {{excellent}} training for children and adolescents, both {{as a form of}} physical exercise and for breathing, focus, <b>mindfulness,</b> and stress relief: many school districts have considered incorporating yoga into their P.E. programs. The Encinitas, California school district gained a San Diego Superior Court Judge's approval to use yoga in P.E., holding against the parents who claimed the practice was intrinsically religious and hence should not be part of a state funded program.|$|E

5|$|Over 50% {{of people}} with MS may use {{complementary}} and alternative medicine, although percentages vary depending on how alternative medicine is defined. The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens, vitamin D, relaxation techniques such as yoga, herbal medicine (including medical cannabis), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, self-infection with hookworms, reflexology, acupuncture, and <b>mindfulness.</b> Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time, {{tend to be more}} disabled and have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare.|$|E
25|$|It is {{suggested}} that <b>mindfulness</b> {{plays a role in}} forgiveness and health. The forgiveness of others has a positive effect on physical health when it is combined with <b>mindfulness</b> but evidence shows that forgiveness only effects health as a function of <b>mindfulness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the 1970s, {{clinical}} psychology and psychiatry {{have developed a}} number of therapeutic techniques based on <b>mindfulness</b> for helping people who are experiencing a variety of psychological conditions. <b>Mindfulness</b> practice is being employed in psychology to alleviate a variety of mental and physical conditions, such as bringing about reductions in depression symptoms, stress, and anxiety. <b>Mindfulness</b> is also used {{in the treatment of}} drug addiction. Recent studies demonstrate that <b>mindfulness</b> meditation significantly attenuates pain through multiple, unique mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{popularity}} in participation of <b>mindfulness,</b> conferences such as Wisdom 2.0 have arisen. <b>Mindfulness</b> has entered the secular world in many ways, allowing it to reach many different groups of people.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mindfulness</b> {{immersed}} {{in the body and}} <b>Mindfulness</b> of in-and-out breathing are both part of the ten recollections and the four satipatthana, and are commonly given special attention as primary themes for a meditator to focus on.|$|E
25|$|Most ACT {{self-help}} books (e.g.,) and many tested ACT protocols teach formal contemplative practice skills, but by this definition of <b>mindfulness,</b> such defusion skills as word repetition (taking a difficult thought, distilling it {{to a single}} word, and saying it repeatedly out loud for 30 seconds) are also viewed as <b>mindfulness</b> methods.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, <b>Mindfulness</b> and mindfulness-based {{programs}} {{have become increasingly}} important to Westerners and in the Western medical and psychological community {{as a means of}} helping people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy. Jon Kabat-Zinn, who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program in 1979, has defined <b>mindfulness</b> as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.' Several methods are used during time set aside specifically for <b>mindfulness</b> meditation, such as body scan techniques or letting thought arise and pass, and also during our daily lives, such as being aware of the taste and texture of the food that we eat. Some studies offer evidence that <b>mindfulness</b> practices are beneficial for the brain's self-regulation by increasing activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. A shift from using the right prefrontal cortex is claimed to be associated with a trend away from depression and anxiety, and towards happiness, relaxation, and emotional balance.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} quantifiable research that <b>mindfulness</b> {{has on the}} brain and body {{is one of the}} major reasons why corporate <b>mindfulness</b> programs has become more prominent in the modern day business world. Studies conducted by Yale University found that <b>mindfulness</b> meditation is associated with lower levels of activity in the default mode network (DMN), which is part of the brain network that is responsible for self-related thinking and mind wandering. Volume changes in key areas of the brain are also found as a result of meditation. In 2011, a team at Harvard found that <b>mindfulness</b> can actually change the structure of the brain after conducting an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) on participants. The research found an increase in cortical thickness in the hippocampus, which controls learning, memory and emotion regulation. The research also found decreases in brain cell volume in the Amygdala, which is responsible for fear, anxiety and stress. These changes were also aligned with the participant's self-reports of their stress levels.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} Flow studied by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has been {{compared}} to Buddhist meditative states such as samadhi and <b>mindfulness.</b> Ronald Siegel describes flow as “mindfulness while accomplishing something.” Nobo Komagata and Sachiko Komagata, however, are critical of characterizing the notion of “flow” as a special case of <b>mindfulness,</b> noting that the connection is more complicated. Zen Buddhism has a concept called Mushin (無心, no mind) which is also similar to flow.|$|E

25|$|In {{the modern}} era, Buddhist {{meditation}} saw increasing popularity {{due to the}} influence of Buddhist modernism and the lay meditation based Vipassana movement. The spread of Buddhist meditation to the Western world paralleled the spread of Buddhism in the West. Buddhist meditation has also influenced Western Psychology, especially through the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in 1979. The modernized concept of <b>mindfulness</b> (based on the Buddhist term sati) and related meditative practices has in turn led to several <b>mindfulness</b> based therapies.|$|E

25|$|Another {{recommended}} {{technique is}} from the Satipatthana Sutta, which outlines the practice of <b>mindfulness,</b> which {{is not just a}} formal meditation, but a skill of attentive awareness and self monitoring. In developing <b>mindfulness,</b> one is advised to be aware of all thoughts and sensations that arise, even unwanted or unpleasant ones and continuously attend to such thoughts. Eventually, through habituation and exposure, the intensity and unpleasantness of such thoughts will disappear. Buddhist texts also promote the training of positive emotions such as loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity.|$|E

25|$|Gestalt Therapy, an {{approach}} created by Fritz Perls, {{was based on}} phenomenology, existentialism and also Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Perls {{spent some time in}} Japanese Zen monasteries and his therapeutic techniques include <b>mindfulness</b> practices and focusing on the present moment. Practices outlined by Perls himself in Ego, hunger and aggression (1969), such as “concentration on eating” (“we have to be fully {{aware of the fact that}} we are eating”) and “awareness continuum” are strikingly similar to Buddhist <b>mindfulness</b> training. Other authors in Gestalt Therapy who were influenced by Buddhism are Barry Stevens (therapist) and Dick Price (who developed Gestalt Practice by including Buddhist meditation).|$|E
