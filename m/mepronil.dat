40|$|Garden pea leaf blight, {{caused by}} Mycosphaerella pinodes, is a severe disease of peas worldwide. Detection of this {{pathogen}} from seed, plant debris and soil is difficult using non-selective agar media. This {{study was conducted}} to develop a semiselective medium for the isolation of this pathogen. Of the 14 carbon sources and 18 nitrogen sources tested, maltose and soluble starch were the most suitable carbon sources and casein was the most important nitrogen source for mycelial growth of three isolates of M. pinodes. Among 13 pesticides and two antibiotics tested, atrazine, <b>mepronil,</b> paraquat, propamocarb and TMTD showed no adverse effect on growth of M. pinodes. Based on these results, a starch-casein semiselective medium (designated as the SC-semiselective medium) was developed by amendment of 1 L Czapek-Dox agar with 30 g soluble starch, 2 g casein, 25 g mL- 1 propamocarb, 10 g mL- 1 benomyl, 50 g mL- 1 <b>mepronil,</b> 300 g mL- 1 atrazine, 100 g mL- 1 streptomycin sulfate and 200 g mL- 1 neomycin sulfate. This SC-semiselective medium was effective for detection of M. pinodes in artificially and naturally infested field soils, diseased seeds, leaves, and stems of peas. It should have potential for applications in research on biology, ecology and control of M. pinodes in peas...|$|E
40|$|A simple bioautographic agar spray assay {{has been}} {{developed}} using the plant pathogenic fungus Valsa ceratosperma as an indicator organism for the detection and activity guided fractionation of antifungal compounds by thin-layer chromatography. Besides silica gel G 60 F- 254 aluminium- and glass-backed plates, chemically modified silica gel (RP- 18 F 254 S, RP- 18 WF(254) s, RP- 8, etc.) plates and various organic solvents were {{used to evaluate the}} compatibility of the agar spray technique. Two fungicides, Iprodione (Rovral(R)) and <b>Mepronil</b> (Bastak(R)), were tested to determine the sensitivity of the test fungus...|$|E
