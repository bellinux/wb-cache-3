5|$|It {{originally}} {{started as}} a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it has retained its current, much shorter route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it {{became the subject of}} <b>much</b> <b>concern</b> for local residents regarding expansion which slowed down any progress for capacity improvement. By the late 2000s, the delays have come and gone and it has emerged as a state route that has been largely modernized to deal with heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|The high-altitude explosions {{that had}} caused so <b>much</b> <b>concern</b> for Nike Zeus due to {{blackout}} had been further studied in the early 1960s {{and led to a}} new possibility for missile defense. When a nuclear warhead explodes in a dense atmosphere, its initial high-energy X-rays ionize the air, blocking other X-rays. In the highest layers of the atmosphere, there is too little gas for this to occur, and the X-rays can travel long distances. Sufficient X-ray exposure to an RV can damage its heat shields.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused <b>much</b> <b>concern</b> among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E

5|$|In 1631 Wiśniowiecki {{returned}} to the Commonwealth and took over from his uncle the management of his father's huge estate, which included {{a large part of}} what is now Ukraine. In 1632 he converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism, an action that caused <b>much</b> <b>concern</b> in Ukraine. His decision has been analyzed by historians, and often criticized, particularly in Ukrainian historiography. The Orthodox Church feared to lose a powerful protector, and Isaiah Kopinsky, metropolitan bishop of Kiev and a friend of his mother, unsuccessfully pleaded with him to change his mind. Jeremi would not budge although he remained on decent terms with the Orthodox Church, avoiding provocative actions, and supported his uncle and Orthodox bishop Peter Mogila and his Orthodox Church collegium.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1950, in {{the middle}} of a holiday in Italy, Pontecorvo {{abruptly}} flew from Rome for Stockholm with his wife and three sons without informing friends or relatives. On 2 September he was helped by Soviet agents to enter the Soviet Union from Finland. His abrupt disappearance caused <b>much</b> <b>concern</b> to many of the western intelligence services, especially those of Britain, Canada and the United States, that were worried about the escape of atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and of Finland and Sweden, through which Pontecorvo and Marianne had been allowed to travel without valid passports and visas.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on September 26, 1913 and played in theaters throughout the United States. The unbilled cast list has been stated to include Lon Chaney {{in the role of}} the pawn broker. The propaganda film was billed as a popular love story by theaters, but the production was the subject of <b>much</b> <b>concern</b> by organized charities. The Charity Organization Societies sought to produce a film to counter the negative portrayal of charities in The Blood Red Tape of Charity. P. L. Whitney stopped short of directly calling the film's portrayal dangerous, but advocated that charity members use the media to highlight the film's faults and exaggerations. Patricia Erens would use the surviving film still of the pawn broker, claimed to be Lon Chaney by scholars, as an example of Jewish character archetypes that were prominent in silent films. The film is now considered lost.|$|E

According to Crystal (2005), these concerns are neither without grounds nor unseen in history – it surfaces almost always when a new technology breakthrough influences languages; as seen in the 15th century when printing was introduced, the 19th century when the telephone was invented and the 20th century when broadcasting began to penetrate our society.|$|E

25|$|After Bavaria's {{entry into}} the Empire, Ludwig II became {{increasingly}} detached from Bavaria's political affairs and spent vast amounts of money on personal projects, such as {{the construction of a}} number of fairytale castles and palaces, the most famous being the Wagnerian-style Castle Neuschwanstein. Ludwig used his personal wealth to finance these projects, and not state funds, and the construction projects landed him deeply in debt. These debts caused <b>much</b> <b>concern</b> among Bavaria's political elite, who sought to persuade Ludwig to cease his building; he refused, and relations between the government's ministers and the crown deteriorated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, the Chinese {{government}} began a crackdown on dissent, and Hua Hao Yue Yuan documents the stories of Liu Dejun and Liu Shasha, whose activism and outspoken attitude led them to violent abuse from the authorities.

The incidents attracted <b>much</b> <b>concern</b> over the Internet, as well as wide speculation and theories about what exactly happened. This documentary presents interviews of the two victims, witnesses and concerned netizens. In which it gathers various perspectives about the two beatings, and brings us closer to the brutal reality of China’s “crackdown on crime”.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{relied on}} depots much less {{frequently}} laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes {{were marked by}} the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has <b>much</b> <b>concern</b> recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots. It {{is also clear that}} Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they {{would have been able to}} travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.|$|E
