We show that the moral sentiments should be used chiefly to control externalities and further that guilt is best to employ when most harmful acts can successfully be deterred whereas virtue is best when only a few individuals can be induced to behave well.

50|$|In {{line with}} the {{interpretation}} of the film as a lesbian film, certain Western authors see the “inevitable” course of events as an ideological nexus between sinful desire, thus guilt, and necessary punishment. Thus, one author felt that “Twin Bracelets by Huang Yu-Shan … deals with the impossible price that must be paid as punishment for the transgression of conventional desires.” Apparently ignorant of Chinese socioculture which is not characterized by a Christian defamation of sexuality or haunted by guilt feelings associated with sexual desire, many Western critics typically underestimated the extent to which conflict with traditional customs and disrespect for or rebellion against traditional authority (of governments, superiors, fathers, husbands) is sanctioned. To the extent that the suspicion of lesbian love would have been aroused in the village, {{it would have been the}} departure from convention, not desire as such that would have given rise to disapproval. But a refusal to fulfill conventional expectations to get married and accept the role of a dutiful, obedient wife is clearly something that evokes greater scorn than any revelation of desire. And it is such a departure from the norm that leads to corresponding <b>moral</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Feminists like Huang Yu-shan turn against this traditional world view and thus against an ideology that has always evoked the age-old teachings of Confucius while serving to maintain repressive social and political relations that are contemporary.|$|R
5000|$|The quotation, in context, {{reads as}} follows (emphasis added): The {{foundation}} of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion {{does not make}} man. Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man - state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is {{the general theory of}} this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its <b>moral</b> <b>sanction,</b> its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion.Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.|$|E

5000|$|Christian Reconstructionists {{advocate}} a theonomic government and libertarian economic principles. They maintain a distinction of spheres of authority between family, church, and state. [...] For example, {{the enforcement of}} <b>moral</b> <b>sanctions</b> under theonomy is {{carried out by the}} family and church government, and <b>sanctions</b> for <b>moral</b> offenses are outside the authority of civil government (which is limited to criminal matters, courts and national defense). However, some believe these distinctions become blurred, as the application of theonomy implies an increase in the authority of the civil government. Reconstructionists argue, though, that under theonomy, the authority of the state is severely limited to a point where only the judicial branch exists (e.g., a homosexual does not fear of a police force breaking in their house at night, since, under theonomy, there is no executive branch and therefore no police). Reconstructionists also say that the theocratic government is not an oligarchy or monarchy of man communicating with God, but rather, a national recognition of existing laws. Prominent advocates of Christian Reconstructionism have written that according to their understanding, God's law approves of the death penalty not only for murder, but also for propagators of all forms of idolatry, active homosexuals, adulterers, practitioners of witchcraft, and blasphemers, and perhaps even recalcitrant youths (see the List of capital crimes in the Bible). American Vision's Joel McDurmon responded to these criticisms by denying that Reconstructionists have promoted coercive means.|$|R
30|$|In public {{campaign}} work, people participate by contributing labor, farm tools, etc. in {{watershed management}} activities through a ‘development team’. In each surveyed kebele, small ‘development teams’ have been organized. The {{number of members}} on a team depends on the local situation. The largest development team, with 35 members, existed in Sadoye kebele (Ofa wereda of Wolayita zone) and the smallest, with 3 members, was observed in Mari Madara kebele (Mareka wereda of Dawro zone). The team is responsible for developing and administering internal regulations that enforce, encourage, or punish absentees from campaign work. Since the implementation of watershed management campaign work is based on group consensus, the punishment on absentees is not particularly serious. For instance, in Zebecho, Soresha, Gede Genet, Ela Kabal, Abela Faracho and Adis Bodare kebele, some development teams only give advice and exercise no monetary or other penalties. The development teams in Gobo Shamenena, Zebecho, Megara, and Soresha kebele require that the absentees compensate missed work on another day(s) if they don’t have convincing reasons for not participating. Some development teams in Bucha, Hanja Chafa and Gendo Walcha kebeles financially penalize the absentees and use the collected money for strengthening the development work (e.g. purchasing farm tools). Gendo Walcha kebele uses some of the funds to partially pay guards to protect the exclosed site.

I will argue that Democritus’ account of the virtues and success is naturally interpreted as an intellectualist one.

40|$|This paper takes a constitutivist {{approach}} to self-deception, {{and argues that}} this phenomenon should be evaluated under several dimensions of rationality. The constitutivist approach has the merit of explaining the selective nature of self-deception {{as well as its}} being subject to <b>moral</b> <b>sanction.</b> Self-deception is a pragmatic strategy for maintaining the stability of the self, hence continuous with other rational activities of self-constitution. However, its success is limited, and it costs are high: it protects the agent’s self by undermining the authority she has on her mental life. To this extent, self-deception is akin to alienation and estrangement. Its morally disturbing feature is its self-serving partiality. The self-deceptive agent settles on standards of justification that are lower than any rational agent would adopt, and thus loses grip on her agency. To capture the moral dimension of self-deception, I defend a Kantian account of the constraints that bear on self-constitution, and argue that it warrants more discriminating standards of agential autonomy than other contemporary minimalist views of selfgovernment. 1...|$|E

These moral situations are posed {{in the form of}} questionnaire in Kohlburg's moral dilemma forms where possible; responses are open ended in some cases and rank order or single responses in other cases. The tests were administered to 180 adolescents, in schools and church groups in the area by, teachers and student teachers. The secondary variables of sex, age and social class were obtained for each respondent. The principal variables were religious denomination, church attendance, religious social group and type of religious education in school. Analysis of the results obtained consisted of the type of sanctions operating in the differing moral situation tests. These tended to be confined to the prudential, authoritarian, ego ideal and reciprocal areas. However, guilt in various forms was obvious, particularly in the stealing situations and these were categorised {{on the basis of a}} scale of guilt dimensions as used by Kohlburg. The primary and principal variables were compared by a process of cross tabulation, using Chi Squared and Kendall's Tau, with the sanctions operating in the differing moral situations. Developmental factors supporting Piaget and Bull’s work were operative throughout in the type of sanctions used. However, there was some difference according to the social setting of the test, whether in school, at home or 'out in society’. The overriding null hypothesis was that there was no/ relationship between the religious factors and the type of sanction operating.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present my {{interpretation}} of a moral discourse as it plays out in a Malay village {{in a period of}} social and cultural transformation related to the expansion of tourism. I argue that this moral discourse displays dilemmas that are anchored in central Malay beliefs, values and virtues. Some core aspects of this discourse, which can be recognised among Malays elsewhere, are especially prevalent and explicit in this village due to the massive presence of tourists as a significant Other and rapid transformations in the local economy over the past two decades. I have chosen an interpretive framework to show how the Malays indigenous psychology and cosmological orientations underpin the moral discourse as it plays out in the village. I show that the local Malays categorise the tourists and interpret the transformations - and what is commonly perceived as moral decline - in their own society, through central concepts from their indigenous psychology. I point out that semangat the vital life force in Malay cosmology - is seen to be weakened at different levels as cool (sejuk) and rational basis for behaviour, based on reason (akal) is seen to increasingly give way to heated (panas) behaviour based on desire (nafsu). When the semangat is weakened this is thought to make people less able to withstand negative influence from tourists. Such negative influence from outside further leads to actions which are defined as heated (panas), based on desire (nafsu) and which are not within the moral code of Islam and tradition (adat). This is experienced as resulting in a downward spiral of moral decline. In this thesis I do also present the dominant local explanations which view changes in patterns of production and exchange and availability of much more money as the engine of social, cultural and moral transformations in this society. I show that the introduction of monetary relations into areas where reciprocal ties used to be the norm, has reduced the relevance and reach of social and <b>moral</b> <b>sanctioning</b> mechanisms on which much of traditional authority was based. It has thus reduced the possibilities for social and moral control in the village. I point out that it is not mainly the presence of the tourists and their practices, but rather the changed patterns of production and exchange in this location, which explain these transformations. An extraordinary increase in money flow has been a result of the local tourism business, and this has weakened the mechanisms of social and moral control in the village, and provided radically increased opportunities to travel far beyond where the community can observe and <b>sanction</b> <b>moral</b> violations. These transformations have been fast and the moral community are no longer able to sanction its subjects as before. The traditional mechanisms for sanctions in the village have been become weaker and many men are now able to travel beyond the village community s moral control, which is referred to locally as to go for enjoy As a result many local Malays are increasingly accused by others in the local context of becoming tourists and loosing the vital life force - semangat...|$|R
