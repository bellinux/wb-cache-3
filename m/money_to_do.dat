5|$|The most {{pressing}} economic matter the Nazis initially faced was the 30 percent national unemployment rate. Economist Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics, created in May 1933 a scheme for deficit financing. Capital projects were {{paid for with}} the issuance of promissory notes called Mefo bills. When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. While the national debt soared, Hitler and his economic team expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the debt. Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Council in Ludlow Castle gave it a new lease of life, during {{a period in which}} many similar fortifications were falling into decay. By the 1530s, the castle needed considerable renovation; Lee began work in 1534, borrowing <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, but Sir Thomas Engleford complained the following year that the castle was still unfit for habitation. Lee repaired the castle roofs, probably using lead from the Carmelite friary in the town, and using the fines imposed and the goods confiscated by the court. He later claimed that the work on the castle would have cost around £500, had the Crown had to pay for it all directly. The porter's lodge and prison were built in the outer bailey around 1552. The woods around the castle were gradually cut down during the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|When {{the circus}} {{refused to pay}} freight charges {{to send it to}} Willow Bunch, Benard put the body on exhibit and charged {{admission}} to recoup embalming expenses. Because the Beaupré family was so poor, there was little its members could do to bring the Giant’s body home. Édouard’s father, Gaspard, travelled by train to Winnipeg with the intention of bringing his body to Willow Bunch for burial. However, when he was told he needed a double fare, he realized he did not have enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. As a result, Édouard’s family eventually assumed that his body was buried somewhere in St. Louis.|$|E

25|$|On June 1, 2008, Philadelphia Media Holdings missed its {{interest}} payment on US$85 million in junior loans. Philadelphia Media Holdings missed the payment because it didn't maintain debt-to-cash flow ratio its senior lenders required so they blocked the payment. The company began negotiations with its lenders to restructure its debt and in October 2008 Philadelphia Media Holdings deferred paying {{its interest}} payment despite having the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Charged $13.4 million in penalty interest and fees, Philadelphia Media Holdings continued negotiations with lenders until February 20, 2009, when the talks collapsed. Late {{the next day}} Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the papers, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

The two had been holding a secret affair, with Nonnie becoming pregnant with Tracy's child, only for Tracy to at one point plan for her to marry 'Big Henry', a man she despises. Tracy himself had originally planned to marry another white townsperson, but changed his mind after a conversation with one of the local preachers and intends on making his relationship with Nonnie public. He instead goes to Nonnie's house and tells her of his original intent to have her wed to Big Henry, having paid him <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Despite this change of heart, Nonnie's brother overhears Big Henry telling of Tracy's payment and Big Henry's impending wedding to Nonnie and why.

500|$|Fragile Allegiance was {{generally}} well received, achieving average to good scores from reviewers. It was praised for its graphics and icon driven interface which was considered slick and well integrated {{but a little}} confusing at first. Reviewers noted that after figuring out what all the icons did the game was immensely engrossing, with the player always having something to do. The game was criticised for its difficulty, its simplistic combat model, the time spent transporting ore between asteroids, and {{the large amount of}} micromanagement involved when the player's empire got large — although reviewers noted that the latter two could be countered by the [...] "Ore Teleporter blueprint" [...] and Colony Supervisors respectively. There were mixed feelings regarding the replacing of research with the Sci-Tek blueprint system, which meant that any blueprint could be bought in any order provided the player had the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
500|$|With 54,288 total entries and a {{combined}} prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP {{was the largest}} series of poker tournaments ever.

[...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. [...] After winning $8.25million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. [...] "My winning today also means a lot to me, because I know that I can use this <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a lot of good for other people out there," [...] Yang said before donating over a million dollars to charity.

500|$|Bazy (then Miller) was {{publisher}} of the newspaper for only 19 months. By April 1951, McCormick and his niece developed differences of opinions over both the newspaper and her relationship with Garvin Tankersley. She later said, [...] "I understood when I went to the Times-Herald I was to have full control. That control was not given me... There is some difference in our political beliefs. I have broader Republican views than [...] has. I am for the same people as the colonel, but I am for some more people." [...] McCormick also told her to decide between Garvin Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she resigned from the Times-Herald. McCormick tried to run the paper himself, but lost money on the venture, and sold the Times-Herald to The Washington Post in 1954. When he announced the sale, one of the paper's board members insisted that Bazy Tankersley be {{given a chance to}} purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Upon the purchase of the Times-Herald, the Post consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper. Though estranged for many years, Bazy and McCormick reconciled prior to his death.|$|E
500|$|In {{keeping with}} Sifton's policy of {{excluding}} all prominent {{players in the}} A affair from cabinet, Cross was not re-appointed (Cushing, Rutherford, and Boyle were also left out). Despite this, Cross declared his support for Sifton's government while restating his admiration for Rutherford's. In response to the A's default of its obligations to the government, Sifton introduced a bill confiscating the money the A had raised through the sale of government-guaranteed bonds. Cross, still a supporter of building the A and concerned that the bill {{did not include a}} commitment to use the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, opposed it. The bill passed, but was disallowed by the courts. Sifton, left with little choice but to use the money for the purpose for which it had been raised, announced a new policy of railway construction. At the same time, he invited Cross to resume his post as Attorney-General. Boyle was also admitted to cabinet, as Minister of Education; Cushing and Rutherford, the other major players in the A affair, had withdrawn from the limelight, and neither would return to the legislature after the 1913 election. Cross accepted Sifton's offer, telling the public that Sifton's new railway policy [...] "made it proper for me to support and join his government".|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{explained}} that the cast listing for the episode, along with [...] "Patient X" [...] was [...] "longer than most cast lists you'll ever see on a TV series". In order {{to allow for the}} increased expenses of hiring additional actors, Carter and the producers of the series talked Fox into allowing the episodes to be slightly more expensive because they would lead into the soon-to-be-released X-Files movie. Carter explained, [...] "we convinced them to spend the extra <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this extra special work because it was all leading up to [...] when the X-Files movie would be released." [...] In addition, the child he gave the message to was a young boy and the son of production manager J.P. Finn. Rob Bowman originally intended to direct the episode but, due to reshoots, he was unable to do it, resulting in Carter directing. Bowman later recounted, [...] "I was supposed to direct 'The Red and the Black' [...] but we were prepping for the reshoots [...] so I couldn't do it. [...] Chris had to direct this episode. He was so mad at me." [...] When filming the scene where Mulder and Scully go to a medic station, Carter made homage to the medical drama ER, filming it entirely with a Steadicam.|$|E
