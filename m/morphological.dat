5|$|In {{explaining}} {{this separation}} of species, Rasmussen points to <b>morphological</b> divergence and {{significant differences in}} vocalization. Ornithologist Edward C. Dickinson observed in a 2006 article that though evidence of <b>morphological</b> and vocal differences between S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been delineated, little had yet been published presenting comparative <b>morphological</b> details, {{and that it would}} be instructive to study how each taxon responds to the calls of the other.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus, but <b>morphological</b> identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping <b>morphological</b> variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, {{presence or absence of}} cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for <b>morphological</b> species delimitation in the genus.|$|E
5|$|According to Li (2005), several <b>morphological</b> {{features}} of A. longicervia indicate {{a close relationship}} to Sarraceniaceae: both taxa exhibit one or two pitcher wings, a smooth peristome, and pitchers that extend vertically {{from the top of}} a short petiole.|$|E
5|$|All tansy beetles are small, rounded beetles {{approximately}} 7–12mm in length. There {{are both}} internal and external <b>morphological</b> differences between the six subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>morphological</b> similarities, the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the last Ice Age, but, like the woolly mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some <b>morphological</b> studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E
5|$|Compounding of noun {{roots to}} form new nouns is commonplace; {{there are also}} many <b>morphological</b> {{processes}} to derive nouns from verbs. Verbs also admit highly productive derivational affixes of several kinds, most of which specify transitivity or voice.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the slight}} <b>morphological</b> {{differences}} between the two, wild parsnip is the same taxon as the cultivated version, and the two readily cross-pollinate. Parsnip has a chromosome number of 2n=22.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the group (tribe) to which hammondi {{and the related}} species mentioned above belong. He used both <b>morphological</b> and molecular characters, but had only <b>morphological</b> data for Oryzomys hammondi. The placement of the species in his results was unstable; some trees placed it close to the tree rice rats, Oecomys, within clade B and others placed it as an isolated lineage, basal to all other Oryzomyini.|$|E
5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} <b>morphological</b> {{and physiological}} changes. An advantage of inducible, as opposed to constitutive defenses, {{is that they are}} only produced when needed, and are therefore potentially less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{plants of}} {{agricultural}} importance, several subspecies and varieties of P.sativa have been described, {{but these are}} mostly no longer recognized as independent taxa, but rather, <b>morphological</b> variations of the same taxon.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major <b>morphological</b> categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores <b>morphological</b> characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering {{many of the questions}} about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus but identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping <b>morphological</b> variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, {{presence or absence of}} cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for <b>morphological</b> species delimitation in the genus. Volvopluteus michiganensis is distinguished from other species of Volvopluteus by its relatively shorter spores, measuring on average less than 12.5µm long.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} shown that the current species concept for H.repandum may need {{revision}} as there is a poor overlap between <b>morphological</b> and molecular species concepts. Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based on internal transcribed spacer and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicates that H.repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent <b>morphological</b> distinction is cap size. These genetic differences may indicate the presence of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Morphological</b> {{analyses}} tend {{to recover}} a conchiferan clade that receives less support from molecular analyses, although these results {{also lead to}} unexpected paraphylies, for instance scattering the bivalves throughout all other mollusc groups.|$|E
5|$|No modern trace {{remains of}} the slower Italian Slow Heavy Draft Horse, the Cavallo Italiano da Tiro Pesante Lento, subject of a {{biometric}} and <b>morphological</b> study in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Once {{placed in}} the family Triakidae, the whitetip reef shark is now {{recognized}} by most authors as belonging to the family Carcharhinidae {{on the basis of}} <b>morphological</b> characters, such as a full nictitating membrane, well-developed precaudal pit, strong lower caudal fin lobe, and scroll-like intestinal valves. <b>Morphological</b> and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest the whitetip reef shark is grouped with the lemon sharks (Negaprion) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E
5|$|Originally {{placed in}} the genus Microcebus (mouse lemurs), the giant mouse lemur was moved to its own genus, Mirza, in 1985 due to its larger size, <b>morphological</b> differences, dental characteristics, and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of <b>morphological</b> characteristics and gene sequences {{has supported the}} basal position within the genus long suspected of D.regia, often regarded as the most ancient of all extant Drosera species. Its distinct morphology and unique relict characteristics, ones it likely shared with the common ancestor of all Drosera such as the operculate pollen, led early researchers to suggest its ancient position in the genus. The first cladistic analysis based on rbcL and <b>morphological</b> data confirmed these ideas and suggested that D.regia formed a clade sister to all other Drosera surveyed, with Dionaeamuscipula forming a sister clade to all Drosera. Further analysis in 2002 based on the nuclear 18S rDNA, plastid DNA (rbcL, matK, atpB), and <b>morphological</b> data confirmed these relationships, supporting the basal position of D.regia in the genus and its close relationship with Dionaea and Aldrovanda. New analysis in 2003 revealed a close relationship between D.regia and D.arcturi, both of which clustered basally with respect to all other Drosera, suggesting a link between D.regia and all other Drosera through its relationship with D.arcturi.|$|E
5|$|Recent work in {{developmental}} biology has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis that may underlie abrupt <b>morphological</b> transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change {{that have been}} found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, particularly in studies of the origin of <b>morphological</b> novelty. A description of such mechanisms {{can be found in the}} multi-authored volume Origination of Organismal Form (MIT Press; 2003).|$|E
5|$|Several phylogenetic studies {{published}} {{during the}} 1990s and 2000s supported {{a close relationship}} between Pseudoryzomys and two other oryzomyines with reduced or absent mesoloph(id)s, Lundomys and Holochilus. The extinct genera Noronhomys and Carletonomys, described in 1999 and 2008 respectively, were also recognized {{as members of the}} group. In 2006, a broad <b>morphological</b> and molecular phylogenetic study of Oryzomyini provided further support for the relationship between Holochilus, Lundomys, and Pseudoryzomys. Within this group, <b>morphological</b> data supported a closer relationship between Holochilus and Lundomys to the exclusion of Pseudoryzomys, but DNA sequence data favored a clustering between Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys to the exclusion of Lundomys; among all oryzomyines, this was the only case where relationships which received strong support from <b>morphological</b> and DNA sequence data conflicted. Together, the three genera form part of a large group of oryzomyines ("clade D"), which contains tens of other species. Several of those display some adaptations to life in the water, being partially aquatic, as do Pseudoryzomys and its relatives. <b>Morphological</b> data indicate that the genus Oryzomys is the closest relative of the group that includes Pseudoryzomys, but DNA sequence data from the nuclear IRBP gene did not support this relationship; convergent adaptations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle may explain the <b>morphological</b> support for a relation between Oryzomys and the other three genera.|$|E
5|$|Some {{combined}} {{studies in}} 2000 and 2001, using both molecular and <b>morphological</b> data, support brachiopods as Lophotrochozoa, while others in 1998 and 2004 concluded that brachiopods were deuterostomes.|$|E
5|$|The cat {{is larger}} in its {{northern}} range and in open habitats. A <b>morphological</b> size comparison {{study in the}} eastern United States found a divergence in {{the location of the}} largest male and female specimens, suggesting differing selection constraints for the sexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{mourning}} dove {{was thought to}} be the passenger pigeon's closest living relative, based on <b>morphological</b> grounds. The {{mourning dove}} was even suggested to belong to the same genus, Ectopistes, and was listed by some authors as E. carolinensis.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Trigonognathus within the Etmopteridae is uncertain. <b>Morphological</b> and molecular phylogenetic data generally support the subdivision of the Etmopteridae into two clades, one consisting of Etmopterus and Miroscyllium {{and the other}} consisting of Centroscyllium and Aculeola. Phylogenetic analyses have variously placed Trigonognathus as closer to one clade or the other or as basal to both, depending on which <b>morphological</b> characters, nuclear DNA markers, and/or mitochondrial DNA markers were used.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby {{is listed}} as Least Concern by the IUCN, because of its {{abundance}} and presumably stable population. However, the fragmentation of its range has led to high amounts of inbreeding and <b>morphological</b> abnormalities in some populations.|$|E
5|$|While the {{previous}} grouping had good <b>morphological</b> support, molecular studies do not corroborate the monophyly of this group. Previously Mysida included two other families, Lepidomysidae and Stygiomysidae, but these {{have now been}} placed in a separate order, Stygiomysida.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{mechanisms}} limit {{the success of}} hybridization, including the large genetic difference between most species. Barriers include <b>morphological</b> differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization; others after it.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{knowledge}} of plant anatomy, morphology and life cycles {{led to the}} realisation {{that there were more}} natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. Adanson (1763), de Jussieu (1789), and Candolle (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The Candollean system reflected his ideas of the progression of <b>morphological</b> complexity and the later classification by Bentham and Hooker, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere <b>morphological</b> similarity.|$|E
5|$|P. l. vereshchagini, the Beringian cave lion of Yakutia (Russia), Alaska (United States), and the Yukon Territory (Canada), {{has been}} {{considered}} a subspecies separate from P. l. spelaea on <b>morphological</b> grounds. However, mitochondrial DNA sequences obtained from cave lion fossils from Europe and Alaska were indistinguishable.|$|E
5|$|Pacific {{populations of}} the false {{catshark}} were once regarded as a separate species, P. acrales. However, <b>morphological</b> comparisons have failed to find any consistent differences between P. microdon and P. acrales, leading {{to the conclusion that}} there is only one species of false catshark. The closest relatives of the false catshark are the gollumsharks (Gollum). Pseudotriakis and Gollum share a number of <b>morphological</b> similarities. Phylogenetic analysis using protein-coding genes has found that the amount of genetic divergence between these taxa is less than that between some other shark species within the same genus. This result suggests that the many autapomorphies (unique traits) of the false catshark evolved relatively recently, and supports the grouping of Pseudotriakis and Gollum together in the family Pseudotriakidae.|$|E
25|$|<b>Morphological</b> {{structures}} development occurs over {{a period}} of several years. Before language is acquired, children lack any use of <b>morphological</b> structures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Morphological</b> {{dependencies}} obtain between {{words or}} parts of words. When a given word or part of a word influences the form of another word, then the latter is morphologically dependent on the former. Agreement and concord are therefore manifestations of <b>morphological</b> dependencies. Like semantic dependencies, <b>morphological</b> dependencies can overlap with and point {{in the same direction}} as syntactic dependencies, overlap with and point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The arrows are now used to indicate <b>morphological</b> dependencies.|$|E
25|$|Classification {{has been}} revised along genetic lines. There are two <b>morphological</b> forms of Ursus arctos, the grizzly and the coastal brown bears, but these <b>morphological</b> forms {{do not have}} {{distinct}} mtDNA lineages.|$|E
25|$|While {{it appears}} that caste might be {{discernible}} through ovary development, the absence of <b>morphological</b> differences between individuals in B. lecheguana {{suggests that there is}} no meaningful <b>morphological</b> caste. However it is clear that individuals can be designated reproductives and nonreproductives.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between alienable and inalienable possession is often marked with various morphosyntactic properties such as <b>morphological</b> markers and word order. There {{is a strong}} typological pattern for inalienable possession to require fewer <b>morphological</b> markers than alienable possession constructions.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus but <b>morphological</b> identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping <b>morphological</b> variation among the species. Size of the basidiocarps, color of the pileus, spore size, {{presence or absence of}} cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for <b>morphological</b> species delimitation in the genus. Volvopluteus asiaticus stands apart from other species by the pleurocystidia provided with apical excrescences and the cheilocystidia that are predominantly lageniform.|$|E
