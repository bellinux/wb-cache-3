500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let <b>me</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, {{preferred}} Sony's console to {{the competition}} from Sega, saying [...] "Our game designer likes the Sony machine." [...] Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, Famicom Tsūshin would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation {{a few weeks after}} its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is [...] "fairly average", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, [...] "To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war." [...] An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, [...] "Live in your world. Play in ours." [...] It is stylised as, [...] "LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS." [...] Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled [...] "You Are Not Ready" [...] or [...] "U R NOT [...]" [...] Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that [...] "it's the ultimate challenge. Gamers love to respond to that tag line and say 'Bullshit. Let <b>me</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how ready I am.'" ...|$|E
