40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} player performance on free agency <b>contract</b> <b>values</b> in Major League Baseball (MLB). We hypothesize that performance, as measured by Wins Above Replacement (WAR), has {{a positive effect on}} the <b>contract</b> <b>value.</b> To test this, we specify and estimate a linear regression for <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> as a function of current and lagged WAR values and other control variables. Using data from 82 major league position players during the 2013 and 2014 seasons, our results indicate that the current and lagged values of WAR have a significant, positive effect on <b>contract</b> <b>value.</b> Among the control variables, the contract length has a significant, positive effect on the <b>contract</b> <b>value.</b> The model is used to predict free agent <b>contract</b> <b>values</b> set during the 2015 off-season. This prediction for 25 players has an average error of 35 %, without systematic over-or under-prediction...|$|R

40|$|In {{supply chain}} management, it is {{prevalent}} to design contract for coordination or proper risk-sharing {{in the supply}} chain. However, when a supply chain contract is developed based {{on the concept of}} expectation (e. g., expected profit), there is uncertainty risk with respect to the <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> which arises from various uncertainties inherent in the supply chain, such as demand uncertainty, price uncertainty, etc. We call such uncertainty risk associated with the <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> risk since it relates to the true <b>value</b> of the <b>contract.</b> <b>Value</b> risk is obviously an important factor in the design and analysis of a supply chain contract. In addition, individual supply chain agents with different risk preferences will have different risk attitudes towards the <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> risk, which affects their decisions under the contract. Motivated by the above, we conduct in this paper a mean-risk analysis for the commonly adopted wholesale price contracts with a supplier-retailer supply chain facing a stochastic price-dependent downward-sloping demand curve, taking into account <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> risk and the retailer's degree of risk-aversion. Formulating the problem under study as a supplier-led Stackelberg game, we characterize the wholesale price contract model analytically in terms of only the retailer's risk preference structure, and derive all the results in closed-form. This study makes the first attempt to assess the efficiency of wholesale price <b>contracts</b> incorporating <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> risk, and thereby some interesting managerial and academic insights are obtained. Our research provides a new perspective of looking at the performance of a supply chain contract. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
