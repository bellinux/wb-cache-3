The high levels of mobile device ownership and increased access to social <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> enables the potential for ‘anytime, anywhere’ cooperation and collaboration in education. While recent reports into emerging technologies in higher education predict {{an increase in the}} use of mobile devices and social <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> (Horizon Report, 2013), {{there is a lack of}} theory-based research to indicate how these technologies can be most effectively harnessed to support and enhance student learning and what the impacts of these technologies are on both students and educators. In response to the need to understand how these technologies can be better embraced within higher education, this study investigated how first year education students used mobile devices and social <b>media</b> <b>technologies.</b> More specifically, the study identified how students spent most of their time when connected online with mobile devices and social <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> and whether the online connected time engaged them in their learning or whether it was a distraction...|$|R

The Animal Lover projects are often produced in collaboration with companion dogs Tom and Sugi where respect, fun and challenge are employed in the process. The dogs participate directly in the research and content creation of the work by suggesting ideas for projects and by determining the material for production. Also, aleatoric and improvisational methods are used that provide for a chance, open-ended expectation, surprise and learning.|$|E
25|$|New Media as the Encoding of Modernist Avant-Garde; New Media as Metamedia Manovich {{declares}} that the 1920s are {{more relevant to}} New Media than any other time period. Metamedia coincides with postmodernism in that they both rework old work rather than create new work. New media avant-garde is about new ways of accessing and manipulating information (e.g. hypermedia, databases, search engines, etc.). Meta-media {{is an example of}} how quantity can change into quality as in new <b>media</b> <b>technology</b> and manipulation techniques can recode modernist aesthetics into a very different postmodern aesthetics.|$|E

25|$|Interactivity can be {{considered}} a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable different degrees of interactivity, and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman considers digital satellite television {{as an example of a}} new <b>media</b> <b>technology</b> that uses digital compression to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature of what can be offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user's point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that interactivity is not an inherent characteristic of all new media technologies, unlike digitization and convergence.|$|E
25|$|In this way, Wodiczko {{continued}} in his testimonial video projections {{to respond to}} the needs of urban society’s marginal citizens who frequently survive outside the usual boundaries of juridical and social resources. In 2001, he merged the means of his instruments with the purpose of the projections in his Tijuana Projection executed for InSite 2000. In this public intervention, women working in the “maquiladora” industry of Tijuana, Mexico wore <b>media</b> <b>technology</b> designed to project their faces onto El Centro Cultural as they spoke emotionally of incest, police abuse, and work place discrimination in real time. As participants, their parrhesiastic speech was courageously offered at great risk to themselves for the purpose of moral and political change. Through the video projections, Wodiczko continues to develop the potential for aesthetic practice to effect social change as part of a wider discourse on agonistic pluralism prompted by such influences as Chantal Mouffe and Ludwig Wittgenstein.|$|E
25|$|When {{we think}} of {{interactivity}} and its meaning, we assume {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new <b>media</b> <b>technology</b> was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E

25|$|The Faculty of Arts offers {{undergraduate}} major {{programs in}} immunology, international relations, and ethics, society, and law {{to students at}} the university. Associated with the latter two is an academic program called Trinity One. Admission to the Trinity One program is separate {{from that of the}} college itself, with enrollment limited to 25 students per stream. At least one prominent professor teaches in each stream; for example, Robert Bothwell in the International Relations stream Mark Kingwell in Ethics, Society, and Law.

500|$|Cooper {{discusses}} how {{he feels}} Minority Report emphasizes the future importance over the control of imagery. According to him, the images captured from the precogs' visions in the film bestow power on those who control their processing. He says the film warns viewers that those who control images must be carefully overseen so as to prevent the abuse of power, and that the film presents [...] "governance as a problem of image arrangement." [...] The film also presents a future world where government probes use advanced <b>media</b> <b>technology</b> to monitor its citizenry. Cooper says the quandary arises when the film intimates that there were will be no way to escape the media industry's omnipotence in the future, {{while at the same}} time defending [...] "the need for image manipulating institutions." [...] He feels that this logically raises another issue in that the same concern could be leveled towards image-makers such as DreamWorks, and he says the [...] "film's virtue lies in provoking this question." [...] He notes that the film's tranquil ending concludes with the Andertons looking out into a peaceful exterior with only rain visible, and the precogs reading in their isolated, idyllic farm, and both families apparently free of electronic surveillance.|$|E

40|$|This study uses an ethnographic {{approach}} (in-depth {{interviews and}} newsrooms observations) combined with Critical Discourse Analysis to closely interrogate how journalists in four Nigerian print newsrooms; The Punch, Vanguard, Nigerian Tribune and Guardian, appropriate ‘alternative media’ content and new <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> in their newsmaking practices. The choice {{of these four}} newsrooms enables a detailed reading of how the process of appropriating new <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> and alternative <b>media</b> content takes place in Nigerian print newsrooms. The study explores how and whether (or not) these appropriations are impacting on institutional practices of Nigerian print journalists. It also sheds light on the spaces which new <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> negotiate in these newsrooms and how these journalists negotiate the appropriation of alternative media content. Beyond the everyday newsmaking practices, the study uses the reporting of two key events; the Nigerian elections of 2011 and the Occupy Nigeria protests of 2012 to show how journalists in Nigerian print newsrooms negotiate their appropriation of alternative media content and new <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> in reporting key events. Together, these examples highlight the creative appropriation of new <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> in Nigerian print newsrooms {{and the need to}} avoid technological determinist perspectives which totalise experiences elsewhere as being universal. The study therefore reinvigorates the continued relevance of newsroom ethnography and argues that a sociological approach, which importantly considers local context imperatives, remains useful in understanding how Nigerian print journalists appropriate new <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> and the resulting alternative journalisms. The findings of the study provide useful insights into the journalistic cultures in Nigerian print newsrooms and highlights how these journalists negotiate their appropriation of alternative media content. While the (disruptive) impact of new <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> on newsmaking practices in these newsrooms cannot be ignored, the study finds that a number of local context factors constrain and shape how appropriations take place in these newsrooms. Thus, Nigerian print journalists appropriate alternative media and new <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> to suit traditional journalistic practices. The study’s contribution to knowledge therefore lies in acknowledging that, beyond binary assumptions about the impact of new <b>media</b> <b>technologies</b> on journalism practices in Africa, particularly Nigeria, there is the need to consider the creative and complex ways in which journalists in these contexts appropriate these technologies. This study should thus be read as a step towards that end...|$|R
