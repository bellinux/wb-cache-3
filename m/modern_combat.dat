5|$|In 1940, Eichelberger {{became the}} Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He instituted {{a number of}} reforms, cutting back {{activities}} such as horseback riding and close order drill, and substituting <b>modern</b> <b>combat</b> training, in which cadets participated in military exercises alongside National Guard units. He acquired Stewart Field as a training facility, which gave cadets a chance to qualify as pilots while still at West Point. He became commander of the 77th Infantry Division in March 1942, and I Corps in June.|$|E

25|$|The {{modernisation}} stall {{ended in}} April 2006 when the Pakistani cabinet approved the PAF's proposals to procure new aircraft and systems from several sources, including <b>modern</b> <b>combat</b> aircraft from the U.S. and China.

25|$|The Netherlands, in {{urgent need}} of <b>modern</b> <b>combat</b> aircraft, placed {{an order for}} 18 Model 8A-3Ns in 1939, with all being {{delivered}} {{by the end of}} the year. Used in a fighter role for which they were unsuited, the majority were destroyed by Luftwaffe attacks on 10 May 1940, the first day of the German invasion.|$|E
25|$|The {{helicopter}} {{has added}} {{much to the}} exploitation of the modern battlefield, changing traditional war-fighting scenarios {{to the extent that}} entirely new strategies and tactics have been developed both to utilise and deny the capabilities of these aircraft. In the air, against land-based threats, and at sea, helicopters can be used in offensive, defensive and transportation capacities to react swiftly to the fluid tactical conditions <b>modern</b> <b>combat</b> imposes on the battlefield.|$|E
50|$|The salvo combat model {{provides}} a mathematical representation of anti-ship missile battles between modern warships. It {{was developed by}} Wayne Hughes at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. The salvo model describes {{the basic elements of}} <b>modern</b> missile <b>combat</b> in a very simple manner. This is similar to how Lanchester's Square Law {{provides a}} simple model of <b>modern</b> gun <b>combat.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Eurofighter Typhoon {{is unique}} in <b>modern</b> <b>combat</b> {{aircraft}} in that there are four separate assembly lines. Each partner company assembles its own national aircraft, but builds the same parts for all aircraft (including exports); Premium AEROTEC (main centre fuselage), EADS CASA (right wing, leading edge slats), BAE Systems (front fuselage (including foreplanes), canopy, dorsal spine, tail fin, inboard flaperons, rear fuselage section) and Leonardo (left wing, outboard flaperons, rear fuselage sections).|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War meant Iraq had military equipment from almost every major arms-selling country. This {{resulted in a}} lack of standardization in this large heterogeneous force, which additionally suffered from poor training and poor motivation. The majority of Iraqi armoured forces still used old Chinese Type 59s and Type 69s, Soviet-made T-55s from the 1950s and 1960s, and some T-72s from the 1970s in 1991. These machines were not equipped with up-to-date equipment, such as thermal sights or laser rangefinders, and their effectiveness in <b>modern</b> <b>combat</b> was very limited. The Iraqis failed to find an effective countermeasure to the thermal sights and the sabot rounds used by the M1 Abrams, Challenger 1 and the other Coalition tanks. This equipment enabled Coalition tanks to effectively engage and destroy Iraqi tanks from {{more than three times}} the distance that Iraqi tanks could engage.|$|E
25|$|Following Chennault's advice, Generalissimo Chiang {{rejected}} the proposal; British commanders sided with Chennault, aware {{they could not}} launch a coordinated Allied offensive into Burma in 1943 with the resources then available. During the summer of 1943, Stilwell's headquarters concentrated on plans to rebuild the Chinese Army for an offensive in northern Burma, despite Chiang's insistence on support to Chennault's air operations. Stilwell believed that after forcing a supply route through northern Burma {{by means of a}} major ground offensive against the Japanese, he could train and equip thirty Chinese divisions with <b>modern</b> <b>combat</b> equipment. A smaller number of Chinese forces would transfer to India, where two or three new Chinese divisions would also be raised. This plan remained only theoretical at the time, since the limited available airlift capacity for deliveries of supplies to China over the Hump was used to sustain Chennault's air operations instead of equipping Chinese ground units.|$|E

25|$|Trolls are {{the least}} {{intelligent}} of the non-magical creatures. Most of their decisions are based on their instincts. They are quick for their size and have large serrated tusks which produce a narcotic venom which renders the prey mindlessly—and defenselessly—happy. If they can, their preferred kill tactic is to slip their claws under the rib cage and pop the heart out before the muscles have time to tense up, rendering the meat mostly unharmed and tender. They have an extreme aversion to light, noise, and water. The largest pack of trolls were seen in the Eleven Wonders of the World Exhibit in a run-down part of Haven. Very few people have ever managed to single-handedly down a troll. Holly Short once did it with her helmet's eight-hundred-watt high beams, {{the shock of the}} light rendering the troll unconscious. Domovoi Butler became the only human ever to do so with a combination of medieval weaponry and <b>modern</b> <b>combat</b> techniques.|$|E

500|$|As superintendent, Eichelberger {{attempted}} to [...] "bring West Point {{into the twentieth}} century". He cut back activities such as horseback riding and close order drill, and substituted <b>modern</b> <b>combat</b> training, in which cadets participated in military exercises alongside National Guard units. He acquired Stewart Field as a training facility, and required cadets to undergo basic flight training. This gave cadets a chance to qualify as pilots while still at West Point. Yet he also concerned himself with the dismal state of the West Point football team. Through Pa Watson, {{he was able to}} persuade the Surgeon General of the United States Army to waive weight restrictions to allow heavier players to be recruited, and hired Earl Blaik to coach the team.|$|E
500|$|Several of the U.S. ships {{detected}} the approaching Japanese on radar, beginning at about 01:24, but had trouble communicating {{the information to}} Callaghan due to problems with radio equipment, lack of discipline regarding communications procedures, and general inexperience in operating as a cohesive naval unit. Messages were sent and received but did not reach the commander in time to be processed and used. With his limited understanding of the new technology, Admiral Callaghan wasted further time trying to reconcile the range and bearing information reported by radar with his limited sight picture, to no avail. Lacking a <b>modern</b> <b>Combat</b> Information Center (CIC), where incoming information could be quickly processed and co-ordinated, the radar operator was reporting on vessels that were not in sight, while Callaghan was trying to coordinate the battle visually, from the bridge. (Post battle analysis of this and other early surface actions would lead directly {{to the introduction of}} modern CICs early in 1943.) ...|$|E
