In images of natural scenes the difference in the fractions such as vegetation and bare soil occurring in two different dates tend to present a distribution symmetric about the origin. This fact can be used to model two overlapping multivariate Normal distributions: change, no-change. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM) is implemented to estimate the parameters (mean vector, covariance matrix and a priori probability) associated with these two distributions. Random samples are extracted from these two distributions and used to train a SVM classifier in this semi-supervised approach.

40|$|Abstract—This letter {{presents}} a novel parcel-based context-sensitive technique for unsupervised change detection in very high geometrical resolution images. In {{order to improve}} pixel-based change-detection performance, we propose to exploit the spatial-context information {{in the framework of}} a multilevel approach. The proposed technique models the scene (and hence changes) at different resolution levels defining multitemporal and multilevel “parcels ” (i. e., small homogeneous regions shared by both original images). Change detection is achieved by applying a multilevel change vector analysis to each pixel of the considered images. This technique properly analyzes the multilevel and multitem-poral parcel-based context information of the considered spatial position. The adaptive nature of multitemporal parcels and their multilevel representation allow one a proper modeling of complex objects in the investigated scene as well as borders and details of the changed areas.

Under this concept, a novel approach to detect changes in multitemporal remote sensing image data is proposed in this paper.
