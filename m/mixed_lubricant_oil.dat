In order to collectwear debris of non-ferrousmetalmaterial more effectively and deposit {{them on a}} ferrogram in a stable deposit-ing ratio, themethodof employingmagnetic fluid as amagnetization agent to collect non-ferrous wear debris in ferrography was attempted. Magnetic fluid constituting Fe 3 O 4 magnetic particles was prepared using a precipitation reaction. Tetrachloroethylene {{was used as a}} carrier liquid to ensure that magnetic fluid can be easily <b>mixed</b> with <b>lubricant</b> <b>oil</b> sample. Oleic acid was used as a surfactant, which enables magnetic particles to adhere to the surface of non-ferrous wear debris. Then the non-ferrous wear debris was magnetized and deposited on a ferrogram in a sta-ble depositing ratio. Copper debris was chosen as an example of non-ferrous debris to illustrate the magnetization effect of the magnetic fluid. With the help of magnetic fluid, the ferrographic analyst will achieve the operating condition of the machine more accurately...|$|R

Different contaminants have different physicochemical properties, which influence the geochemical reactions induced in the soils and may bring about changes in their engineering and environmental behaviour. Several technologies exist for the remediation of contaminated soil and water. In the present study soil washing technique using plain water with surfactants as an enhancer was used to study the remediation of soil contaminated with (i) an organic contaminant (engine <b>lubricant</b> <b>oil)</b> and (ii) an inorganic contaminant (heavy metal). The <b>lubricant</b> engine <b>oil</b> was used at different percentages (by dry weight of the soil) to artificially contaminate the soil. It was found that geotechnical properties of the soil underwent large modifications on account of <b>mixing</b> with the <b>lubricant</b> <b>oil.</b> The sorption experiments were conducted with cadmium metal in aqueous medium at different initial concentration of the metal and at varying pH values of the sorbing medium. For the remediation of contaminated soil matrices, a nonionic surfactant was used for the restoration of geotechnical properties of <b>lubricant</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated soil samples, whereas an anionic surfactant was employed to desorb cadmium from the contaminated soil matrix. The surfactant in case of soil contaminated with the <b>lubricant</b> <b>oil</b> was able to restore properties to an extent of 98 % vis-à-vis the virgin soil, while up to 54 % cadmium was desorbed from the contaminated soil matrix in surfactant aided desorption experiments...|$|R

In Addition to the direct observations during field visits, questionnaires were distributed to the staff of selected fuel service stations and many photographs were taken from different used oil sites. The major results obtained during this research indicate the possibility of polluting the sewage drainage system with pollutants resulting from such oils at a percentage reaching, up to 54 %, which is a high percentage since it might affect drinking water for humans, animals and plants as well. This is beside the risks attributed to the non – availability of fire extinguishers and other safety personal protective equipment.
