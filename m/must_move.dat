5|$|Tales of Legendia is a console {{role-playing}} game set in {{a fantasy}} world featuring three-dimensional characters and environments. The game is presented from a top-down perspective, and players <b>must</b> <b>move</b> their character {{through a number of}} locales, battle monsters, and interact with non-player characters to advance the story. Unlike previous games in the series where monsters were visible before being encountered, Tales of Legendia features randomized battles that occur every few steps while inside dungeons or other hostile areas.|$|E
5|$|The Witches, 2013, by Martin Wallace, {{published}} by Treefrog Games. This {{is a game}} aimed at younger or more family oriented players. They <b>must</b> <b>move</b> around the town of Lancre and its surrounds, dealing with 'problems' ranging from a sick pig, to an invasion by vampires. Each player has a one-use special power. It is a semi-cooperative game, in that all players can lose if the game wins, but if they resolve all the problems, then {{one of them will}} win.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Snake Eater {{is similar}} to that of previous games in the Metal Gear Solid series. Snake, controlled by the player, <b>must</b> <b>move</b> undetected through a hostile, enemy-filled environment. Although Snake acquires various weapons (ranging from handguns to rocket propelled grenades), the emphasis is on using stealth to avoid confrontations. A number of objects and gadgets can be found along the way to aid in this, including motion detectors to track hostile soldiers, and the Metal Gear series' trademark cardboard box, which Snake can hide under to avoid visual detection.|$|E

5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but <b>must</b> <b>move</b> at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E
5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps <b>must</b> <b>move</b> {{away from their}} natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in {{the case of}} a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that <b>must</b> <b>move</b> relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E

5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator <b>must</b> <b>move</b> the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5|$|The worm {{starts at}} some point of an {{infinite}} triangular grid. It starts moving along {{one of the six}} gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a new point. The worm then decides, based on the distribution of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction it will take. The directions are relative to the worm's point of view. If the worm has not encountered this exact distribution before it may leave along any untraversed gridline. From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it <b>must</b> <b>move</b> in the same way. If there are no untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends.|$|E
5|$|MD 10 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Pasadena. The highway heads north as a four-lane freeway to a partial interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). There is no access from northbound MD 10 to eastbound MD 100 or from westbound MD 100 to southbound MD 10. MD 10 and MD 100 briefly run concurrently northwest as an eight-lane freeway and diverge at another partial interchange; in both carriageways, traffic <b>must</b> <b>move</b> over two lanes {{to remain on}} the same route. Just north of the MD 100 split, MD 10 has a half-diamond interchange with MD 177 (Mountain Road). That interchange has ramps from southbound MD 10 to MD 177 and from MD 177 to northbound MD 10. Traffic from eastbound MD 100 to northbound MD 10 and from southbound MD 10 to westbound MD 100 uses MD 177 and MD 2 as intermediaries.|$|E

25|$|The Sec-dependent {{system is}} divided into three {{pathways}}. TAAs are one of those pathways and also go by the name type Vc secretion pathway. The mechanism is split into two. First, the protein <b>must</b> <b>move</b> across the inner membrane or, in other words, translocate, in a Sec-dependent manner via the periplasm. The signal peptide on the N-terminus acts as a temporary tether to hold it in place. Next, it <b>must</b> <b>move</b> to the outer membrane. The trimerisation aids translocation, and no translocation would occur without its beta-barrel membrane anchor. The type V secretion system is described as non-fimbrious, meaning that the bacterial cells do not use long physical appendages named pili to attach to one another.|$|E

25|$|Each puzzle must be {{completed}} within a time limit; otherwise the game ends, though the player can spend {{some of his}} score to restart the failed puzzle instead.

25|$|Moving into {{free space}} {{is one of}} the most {{critical}} skills that football players must develop. Attacking players <b>must</b> <b>move</b> off the ball into space to give an advance the maximum chance of success. Passes to space are feasible when there is intelligent movement of players to receive the ball and do something constructive with it. Skilled players are able to find seams between defenders, positioning themselves to receive a pass.|$|E

25|$|When castling, {{the king}} {{must be the}} first piece touched.

If the player completes a two-square king move without touching a rook, the player <b>must</b> <b>move</b> the correct rook accordingly if castling in that direction is legal. Otherwise, the move must be withdrawn and another king move made.|$|E
