5|$|So {{direction}} 0 {{indicates the}} worm continues to travel straight ahead, direction 1 indicates the worm {{will make a}} right turn of 60° and similarly for the other directions. The worm cannot travel in direction 3 {{because that is the}} gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 the first time it has to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice,</b> in direction 0 the next time it has to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> and so on.

At certain points, they get to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice,</b> which affects the {{direction}} of the story, leading to eleven possible different endings. The whole plot is not revealed in just one ending; instead, the player has to play through the game multiple times, with each playthrough revealing new information. After playing through the game once, the player is able to fast-forward past text to decision points; they can also choose to start from a point further into the game, so {{that they do not have}} to go back to the beginning of the game for each playthrough.|$|E
5|$|Kydd {{was born}} in the Victorian {{regional}} town of Kyabram, and began playing competitive netball at age nine. Though also a talented swimmer, she was forced to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> between the two sports, and ultimately chose netball. She played for local and Goulburn Valley representative teams as a teenager and, in 1998 at the age of 16, was selected to play for the dominant Eastside Netball Club in the state Dairy Farmers State League competition, alongside three national league players. Despite a regular three-hour commute and having to juggle sporting commitments with studies at Kyabram Secondary College, she played an integral role in Eastside's premiership that year. She was subsequently named in the state under-21 squad for the annual Australian National Netball Championships and in the Melbourne Kestrels squad for the 1999 season.|$|E

On 25 August 1918, she moved to the war front with only five operators helping her. For this operation at Saint-Mihiel, Banker had to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> of the best operators for the job, she selected: Suzanne Prevot, Esther Fresnel, Helen Hill, Berthe Hunt, and Marie Lange.

5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice,</b> the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, and whether or not they are currently on medication.|$|E

Colleen's real reason for visiting her son is that she learned from her friend in Florida that Jack is dating Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), a recent divorcée, {{and a woman who}} happens to be Jack's high school sweetheart. During dinner, Colleen does not bring Nancy up, but tells Jack she knows about his involvement with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) after an awkward encounter between Avery and Jack in an elevator with Colleen present; because of the encounter, Colleen knows that Avery and Jack are sleeping together.

5|$|The game {{keeps track}} of the player's {{completed}} percentage of the storyline, increased by viewing the scenarios comprising each Episode. If 100% {{of the game is}} completed, an additional ending will be unlocked. The game features a fork in its plot, allowing the player to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> that changes what scenes they see and the number of percentage points they acquire afterward. It is impossible to see all of the game's content on a single playthrough, due to this fork in the storyline, although it is possible to achieve 100% storyline completion in a single playthrough. However, a 100% storyline completion can only be achieved through one of the two possible storylines. When the game is completed for the first time, it unlocks a New Game Plus option that allows the player to restart the game with all of the items, Garment Grids, dresspheres and storyline completion percentage achieved previously. However, all character levels are set back to one.|$|E

25|$|One {{can also}} use {{consumer}} theory to analyze a consumer's choice between leisure and labor.

The position adopted for {{this study is that}} of a buyer or consumer behaviour perspective. This is the first study of its kind undertaken in Australia. Much related research been done in the United States and elsewhere. However, the Australian higher education system has unique characteristics. Consequently, while existing student-choice models drawn from elsewhere provide a useful foundation, they are not sufficient to answer the key question: How do students choose universities in Australia?

Simultaneously, a treaty of friendship was signed in Moscow between Soviet Russia and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, whereby Ardahan and Artvin were awarded to Turkey, which renounced its claims to Batumi.|$|E
25|$|This {{historic}} intuition {{is therefore}} mathematical intuition. For Poincaré, it {{is a result}} of the principle of least effort, that is, of a link to scientific convention based on experimentation. Convention, thus given a context, permits one to consider different theories of the same problem, and subsequently <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> based on the degree of simplicity and usefulness of explanations advanced by each of these theories (see also Occam's razor). The example chosen by Poincaré is that of three-dimensional space. He shows how the representation of this space is only one possibility, chosen for its usefulness among many models that the mind could create. His demonstration rests on the theory of The Mathematical Continuum (1893), one of Poincaré's earlier publications.|$|E
