5|$|Filming {{also took}} place in 2005, near the {{marketplace}} of the Bucharest neighborhood Rahova. The chosen area raised a few difficulties related to safety.

5|$|Babb, {{who gained}} notoriety for his various {{marketing}} gimmicks, occasionally had Leeds make appearances and give lectures at showings of the film. Babb often booked the <b>movie</b> <b>as</b> a midnight presentation {{twice a week}} in the same town; David F. Friedman, who would later use the film in his own double-billings, attributed the distribution plan to a film that was so low in quality that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as fast as possible.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{beginning}} principal photography, Refn {{went to the}} 2010 Cannes Film Festival to sell the rights to Drive and released promotional posters for the film. In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights. The owners were so eager {{to get their hands}} on Drive, they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre <b>movie,</b> <b>as</b> well as the arthouse crowd. The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{score to}} Zombi 2 was {{composed}} by Fabio Frizzi, who frequently scored Fulci's works, including Sette note in nero, I quattro dell'apocalisse and Sella d'argento previously. Zombi 2 {{marked the first}} time the two had worked together on a straight horror <b>movie</b> <b>as</b> opposed to their previous spaghetti western and giallo thriller work; Frizzi would go on to compose for many more horror films with and without Fulci.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} two {{short-lived}} television series based upon Casablanca, both sharing the title. The first, a Cold War espionage program set during the production's present day, aired on ABC {{as part of the}} wheel series Warner Bros.

5|$|A {{year later}} Radcliffe starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second {{installment}} of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarised opinions on the <b>movie</b> <b>as</b> a whole. The 2004 release Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance. Next was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005. The film was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as being {{a reason for the}} movie's creative success.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Platoon (1986), Stone wanted film school friend and Los Angeles screenwriter Stanley Weiser to {{research}} and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in Crime and Punishment. The director {{had been thinking about}} this kind of a <b>movie</b> <b>as</b> early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} late February 2006, Jason McElwain {{and his family}} started {{receiving}} inquiries from over twenty-five film companies, including The Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros., about making a film based on his story. In April 2006, {{it was announced that}} Columbia Pictures had bought the rights to produce the film. Laura Ziskin, producer of the Spider-Man film series, was signed on to produce the film about McElwain's life. Magic Johnson has also been attached as producer, while two-time Academy Award winner Alvin Sargent is in talks to write the film. However, there currently is no timetable for the <b>movie</b> <b>as</b> contracts are being finalized and the script is still being written.|$|E

5|$|Grissom {{has been}} noted and remembered in many film and {{television}} productions. Before he became widely known as an astronaut, the film Air Cadet (1951) starring Richard Long and Rock Hudson briefly featured Grissom early in the <b>movie</b> <b>as</b> a U.S. Air Force candidate for flight school at Randolph Field, San Antonio, Texas. Grissom was depicted by Fred Ward in the film The Right Stuff (1983) and (very briefly) in the film Apollo 13 (1995) by Steve Bernie. He was portrayed in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon (1998) by Mark Rolston. Actor Kevin McCorkle played Grissom in the third-season finale of the NBC television show American Dreams. Bryan Cranston played Grissom as a nervous variety-show guest in the film That Thing You Do! Actor Joel Johnstone portrays Gus Grissom in the 2015 ABC TV series The Astronaut Wives Club.|$|E
5|$|Mattel {{produced}} toys {{based on}} the film through several divisions. Hot Wheels produced die-cast vehicles, race sets and track sets. Tyco produced remote-controlled Mach 5s and racing sets. Radica Games produced video games in which players can use a car wheel. The products became available in March 2008. Also, the Lego Company produced four Lego sets {{based on the}} <b>movie.</b> <b>As</b> part of the General Mills promotional tie-in, during the 2008 Crown Royal Presents the Dan Lowry 400, part of the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup season, the famous #43 Dodge Charger of Petty Enterprises {{was transformed into a}} NASCAR Sprint Cup Series version of the Mach 5, driven by Bobby Labonte.|$|E
5|$|On television, the {{parallels}} between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B <b>movie</b> <b>as</b> well. As production of TV movies expanded {{with the introduction of}} the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst, which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened {{all the way back to}} the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as The California Kid (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. Nightmare in Badham County (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.|$|E
