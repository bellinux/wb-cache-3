50|$|<b>Megalonychidae</b> is a {{group of}} sloths {{including}} the extinct Megalonyx and the living two toed sloths. Megalonychids first appeared in the early Oligocene, about 35 million years ago, in southern Argentina (Patagonia), and spread as far as the Antilles by the early Miocene. Megalonychids first reached North America by island-hopping, about 9 million years ago, prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. Some megalonychid lineages increased in size as time passed. The first species of these were small and may have been partly tree-dwelling, whereas the Pliocene (about 5 to 2 million years ago) species were already approximately half the size of the huge Late Pleistocene Megalonyx jeffersonii from the last ice age. Some West Indian island species were as small as a large cat; their dwarf condition typified both tropical adaptation and their restricted island environment. This small size also enabled them a degree of arboreality.|$|E
50|$|Extinct sloths {{are known}} from the three Greater Antilles of Cuba, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico and several smaller Antillean islands, but they are missing from the fourth of the Greater Antilles, Jamaica. These {{are part of the}} family <b>Megalonychidae,</b> which also {{includes}} some of the extinct giant ground sloths, such as Megalonyx, and the living two-toed sloths (Choloepus) of the American mainland. All Greater Antillean sloths are now extinct; their extinction by ~4400 BP (uncalibrated radiocarbon date) apparently postdated the extinction of the mainland ground sloths by about six thousand years, and coincided (to within a thousand years) with the arrival of humans on the islands. The extinct Caribbean sloths apparently had a wide range of locomotor habits corresponding to varying degrees of arboreality, but were generally more terrestrial than extant tree sloths. They had been present on the Antilles since the early Oligocene, 32 million years ago. The subdivision of Antillean sloths into several subfamilies implies at least a diphyletic origin for them, requiring two or more separate colonization events.|$|E
40|$|We sequenced {{part of the}} 16 S rRNA {{mitochondrial}} gene in 17 extant taxa of Pilosa (sloths and anteaters) and used these sequences along with GenBank sequences of both extant and extinct sloths to perform phylogenetic analysis based on parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. By increasing the taxa density for anteaters and sloths {{we were able to}} clarify some points of the Pilosa phylogenetic tree. Our mitochondrial 16 S results show Bradypodidae as a monophyletic and robustly supported clade in all the analysis. However, the Pleistocene fossil Mylodon darwinii does not group significantly to either Bradypodidae or <b>Megalonychidae</b> which indicates that trichotomy best represents the relationship between the families Mylodontidae, Bradypodidae and <b>Megalonychidae.</b> Divergence times also allowed us to discuss the taxonomic status of Cyclopes and the three species of three-toed sloths, Bradypus tridactylus, Bradypus variegatus and Bradypus torquatus. In the Bradypodidae the split between Bradypus torquatus and the proto-Bradypus tridactylus / B. variegatus was estimated as about 7. 7 million years ago (MYA), while in the Myrmecophagidae the first offshoot was Cyclopes at about 31. 8 MYA followed by the split between Myrmecophaga and Tamandua at 12. 9 MYA. We estimate the split between sloths and anteaters to have occurred at about 37 MYA...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a small {{collection}} of late Cenozoic fossil vertebrates recovered from a lahar (mudflow) deposit at Locality 12 North on the southern coast of Grenada. * 40 K/ 40 Ar–dated hornblende concentrate from the lahar deposit yielded age estimates of 2. 6 – 3. 7 Ma (Late Pliocene). Although these estimates date crystallization of the hornblende and not the lahar event, the latter {{is unlikely to be}} substantially younger. The contained fauna is here regarded as latest Pliocene or slightly younger. Dental specimens in the collection are readily referable to Hydrochaeridae (Rodentia, Ca-viida) and <b>Megalonychidae</b> (Xenarthra, Phyllophaga), groups heretofore unknown on this is-land. The capybara, Hydrochaeris gaylordi, new species, differs from extant Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris in the conformation of the maxillary second molar. The sloth teeth (two cani-niforms, one molariform) notably differ from one another in size, but whether they represent one species or two cannot be decided on this evidence. Because of the limitations of the material, attribution of the specimens to subfamily or tribe within <b>Megalonychidae</b> is also uncertain. Megalonychid sloths have never been found previously on any of the Lesser An-tilles, although they formed part of the terrestrial vertebrate fauna of most of the Greater Antilles. Curaçao is the only other island in the Caribbean Sea that has yielded sloth and capybara fossils. Sloths and capybaras might have reached that island as well as Grenada by short-distance over-water transport, perhaps during a time of lowered sea level. A late land connection with South America is perhaps possible, but this would need to be confirmed with suitable geological evidence...|$|E

40|$|As part {{of ongoing}} revisionary work on Antillean <b>Megalonychidae,</b> we {{document}} four new sloth species from Quaternary cave localities in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. * The new taxa and their tribal affiliations are as follows: Megalocnus zile (Megalocnini), Acratocnus ye (Acratocnini), and Neocnus dousman and N. toupiti (Cubanocnini). Significantly, each is close-ly related to species in genera long known from Cuba. This observation is of primary bio-geographical importance {{because the most}} parsimonious explanation {{for the presence of}} par-allel arrays of lower-level clades of sloths {{on opposite sides of the}} Windward Passage is vicariance, not a series of uncoordinated over-water dispersals. For a brief period in the late Paleogene, eastern Cuba, northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Aves Rise formed a large positive structure (GAARlandia) that was evidently briefly continuous with northwestern South America. We infer that the later subdivision and subsidence of major portions of GAARlandia must have finely vicariated its biota (which included sloths at least as early as the Early Oligocene). On this argument, Megalocnus, Acratocnus, Neocnus, and Parocnus (5 Mesocnus) must have already been in existence as independent clades at the time of origin of the Wind...|$|E
40|$|Extant sloths {{present an}} {{evolutionary}} conundrum {{in that the}} two living genera are superficially similar (small-bodied, folivorous, arboreal) but diverged from one another approximately 30 million years ago and are phylogenetically separated by a radiation of medium to massive, mainly ground-dwelling, taxa.   Indeed, the species in the two living genera are among the smallest, and perhaps most unusual, of the 50 + known sloth species, and must have independently and convergently evolved small size and arboreality.   In order to accurately reconstruct sloth evolution, {{it is critical to}} incorporate their extinct diversity in analyses.   Here, we used a dataset of 57 species of living and fossil sloths to examine changes in body mass mean and variance through their evolution, employing a general time-variable model that allows for analysis of evolutionary trends in continuous characters within clades lacking fully-resolved phylogenies, such as sloths. Results:Our analyses supported eight models, all of which partition sloths into multiple subgroups, suggesting distinct modes of body size evolution among the major sloth lineages.   Model-averaged parameter values supported trended walks in most clades, with estimated rates of body mass change ranging as high as 126 kg/million years for the giant ground sloth clades Megatheriidae and Nothrotheriidae.   Inclusion of living sloth species in the analyses weakened reconstructed rates for their respective groups, with estimated rates for <b>Megalonychidae</b> four times higher when the extant genus Choloepus species was excluded.  Conclusions:Analyses based on extant taxa alone have the potential to oversimplify or misidentify macroevolutionary patterns. This study demonstrates the impact that integration of data from the fossil record can have on reconstructions of character evolution and establishes that body size evolution in sloths was complex, but dominated by trended walks towards the enormous sizes exhibited in some recently extinct forms...|$|E
