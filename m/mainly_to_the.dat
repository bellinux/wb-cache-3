5|$|Christianity {{has deep}} roots in the Western Isles, but owing <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{different}} allegiances of the clans in the past, {{the people in the}} northern islands (Lewis, Harris, North Uist) have historically been predominantly Presbyterian, and those of the southern islands (Benbecula, South Uist, Barra) predominantly Roman Catholic.|$|E
5|$|During the Second French Empire (1852–70) further {{changes were}} made, <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interior. Hippolyte de La Rochefoucauld (1804–63), {{who had been}} {{minister}} plenipotentiary in Germany and Florence, brought a fine collection of furniture and 18th century Venetian glass chandeliers when he retired. He restored the great stone staircase. Influenced by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc he decided to transform the large East tower into a library. He blocked up the old openings and pierced large new windows in the old walls.|$|E

5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} {{evolution}} of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has {{a wide array of}} ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This is due <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that Philippines is an archipelago thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was minimal in the region of Zamboanga.|$|E
5|$|More recently, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (S.speciosus) and Pacific cicada killer (S.convallis) at Big Bend National Park in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent clades, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the Rocky Mountains, with one occurring <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south and east, {{the other to the}} west.|$|E

5|$|St Chad's Church, the Anglican parish church, is in {{the centre}} of town, {{bordering}} the market place. It has been designated a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage. The current structure dates largely from the mid-18thcentury when the previous church was demolished, although the tower is from the 17thcentury. The church is constructed of stone and has a slate roof. A round Norman-style apse was added in 1868. The churchyard, <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south and east of the building, is noted for its display of crocuses in the spring.|$|E

5|$|As Jerry {{entered the}} eastern Caribbean Sea early on October 8 after {{bypassing}} St. Vincent, its forward speed increased to 25 mph (40km/h), and reconnaissance aircraft observations indicated a broad circulation with several small rotations but an ill-defined low-level center. Later, satellite observations {{indicated that the}} storm was poorly organized, with an elongated cloud mass and displaced secondary center to the northwest. Moderate vertical wind shear from the northwest developed, disrupting Jerry's upper-level outflow. Jerry continued to deteriorate, and later on October 8, aircraft data indicated the system had weakened into a broad {{area of low pressure}} with scattered squalls <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the remnant center. Jerry then dissipated shortly afterward approximately 230miles south of Puerto Rico, with the remnants moving westward.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, George Washington {{owned and}} raced a Narragansett Pacer, while in 1772, Edmund Burke asked an American friend for a pair. Paul Revere {{possibly}} rode a Pacer during his 1775 ride {{to warn the}} Americans of a British march. The extinction was due <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> breed being sold in such large numbers to sugarcane planters in the West Indies that breeding stock was severely diminished in the United States. The few horses that were left were crossbred to create and improve other breeds and the pure strain of the Narragansett soon became extinct. North Carolina was also a noted to have breeders of the Narragansett, with breeding stock having {{been brought to the}} area as early as 1790 by early pioneers. The last known Pacer, a mare, died around 1880.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 {{a further}} {{edition of the}} Statutes was issued; the changes related <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> costs {{associated}} with the Order. Prior to this date it had been the policy that the insignia (which were provided by the Crown) were to be returned on the death of the holder; the exception had been foreigners who had been awarded honorary membership. In addition foreigners had usually been provided with stars made of silver and diamonds, whereas ordinary members had only embroidered stars. The decision was made to award silver stars to all members, and only require the return of the Collar. The Crown had also been paying the fees due to the officers of the Order for members who had been appointed for the services in the recent war. The fees were abolished and replaced with a salary of approximately the same average value. The offices of Genealogist and Messenger were abolished, and those of Registrar and Secretary combined.|$|E

5|$|Joseph H. Allen (September 5, 1821 – April 24, 1884) was an {{industrial}} businessman, {{an officer in}} the Civil War, and a town supervisor of Brunswick, New York. Allen was born in Alburg, Vermont, to parents of British descent and left home at an early age. After several business ventures, he became successful in the auger and hoe business, selling <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American South. He successfully ran for supervisor of the Town of Brunswick in 1856 and justice of the peace in 1861. At the beginning of the Civil War, his sales plummeted so he closed his business and enlisted in the Union Army. Allen was wounded multiple times during his service and ended his career at the rank of lieutenant colonel. He returned home to reopen his factory, which was instrumental to the industrial success of the hamlet of Eagle Mills in the mid to late 19th century. He died in 1884 at the age of 62.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Armoured Division was {{subsequently}} reformed, {{and became a}} mobile reserve in south eastern England. It was tasked with counter-attacking an invading German army, and the 1st Support Group was given two Canadian infantry battalions for this purpose. In November 1940 Morgan was appointed Brigadier General Staff (BGS) at II Corps, based in Norfolk. Morgan was promoted major-general in 1941 and in late February given command of the Devon and Cornwall County Division, a static formation created for coastal defence, lacking artillery, engineers and divisional troops. In October he assumed command of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division, a first-line TA formation serving as part of Southern Command and later Northern Command. Despite being a first-line formation, the division included {{a large number of}} second-line units, due <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> division splitting with its second-line duplicate, the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, on a geographical basis. The division was placed on the Lower Establishment in January 1942, losing much of its artillery, engineers and divisional troops and receiving a low priority for modern equipment.|$|E
5|$|The Great Arab Revolt {{started on}} 5 June 1916 from Medina and pushed northwards until the {{fighting}} reached Transjordan in the Battle of Aqaba on 6 July 1917. By 1918, the revolt — with the Allies' support — successfully {{gained control of}} most of the territories of the Hejaz and the Levant, including Damascus. However, it failed to gain international recognition as an independent state, due <b>mainly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> secret 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement and the 1917 Balfour Declaration. This was seen by the Hashemites and the Arabs as a betrayal of their previous agreements with the British, including the 1915 McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, in which the British stated their willingness to recognise the independence of a unified Arab state stretching from Aleppo to Aden under the rule of the Hashemites. The region was divided into French and British spheres of influence. Abdullah I, the second son of Sharif Hussein arrived from Hejaz by train in Ma'an in southern Jordan on 11 November 1920, where he was greeted by Transjordanian leaders. Abdullah established the Emirate of Transjordan on 11 April 1921, which then became a British protectorate.|$|E
