60|$|This {{was one of}} {{the speeches}} of the <b>marchande</b> de mode to Adrienne, and the dear girl {{repeated}} it in her mind, as she sat at work on me, without the slightest distrust of the heartless selfishness it so ill concealed. On fifteen sous she found she could live without encroaching on the little stock set apart for the support of her grandmother, and she was content. Alas! The poor girl had not entered into any calculation of the expense of lodgings, of fuel, of clothes, of health impaired, and as for any resources for illness or accidents, she was totally without them. Still Adrienne thought herself the obliged party, in times as critical as those which then hung over France, in being permitted to toil for a sum that would barely supply a grisette, accustomed all her life to privations, with the coarsest necessaries.|$|E

When certain things are wanted in a hurry, you will not mind working an hour or two beyond time, and I will always find lights with the greatest pleasure.

Your Citizen, {{who would be}} fashionable, walks abroad, with his Wife on his arm, in red wool nightcap, black shag spencer, and carmagnole complete. Aristocratism crouches low, in what shelter is still left; {{submitting}} to all requisitions, vexations; too happy to escape with life. Ghastly chateaus stare on you by the wayside; disroofed, diswindowed; which the National House-broker is peeling for the lead and ashlar. The old tenants hover disconsolate, over the Rhine with Conde; a spectacle to men.

6000|$|For {{this same}} opinion of Albert's is entertained by {{many other people}} {{respecting}} their own doings--a very prevalent opinion, indeed, I find it; and the answer itself, though rarely made with the Nuremberger's crushing decision, is nevertheless often enough intimated, with delicacy, by artists of all countries, in their various dialects.

An entirely modest saying, I repeat, in him--not always in us. For Modesty is [...] "the measuring virtue," [...] the virtue of modes or limits. She is, indeed, said to be only the third or youngest of the children of the cardinal virtue, Temperance; and apt to be despised, being more given to arithmetic, and other vulgar studies (Cinderella-like), than her elder sisters; but she is useful in the household, and arrives at great results with her yard-measure and slate-pencil--a pretty little <b>Marchande</b> des Modes, cutting her dress always according to the silk (if this be the proper feminine reading of [...] "coat according to the cloth"), so that, consulting with her carefully of a morning, men get to know not only their income, but their in being--to know themselves, that is, in a gauger's manner, round, and up and down--surface and contents; what is in them and what may be got out of them; and in fine, their entire canon of weight and capacity. That yard-measure of Modesty's, lent to those who will use it, is a curious musical reed, and will go round and round waists that are slender enough, with latent melody in every joint of it, the dark root only being soundless, moist from the wave wherein ...|$|E
60|$|The first stitch {{was made}} {{just as the}} clocks were {{striking}} the hour of five, {{on the morning of}} the fourteenth of April, 1831. The last was drawn that day two months, precisely as the same clocks struck twelve. For four hours Adrienne sat bending over her toil, deeply engrossed in the occupation, and flattering herself with the fruits of her success. I learned much of the excellent child's true character in these brief hours. Her mind wandered over her hopes and fears, recurring to her other labors, and the prices she received for occupations so wearying and slavish. By the milliner, she was paid merely as a common sewing-girl, though her neatness, skill and taste might well have entitled her to double wages. A franc a day was the usual price for girls of an inferior caste, and out of this they were expected to find their own lodgings and food. But the poor revolution had still a great deal of private misery to answer for, in the way of reduced wages. Those who live on the frivolities of mankind, or, what is the same thing, their luxuries, have two sets of victims to plunder--the consumer, and the real producer, or the operative. This is true where men are employed, but much truer in the case of females. The last are usually so helpless, that they often cling to oppression and wrong, rather than submit to be cast entirely upon the world. The <b>marchande</b> de mode who employed Adrienne was as rusee as a politician who had followed all the tergiversations of Gallic policy, since the year '89. She was fully aware of what a prize she possessed in the unpracticed girl, and she felt the importance of keeping her in ignorance of her own value. By paying the franc, it might give her assistant premature notions of her own importance; but, by bringing her down to fifteen sous, humility could be inculcated, and the chance of keeping her doubled. This, which would have defeated a bargain with any common couturiere, succeeded perfectly with Adrienne. She received her fifteen sous with humble thankfulness, in constant apprehension of losing even that miserable pittance. Nor would her employer consent to let her work by the piece, at which the dear child might have earned at least thirty sous, for she discovered that she had to deal with a person of conscience, and that in no mode could as much be possibly extracted from the assistant, as by confiding to her own honor. At nine each day she was to breakfast. At a quarter past nine, precisely, to commence work for her employer; at one, she had a remission of half an hour; and at six, she became her own mistress.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the works}} of Jacques Lacan and Cornelius Castoriadis, we propose an {{articulation}} of structure and history {{in order to build}} a psychoanalytic approach of the impacts of our era — in its dual determination by consumerist market logic, and the scientific discourse — on loving relationships. We have been able to propose a psychoanalytic, structural and historical approach of the causes, the conditions and consequences of indifference to things of love induced by capitalist discourse structure and the socio-historical purview witch is linked to it. Le travail consiste à articuler la question de l'amour avec celle de l'époque à partir de la catégorie de discours telle qu'elle a été proposée par Lacan.

40|$|International audienceThe {{notion of}} embeddedness is {{examined}} from the stance {{that there is}} not and cannot be a self-regulated marketplace. All markets are embedded. Market transactions are carried out in a tangle of interpersonal relationships, formal rules, tools and shared ideas. These embedding conditions limit such transactions while making them possible. They are not just the normative setting for decision-making but, indeed, the very basis of transactions, as resources are continually tapped for actions. The notion of embeddedness calls for research to work out useful approaches for developing a sociological theory of market exchanges. Tous les marchés sont encastrés. Les échanges marchands se réalisent dans un contexte enchevêtré de relations interpersonnelles, de règles formelles, d'outils et de représentations collectives. Ces conditions d'encastrement à la fois contraignent et permettent les transactions <b>marchandes.</b> Elles ne constituent donc pas seulement le décor normatif où est prise la décision mais le socle, les ressources mobilisées continuellement lors de l'action. La notion d'encastrement invite à une sociologie des échanges marchands...|$|R

Karl Polanyi {{argued in}} The Great Transformation (2001 [1944]) {{that the development}} of market societies over the past two hundred years has been shaped by a double movement. On one side is the movement of laissez faire [...] the efforts by a variety of groups to expand the scope and influence of self-regulating markets.  On the other side has been the movement of protection–the initiatives, again by a wide range of social actors, to insulate the fabric of social life from the destructive impact of market pressures.  The essay starts by laying out the broad outlines of the double movement idea, and then it elaborates the micro-foundations of the protective counter movement to explain how agents sometimes have the opportunity, the power, and the capacity to challenge and change the institutional structures of market societies.  After examining barriers to the mobilization of a protective counter movement, the final section explores the possibilities of moving beyond the double movement...|$|R

40|$|Pendant l’entre-deux-guerres, pour améliorer la difficile {{situation}} nationale et internationale du commerce des vins (fraudes, mévente, surproduction endémique, fermetures de marchés, politiques protectionnistes), le gouvernement français profite des débats internationaux pour imposer les normes hexagonales de vente et de production à l’étranger. En dépit de nombreuses réussites au sein de l’OIV ou lors de congrès, et malgré une propagande organisée, l’Etat français ne parvient pas à restaurer la confiance. La régionalisation des enjeux et les luttes pour ou contre l’instauration des appellations déclasse en partie les initiatives centralisées de l’Etat. Aussi, les syndicats vignerons tentent-ils d’organiser eux-mêmes leur propagande. Les démarches bourguignonnes vers les Etats-Unis évoquent ce processus d’exportation de la notion d’appellation d’origine. Dans un même temps, ces actions deviennent un moyen efficace pour légitimer nationalement ces nouvelles normes <b>marchandes.</b> L’apposition de normes légitimes semble, dans ce cas, un préalable nécessaire à tout bon fonctionnement du marché. De 1919 à 1939, {{la mise en place}} d’une légitimité internationale des AOC et la victoire nationale de cette norme procède au final d’une identification très locale des territoires de production en concurrence. Between the two World Wars, {{in order}} to improve the problematic situation of wine trading on a national and international scale – due to irregularities, slumping sales, endemic overproduction, markets closing down or protectionist policies – the French government took advantage of the worldwide debates taking place so as to have its own French standards of sales and production implemented abroad. Despite many successful manoeuvres within the OIV or at general meetings, and in spite of an organised propaganda, the French authorities were unable to recreate a state of confidence. The state’s efforts to centralise organisation were partly thwarted {{by the fact that the}} stakes were mostly regional, and by the struggle for or against the institution of a label guaranteeing the quality of wine. Therefore, winemakers’ unions tried to organise their own propaganda. The exchanges between Burgundy and the United States gave rise to the idea of exporting the notion of the French quality label. Concurrently, such steps became an efficient means of making these new standards of trade legitimate on a national scale as well. In this situation, the implementation of legitimate standards emerged as the first step towards a healthy market. Between 1919 and 1939, the French AOC gained recognition on an international scale as a result of an extremely localised process of identifying the competing production territories...|$|R
