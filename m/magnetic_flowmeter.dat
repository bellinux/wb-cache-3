50|$|If the {{magnetic}} field direction were constant, electrochemical and other effects at the electrodes would make the potential difference difficult to distinguish from the fluid flow induced potential difference. To mitigate this in modern <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeters,</b> the <b>magnetic</b> field is constantly reversed, cancelling out the electrochemical potential difference, which does not change direction with {{the magnetic}} field. This however prevents the use of permanent magnets for <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Magnetic flow meters, {{often called}} [...] "mag meter"s or [...] "electromag"s, use a {{magnetic}} field applied to the metering tube, which results in a potential difference proportional to the flow velocity perpendicular to the flux lines. The potential difference is sensed by electrodes aligned perpendicular to the flow and the applied magnetic field. The physical principle at work is Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. The magnetic flow meter requires a conducting fluid and a nonconducting pipe liner. The electrodes must not corrode {{in contact with the}} process fluid; some <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeters</b> have auxiliary transducers installed to clean the electrodes in place. The applied magnetic field is pulsed, which allows the flowmeter to cancel out the effect of stray voltage in the piping system.|$|R

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this thesis is focused on theoretical and experimental investigations of identifying and characterizing vertical and horizontal flow regimes in two-phase flows. A methodology of flow regime identification with impedance-based neural network systems and a comprehensive model of vertical slug flow have been developed. Vertical slug flow has been extensively investigated and characterized with geometric, kinematic and hydrodynamic parameters. ^ A multi-sensor impedance void-meter and a multi-sensor <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> were developed. The impedance void-meter was cross-calibrated with other reliable techniques for void fraction measurements. The performance of the impedance void-meter to measure the void propagation velocity was evaluated by the drift flux model. It was proved that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> was applicable to vertical slug flow measurements. Separable signals from these instruments allow us to unearth most characteristics of vertical slug flow. ^ A methodology of vertical flow regime identification was developed. Supervised neural network and self-organizing neural network systems were employed. First, they were trained with results from an idealized simulation of impedance in a two-phase mixture. The simulation was mainly based on Mishima and Ishii 2 ̆ 7 s flow regime map, the drift flux model, and the newly developed model of slug flow. Then, these trained systems were tested with impedance signals. The {{results showed that the}} neural network systems were appropriate classifiers of vertical flow regimes. The theoretical models and experimental databases used in the simulation were reliable. Furthermore, this approach was applied successfully to horizontal flow identification. ^ A comprehensive model was developed to predict important characteristics of vertical slug flow. It was realized that the void fraction of the liquid slug is determined by the relative liquid motion between the Taylor bubble tail and the Taylor bubble wake. Relying on this understanding and experimental results, a special relationship was built for the void fraction of the liquid slug. The prediction of the void fraction of the liquid slug was considerably improved. Experimental characterization of vertical slug flows was performed extensively with the impedance void-meter and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> The theoretical predictions were compared with the experimental results. The agreements between them are very satisfactory. ...|$|E

The methods are generally based on either the temporal response to an initial disturbance or on external methods for generating the required oscillations. The size distribution of condensed-phase combustion products are characterized {{by means of the}} experimental approaches. The 'T-burner' approach is shown to assist in the derivation of pressure-coupled driving contributions and particle damping in solid-propellant rocket motors. Other techniques examined include the rotating-valve apparatus, the impedance tube, the modulated throat-acoustic damping burner, and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> The paper shows that experimental methods do not exist for measuring the interactions between acoustic velocity oscillations and burning propellant...|$|E

Performance of the system becomes main issue and many researches are still ongoing to evaluate and improve efficiency of the system. Therefore, this paper presents the development process of refrigerator test rig and performance analysis of a domestic refrigerator. The experiment platform which called test rig was developed from refrigerator model NRB 33 TA National brand. The main objective in this study was to obtain performance of the refrigeration system in term of Refrigeration Capacity, Compressor work and Coefficient of Performance (COP) by determining three important parameters during in operating mode which are temperature, pressure and refrigerant flowrate. In the test rig, all temperature probes were connected to thermocouple scanner to measure temperature at particular points on the refrigeration system. Pressure gauges were used to measure pressure and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> was used to measure refrigerant flowrate. In order to avoid effects of a changing the measured data, the environmental of testing was controlled according to Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) standard. There are three sets of experiment data were collected in order to evaluate the refrigerator performance. Each data was collected for a cycle of operation for 2 hours. The result shows that the average COP of the refrigeration system using the refrigerator test rig was about 2. 7...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{complexities}} in handling liquid metals, theoretical {{evaluation of the}} sensitivity of <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeters</b> forms an attractive and preferred choice. The classical Galerkin finite element formulation is generally opted for the required evaluation. However, it is known to lead to numerical oscillations at higher flow rates. To overcome this, modified methods like upwind/Petrov-Galerkin schemes are generally suggested in allied areas like fluid dynamics. However, it requires the evaluation of stabilisation parameter and this parameter is not readily available for elements of order beyond quadratic. After a careful analysis of the numerical instability through a reduced one-dimensional problem, an elegant and stable approach is devised. In this scheme, the input magnetic field is restated {{in terms of the}} associated vector potential and the classical Galerkin finite element method is employed without any modification. The analytical solution of the associated difference equation is employed to show: (i) the stability of the proposed approach at higher flow rates and (ii) quantification of the small oscillations remnant at intermediate flow rates. It is then applied to the original flowmeter problem and the stability of the numerical solution is clearly demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The European Energy Policy has {{currently}} {{two main}} goals to reach: to minimize exposure to volatility of fossil fuel prices {{and to reduce}} of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To reach these targets a practical way, among the others {{is represented by the}} biogas production by anaerobic digestion (Bonoli et al., 2014) (AD) and its upgrading to biomethane. In this work the absorption of CO 2 is studied using a column working at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (5 99 %) and a stream of methane (> 99. 9 %) in order to reproduce a typical raw biogas composition, i. e. molar fraction of methane of about 0. 6. The internal temperature was monitored by a thermocouple and the inlet and outlet flow of biogas (G) was measured using a mass flowmeter while the water flow rate (L) was monitored using a <b>magnetic</b> induction <b>flowmeter.</b> The compositions were determined using a 3000 A micro-Gas Chromatograph Agilent, previously calibrated. The temperature was varied between 6. 5 and 20 °C and the water flow rate between about 0. 5 and 5 L/h.

40|$|The {{instantaneous}} flow-rate in high-pressure pipelines {{of fluid}} power {{systems can be}} predicted by means of refined numerical models, the performance of which should be validated extensively against experimental pressure transients. However, such an approach in complex hydraulic systems can require an advanced modelling of the hydraulic, mechanical and electronic components and can therefore be cumbersome and ineffective. Experimental analysis is valuable to support the fast and complete evaluation of integrated electronic-hydraulic power systems, i. e., reciprocating pumps equipped with sophisticated regulation devices, gasoline and diesel fuel injection apparatus, anti-lock braking systems and traction-control systems. However, {{the state of the}} art only allows the unsteady high-pressure liquid flows in these systems to be characterized in terms of the pressure time-history measured at fixed locations. The situation is particularly critical for volumetric pumps, since the main mission of these components is the high-pressure instantaneous delivered flow-rate and one main aspect concerning the final judgement of their performance is related to the flow-rate ripple, which can only be evaluated approximatel. The selection of the operating principle for the flow-rate measurement in high-pressure pipelines can be considered challenging because miniaturized devices, capable of operating at high-pressure levels and characterized by a superior dynamic performance, are required. Obstruction meters, which relate the fluid velocity to the measured pressure drop across a calibrated orifice, offer steady measurements and are therefore not suitable for transients. On the other hand, positive displacement, turbine, and Coriolis flowmeters cannot generally be used because of their relatively low dynamic response (the cut-off frequency can reach 1 kHz) and their excessive overall sizes. As far as <b>magnetic</b> induction based <b>flowmeters</b> is concerned, they are characterized by high dynamic performance, but these meters require fluids with electrical conductivity as low as 0. 1 S/cm, and diesel oil and gasoline both have much lower conductivity than this threshold. Finally, laser Doppler velocimetry-based techniques, which have been applied to the analysis of fluid dynamic transients in gasoline injection systems ([12]), imply a high initial setup cost, and are only applicable for laminar flows. Furthermore, these measurements require a pipe section made of quartz glass and this technique cannot therefore be applied when the pressure is higher than 100 bar. Flow-rate estimations, based on instantaneous pressure measurements, seem to be the most attractive opportunity, due to the superior dynamic response and the miniaturized sizes of the pressure transducers. Having assessed that pressure wave propagation occurs along a single direction, a mathematical relation exists between the pressure and flow-rate time-histories at any pipe section. On the other hand, the flow rate time-distribution cannot be inferred from the pressure time-history, measured at a single location, when the pressure waves travel back and forth through the pipeline, as usually occurs in engineering systems. An innovative methodology has been developed to evaluate the unsteady flow-rate in high-pressure pipelines, on the basis of the signals from two piezoelectric pressure transducers. A first-order non-linear ordinary differential equation was derived from Euler's momentum balance and mass conservation equations, and was numerically solved to compute the instantaneous mass flow-rate. The flowmeter working principle was validated successfully through a comparison with numerical flow-rate data, which were predicted by means of a reliable one-dimensional model of a CR fuel injection system, and satisfactory accuracy and repeatability of the measurements were proved. However, the flowmeter algorithm required knowledge of the initia...|$|R
40|$|When an {{acoustic}} wave {{is present in}} a solid propellant combustion environment, the mass flux from the combustion zone oscillates at the same frequency as the acoustics. The acoustic wave is either amplified or attenuated by {{the response of the}} combustion to the acoustic disturbance. When the acoustic wave is amplified, this process is called combustion instability. The amplification is quantitatively measured by a response function. The ability to predict combustion stability for a solid propellant formulation is essential to the formulator to prevent or minimize the effects of instabilities, such as an oscillatory thrust. Unfortunately, the prediction of response values for a particular propellant remains a technical challenge. Most predictions of the response of propellants are based on test data, but {{there are a number of}} questions about the reliability of the standard test method, the T-burner. Alternate methods have been developed to measure the response of a propellant, including the ultrasound burner, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> and the rotating valve burner, but there are still inconsistencies between the results obtained by these different methods. Aside from the experimental differences, the values of the pressure-coupled responses obtained by different researchers are often compared erroneously, for the simple reason that inconsistencies in the definitions of the responses and admittances are not considered. The use of different definitions has led to substantial confusion since the first theoretical treatments of the problem by Hart and McClure in 1959. The definitions and relations derived here seek to alleviate this problem...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{additives}} on friction loss in upward turbulent flow {{was investigated in}} this experimental study. Additives such as air bubbles, frother and polymer were added to water flow to study their influence on the friction factor. In order to perform this research an experimental set-up was designed and developed. The test sections of the set-up consisted of three vertical pipes of different diameters. The set-up was equipped with three pressure transducers, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeter,</b> gas spargers and a gas rotameter. The {{first phase of the}} experimental program involved calibration of the various devices and pipelines test-sections. The single-phase pressure loss data obtained from the pipelines exhibited good agreement with the standard equations. The second phase of the experimental program dealt with the effect of air bubbles and additives (frother and polymer) on drag reduction in turbulent flows. The experimental results showed that bubbles in the range of 1 mm- 3 mm increased the wall shear stress. Therefore, no drag-reduction effect was observed. On the contrary, a significant increase in friction factor was observed at low Reynolds numbers as a result of larger bubble sizes and lower turbulence intensities. The friction factor at low Reynolds numbers could be decreased by decreasing the bubble size by addition of frother to the flow system. The combination of polymer and air bubbles showed a drag reduction of up to 60 %. It is also evident from the experiment results that the addition of polymer to bubbly flow system leads to fully homogeneous mixture...|$|E
40|$|The contour of {{the flow}} pulse along the normal unopened aorta of human {{subjects}} and dogs was established by recording with the surgical probe type, square-wave <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> The contour at a given vessel segment {{was found to be}} the result of the transforming action of the arterial system on the ventricular ejection pulse. The char-acteristics of the aorta and its branches were found to be analagous to a low-pass electric tuned circuit, which resonates at 3 to 6 c. p. s. The resonant frequency, apparent from midsystole throughout diastole, was independent of heart rate, damped to extinction during diastole and renewed with each systole. New terms for elastic hydraulics are proposed and defined. CUMULATIVE experience in measuringthe normal aortic blood flow in 85 dogs and 10 human subjects has revealed a wide variation in flow pulse contour. A reasonable explanation of the major variations is needed, not alone for the sake of knowledge, but also to help future investigators establish the nor-malcy and validity of a given flow pulse. In addition, new practical approaches to diag-nosis of heart and vascular diseases will result from an understanding of the pulsatile dynamics in the arterial system. Previous reports have discussed the rela-tionship of flow to differential pressure in the aorta showing that a given flow pulse is re-lated through the laws of inertia to the differ-ential pressure along that particular aortic segment. 1 The question to be examined here is, "What are the factors which determine the major characteristics {{of the flow}} pulse contours existing along the aor ta?" Two schools of thought have grown up eon...|$|E
40|$|A {{project was}} carried out in {{conjunction}} with an Australian dredging company and served the purpose of increasing their operational efficiency through advanced monitoring and control. A system consisting of wireless communications, PLCs, HMIs and SCADA was implemented to provide the dredge operator and management staff remote monitoring and control of the operation. The pre-existing dredging arrangement relied on frequent visits to the land-based engine-driven booster pump to tune the engine speed for optimal pipeline flow. These visits were carried out by land-based staff, {{at the request of the}} offshore dredge operator who monitors the flow via a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> The dredge operator needed to control the booster pump remotely to save time and resources. For improved project supervision, it was also envisaged that management should have access to daily shift reports and live monitoring from the office. Electrical systems were implemented at the dredge and booster pump to accommodate wireless and wired industrial networks. The new arrangement allows the dredge operator to monitor and control operations via a HMI display mounted in the dredge cabin. From the cabin, the dredge operator can view data from both engines and process instrumentation such as pipeline flow. The booster pump also contains a HMI display from which it can be independently monitored and controlled. A SCADA system was installed on the dredge to generate daily reports and provide management with live access to operations from the office. The new system was a complete success increasing production efficiency and improving operations management. Eliminating visits to the booster pump and improved supervision of equipment significantly reduces dredging downtime. Access to daily reporting and live operations allows management to supervise operations without travelling to site resulting in cost and time savings. This project not only provides a solution to a gap in the dredging market, it provides a knowledge-base for future students or engineers to continue development of diesel engine monitoring and control using commercially available components...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the various methods {{that could be used}} in the laboratory to determine the values of production from a model cutter suction dredge. The values of production obtained from different methods are compared to estimate the best value. The tests were conducted in an attempt to pave the way to find spillage from the cutter suction dredge. The development of these methods is useful for evaluating the sediment spillage and residuals during dredging. The more accurate the values of production the more accurate would be the values of spillage. For this purpose, the laboratory dredge carriage and dredge/tow tank located at the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory at Texas A&M University is used. During the summer of 2007 and 2008, the laboratory dredge carriage was used to dredge sand (d 50 = 0. 27 mm) in the sediment pit that is 7. 6 m (25 feet) long, 3. 7 m (12 feet) wide and 1. 5 m (5 feet) deep. A laser profiler, a model hopper barge attached with pressure gauges, a flowmeter and density gauge aid in determining the production from the laboratory model of the cutter suction dredge were used. The before and after bathymetry measurements using a laser profiling system are used to determine the amount of sediment remaining after dredging. The hopper is instrumented with pressure gauges to measure the amount of sediment contained in the hopper. The laboratory dredge system has a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> and nuclear density gauge that provide data to calculate the amount of sand delivered to the hopper. The difference between the sand volume from the before and after bathymetry is the amount of sand that is resuspended and subsequently resettles in the dredging area (residual) and the sand that is not picked up by the dredge (spillage). Many issues in laboratory testing were found during the course of testing and solutions were found. The production values are compared with reasoning as to why the differences occur. The results demonstrate the ability and difficulty of measuring the amount of material that is dredged and the amount of spillage and residuals that occurs during dredging...|$|E
