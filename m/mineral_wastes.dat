40|$|<b>Mineral</b> <b>waste</b> {{is largely}} an {{unavoidable}} by-product of the extraction, processing {{and production of}} mineral-based products. The UK is well-endowed with mineral resources which have been worked {{for thousands of years}} resulting in millions of tonnes of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> across the country. The most significant mineral resource worked was coal with more than 26, 000 million tonnes of coal produced and 3600 million tonnes of waste rock. Other significant volumes of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> were derived from metal mining including tin, copper, lead and iron ore. Also a considerable volume was derived from the production of industrial and construction minerals such as brick clay, building stone, china clay, salt and slate. Currently the largest volumes of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> produced in the UK are those associated with the production of construction aggregate from hard rock quarries and sand and gravel operations. The amount of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> produced in the UK is currently not known in detail. Any figures for <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> are usually based on calculations that rely on the amount of saleable products recorded in the Annual Minerals Raised inquiry. Legislation in the UK is primarily concerned with the safe disposal of waste. It was not until the introduction of the Landfill Tax in 1996 and the Aggregates Levy in 2002 that concerted effort was made by the UK minerals industry to reduce, reuse or recycle <b>mineral</b> <b>waste.</b> A significant amount of research has been carried out since then to identify new uses for <b>mineral</b> <b>waste,</b> much of it funded in the 1990 s and 2000 s by the taxes raised.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} {{the influence of}} soil amendment with two <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> on the wheat plants development. Both types of tested <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> have resulted from the magnesium products industry, namely as waste-product and as deposits on the industrial equipment. The composition of these waste shows significant contents of precipitated magnesium and calcium carbonates as well as low contents of iron, copper, manganese and zinc. The {{difference between the two}} tested <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> lies in the double magnesium content, established for the crusts composition. An acid low fertile soil was treated with four different doses of each waste, in absence or in presence of nitrogen addition. The waste influence on the development of wheat was established by analysing some physiological characteristics of green wheat plants, on one hand as well as their essential and trace elements content, on the other hand...|$|R
40|$|An {{industrial}} <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> {{produced in}} the aluminum sulphate industry was selected as a low cost catalyst precursor. This material {{has been active in}} dibenzylether hydroconversion, as a model compound of C-O linkages in coal. Besides, it was used in the hydroconversion of a colombian subbituminous coal. The <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> and a commercial iron oxide (as reference material) were sulfided in order to produce iron sulfide, pyrrhotite type (Fe 1 -xS), which is the active phase in hydroconversion reactions. The solids were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Catalytic tests with the model compound and coal were carried out at 5 MPa of H 2, temperatures between 240 °C and 400 °C and reaction times were 0. 5 h or 1 h. The results showed a higher activity of the industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> compared with the reference material in the dibenzylether C-O bond cleavage. These kind of bonds are responsible for asphalthenes and preasphalthenes assembly in the molecular coal structure. In addition, coal conversion in presence of catalysts was 83. 9 %, this value was 1. 8 times higher than conversion without catalyst. Results show the potential of the industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> to be used as catalyst in the hydroconversion of coal due to its good activity and low cost...|$|R
30|$|Rubble, slag, and sludge, {{referred}} to as non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes,</b> are frequently recycled as alternate materials for natural non-metallic mineral resources such as dirt, crushed stone, sand, and clay. Concrete waste and asphalt concrete waste, which are non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes,</b> are categorized as industrial wastes in Japan. According to the annual report of Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (2015), the emission of these non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> in 2012 was 56.7 million tons in the country, which accounted for 15 % of the 379.1 million tons of total industrial waste.|$|E

40|$|In 1998 the BGS, in {{collaboration}} with Tarmac, initiated an industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> project known as REFILL which {{was funded by the}} EU BriteEuRam programme. BGS was responsible for the characterization of quarry waste from certain aggregate quarrying operations across the UK. During the work it became clear that there was little information available on the quantity and technical quality of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> in the UK. Also, BGS assisted Tarmac in research work to find uses for the fines produced at a coastal aggregate quarry in southern Ireland. In 1999 BGS developed a further research project, known as ‘Minerals from Waste’, which was funded by the UK Government Department for International Development (DfID). This project aimed to improve the sustainability of mining communities by investigating the use of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> as a source of construction and industrial minerals. The types of waste found in a range of extractive operations were reviewed. Case studies were carried out in Namibia and Costa Rica including investigations of the properties of the <b>waste,</b> <b>mineral</b> product evaluations, market and economic appraisals and social and environmental impact assessments of local communities. Overall, this work aimed to benefit not only mine and quarry engineers, but all those involved in the management of mine waste. ...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on the {{increase}} in generation of non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> and the decrease in demand for construction by investigating the material flow resulting from and the economic influence {{of changes in the}} supply and demand for wastes, focusing on the period from the near future to 2030. We predict the amount of final disposal of non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> and its influence on industries in the future under the assumption of two scenarios—zero emission and business-as-usual—using linear programming and input–output techniques developed for non-metallic mineral materials. We conclude that zero emission can be achieved at the cost of a 3.76 % decrease in the value added of industries related to non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes.</b> Otherwise, the final disposal might increase 13 times the size of 2005 ’s disposal. Considering the empirical results, we discuss an effective policy for non-metallic mineral waste management from the viewpoints of material flow and economic influence.|$|E

Although industries can achieve zero emissions of asphalt concrete waste and {{iron and steel}} slag, even under the maximization of their value added, the final disposal of concrete waste and coal ash increases to approximately 25 times and 18 times, respectively, compared to the values for 2005.

Since there is a critical lack of data on <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> and by-products used for application on cultivated land regarding type, amount and composition {{the objectives of the}} study are as follows: identification of wastes and by-products applied on cultivated land, assessment of quantities of the identified wastes/by-products and of the amounts applied on cultivated land, collection of information regarding material properties of such wastes and by-products and establishment of a data base. The study shows that at present at least 3 mil. tons of <b>mineral</b> <b>wastes</b> and by-products are applied on cultivated land. Particularly wastes and by-products are employed which are resulting from sugar processing (calcium carbonate sludge), water supply (dredging spoil), exploration of quarry (fractions of minor quality, mineral powder), chemical industry (ammonium sulphate, various limy residues), treatment of water for industrial use (sludge from decarbonation) and iron and steel production (blast furnace cinder and converter slug). In view of detrimental effects of substances as applied on cultivated land substantial efforts for legal regulations are required. (orig.)
