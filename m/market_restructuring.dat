40|$|Abstract. A company crisis can {{be defined}} as a short-term, undesired, {{unfavourable}} and critical state in the company (organization) which has derived from both internal and external causes and which directly endangers the further existence and growth of the company. In crisis not only short-term measures but also long-term vision and business directions must be prepared and implemented {{in order to be able}} to provide further existence and development. One of the most important area is <b>marketing</b> <b>restructuring</b> which represents a transition from the prior structural combination of programmes and markets to a new structure that must enable greater profitability and effectiveness of operations. In regard to such a restructuring, one must take into account the inter-linked relationship of the market (the chosen segment of customers) and of the programme (product, service), since, in principle, it is true that the identical programme of offer cannot be placed on the new market or the new programme in the prior market (segment). If the <b>marketing</b> <b>restructuring</b> is one of the most important restructuring area in the company in times of crisis it should be based upon marketing concept in order to follow the right direction of the renewal. However, empirical evidence from the author’s research has shown that companies in acute crisis pay surprisingly little attention to their <b>marketing</b> <b>restructuring,</b> even though in this case this is the most important area of reorganization. In the article some guidelines for the <b>marketing</b> <b>restructuring</b> for achieving the company renewal based on marketing knowledge and practice are presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} <b>markets</b> <b>restructuring</b> on small-scale farmers in South Africa by analysing the determinants of small-scale farmers’ market choices in the tomato sector in two Provinces. South Africa has a very dualistic agricultural sector with a highly performing large-scale capital intensive agriculture {{on one hand and}} a traditional, semi subsistence small-scale communal sector on the other. Small farmers’ participation in modern markets (i. e. supermarkets, agro-processors and national fresh produce markets) is thus very low. Furthermore, results from our survey indicate that small-scale tomato growers in Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces prefer supplying informal markets than modern markets. The econometric analysis of household level data indicates that access to land is a key determinant of their participation in modern markets. As confirmed by our survey, small-scale farming systems in South Africa are still very poorly capitalised. While still not being widely used, the key non-land asset variable is whether they can produce under greenhouses, thus supplying consistent quality demanded by the modern local channels. Other factors such as education and location in a good tomato producing area are also significant determinants of participation in modern markets. Interestingly, ownership of a cell phone as well as the number of market channels to which the farmers are connected are significant in determining market choices but they are negatively related to modern markets choice, which is {{to be related to the}} different natures of the transactions. Modern markets propose fixed prices or at least very stable prices under some forms of contractual arrangements while informal markets offer relatively flexible prices, price discovery and price risk management (through multiple marketing strategies) thus being much more important. The econometric analysis also shows that supplying modern markets does not improve small-scale farmers’ income whereas the access to a cell phone does, which supports the importance of the cell phone in price management as well as the preference for informal <b>markets.</b> <b>Marketing,</b> <b>Restructuring</b> <b>markets,</b> small-scale farmers, market channel choice,...|$|R

40|$|Over {{three decades}} {{there has been}} a shift from {{ideologies}} of idealism and educationalism towards instrumentalism in higher education due to the global circulation of neoliberal ideologies. Facilitated by digital technologies and encouraged by international ranking systems, there is a paradoxical trend towards homogenisation rather than heterogeneity in terms of what counts as valued knowledge, producing tensions in national policies, institutional responses and academic work in Australia as elsewhere. The paper identifies the implications of trends driving universities towards entrepreneurialism, hyper-instrumentalism, continual rebranding in their search for distinctiveness in global <b>markets,</b> <b>restructuring</b> towards specialisation, focusing on immediate use-value of research, vocationalising teaching, demand driven curriculum that makes students happy, and the disaggregation of curriculum underpinning new multimodal forms of online learning / management technologies...|$|R

40|$|The Australian {{electricity}} {{industry has}} undergone a significant reform, since the mid- 1990 s. Key changes comprised functional unbundling, <b>market</b> <b>restructuring,</b> regulatory reform, public corporatisation and privatisation. Technological development has been another indisputable constituent of these changes, {{in the wake of}} ICT revolution. The principle rationale behind these changes has been that they would improve productivity of the industry and social well-being of people. This paper examines the dynamics of productivity changes in the Australian electricity industry and conducts several hypotheses-testings to identify whether industry's efficiency measures are truly improved {{as a result of the}} reform-driven changes. Malmquist Total Factor Productivity Index approach and ANOVA are used for this purpose. The results reveal that the productivity gains in the industry have been largely driven by technological improvements and, to a lesser extent, by reform-induced comparative efficiency gains. On average at national level and for the entire industry, there are efficiency gains that, to large extents, can be attributed to functional unbundling and public corporatisation and, to a lesser extent, to <b>market</b> <b>restructuring</b> and privatisation. The results, however, reveal that the reform-driven changes have made insignificant contribution to comparative efficiency, at the level of thermal generation.
