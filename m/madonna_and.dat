5|$|The {{next year}} <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Maverick sued Warner Music Group and its former parent company Time Warner, {{claiming}} that mismanagement {{of resources and}} poor bookkeeping had cost the company millions of dollars. In return, Warner filed a countersuit alleging that Maverick had lost {{tens of millions of}} dollars on its own. The dispute was resolved when the Maverick shares, owned by <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Ronnie Dashev, were purchased by Warner. <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Dashev's company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music, but Madonna was still signed to Warner under a separate recording contract.|$|E

5|$|In Chicago, Madonna's father Tony Ciccone is {{interviewed in}} his vineyard; he recalls Madonna's childhood. Ciccone {{and his wife}} Joan come to visit the singer at her concert in United Center. The entourage moves to Miami where Ritchie is shown angling with their son Rocco, plays with her {{daughter}} Lourdes, and Madonna reflects on relationships and her husband. By the time the tour reaches London, Madonna gets irritated with the journeys. Kabbalah comes into the picture with explanations of the mystical practice from <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> her teacher Eitan. At Slane Castle, Dublin, <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> her dancers {{were in danger of}} being electrocuted due to constant rain, but she nevertheless continued the performances.|$|E

5|$|Life with My Sister Madonna, {{a book by}} Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted {{at number}} two on The New York Times bestseller list. The book caused some {{friction}} between <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> her brother, because of the unsolicited publication. Madonna eventually filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences. On December 15, 2008, Madonna's spokeswoman announced that the singer had agreed to a divorce settlement with Ritchie, the terms of which grant him between £50 million and £60 million, a figure that includes {{the value of the}} couple's London pub and residence and Wiltshire estate in England. <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Guy Ritchie's marriage was dissolved by District Judge Reid by decree nisi at the clinical Principal Registry of the Family Division in High Holborn, London. <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Ritchie entered into a compromise agreement for Rocco and David, then ages eight and three respectively, and divided the children's time between Ritchie's London home and Madonna's in New York, where the two will be joined by her daughter, Lourdes, from a previous relationship.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} showing the world {{evolving}} from its genesis. Images of volcanoes erupting, dinosaurs and tidal waves flash by to show <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> her two backup dancers singing the song while {{standing on a}} hill. It continues in this fluid motion up to the intermediate verse when Madonna is shown crawling under the waves and spirals. As the song moves towards the bridge again, the scene changes from the mountains to a cityscape. <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> her dancers are shown dancing and singing the song on a skyscraper. The video ends with Madonna standing on {{the building and the}} camera autofocusing out of the panel.|$|E
5|$|We’re flattered, of course, that <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Björk {{have offered}} to perform with us. But the only {{performances}} we’ll participate in are illegal ones. We refuse to perform {{as part of the}} capitalist system, at concerts where they sell tickets.|$|E
50|$|During her childhood, she {{sometimes}} showed a silent, childish religiousness. This could especially be seen when she prayed {{in front of}} self-erected altars surrounded by numerous candles or when she modeled <b>Madonnas</b> <b>and</b> drew images of saints per order of her sister.|$|R
50|$|Madonna {{appeared}} for {{the last}} time on September 30, 2009 to promote her latest release, the greatest hits compilation Celebration. During this episode, Letterman <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> again made light of her appearance on the show in 1994. The episode concluded with Letterman <b>and</b> <b>Madonna</b> going down the street and sharing a vegetarian pizza (minus cheese at <b>Madonna's</b> request) <b>and</b> martinis together.|$|R

Jahangir also added the Kala Burj pavilion, which features European-inspired angels on its vaulted ceiling. British {{visitors to the}} fort noted Christian iconography during the Jahangir period, with paintings of the <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Jesus found in the fort complex. In 1606, Guru Arjan of the Sikh faith was imprisoned at the fort before his death.|$|E
5|$|Melua's sixth studio album, Ketevan, was {{released}} on 16 September 2013. Ketevan entered the UK charts at number 6 - Katie joined a very small group of female artists, which includes <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Kate Bush, who have scored 6 consecutive UK top 10 studio albums. Ketevan also entered the top 10 in France, Poland, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland in its first week of release.|$|E
5|$|Rodman {{garnered}} as much {{publicity for}} his public antics. He dated <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> claimed {{she tried to}} conceive a child with him. Shortly after, Rodman famously wore a wedding dress to promote his autobiography Bad As I Wanna Be, claiming that he was bisexual {{and that he was}} marrying himself.|$|E

5|$|The Gatehouse {{is reached}} across a wooden bridge, {{incorporating}} a drawbridge. Burges intended {{the bridge to}} copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire {{in the event of}} attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive bretache and, above the entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E
5|$|By {{incorporating}} R infused beats in {{the music}} and not including her image on the cover artwork, marketing for the song {{gave the impression of}} Madonna as a black artist. That impression did not last long as Madonna would later convince Sire executives to shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget video directed by Ed Steinberg showed <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> her friends in a club singing and dancing to the song. The video helped to further promote the song and Madonna as an artist.|$|E

The RIAA also certified Back in Black as double Diamond (20million) in US sales, and by 2007 the album had sold 22million copies, which made it the fifth-best-selling album of all-time in the US.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} this information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was able to pass on an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Child, signed and dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. This appears to be a nostalgic and naive tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed an artistic footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further.|$|E
5|$|Morton {{interviewed about}} 70 {{people who had}} known Madonna since her youth. He had {{to spend a lot}} of evenings in bars and clubs in New York chatting to people—including artists, musicians, and directors—who had an {{interesting}} perspective on <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> the world. After its release, Madonna received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who pointed out Morton's poor writing skills and felt that the book did not present anything new about the singer. The book was a commercial disappointment. In the United States, the book reached eight on The New York Times Best Seller list, and sold half of its initial print.|$|E

It is decorated with carved roof bosses representing the Trinity, the <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> Child, and the murder of Thomas Becket. The chapel also has a sedilia and a piscina.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin Tour was {{the debut}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna. The tour {{supported}} her first two studio albums, Madonna (1983) and Like a Virgin (1984). Although initially planned {{for an international}} audience, the tour was restricted to the United States and Canada. Warner decided to send Madonna on tour after Like a Virgin became a success. After an official announcement on March 15, 1985, <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> her team began production plans. She wanted the tour to be a reflection of her own self and collaborated with designer Maripol for the costumes.|$|E
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was shot in}} Tokyo during Madonna's 2006 Confessions Tour stopover.

It was also incorporated in her Confessions Tour, where <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> her dancers jumped around the stage actively, while singing the song. The song was used in the movie The Devil Wears Prada (2005) and the Ugly Betty season 2 finale.|$|E
