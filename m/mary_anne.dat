5|$|Alfred Wallace {{was born}} in the Welsh village of Llanbadoc, near Usk, Monmouthshire. He was the seventh of nine {{children}} of Thomas Vere Wallace and <b>Mary</b> <b>Anne</b> Greenell. <b>Mary</b> <b>Anne</b> was English; Thomas Wallace was probably of Scottish ancestry. His family, like many Wallaces, claimed a connection to William Wallace, a leader of Scottish forces during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 13th century. Thomas Wallace graduated in law, but never practised law. He owned some income-generating property, but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's financial position. His mother was from a middle-class English family from Hertford, north of London. When Wallace was five years old, his family moved to Hertford. There he attended Hertford Grammar School until financial difficulties forced his family to withdraw him in 1836, when he was aged 14.|$|E

5|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} Longstreet family in January 1862. A scarlet fever {{epidemic}} in Richmond, Virginia claimed {{the lives of}} his one-year-old daughter <b>Mary</b> <b>Anne,</b> his four-year-old son James, and eleven-year-old Augustus ("Gus"), all within a week. His 13-year-old son Garland almost succumbed. The losses were devastating for Longstreet and he became withdrawn, both personally and socially. In 1861 his headquarters were noted for parties, drinking, and poker games. After he returned from the funeral the headquarters social life became for a time more somber. He rarely drank, and he became a devout Episcopalian.|$|E

25|$|On April 26 {{the pirates}} {{captured}} the ship <b>Mary</b> <b>Anne</b> with a hold full of Madeira wine. The captain of <b>Mary</b> <b>Anne</b> refused Bellamy's request to pilot {{them up the}} coast, so Bellamy arrested the captain and five of his crew and brought them aboard Whydah Gally, leaving three of the original crew aboard <b>Mary</b> <b>Anne.</b> Then Bellamy sent 7 of his own men onboard of <b>Mary</b> <b>Anne</b> - {{one of whom was}} the carpenter Thomas South who had been forced by Bellamy and his crew to make repairs; not wanting to join the pirate crew he had been offered release by Bellamy after work was completed, but the surviving pirates later testified to the court that they had over-ruled Bellamy's decision and forced South to stay due to his much whimpering and complaining. South testified that it was his choice to accompany the 6 pirates going aboard <b>Mary</b> <b>Anne</b> in hopes of escaping, possibly by jumping overboard and swimming ashore as they drew near to the Cape. Sometime around sunset that evening, the winds completely died, and a massive fog bank made visibility virtually nil. The four ships in Bellamy's fleet lost sight of one another. Bellamy's ships Anne (captained by his quartermaster Richard Noland) and Fisher moved out to sea (eventually making it to Damariscove Island with heavy damage). Williams had turned the Marianne away earlier, putting into Block Island to visit relatives but agreeing to meet Bellamy later off Maine.|$|E
