30|$|For {{both the}} S-K {{growth and the}} droplet epitaxy, <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> will be {{introduced}} to further release the strain caused by the lattice mismatch when {{the size of a}} QD reaches a critical value [12, 13]. Because <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> produce deleterious effects on QD properties, the mechanisms on how <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> are generated have been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically [11 – 20]. Based {{on the fact that the}} highest stress in a QD occurs at the corner where the island meets the substrate, it has been suggested that strain-relieving perfect <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> are generated at the island edge, when the island reaches its critical size [14 – 16]. The generation and morphology of perfect <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> have been considered theoretically [17 – 19]. Partial <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> have also been identified in relaxed islands [9, 20] and are believed to be energetically more favourable than perfect <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> in some regions of QDs [21]. In some situations, e.g. Ge/Si(001) QDs grown at high temperature, partial <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> can originate from the surface of QD islands and then glide to the island/substrate interface [22]. While most <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> are located at the island/substrate interface, it is interesting to note an exception in a recent report that presented evidence of <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> located above the island/substrate interface in an S-K-grown GaSb/GaAs(001) system [23]. The phenomenon was explained based on the compressive stress induced on the GaSb islands by the GaAs substrate due to lattice mismatch between the epilayer and the substrate [23]. In this letter, we conducted electron microscopy characterization of InAs/GaAs(001) QDs grown by droplet epitaxy. <b>Misfit</b> <b>dislocations</b> in relaxed InAs/GaAs(001) islands were found to be located about 2 nm above the island/substrate interface. However, detailed analysis of the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data indicates that the observation is in fact an artefact caused by surface oxidation of the material that resulted in substrate surface moving down about 2 nm. We therefore conclude that caution is needed when explaining the interfacial structure of the QDs.|$|R

InGaAs epitaxial layers were grown by low-pressure oragnometallic vapor-phase epitaxy on patterned and unpatterned GaAs substrate having etch-pit densities (EPD) of 200, 1400, and 10, 000 cm(exp - 2).

40|$|Abstract. A {{theoretical}} model is proposed which describes a new physical micromechanism for relaxation of misfit stresses in crystalline films, namely {{the formation of}} <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocation</b> walls. Energetic characteristics of films with <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocation</b> walls are estimated and {{compared with those of}} films with ‘standard ’ <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocation</b> rows. <b>Misfit</b> <b>dislocation</b> walls are recognized as misfit defect configurations that can be formed, in particular, in films resulting from convergence of island films. Misfit stresses occur in crystalline films due to the geometric mismatch at interphase bound-aries between crystalline lattices of films and substrates. In most cases a partial relaxation of misfit stresses is realized via generation of misfit dislocations (MDs) that form dislocation rows in interphase boundary planes; see e. g. [1 – 5]. Generally speaking, the formation of MD rows at interphase boundaries is either desirable or disappointing, from an applications viewpoint, depending on the roles of the films and interphase boundaries in applications of heteroepitaxial systems. So, if the properties of a film are exploited, the formation of MD rows commonly is desirable as it results in a (partial) compensation for misfit stresses in the film. If the properties of an interphase boundary are exploited, the formation of MD rows commonly is undesirable...|$|E

The films typically contain a combination of a/c-mixed domains and misfit dislocations. The PbTiO 3 layer was composed from {{the two types of}} the a-domain (90 ° domain) : a typical a/c-mixed domain configuration where a-domains are 20 – 30 nm wide and nano sized domains with a width of about 3 nm. In the latter case, the nano sized a-domain does not contact the film/substrate interface; it remains far from the interface and stems from the <b>misfit</b> <b>dislocation.</b> Strain maps obtained from the GPA of HRTEM images show the elastic interaction between the a-domain and the dislocations. The normal strain field and lattice rotation match each other between them.
