These tumours may also arise in the tunica dartos of the scrotum and the mammillary muscle of the nipple (genital leiomyoma), the smooth muscle of blood vessels (angioleiomyoma) and the lung (pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis).

40|$|A rare but {{distinctive}} {{variant of}} smooth muscle tumours that occurs {{almost exclusively in}} the uterus is characterised {{by the presence of}} plexiform tumourlets, which are composed of clumps and cords of tumour cells that form a discrete pseudoepithelial component. We report on a case of a primary leiomyosarcoma of the proximal humerus, which, in addition to characteristic histological and immunophenotypic features of leiomyosarcoma, contained plexiform tumourlets. Tumour cells in the plexiform component focally expressed muscle/smooth muscle actin, calponin and cytokeratin. Spindle-shaped and epithelioid smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumour</b> cells also expressed the above antigens. This is the first report of a plexiform smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumour</b> arising in bone. This case is remarkable, not only for being only the second reported case of a malignant plexiform smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumour,</b> but also for being one of very few examples of this type of tumour arising outside the uterus; it also is unique in having arisen in a male patient. This variant of primary leiomyosarcoma needs to be distinguished from other bone tumours containing epithelial elements, notably metastatic carcinoma...|$|E

40|$|Summary We {{examined}} bcl- 2 {{expression as}} well as p 53 expression and mutation in human uterine smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> to {{determine the influence of}} bcl- 2 expression on prognosis in patients with uterine leiomyosarcomas. bcl- 2 protein was expressed in nearly all benign smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> but in only 57 % of leiomyosarcomas. Benign smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> were usually negative for p 53 protein, but 16 out of 21 (76 %) leiomyosarcomas were positive. A p 53 gene mutation was detected in nine of the 16 leiomyosarcomas that showed p 53 -positive staining. A significant positive correlation was observed between p 53 mutation and p 53 expression, between the number of mitoses and the Ki- 67 labelling index, and between clinical stage and p 53 mutation. A significant negative correlation was observed between bcl- 2 expression and p 53 mutation, and between bcl- 2 expression and p 53 overexpression. Univariate survival analysis revealed that bcl- 2 expression, p 53 mutation and clinical stage (stage 1 vs stages 2 – 4) all showed a significant correlation with prognosis. In a multivariate stepwise regression analysis, positive bcl- 2 expression and stage 1 disease were the independent predictors of a favourable prognosis. Our results suggest that bcl- 2 is frequently expressed in human uterine smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours,</b> and that its expression may correlate with a favourable prognosis in patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma...|$|R

40|$|The {{distinction}} between benign and malignant smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> relying on histological {{features such as}} the mitotic index and pleomorphism remains a generally acknowledged difficulty in modern pathology. A cell image processor was therefore used to quantitatively assess the desmin and vimentin immunostain in 39 smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> which included 26 benign (leiomyomas) and 13 malignant (leiomyosarcomas) cases. The 13 leiomyosarcomas were primary (non-recurrent and non-metastatic). Ploidy level and cell density were also assessed {{on each of these}} 39 tumours by means of the computer-assisted microscopic analysis of 5 -microns thick Feulgen-stained histological sections. The results show that while neither the ploidy level determination nor the quantitative assessment of the vimentin immunostain made it possible to distinguish between leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, cell density determination and the quantitative assessment of the desmin immunostain enabled such a distinction to be made. Indeed, the leiomyomas exhibited a much higher level of desmin positivity than the leiomyosarcomas, as did diploid tumours as compared to the aneuploid (benign or malignant) ones. Furthermore, the leiomyoma group exhibited a significantly lower mean cell density value than the leiomyosarcoma group.

30|$|The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) which {{belongs to}} the human {{herpesvirus}} family {{has been associated with}} the development of a number of malignancies including Burkitt’s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal cancers [111]. Infection appears to be a requisite step {{in the development of a}} group of smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> arising exclusively in immunocompromised patients such as those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and those who have undergone solid organ transplantation. EBV-associated smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumours</b> (EBV-SMT) may arise in almost any body tissue, having been reported in the colon, liver, adrenal glands, and soft tissues; however, they occur most frequently in the CNS in an extra-axial location. A large case review in AIDS patients showed patients presenting with EBV-SMTs to have modest levels of immunosuppression, with mean CD 4 counts of 60 cells/μL, although in some cases above 200 cells/μL [111]. The time from HIV diagnosis to EBV-SMT presentation ranged from under 1 [*]month to 18 [*]years, with two thirds arising in the first 4 [*]years. Benign leiomyomas and malignant leiomyosarcomas have been reported, and while multifocal lesions are the norm, these appear to arise more often as separate neoplasms rather than metastasising. Treatment is primarily with resection although cases in the literature have been managed with a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [111].

40|$|Recognition of {{the types}} and {{characteristics}} of mesenchymal tumours is important, since each type has biological features peculiar to itself that govern its growth and behaviour and {{it is essential to}} know these if treatment is to be effectual. Because many differentiated cell types are capable of acting as facultative fibroblasts, histological diagnosis is often in error. It has been found that no matter how bizarre a tumour may appear, if explanted in vitro, the cells will betray their true nature. By this means the various mesenchymal tumour types have been classified, many examples collected and followed up and their biological potentialities recorded. In more recent studies these uncommon tumours in children have been studied and many of them found to be less malignant than in adults.

30|$|The {{rarity of}} these tumours has {{prevented}} {{the performance of}} large epidemiological studies to identify risk factors. Assuming an incidence of uterine sarcomas of 0.23  % by applying the ‘inverse rule of 3 ’, a surgeon will need to perform 1304 laparoscopic interventions to observe at least one case of uterine sarcoma with 95  % confidence. Imaging characteristics, tumour markers and other parameters indicating the risk of sarcoma are not available or not specific. In addition, the lack of uniform histologic criteria for diagnosing uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS) makes interpretation of the older studies difficult [4]. As the Stanford study [5] {{was the first to}} appreciate that the type of necrosis in a uterine smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumour</b> was of crucial importance, studies that preceded it did not evaluate {{the presence or absence of}} tumour cell necrosis. A leiomyosarcoma usually exhibits diffuse moderate-to-severe atypia, a mitotic count of > 10 MFs/ 10 HPFs and tumour cell necrosis. A tumour with any two of these features is clinically malignant often enough to warrant a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma [6].|$|E
