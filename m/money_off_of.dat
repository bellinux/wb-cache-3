5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about everybody in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made <b>money</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes and Doctor Browning {{travel to}} Las Vegas. They bump into Clare, who lies {{to her that}} Doctor Browning tried to seduce her. Mercedes wants to test Doctor Browning {{to see how much}} he loves her because of this, and comes up with a plan with Clare in order to scam him of his money. They pretend that Mercedes has been kidnapped and demand ransom money. When Mercedes realises that Clare has been lying she decides to stop the scheme, however Clare knocks her {{unconscious}} and takes her hostage. She demands ransom money in order for Mercedes' release. Jacqui is able to gather the money in order to release her, however, this money is stolen. As a result, Clare kidnaps Doctor Browning and traps him and Mercedes in a cage where she threatens them with vicious dogs. They are eventually tracked down and Clare is then sent to prison. Mercedes goes to see Jacqui, who has fled to Alicante having stolen <b>money</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> dangerous gangster Trevor Royle (Greg Wood), before returning to the village. When Myra discovers Doctor Browning is a murderer, she attempts to end his relationship with Mercedes. Doctor Browning attacks Myra because of this and she is left injured. Mercedes is furious when she discovers what Doctor Browning has done although forgives him. Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) also informs Mercedes that Doctor Browning attempted to rape her and Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) tells Mercedes that she had slept with Doctor Browning and he attempted to kill her in order to stop her from telling Mercedes, however Mercedes refuses to believe either of them. Myra continues to attempt to split the couple up however and starts a hate campaign against Doctor Browning, spreading flyers across the village that he is a murderer. As a result, Doctor Browning pays Trevor to kill Myra. Mercedes overhears Doctor Browning and Trevor discussing Myra's murder. Devastated, she tells Myra of this who attempts to flee the country. Mercedes and her family are devastated when they are informed that Doctor Browning shot Myra dead while she was attempting to flee. When Mercedes and Doctor Browning fight over this along with his other actions, Doctor Browning strangles Mercedes and she is almost killed. However, Jim walks in on them in time to save her. Mercedes' half-brother John Paul (James Sutton) later reveals to the family that Myra faked her death to escape Doctor Browning and Trevor's murder plot. When Clare is released from prison, she offers to throw Mercedes a 30th birthday party at The Loft in order to make amends and Mercedes agrees in order to get over her recent tragedies, unaware that Clare is secretly planning to bomb the club in order to get revenge. However, Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis) believes the bag containing the bomb has money and takes it to Ste Hay's (Kieron Richardson) leaving party, causing a huge explosion at the block of flats when Clare detonates the bomb. Mercedes is furious and confronts Clare in the street after learning that Clare had planned to kill her, and a fight breaks out between the two women. Mercedes pushes Clare into the road and she is run over by a car and killed instantly.|$|E
25|$|Continuing their journey, {{the player}} {{encounters}} the villainous Team Flare, whose goals at first {{seem to be}} geared towards making <b>money</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> Pokémon. Later encounters with Team Flare reveal their true goal to be the annihilation of humanity in order to return the world to a pristine, more beautiful state. In Shalour City, the player learns how to use Mega Evolution from the Mega Evolution guru Gurkinn and his granddaughter Korrina, {{who is also the}} Gym Leader of Shalour City. Defeating Korrina in a special Mega Evolution battle using Lucario, the player is given the ability to freely use Mega Evolution.

500|$|Following Zappa's death, {{his widow}} Gail created the Zappa Family Trust, {{which owns the}} rights to a massive trove of music and other {{creative}} output: more than 60 albums were released during Zappa's lifetime and 40 posthumously that are potentially worth at least {{tens of millions of}} dollars. Upon Gail's death in October 2015, it was revealed that Zappa's youngest children, Ahmet and Diva, were given control of the trust with shares of 30% each, while his older children Moon and Dweezil were given smaller shares of 20% each. As beneficiaries only, Moon and Dweezil will not see any money from the trust until it is profitable—in 2016, it was [...] "millions of dollars in debt"—and must seek permission from Ahmet, the trustee, to make <b>money</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> their father's music or merchandise bearing his name. The uneven divide of the trust has resulted in several conflicts between Zappa's children, including a feud between Dweezil and Ahmet over Dweezil's use of his father's music in live performances.|$|E

In 2002, he told The Jamaica Observer with respect to the songs he wrote that were released by Marley, [...] "Periodically, I get chump change, nothing big.

5000|$|On October 22, 2016, the SEC refiled its {{securities}} fraud claims against Paxton.

[...] The SEC further alleged that Paxton did not properly disclose his Severgy ownership stake on his taxes and that he attempted to conceal the stake by at different times claiming it was his fee for legal services, {{that it was a}} gift, and that he had only received it after investing money. [...] Cook later backtracked on these claims, undermining the SEC case against Paxton, when Cook's attorney conceded there was never a [...] "formal investment group" [...] involving Cook and Paxton but rather an [...] "ad hoc arrangement where, from time to time, good friends might invest in the same transaction" [...] with the particular participants varying from transaction to transaction.|$|R

5000|$|Statistics {{have shown}} that since the latter half the 2000s, {{there has been a}} decline in music piracy. According to a NPD survey, in 2012, {{approximately}} one in ten Internet users in the United States downloaded music through a file sharing service similar to BitTorrent or LimeWire. This number is significantly less than 2005, the peak of the piracy phenomenon, when one in five users used peer-to-peer networks to gather music files. The emergence of free streaming services has decreased the amount of users who pirate music on the internet. Services such as Spotify and Pandora have easy-to-use interfaces and decrease the risk for computer viruses and spyware. In comparison to the illegal software used by older music piracy networks such as Napster or Limewire, current music streaming services such as Spotify and Rdio offer cheap yet legal access to copyrighted music by paying the rights holders through <b>money</b> made <b>off</b> <b>of</b> payments made by premium users and through advertisements ...|$|R

2500|$|Finally, authors {{with strong}} {{political}} or philosophical points to make {{would no longer}} turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living. Prior to 1737, plays were de rigueur for authors who were not journalists. This {{had to do with}} the economics of booksellers. A bookseller would purchase a book from an author, whether that book was Gulliver's Travels or Collected Sermons, and would calculate his chances of making <b>money</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> sales. He would pay the author according to the money he expected to make. [...] (For example, Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield was famously sold to pay a single rent installment, whereas John Gay had been paid 1,000 pounds for his Poems on Various Occasions, which was more than seven years of salary for his government job). That would be the only money an author would see from the book, and therefore he or she would need to produce a new version, new book, or a serial publication of the next work to have hopes of more income. Prior to 1737, novelists had come from the ranks of satirists (Jonathan Swift) and journalists (Daniel Defoe), but these novels had in common wide changes of scenery, long plots, and often impossible things (such as talking horses)—all features that made the works unsuitable for the stage. The exception was Aphra Behn, who was a dramatist first and a novelist second. Her Oroonoko seems to have been written as a novel simply because there was no time for staging, as it was a political commentary on ongoing events, and she could not have another play on the boards at the time. Her Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister, like Gulliver's Travels and Moll Flanders, was inappropriate for the stage. [...] However, after 1737, novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors.|$|E
