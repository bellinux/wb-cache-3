Diagnosis was made on the basis of culture which was positive in 179 cases, and direct microscopic observation which was positive in 155 of 179 cases. In two cases, positive direct microscopic results were not confirmed by the culture. The most frequently isolated <b>mycete</b> was Microsporum canis (162 cases, 90. 5 %) and the main source of infection was the cat, which was often a healthy carrier. The second most frequent <b>mycete</b> was Trychophyton mentagrophytes. Trichophyton violaceum, a dermatophyte practically absent from our province since the 1960 s, was isolated in five patients. All patients were successfully treated. One adult was treated with oral ketoconazole and the other four with oral itraconazole.

40|$|Pomegranate (Punica granatum) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} commercial fruit crop in eastern Mazandaran (Iran, 35 ° 47 ’N, 50 ° 34 ’E). During spring 2013, distinct dark brown spots were observed on pomegranate fruits, from which a fungus was isolated on standard potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin (0. 05 % w/v). The mycelium was white- grey turning olive green over time, and produced oval to cylindrical, hyaline, unicellular, aseptate conidia measuring 5 - 13 × 1. 5 - 4 μm. Based on these morphological characters the <b>mycete</b> was tentatively identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of r-DNA was then amplified using the primers ITS 5 /ITS 4 sequenced locally and deposited under GeneBank accession No. KJ 769129. A sequence similarity search performed using BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990) algorithm available via GenBank confirmed the identification as C. gloeosporioides. Pathogenicity tests were carried out by placing agar-discs from a six-day-old culture of the fungus onto five artificially injured pomegranate fruits, which were placed inside sterile plastic bags. Controls consisted of non- inoculated fruits. Symptoms were reproduced after six days only on inoculated fruits and the pathogen was subsequently re-isolated, fulfilling Koch’s postulates.

60|$|The last Order {{which we}} need {{consider}} {{is that of}} the Primates. The male of the Lemur macaco is generally coal-black, whilst the female is brown. (29. Sclater, 'Proc. Zool. Soc.' 1866, p. i. The same fact has also been fully ascertained by MM. Pollen and van Dam. See, also, Dr. Gray in 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' May 1871, p. 340.) Of the Quadrumana of the New World, the females and young of <b>Mycetes</b> caraya are greyish-yellow and like each other; in the second year the young male becomes reddish-brown; in the third, black, excepting the stomach, which, however, becomes quite black in the fourth or fifth year. There is also a strongly-marked difference in colour between the sexes of <b>Mycetes</b> seniculus and Cebus capucinus; the young of the former, and I believe of the latter species, resembling the females. With Pithecia leucocephala the young likewise resemble the females, which are brownish-black above and light rusty-red beneath, the adult males being black. The ruff of hair round the face of Ateles marginatus is tinted yellow in the male and white in the female. Turning to the Old World, the males of Hylobates hoolock are always black, {{with the exception of a}} white band over the brows; the females vary from whity-brown to a dark tint mixed with black, but are never wholly black.

On the Semnopithecus, S. Muller, 'Zoog. Indischen Archipel.' tab. x.) In the beautiful Cercopithecus diana, the head of the adult male is of an intense black, whilst that of the female is dark grey; in the former the fur between the thighs is of an elegant fawn- colour, in the latter it is paler. In the beautiful and curious moustache monkey (Cercopithecus cephus) the only difference between the sexes is that the tail of the male is chestnut and that of the female grey; but Mr. Bartlett informs me that all the hues become more pronounced in the male when adult, whilst in the female they remain as they were during youth. According to the coloured figures given by Solomon Muller, the male of Semnopithecus chrysomelas is nearly black, the female being pale brown. In the Cercopithecus cynosurus and griseo-viridis one part of the body, which is confined to the male sex, is of the most brilliant blue or green, and contrasts strikingly with the naked skin on the hinder part of the body, which is vivid red.|$|E

40|$|The {{treatment}} of candidiasis and cryptococcosis {{is based on}} the use of antimycotic drugs such as amphotericin B, 5 -fluorocytosine, miconazole and fluconazole.

Amphotericin B, 5 -fluorocytosine, miconazole and fluconazole were chosen as reference drugs. Sensitivity tests were performed in according with the NCCLS method for agar dilution and MIC values were calculated for all the substances. No antifungal activity was evident in cultures treated with isoliquiritigenin (MIC values > 100 mg/L) while, very interesting results came from the combination: isoliquiritigenin/ antifungal drugs used at inhibitory and sub-inhibitory concentrations on yeast cultures (isoliquiritigenin 50 - 10 mg/L, amphotericin B 10 - 0. 1 mg/L, 5 -fluorocytosine 2. 5 - 0. 5 mg/L, miconazole 0. 25 - 0. 05, fluconazole 10 - 0. 1 mg/L). The FIC index used to estimate the interactions outcomes was also calculated. The association of isoliquiritigenin with the antimycotic often resulted in a synergic effect with addition (0. 55 <FIC index< 1). In few cases we observed indifference (1 <FIC index< 2).

Based on previous reports, some strains of fungus including Pestalo-tiopsis microspora have been reported to degrade this plastic. The ultimate objective is to create a genetically engineered variant of Pichia pastoris which will digest polyester polyure-thane (PUR) using the enzyme responsible for PUR degrada-tion from Aspergillus flavus; this year we aim to identify the esterase, believed to be responsible for the biodegradation. The degradation of TPU (a granular form of thermoplastic PUR) and water-based PUR by A. flavus, was tested using incubation with shaking for one month. Although no significant weight loss was observed, the fungus was capable of grow-ing on the water-based PUR as a food source. Esterase, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the water-based PUR, was observed in the water-based PUR lane of the Na-tive PAGE gel and has a molecular weight of approximately 20 kDa. Since the only difference between the experimental wa-ter-based lane and experimental TPU lane, was the esterase band, it can be confirmed that the degradation of the plastic and growth of fungus {{can be attributed to the}} esterase.

He seems, speaking scientifically, to be some sort of <b>Mycetes</b> or Howler, from the flat globular throat, which indicates the great development of the hyoid bone; but, happily for the sleep of the neighbourhood, he never utters in captivity any sound beyond a chuckle; and he is supposed, by some here, from his burly thick-set figure, vast breadth between the ears, short neck, and general cast of countenance, to have been, in a prior state of existence, a man and a brother--and that by no means of negro blood--who has gained, in this his purgatorial stage of existence, nothing save a well-earned tail.

Hence, these latter monkeys probably use their voices as a mutual call; and this is certainly the case with some quadrupeds, for instance with the beaver.[336] Another gibbon, the H. agilis, is highly remarkable, from having the power of emitting a complete and correct octave of musical notes,[337] which we may reasonably suspect serves as a sexual charm; but I shall have to recur to this subject in the next chapter. The vocal organs of the American <b>Mycetes</b> caraya are one-third larger in the male than in the female, and are wonderfully powerful. These monkeys, when the weather is warm, make the forests resound during the morning and evening with their overwhelming voices. The males begin the dreadful concert, in which the females, with their less powerful voices, sometimes join, and which is often continued during many hours. An excellent observer, Rengger,[338] could not perceive that they were excited to begin their concert by any special cause; he thinks that like many birds, they delight in their own music, and try to excel each other. Whether most of the foregoing monkeys have acquired their powerful voices in order to beat their rivals and to charm the females—or whether the vocal organs have been strengthened and enlarged through the inherited effects of long-continued use without any particular good being gained—I will not pretend to say; but the former view, at least {{in the case of the}} Hylobates agilis, seems the most probable.|$|E
60|$|In {{the class}} of Mammals, with which we are here more {{particularly}} concerned, the males of almost all the species use their voices during the breeding-season much more {{than at any other}} time; and some are absolutely mute excepting at this season. Both sexes of other species, or the females alone, use their voices as a love-call. Considering these facts, and that the vocal organs of some quadrupeds are much more largely developed in the male than in the female, either permanently or temporarily during the breeding season; and considering that in most of the lower classes the sounds produced by the males, serve not only to call but to excite or allure the female, it is a surprising fact that we have not as yet any good evidence that these organs are used by male mammals to charm the females. The American <b>Mycetes</b> caraya perhaps forms an exception, as does more probably one of those apes which come nearer to man, namely, the Hylobates agilis. This gibbon has an extremely loud but musical voice. Mr. Waterhouse states,[405] “It appeared to me that in ascending and descending the scale, the intervals were always exactly half-tones; and I am sure that the highest note was the exact octave to the lowest. The quality of the notes is very musical; and I do not doubt that a good violinist would be able to give a correct idea of the gibbon’s composition, excepting as regards its loudness.” Mr. Waterhouse then gives the notes. Professor Owen, who is likewise a musician, confirms the foregoing statement, and remarks that this gibbon “alone of brute mammals may be said to sing.” It appears to be much excited after its performance. Unfortunately its habits have never been closely observed in a state of nature; but from the analogy of almost all other animals, it is highly probable that it utters its musical notes especially during the season of courtship.|$|E

Mr. Green, in 'Journal of Linnean Society,' vol. x. 'Zoology,' 1869, note 362.) Another gibbon, the H. agilis, is remarkable, from having the power of giving a complete and correct octave of musical notes (6. C.L. Martin, 'General Introduction to the Natural History of Mamm.

60|$|We {{will first}} briefly {{run through the}} class of mammals, and then turn to birds. The gorilla {{seems to be a}} polygamist, and the male differs {{considerably}} from the female; so it is with some baboons which live in herds containing twice as many adult females as males. In South America the <b>Mycetes</b> caraya presents well-marked sexual differences in colour, beard, and vocal organs, and the male generally lives with two or three wives: the male of the Cebus capucinus differs somewhat from the female, and appears to be polygamous.[340] Little is known on this head with respect to most other monkeys, but some species are strictly monogamous. The ruminants are eminently polygamous, and they more frequently present sexual differences than almost any other group of mammals, especially in their weapons, but likewise in other characters. Most deer, cattle, and sheep are polygamous; as are most antelopes, though some of the latter are monogamous. Sir Andrew Smith, in speaking of the antelopes of South Africa, says that in herds of about a dozen there was rarely more than one mature male. The Asiatic Antilope saiga appears to be the most inordinate polygamist in the world; for Pallas[341] states that the male drives away all rivals, and collects a herd of about a hundred, consisting of females and kids: the female is hornless and has softer hair, but does not otherwise differ much from the male. The horse is polygamous, but, except in his greater size and in the proportions of his body, differs but little from the mare. The wild boar, in his great tusks and some other characters, presents well-marked sexual characters; in Europe and in India he leads a solitary life, except during the breeding-season; but at this season he consorts in India with several females, as Sir W. Elliot, who has had large experience in observing this animal, believes: whether this holds good in Europe is doubtful, but is supported by some statements. The adult male Indian elephant, like the boar, passes much of his time in solitude; but when associating with others, “it is rare to find,” as Dr. Campbell states, “more than one male with a whole herd of females.” The larger males expel or kill the smaller and weaker ones. The male differs from the female by his immense tusks and greater size, strength, and endurance; so great is the difference in these latter respects, that the males when caught are valued at twenty per cent. above the females.[342] With other pachydermatous animals the sexes differ very little or not at all, and they are not, as far as known, polygamists. Hardly a single species amongst the Cheiroptera and Edentata, or in the great Orders of the Rodents and Insectivora, presents well-developed secondary sexual differences; and I can find no account of any species being polygamous, excepting, perhaps, the common rat, the males of which, as some rat-catchers affirm, live with several females.|$|E

5000|$|For {{names in}} the {{singular}} form, plurals cannot be made (singulare tantum) as would imply multiple groups with the same label and not multiple members of that group (by analogy, in English, chairs and tables are types of furniture, which cannot {{be used in the}} plural form [...] "furnitures" [...] to describe both members), conversely names plural form are pluralia tantum. However, a partial exception to this is made by the use of vernacular names.However, to avoid repetition of taxonomic names which break the flow of prose, vernacular names of members of a genus or higher taxa are often used and recommended, these are formed by writing the name of the taxa in sentence case roman ("standard" [...] in MS Office) type, therefore treating the proper noun as an English common noun (e.g. the salmonellas), although there is some debate about the grammar of plurals, which can either be regular plural by adding -(e)s (the salmonellas) or using the ancient Greek or Latin plural form (irregular plurals) of the noun (the salmonellae); the latter is problematic as the plural of - bacter would be -bacteres, while the plural of myces (N.L. masc. n. from Gr. masc. n. mukes) is <b>mycetes.</b>|$|E

The diagnosis of catheter-related infections relies on the presence of clinical manifestation of infection and the evidence of colonization of the catheter tip by bacteria or fungi. The most frequent pathogens were Gram-positive organisms, mainly coagulase negative staphylococci, followed by Gram-negative and <b>mycetes.</b> During the years 2001 - 2003 we examined 2079 vascular catheters, of which 896 were positive for bacterial and fungal species.

Recent data propose that dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota composition contributes to development of Type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). Moreover, dysbiosis alters intestinal endothelium permeability causing the “Leaky gut syndrome” (LGS). We measured in 15 selected patients with standard medical cures for sable T 2 D the effects of 6 months of endurance, resistance and flexibility training on the gut microbiota composition and intestinal permeability. At baseline, T 2 D patients had high biochemical parameters (glycaemia, HOMA index, HbA 1 c, C-Reactive Protein [CRP]) with dysbiosis (elevated concentration of <b>Mycetes)</b> and altered intestinal impermeability (Measured by faecal Zonulin). Alter chronic exercise, glycaemia, HOMA index, HbA 1 c and CPR were reduced as well as faecal presence of Mycetesspp and Zonulin. This pilot study showed that selected patients with T 2 D had intestinal dysbiosis with overgrow of <b>Mycetes,</b> presence of LGS and low grade inflammation. Interestingly, chronic exercise significantly reduced all these parameters...|$|E
