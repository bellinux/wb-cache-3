40|$|We wish to {{investigate}} circuits containing devices that are nonlinear and/or time-variant and/or active, including transistors, tunnel diodes, and varactor diodes. Such investigations include (a) theoretical and experimental behavior of parametric amplifiers, frequency multipliers, <b>mixers,</b> <b>transistor</b> and tunnel-diode circuits; and (b) theoretical study of those properties that are invariant under {{certain types of}} imbeddings, in part {{by means of a}} general voltage-current conservation theorem...|$|R
40|$|The {{unlicensed}} band around 60 GHz has motivated work on mmwave CMOS building blocks such as low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) and mixers [1, 2] and oscillators [3]. However, {{the integration of}} these building blocks to form transceivers poses additional constraints {{on the design of}} these circuits. For example, a direct-conversion receiver would require at least two inductors for the LNA, one inductor for each quadrature mixer, at least two inductors for the quadrature oscillator, and at least one inductor for the first divider in the synthesizer loop. (In practice, each side of the quadrature oscillator must be loaded by a divider to retain phase balance, thus requiring one more inductor.) With the large foot print of the inductors, the 60 GHz quadrature phases of the LO must travel a long distance before reaching the mixers (or, if the <b>mixer</b> <b>transistors</b> are placed next to the LO transistors, the RF signal must travel a long distance to reach the mixers.) Under these conditions...|$|R
50|$|Nonlinear {{electronic}} components {{that are used}} as <b>mixers</b> include diodes, <b>transistors</b> biased near cutoff, and at lower frequencies, analog multipliers. Ferromagnetic-core inductors driven into saturation have also been used. In nonlinear optics, crystals with nonlinear characteristics are used to mix two frequencies of laser light to create optical heterodynes.|$|R
5000|$|First {{detector}}, second detector - the <b>mixer</b> tube or <b>transistor</b> {{is sometimes}} called the [...] "first detector", while the demodulator that extracts the modulation from the IF signal is called the [...] "second detector". In a dual-conversion superhet there are two mixers, so the demodulator is called the [...] "third detector".|$|R
40|$|In this report, three single <b>transistor</b> <b>mixer</b> {{circuits}} are discussed. The mixers {{are meant}} to be used in low power integrated zero IF receivers with a power supply voltage of about 1 V. As far as linear circuit analysis techniques still hold, some statements are made about gain, noise, required LO-power and optimal source impedances. Furthermore, a new analytic method is presented which makes it possible to find reliable results for non-linear steady state systems, without the cost of time con-suming simulation runs. The method makes it possible to calculate the transfer function, noise and distortion of switching single <b>transistor</b> <b>mixers</b> and has been partly implemented in the symbolic mathematics software package “MATHE-MATICA”. This report presents the results of the traineeship at the Philips Research Labora-tories, Eindhoven during the months March through June, 1993. The traineeship was supervised by...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{instrumentation}} {{suitable for}} measuring aircraft noise and sonic booms is described. An electric current {{proportional to the}} sound pressure level at a condenser microphone is produced and transmitted over a cable and amplified by a zero drive amplifier. The converter consists of a local oscillator, a dual-gate field-effect <b>transistor</b> <b>mixer,</b> and a voltage regulator/impedance translator. The improvements include automatic tuning compensation against changes in static microphone capacitance and means for providing a remote electrical calibration capability...|$|R
40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Wireless {{applications}} create {{special needs}} for mixers. Over the age, mixer {{technology has evolved}} from a major research topic into one of great maturity. Diode mixers are now well understood and diode mixers exhibiting excellent performance over multioctave bandwidths are commonly available at a lower cost. However, active mixers have special advantages in minimizing the complexity of a system or in reducing noise or intermodulation distortion. The main aim of this project is to design a single stage active <b>transistor</b> <b>mixer</b> in RF frequency range. Circuit implementation and simulations were carried out in Agilent, ADS (Advance Design System). Various mixer design issues including the nonlinear behavior of transistors were covered and dealt with while designing the single stage <b>transistor</b> <b>mixer.</b> ADS simulations were carried out on Infineon BFP 640 transistor and also on Infineon BFP 620 transistor. Further, circuit implementation was carried out on board using the BFP 620 transistor and measurements were done using available measurement hardware systems in the Microwave laboratory at California State University, Sacramento and at Centellax Inc, Santa RosaElectrical and Electronic Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A {{dual-mode}} field programmable RF amplifier / <b>mixer</b> is presented. <b>Transistor</b> switches, low loss CPW {{lines and}} RF transistors are combined in a 3 -stage distributed topology which {{can operate as}} either a distributed amplifier or a distributed mixer. Functional reconfigurability is achieved using one bit programming without changing the signal path. The programmable module in its distributed amplifier mode provides a gain of 8 dB in a 3 - 8 GHz bandwidth. When switched to the distributed mixer mode, it shows a measured average conversion gain of 4 dB in a 1 - 16 GHz bandwidth. This circuit is fabricated in a standard 130 nm CMOS technology and occupies 4 mmx 1. 2 mm chip area...|$|R
40|$|We measure {{graphene}} coplanar waveguides {{from direct}} current (DC) to 13. 5 GHz {{and show that}} the apparent resistance (in the presence of parasitic impedances) has an quadratic frequency dependence, but the intrinsic conductivity (without the influence of parasitic impedances) is frequency-independent. Consequently, in our devices the real part of the complex alternating current conductivity {{is the same as}} the DC value and the imaginary part~ 0. The graphene channel is modelled as a parallel resistive-capacitive network with a frequency dependence identical to that of the Drude conductivity with momentum relaxation time~ 2. 1 ps, highlighting the influence of alternating current (AC) electron transport on the electromagnetic properties of graphene. This can lead to optimized design of high-speed analogue field-effect <b>transistors,</b> <b>mixers,</b> frequency doublers, low-noise amplifiers and radiation detectors...|$|R
40|$|Graphene as a {{material}} {{has created a}} lot of interest due to properties like high saturation velocity [1], high current carrying capacity, ambipolar characteristics [2] and high transconductance. These properties make graphene based transistors a promising candidate for high frequency applications. Recently, there have been [2 - 3] demonstration of RF <b>mixers</b> with graphene <b>transistors.</b> Traditional DC measurements are not sufficient when considering graphene transistors for high frequency circuit design, making it essential to study the transistor IV performance at operating frequencies>GHz. In this work we outline an RF IV extraction technique and use physics based analytical model to evaluate the performance of graphene transistors with HfO 2 high-κ dielectric. Figure 1 shows an SEM micrograph of the fabricated transistor on quasi-free-standing graphene (QFEG). QFEG is prepared on (0001) oriented 6 H-SiC substrates through a combination of sublimation and hydrogen intercalation [4]. The sublimation of Si takes place at 1625 °C for 15 minutes under a 1 Torr Ar ambient, while hydrogen intercalation follows at 1050 °C for 120 minutes in a 600 Torr Ar/H 2 mixture, producing monolayer and bilayer QFEG. Ti (10 nm) /Au (100 nm) contacts are used as source/drain metallizations, after which gates are prepared. HfO 2 dielectric (10 nm thick) was deposited using an oxide seeded ALD (O-ALD) technique previously described in detail elsewhere [5]. The DC transfer characteristics of a 750 nm gate length device are shown in Figure 2 a. Figure 3 a and 4 a shows th...|$|R
