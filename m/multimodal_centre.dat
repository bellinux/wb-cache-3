It was also looking into expanding into a <b>multimodal</b> logistics <b>centre</b> as the main merchandise railway line, serving the Black Sea ports of Poti and Batumi, run right on the location of its airfield making it very convenient for rail, road and air freight to converge both to and from Central Europe, northern Africa and Asia.|$|R

Logicity will be a logistic hub built around Turku Airport. Logicity is supposed to link the different modes of transportation together. Location is considered ideal due to facts that Turku Airport is just in 20 minutes reach by sea ports of Turku and Naantali which combined values are comparable to the Port of Vuosaari in Helsinki, Both E18 highway to St. Petersburg and E63 to Tampere go via Turku Airport, and also rail transport connection to Russia and China passes by Logicity area. Pilot Turku describers Turku Region as [...] "the meeting point of the East, the West and the Nordic countries" [...] and as [...] "the <b>multimodal</b> transport <b>centre</b> of the Nordic Triangle".|$|R

Major railway facilities were built around the original Town wharf site with most servicing equipment moving to the new and substantial Island Harbour port built in 1956. When containerisation was introduced and freight transportation trends changed, Bluff was not selected to be developed as a container port, but it and the railway have remained busy with traffic such as frozen meat, wool, and wood chips. In more recent years a degree of containerisation has taken place with the port investing in mobile crane and straddler facilities, rail playing a predominant role in moving containers from the large private container distribution centre located at Clifton. In 2016 a new port owned <b>multimodal</b> distribution <b>centre</b> was completed on an unused area of the Invercargill railway yards next to the Bluff Line entrance. The port company favouring rail as it's wharf to centre transportation solution.|$|R
40|$|ISSN 0761 - 8980 International audienceThere are {{two main}} types of {{approach}} which govern the supply of public transport in major built up areas. There are the mass transportation, which leads to introduction of rail-based transport systems (underground railways or trams) and that of distribution, which aims to provide a dense network of bus routes. These two major types of transport system have very different characteristics, in terms of costs and level and quality of service. This dual nature of supply opens the way for an additional level which is concerned with ensuring that the network is connected at nodal points which operate as <b>multimodal</b> exchange <b>centres.</b> This paper discusses the characteristics {{of this type of}} intermediate network, which is based on an indissociable triple association of equipment / infrastructure / level of service, as such a network has been envisaged {{in the case of the}} Lyon conurbation.

40|$|AbstractThe paper dwells upon a {{modified}} centre-of-gravity method {{for determining the}} location of a cargo transit terminal (based on the example of Chelyabinsk region) as a <b>multimodal</b> logistic <b>centre.</b> The modified method for calculating the “centre of gravity” for determining the optimal coordinates of a transit terminal is designed to meet the following regulations: if there is some unevenness of cargo flows between any point and the transport node, some part of a rolling stock should be unloaded {{in the direction of a}} lesser traffic flow. The coordinates of the terminal complex are determined similarly to the centre-of-gravity coordinates of a physical system and are treated as a transport problem according to the criterion of minimum total annual costs of goods transportations, storage and redistribution in terminal complexes. The paper analyzes integration of terminal-to-terminal transportations in transit terminal complexes that differ in directions, volumes and regional destinations. This measure allows to make cargo transit more efficient by reducing excess transportations and, as a result, non-productive runs of transit traffic. The proposed method for identifying rational location of transit terminal complexes within the existing transport network configuration takes into account the transit data. The integration of terminal-to-terminal transportations in the transit terminal complex, the location of which is determined on the basis of this method, will reduce excess transportations and total costs of operating transit traffic within the regional transport system, which, in its turn, will improve the efficiency of transit transport nodes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recent {{scientific}} investigations {{indicate that}} multimodal biometrics overcome the technical limitations of unimodal biometrics, making them ideally suited for everyday life applications {{that require a}} reliable authentication system. However, for a successful adoption of multimodal biometrics, such systems would require large heterogeneous datasets with complex multimodal fusion and privacy schemes spanning various distributed environments. From experimental investigations of current multimodal systems, this paper reports the various issues related to speed, error-recovery and privacy that impede the diffusion of such systems in real-life. This calls for a robust mechanism that caters to the desired real-time performance, robust fusion schemes, interoperability and adaptable privacy policies. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to present a framework that addresses the abovementioned issues by leveraging on the heterogeneous resource sharing capacities of Grid services and the efficient machine learning capabilities of artificial neural networks (ANN). Hence, this paper proposes a Grid-based neural network framework for adopting multimodal biometrics with the view of overcoming the barriers of performance, privacy and risk issues that are associated with shared heterogeneous <b>multimodal</b> data <b>centres.</b> The framework combines the concept of Grid services for reliable brokering and privacy policy management of shared biometric resources along with a momentum back propagation ANN (MBP-ANN) model of machine learning for efficient multimodal fusion and authentication schemes. Real-life applications would be able to adopt the proposed framework to cater to the varying business requirements and user privacies for a successful diffusion of multimodal biometrics in various day-to-day transactions...|$|R
