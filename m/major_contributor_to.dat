5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the {{sedimentation}} of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch, an {{irrigation ditch}} near McDonald Creek. Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek, the ditch has failed numerous times, sending several tons {{of dirt and}} mud downstream. The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $10,000 monitoring system for the ditch in September 2010, and applied for a $100,000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace the ditch with pipes.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipyard}} {{was established}} in Faversham by James Pollock & Sons (Shipbuilders) in 1916 {{at the request of}} Lord Fisher, the First Lord of The Admiralty, for manufacturing barges for landing craft. Faversham already had a tradition of shipbuilding, and it soon became a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> markets throughout the world, producing vessels such as the Molliette and the Violette, both constructed of concrete. Over 1200 ships were built and launched from Faversham between 1916 and 1969.|$|E

5|$|In the novel, Miranda {{has many}} {{similarities}} to Wintour—among them, she is British, has two children, and {{is described as}} a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the Met. Priestly is a tyrant who makes impossible demands of her subordinates, gives them almost none of the information or time necessary to comply and then berates them for their failures to do so.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is an {{essential}} element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.|$|E

5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{personal}} taxes in Nauru. The {{unemployment rate is}} estimated to be 90%, and of those who have jobs, the government employs 95%. The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, {{in the absence of an}} alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance. Tourism is not a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the economy.|$|E
5|$|There {{is limited}} {{industrial}} activity — the major industries are household, tailoring, embroidery, plastic wire and metal manufacturing.

The development of industries is constrained by the town being linear and by the applicability of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) regulations that prevent large-scale construction and industrial buildings.|$|E

5|$|Two major {{protactinium}} isotopes, 231Pa and 233Pa, {{are produced}} from thorium in nuclear reactors; both are undesirable {{and are usually}} removed, thereby adding complexity to the reactor design and operation. In particular, 232Th via (n,2n) reactions produces 231Th which quickly (half-life 25.5 hours) decays to 231Pa. The last isotope, while not a transuranic waste, has a long half-life of 32,760 years and is a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the long term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel.|$|E
