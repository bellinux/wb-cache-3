40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study of 123 couples provided some support for the utility of a model of adaptation to parenthood. Even when the effects of initial well-being were controlled, the level of subjective stress (strain) {{and the use of}} tension-reducing coping strategies emerged as (negative) predictors of contemporaneous and delayed <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation.</b> This support for the model was also evident when an external measure of adaptation was utilized. There was, additionally, support for the proposal that problem-focused coping facilitates adaptation to new parenthood, although 18 weeks after the birth this effect was evident only for males. In relation to coping resources, the data provided some support for the proposed effects of the individual resources (self-esteem, internality) and both marital and family support. Non-family support was not related to any of the <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation.</b> There was some evidence that females experienced lower levels of psychological well-being in the immediate postnatal period than males, while males rated their partner 2 ̆ 7 s coping effectiveness more poorly than females. In addition to the gender difference in the effects of problem-focused coping, there was also evidence to suggest that the effects of internality on adaptation 4 weeks after the event differed for males and females...|$|E

We examine data from a 2005 - 2006 survey of migrant Muslim men in Japan, specifically, in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. This study had two main goals. The first goal was to classify the extent <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> to Japan <b>of</b> the Muslims living in Japan. The second {{purpose of the study}} was to clarify some of the factors that are associated with differences in adaptation. It is reasonable that the extent <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> is influenced by attitudes and by individual characteristics. I start by defining adaptation as having two dimensions. The first dimension is a subjective <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation.</b> This is the perception <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> to Japan that the migrants　subjectively claimed and that they reported in the questionnaire. The second dimension is an objective <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> that is <b>measured</b> by differences in various aspects of their living situations. The characteristics are organized in each quadrant according to the adaptation type that they fit into based on the cross-tabulation analyses’ results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} experiences of accessibility in outdoor environments and public places for people who are visually impaired. The authors chose an interview based methodology to answer the study´s purpose. Nine people from two different counties were interviewed with semi-structured interview questions, but with the freedom to answer the questions as they pleased. The included criteria´s for this study were acuity less than 0. 3 and to be a member of the visually impaired national association (Synskadades riksförbund). The study was analyzed by a qualitative content analysis that resulted in three categories, "The difference between independence and dependence in accessible environments", "The difference between security and insecurity in accessible environments" and "General ignorance towards accessible environments". The result showed that the physical outdoor environments and public places could both inhibit and enable people with visual impairments, depending on if <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> for visual impairment had been made. The participants of this study had developed their own strategies to feel involved in activities outside their home. Conclusions that could be made from this study were that outdoor environments and public places could not be fully accessible by people with visual impairment and that there is a lack of knowledge in society regarding the <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> that is needed.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between sexual activity among urban adolescent girls and four global <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> (academic motivation, school achievement, depressive symptoms, and expectations about the future). Method: Data derived from the Social and Health Assessment, a self-report survey administered in 1998 to students {{in the public school}} system in New Haven, CT (149 classes at 17 middle and high schools). Results: Of 1, 413 respondents (57 % black, 28 % Hispanic; mean age 13. 4 ± 1. 7 years), 414 (29 %) acknowledged prior sexual intercourse; the proportions of sexually active girls in 6 th, 8 th, and 10 th grades were 14 %, 30 %, and 50 %, respectively. In multivariate analyses of covariance, sexual activity was significantly associated with all four <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> (p <. 001). Other correlates of at least one <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> maladaptation included socioeconomic status, sensation seeking, and lower school grade (p <. 001 for each), peer pressure (p <. 01), and black ethnicity, and the interaction of sexual activity by lower school grade (p <. 05 for each).

40|$|Providing {{additional}} finance for adaptation {{is a key}} element of the emerging international climate change framework. This paper discusses how adaptation funding may be allocated among developing countries in a transparent, efficient and equitable way. We propose an approach based on three criteria: the climate change impact experienced in a country, a country’s adaptive (or social) capacity and its implementation capacity. Rough indicators are proposed for each of these three dimensions. Physical impact and adaptive capacity together determine a country’s vulnerability to climate change. It seems both efficient and fair that countries which are more vulnerable should have a stronger claim on adaptation resources. The third dimension, implementation capacity, introduces a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> effectiveness.

Twenty patients admitted to PCUs were interviewed at one week, three weeks, and five weeks after admission. Results show that individual QoL was high and remained stable over the three measurement points.

40|$|Sehnsucht, {{the longing}} or yearning for ideal yet {{seemingly}} unreachable states of life, is a salient topic in German culture and has proven useful for understanding self-regulation across adulthood in a German sample (e. g., Scheibe, Freund, & Baltes, 2007). The current study tested whether findings for German samples could {{be generalized to}} the more individualistic and agentic U. S. American culture. Four samples of U. S.

40|$|A {{distributed}} physically-based hydrological model named CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) is used {{to perform}} {{a detailed analysis of}} the response of Toledo River basin (Paranà, Brazil) to climate projections. CATHY couples a subsurface module, described by a three-dimensional Richards equation, with a surface module, led by a one-dimensional diffusion wave equation. Dynamical coupling is achieved by means of a switching in boundary conditions, from a Dirichlet to a Neumann condition and vice versa. Future climate scenarios are determined from historical time series of daily rainfall and temperature in the study area by applying changes compatible with predictions made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A twenty-year simulation is run under four future scenarios and the results are compared with those obtained under an unaltered scenario. It is found that the rise or the lowering of water table level is generally not uniform across the basin, being more significant in the uppermost areas. This suggests that <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> to climate change effects could be practiced by selecting suitable cultures across drainage basins, especially in the areas where the impact of climate change are most significant...|$|E

The study consisted of three training periods (A, B, C), each of approximately 2 months' duration, and four testing weeks. Testing consisted of incremental tests to exhaustion for swimming, cycling and running, and assessments for anthropometry plus cardiovascular and pulmonary measures.

40|$|Natural {{selection}} favors fitter variants in a population, but actual evolutionary processes may decrease fitness by mutations {{and genetic}} drift. How is the stochastic evolution of molecular biological systems shaped by natural selection? Here, we derive a theorem on the fitness flux in a population, {{defined as the}} selective effect of its genotype frequency changes. The fitness-flux theorem generalizes Fisher’s fundamental theorem of natural selection to evolutionary processes including mutations, genetic drift, and time-dependent selection. It shows that a generic state of populations is adaptive evolution: {{there is a positive}} fitness flux resulting from a surplus of beneficial over deleterious changes. In particular, stationary nonequilibrium evolution processes are predicted to be adaptive. Under specific nonstationary conditions, notably during a decrease in population size, the average fitness flux can become negative. We show that these predictions are in accordance with experiments in bacteria and bacteriophages and with genomic data in Drosophila.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess whether the AVL scale satisfies the Rasch model in a cataract population. Methods: The 24 -item AVL scale (18 negatively and 6 positively coded) was mailed to 436 cataract patients for self-administration whilst they were on the waiting list for cataract surgery at the Flinders Eye Centre, Adelaide, South Australia. Rasch analysis was performed to determine whether the items were measuring a single construct (unidimensionality) as examined with fit statistics and principal components analysis (PCA) of the residuals. The ability of the scale to distinguish between the levels <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> the participants (person separation) was investigated, with a value ≥ 2. 0 established as the minimum acceptable. Results: The AVL scale was unable to differentiate sufficiently between participants’ levels <b>of</b> <b>adaptation,</b> indicating poor person separation. One item did not fit the construct, causing misfit. Furthermore, the five positively worded items did not appear either to measure the same construct as other items, resulting in lack of unidimensionality evidenced by PCA. Following the deletion of these items, the AVL scale was one-dimensional but a single item continued to misfit, so it had to be deleted, resulting in an 18 -item AVL scale. Even so, the discriminating abilities of the scale continued to be poor. Conclusions: The AVL scale is not an appropriate <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> to vision loss in a cataract population...|$|R

Both age groups were equally divided into two subgroups; one subgroup was exposed to 11. 25 ° step increments of visual feedback rotation, every 45 trials (up {{to a total of}} 90 °), whereas a second subgroup was subjected to 90 ° rotation from the onset of exposure. Participants performed discrete, horizontal hand movements to virtual targets in four randomized directions. Targets appeared on a computer screen in front of them, and a board prevented vision of the hand at all times. Differential effects of aging on visuomotor adaptation were found, depending on the time course of the visual distortion. In both age groups, early exposure to the sudden visual feedback distortion resulted in typical spiral-like trajectories, which became straighter by late exposure. However, the final adaptation level was reduced in the aged group, although the aftereffects were similar. When subjects were exposed to the gradual distortion, no statistically significant differences in <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> with advancing age were found. In this case, both age groups appeared to adapt equally. However, after removal of the distortion, elderly subjects showed reduced aftereffects as compared with the young group.

Moreover, the author investigated the relation between the need for cognitive closure (NCC; Webster [amp] Kruglanski, 1994) and psychological and sociocultural adaptation. The participants completed a questionnaire including <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> sociocultural <b>adaptation,</b> psychological adaptation, social relationships, acculturation attitudes, and NCC. The results of a multivariate analysis of variance revealed main effects of acculturation strategies for both forms <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> and a main effect of NCC for psychological adaptation. The Croatian and Polish immigrants differed in the level <b>of</b> sociocultural <b>adaptation</b> but not in the level <b>of</b> psychological <b>adaptation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Most {{organisms are}} able to survive shorter or longer {{exposure}} to sub-zero temperatures. Hypothetically, trogloxenes characterized as not adapted, and troglophiles as not completely adapted to thermally stable subterranean environment, have retained or partially retained their ability to withstand freezing, while most troglobionts have not. We tested this hypothesis experimentally on 37 species inhabiting caves in Slovenia, analyzing their lower lethal temperatures in summer and winter, or for one season, if the species was not present in caves during both seasons. Specimens were exposed for 12 hrs to 1 °C-stepwise descending temperatures with 48 hr breaks. In general, the resistance to freezing was {{in agreement with the}} hypothesis, decreasing from trogloxenes over troglophiles to troglobionts. However, weak resistance was preserved in nearly all troglobionts, which responded in two ways. One group, withstanding freezing to a limited degree, and increasing freezing tolerance in winter, belong to the troglobionts inhabiting the superficial subterranean habitats. The other group, which equally withstand freezing in summer and winter, inhabit deep subterranean or other thermally buffered subterranean habitats. Data on cold resistance can thus serve as an efficient additional <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> to particular hypogean environments...|$|R
40|$|Explaining {{adaptive}} behavior {{is a central}} problem in artificial intelligence research. Here we formalize adaptive agents as mixture distributions over sequences of inputs and outputs (I/O). Each distribution of the mixture constitutes a `possible world', but the agent does not know which of the possible worlds it is actually facing. The problem is to adapt the I/O stream {{in a way that}} is compatible with the true world. A natural <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> can be obtained by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the I/O distribution of the true world and the I/O distribution expected by the agent that is uncertain about possible worlds. In the case of pure input streams, the Bayesian mixture provides a well-known solution for this problem. We show, however, that in the case of I/O streams this solution breaks down, because outputs are issued by the agent itself and require a different probabilistic syntax as provided by intervention calculus. Based on this calculus, we obtain a Bayesian control rule that allows modeling {{adaptive behavior}} with mixture distributions over I/O streams. This rule might allow for a novel approach to adaptive control based on a minimum KL-principle. Comment: AGI- 2010. 6 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
