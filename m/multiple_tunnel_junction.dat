40|$|Single {{electron}} transistors {{are fabricated on}} single Si nanochains, synthesised by {{thermal evaporation}} of SiO solid sources. The nanochains consist of one-dimensional arrays of ? 10 nm Si nanocrystals, separated by SiO 2 regions. At 300 K, strong Coulomb staircases are seen in the drain–source current–voltage (Ids–Vds) characteristics, and single-electron oscillations are seen in the drain–source current–gate voltage (Ids–Vgs) characteristics. From 300 – 20 K, a large increase in the Coulomb blockade region is observed. The characteristics are explained using single-electron Monte Carlo simulation, where an inhomogeneous <b>multiple</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction</b> represents a nanochain. Any reduction in capacitance at a nanocrystal well within the nanochain creates a conduction “bottleneck”, suppressing current at low voltage and improving the Coulomb staircase.

Electron microscopy imaging suggests clustering and sub-monolayer formation even after multiple deposition cycles. Voltammetric characterisation of the gold-PDDAC assemblies demonstrates at low coverage a facile electron transport {{perpendicular to the}} film but essentially insulating characteristics laterally across an inter-electrode gap of 40 μm. However, gentle removal of the organic assembly components (PDDAC) in a room temperature UV-ozonolysis process allows the array of “clean” gold–gold junctions to become electrically conducting due to (i) random <b>multiple</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction</b> pathways and (ii) ionic conductivity through a thin water layer. In this room temperature ozone-cleaned state, the gold assembly is considerably more electrically conducting when compared to thermally cleaned films. The crucial effect of humidity on the resistivity and capacitive currents for gold nanoparticle junction arrays is demonstrated. The gold nanoparticle films readily react with thiols and dithiols from the gas phase which results in {{a dramatic increase in}} resistivity. The process is fully reversible and the sensor re-usable after UV-ozonolysis cleaning. Measurements are reported for a range of dithiols with different carbon chain lengths demonstrating that tunnel junction effects are likely to be responsible for the electrical conductivity...|$|E

40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringIn this thesis, a novel batch {{fabrication}} {{technology for}} a mixed-scale PDMS (Polydimethylsilane) channel networks using carbon- micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) and single molding process is introduced. Nanofabrication {{has been used}} in broad research fields including single electron memories, <b>multiple</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction</b> (MTJ) devices, micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and nanofluidic devices. Nanofluidic channel networks are crucial parts in various applications such as DNA electrophoresis, bio sensors, molecular preconcentration, ionic transport nanofluidic diodes, desalination, nanofludic transistors because of their unique phenomena including ion concentration polarization, ion rectification effect, nanocapillarity and electrical double layer overlap. However, the research on the nanofluidics has been limited {{because of the lack of}} simple and cost-effective nanofabrication technologies. Microfabrication technologies that are compatible with nanofabrication processes also needs to be developed so as to integrate microfluidic channels with nanochannels, because the microchannels guide sample fluid into and out of the nanochannels and thus mixed-scale channel networks are the basic architecture of the nanofluidic devices. However, the fabrication of mixed-scale channel networks is limited by difficult alignment processes between nanostructures and microstructures, high fabrication cost, and time consuming and complex processes. These limitations can be overcame by utilizing carbon-MEMS technology and single polymer molding process. A mixed-scale carbon structure as the mold of a Poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) channel network was fabricated using conventional UV lithography and pyrolysis. A single molding process using multi-layers of hard PDMS and soft PDMS completes the fabrication of mixed-scale PDMS channel networks including 55 -nm-high and 441 -nm-wide nanochannels. The quality of the PDMS molding process was evaluated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an atomic force microscope (AFM). The surface energy of the pyrolyzed carbon mold could be modulated by controlling pyrolysis temperature resulting in high surface energy. As a result, a single carbon mold could replicate PDMS channel networks more than 40 times without anti-adhesion coating. The hermetic sealing and uniformity of the PDMS nanochannel were evaluated by filling the mixed-scale PDMS channel networks with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The properties of PDMS nanochannels were characterized by measuring I-V relationship in KCl solution. Except for the simple fabrication of the complex carbon mold, the pyrolysis process also enabled the formation of smoothly tapered mold side wall because of good adhesion between the photoresist and substrate, and volume reduction in pyrolysis. As a result, 3 -D funnels could be integrated at the entrance and exit of the nanochannel. By this novel 3 -D funnel structure, efficient entrapment of a single micro particle at the entrance of a nanochannel was enabled. It is expected that the mixed-scale PDMS channel networks with 3 D-funnels can be applied to nanoelectroporation for efficient cell transfectionope...|$|E
40|$|As {{the minimum}} feature sizes of current {{integrated}} circuits approach 10 nm, {{improvements in the}} speed, complexity and packing density are becoming increasingly difficult. In particular, at these scale, the operation of `classical' complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices is expected to degrade unacceptably. Single-electron devices, where the Coulomb blockade effect {{can be used to}} control charge at the one electron level, provide a means to fabricate large scale integration (LSI) circuits with ultra-low power consumption, immunity from charge fluctuations, and high scalability at sub- 10 nm dimensions. Single-electron devices are potentially a successor technology to conventional classical Si metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), and will play an increasingly important role both in future CMOS and `beyond CMOS' technologies. In this thesis, we first introduce the history of single-electron (SE) effects and the previous work in both theory and practical fabrication. Subsequently, the theoretical operation of the single-electron transistor (SET) is discussed, followed by a brief introduction to the quantum dot (QD) and the <b>multiple</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction</b> (MTJ) transistor. The fabrication process for SET devices in heavily doped, n-type silicon-on-insulator (SOI) material, using the electron-beam lithography (EBL), is then introduced. Two types of Si SET devices have been studied, the 1 μm nanowire (NW) SET and `point gate' SET, which are both defined by EBL followed by reactive-ion etching (RIE) to create trench isolation of the devices, source, drain and nanowire regions. A thermal oxidation approach, was then used to reduce the Si core to the sub- 10 nm scale in the NW. This passivates surface defects, creates charging 'islands' isolated by tunnel barriers and forms the SET. Variation in surface roughness, doping concentration and any disorder inherent at the nanoscale can form the tunnel barriers con ning the charging island. The SiNW SETs fabricated in this work have been electrically characterised at temperatures from 8 - 300 K. Results obtained from NWs with core widths from 5 nm to 40 nm with two di erent gate lengths of 1 μm to 50 nm have been compared. Here, detailed Ids vs. Vds, Vgs measurements have been performed at 8 K, and `Coulomb diamond' characteristics have been observed. The 1 μm long NWs behave as MTJs, with 40 nm scale islands. Here, the width of the Coulomb diamond cannot be reduced to zero. The detailed temperature dependence of the Ids vs. Vds characteristics show that some SE effects persist even at 300 K. The reduction in NW gate length to 50 nm reduces the likelihood of quantum dots to only three dots, but increases their influence on the electrical characteristics. In the point contact device, QD behaviour with a combination of SE charging and quantum confinement effects is observed at 8 K. In a highly scaled point circuit Coulomb blockade and a single-electron oscillation are observed. Monte Carlo simulations have been used to further investigate the devices and their island con gurations. The results of this thesis demonstrate explicitly the signicance of quantum effects for the electrical performance of nominally `classical' SiNW devices and highlight their potential for quantum effect `beyond CMOS' devices.

40|$|We have {{observed}} large tunneling Magnetoresistance (TMR) in amine functionalized octahedral nanoparticle assemblies. Amine monolayer {{on the surface}} of nanoparticles acts as an insulating barrier between the semimetal Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles and provides <b>multiple</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> where inter-granular tunneling is plausible. The tunneling magnetoresistance recorded at room temperature is 38 % which increases to 69 % at 180 K. When the temperature drops below 150 K, coulomb staircase is observed in the current versus voltage characteristics as the charging energy exceeds the thermal energy. A similar study is also carried out with spherical nanoparticles. A 24 % TMR is recorded at room temperature which increases to 41 % at 180 K for spherical particles. Mossbauer spectra reveal better stoichiometry for octahedral particles which is attainable due to lesser surface disorder and strong amine coupling at the facets of octahedral Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Less stoichiometric defect in octahedral nanoparticles leads to a higher value of spin polarization and therefore larger TMR in octahedral nanoparticles. (C) 2016 Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|A single-electron latch is {{a device}} {{that can be used}} as a {{building}} block for Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) circuits. It consists of three nanoscale metal "dots" connected in series by tunnel junctions; charging of the dots is controlled by three electrostatic gates. One very important feature of a single-electron latch is its ability to store ("latch") information represented by the location of a single electron within the three dots. To obtain latching, the undesired leakage of charge during the retention time must be suppressed. Previously, to achieve this goal, <b>multiple</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> were used to connect the three dots. However, this method of charge leakage suppression requires an additional compensation of the background charges affecting each parasitic dot in the array of junctions. We report a single-electron latch where a granular metal film is used to fabricate the middle dot in the latch which concurrently acts as a charge leakage suppressor. This latch has no parasitic dots, therefore the background charge compensation procedure is greatly simplified. We discuss the origins of charge leakage suppression and possible applications of granular metal dots for various single-electron circuits. Comment: 21 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{expressions}} for phonon escape {{times from}} a thin superconducting film. The escape time {{is determined by}} the rate of scattering conversion for phonons propagating beyond the critical cone for total internal reflection. The conversion is due to different scattering processes for the groups of Cooper pair breaking and sub-gap phonons. For pair breaking phonons the most efficient conversion mechanism is through the interaction with the condensate. For sub-gap phonons the conversion rate is much slower and for plane parallel films is due to elastic scattering at surface or interface roughness resulting in significantly slower escape times.

40|$|Niobium {{thin film}} {{nanostructures}} were fabricated using {{electron beam lithography}} and a liftoff process involving a four layer resist system. Wires having micrometres in length and below 200 nm in width were deposited on an insulating substrate and subsequently thinned by anodisation. The resistance of the wires was monitored in situ and could be trimmed by controlling the anodisation voltage and time. The method appears appropriate for the fabrication of very small resistors for use as biasing resistors for single electron devices. Transport properties of these resistors were measured at millikelvin temperatures. They had nonlinear current-voltage characteristics around zero bias and showed a transistion from superconducting to insulating behaviour. Analysis of the offset voltage showed that a Coulomb blockade set in when the sheet resistance of the films exceeded the superconducting quantum resistance approx 6. 45 kOhm. Samples in a single electron transistor-like geometry with two variable thickness weak links were made by combined angular evaporation of niobium and anodisation. Overlapping gate electrodes were deposited on these samples. The drain-source current-voltage characteristics could be modulated by the gate voltage, giving a response typical for a system of <b>multiple</b> ultrasmall <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions.</b> The thesis contains a five page appendix with lithography recipes.

40|$|We {{recently}} {{predicted the}} formation of a highly non-equilibrium quasiparticle (qp) distribution in low TC <b>multiple</b> <b>tunnelling</b> superconducting <b>tunnel</b> <b>junctions</b> (STJs) [1]. The situation arises through qp energy gain in cycles of successive forward and back tunnelling events in the absence of relaxation via sub-gap phonon emission. The qps can acquire sufficient energy to emit phonons, which break more Cooper pairs and release additional qps. In this paper we report theoretical and experimental studies of the effect of this process on photon detection by such an STJ. We derived a set of energy-dependent balance equations [2], which describe the kinetics of the qps and phonons, including the qp multiplication process described above. Solution of the balance equations gives the non-equilibrium distribution of the qps as a function of time and energy, and hence the responsivity of the STJ as a function of bias voltage. We compared the theoretical results with experiments on high quality, multiple-tunnelling Al STJs cooled to 35 mK in an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator, and illuminated with monochromatic photons with wavelengths between 250 and 1000 nm. It was found that in the larger junctions with the longest qp loss time, both responsivity and signal decay time increased rapidly with bias voltage. Excellent agreement was obtained between the observed effects and theoretical modelling. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

Further, it will be shown that a voltage signal arising from the magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction</b> can only be observed when the laser spot is directly centered on top of the magnetic <b>tunnel</b> <b>junction,</b> which allows a lateral separation of the effects...|$|R
