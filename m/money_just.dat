5|$|The mantles of the Muisca were {{decorated}} with various colours. The colours {{were obtained from}} seeds; the seed of the avocado for green, flowers; saffron for orange and indigo weed for blue, fruits, crust and roots of plants, from animals as the cochineal insect producing purple colours, and minerals as the blue and green clays of Siachoque, the coloured earth of Suta and the yellow sediments of Soracá. Also curuba, the flowers of the potato plant (Solanum andigenum) and other colouring materials (Rumex obtusifolia, Bixa orellana, Arrabidaea chica and more) were used. The colours were applied using pencils, applying coloured threads or using stamps. The textiles were produced using various techniques, similar to the Aymara of southern South America and the Mesoamerican cultures. Small textiles functioned as <b>money,</b> <b>just</b> like the tejuelos of gold or salt was used.|$|E
5|$|By then, MacLaren was in {{financial}} difficulties. As an amateur, his expenses {{were covered by}} the tour organisers but he received no money for playing. To support him financially, the Lancashire committee had given him £100 before the tour. By the latter stages of the tour, his money was running out; {{most of it was}} probably spent betting on horse races, and he sent Lancashire a request for further <b>money.</b> <b>Just</b> before the final Test, he received a £60 advance on his expenses for the upcoming English season. For the fifth Test, he dropped down from opening the batting, which he had done throughout the series, to batting at number five, and responded with his first Test century. Batting with greater caution than usual, he scored 120 before accidentally standing on his own wicket. England won the match to take the series 3–2, amid great public interest in England and Australia. MacLaren scored 240 runs at 26.67 in the Test series, finishing fourth in the English averages. He performed more effectively in the lesser matches, and following some final tour fixtures, he totalled 803 runs at 47.23 in all first-class games. On the six-week outward journey MacLaren met (Kathleen) Maud Power, an Australian socialite and the daughter of a horse racing official. They were married in 1898.|$|E

[...] Lyrically, Gaga asks her lover to display his teeth for her. According to MusicOMH, [...] "In the background another voice intones strange messages, which may or may not revolve around dentistry". Music Times said the [...] "skank-y" [...] horns in the track exhibit Riley's work. In an interview with MTV, Gaga explained the meaning behind the song and its lyrics: [...] "It is meant to mean two things, the first one kind of juvenile sexual provocative connotation is about oral sex, but also the monster in the song is fear of the truth. 'Show me your teeth' means 'tell me the truth' and I think that for a long time in my life that I replaced sex with the truth." ...|$|E

[...] It is obvious that Barks's creation is averse to dishonesty in the pursuit of wealth.

In 1872, Gordon was sent to inspect the British military cemeteries in the Crimea, and when passing through Constantinople he made the acquaintance of the Prime Minister of Egypt, Raghib Pasha.

2500|$|Interviews with {{strippers}} {{have revealed}} that the customers are generally viewed as [...] "suckers" [...] for giving the dancers <b>money</b> <b>just</b> for their physical attraction. Dancers, {{in an attempt to}} acquire a tip or monetary reward, may be selling more than just attractiveness and fantasy. [...] They portray feelings of intimacy and emotional connectedness for their customers {{and most of the time}} these portrayals are overstated or false. The stage persona is different from who they are backstage, even if it does mirror aspects of their true personality. Within the context of the strip club, dancers might sometimes give the impression that they are revealing private (or backstage) information to customers in order to play a confidence game for increased profit. Dancers use props such as make-up, clothing, costumes, and appealing fragrances to complete their character and maintain their [...] "front" [...] while in the club. Customers rarely, if ever, see the preparation of these props, since they are denied access to the backstage of a dancer's performance space by the layout of the club. A customer often wants a dancer to [...] "drop the act", which makes them feel special and desired. This girlfriend experience can involve increased intimacy up to and including sex acts. Dancers are commonly aware of this customer desire for increased confidence, and may allow the impression that a customer is seeing their true selves. In reality, it is often just part of the act with little to no emotional attachment for the dancer.|$|E
