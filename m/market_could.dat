5|$|Each boiler powered a turbo generator, made by Parsons, Newcastle upon Tyne. These were three-cylinder {{reaction}} type {{steam turbines}} operating at 3,000rpm, generating 60MW of electricity. The stations used {{them because of}} a Statutory Order of the Ministry of Supply in November 1947 that all turbo alternators made for the home <b>market</b> <b>could</b> only be of 60MW at advanced steam conditions. Stella South had a total generating capacity of 300MW and Stella North originally 240MW (later recorded as only 224MW). The stations {{were the first to}} use silica removal beds in their turbines, a development which became standard within the CEGB's power stations for some time. In 1967, one of the sets at Stella South became the world's first in commercial operation to use brushless excitation. The set was modified by Parsons to use A.C. exciters and silicon diode rectifiers. The stations' switchgear was manufactured by A. Reyrolle & Company.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{education}} level of Rettungsassistent {{could be obtained}} by own expenses, the working market was very employer friendly. With the new Notfallsanitäter system, the number of paramedics in the system is restricted to {{a smaller number of}} paid and employed apprentices finishing their education.

The downward impact on prices of A.B.C. moving into a <b>market</b> <b>could</b> be felt almost immediately. For example, in 1866 Australia, A.B.C.'s lower prices forced other bakers to reduce theirs in turn, by between 8 and 17 percent.|$|E
25|$|In new Roman towns {{the forum}} was usually located at, or just off, the {{intersection}} of the main north-south and east-west streets (the cardo and decumanus). All forums would have a Temple of Jupiter at the north end, and would also contain other temples, as well as the basilica; a public weights and measures table, so customers at the <b>market</b> <b>could</b> ensure they were not being sold short measures; and would often have the baths nearby.|$|E

Proponents of a legal market for organs say that the black-market nature of the current trade allows such tragedies and that regulation of the <b>market</b> <b>could</b> prevent them. Opponents say that such a market would encourage criminals by making it easier for them to claim that their stolen organs were legal.|$|E
25|$|When Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, and Wieser {{began their}} careers in science, {{they were not}} focused on {{economic}} policy issues, much less in the rejection of intervention promoted by classical liberalism. Their common vocation was to develop an economic theory on a firm basis. To do this, following the course initiated by Carl Menger, Wieser, along with his friend and brother-in-law Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, disapproved of the policies of interventionism that the Austrian government, as all governments of the time, had adopted, arguing that only the free <b>market</b> <b>could</b> allow more efficient economic and social development.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, a new company, Hoffmann Flugzeugbau, {{was founded}} by {{aircraft}} designer Wolf Hoffmann in Friesach, Carinthia, Austria; it was formed with the ambition of becoming a major aircraft manufacturer for general aviation purposes. According to Michael Feinig, a future {{managing director of the}} company, the firm's leadership had recognised that there was a market for a range of modern light aircraft, and that the general aviation sector had been then dominated by mostly old designs from established manufacturers. By taking advantage of innovations in avionics and manufacturing technologies, the <b>market</b> <b>could</b> be disrupted by a capable competitor.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{the only}} kind of <b>market</b> that <b>could</b> exist in an economy {{operating}} through the use of labour vouchers would be an artificial market (arket) for mostly non-productive goods and services; as with the dissolution of money, capital <b>markets</b> <b>could</b> no longer exist and labour markets would also likely cease to exist with the abolition of wage labor which would by necessity occur with the adoption of vouchers.|$|R

25|$|Once Alberta's Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board began {{operating}} in 1938, the BA and Gas and Oil Products Limited plants {{had to change}} their operations significantly. Only Royalite had a market for its residue of gas stripped of liquids in the Canadian Western Natural Gas distribution system. The other two plants flared or burned off most of their residue gas until the board ruled that only wells connected to a <b>market</b> <b>could</b> be produced, stopping the practice. Since the rule applied only to wells that tapped the oil reservoir's overlying gas cap, the Hartell and Longview plants stayed in operation by processing solution gas, or gas dissolved in oil from the Valley's wells.|$|E
25|$|However, closing {{times were}} {{increasingly}} disregarded {{in the country}} pubs. In England and Wales by 2000 pubs could legally open from 11am (12 noon on Sundays) through to 11pm (10:30pm on Sundays). That year {{was also the first}} to allow continuous opening for 36 hours from 11am on New Year's Eve to 11pm on New Year's Day. In addition, many cities had by-laws to allow some pubs to extend opening hours to midnight or 1am, whilst nightclubs had long been granted late licences to serve alcohol into the morning. Pubs near London's Smithfield market, Billingsgate fish market and Covent Garden fruit and flower <b>market</b> <b>could</b> stay open 24 hours a day since Victorian times to provide a service to the shift working employees of the markets.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} trade of whale meat is prohibited by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). However, Japan, Norway and Iceland registered reservations with the treaty {{in order to}} remain exempt. The Norwegian company, Myklebust Trading, exports common minke whale and Iceland's Hvalur hf exports Fin whale, which is an endangered species. Environmental organizations criticized the trade and expressed doubts that Japanese markets could absorb the increase in supply as thousands of tonnes of whale meat remained in cold storage in Japan. In 2010, Iceland's proposed quota in killing fin whales was much larger than the amount of whale meat the Japanese <b>market</b> <b>could</b> absorb. In negotiations with Marc Wall, Economic Minister-Counselor at the US embassy in Tokyo, Jun Yamashita of the Japanese Fisheries Agencies, however, rejected a 2010 proposal to suggest to Iceland {{to reduce the number of}} killed fin whales to a more reasonable number.|$|E
25|$|In September 1920, the Seattle City Council quietly {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} that farmer's stalls at the <b>Market</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer be}} placed in the street, in response to complaints from some local businesses about traffic flow. A public outcry immediately followed from the farmers, merchants, and various citizen's groups. In the midst of the turmoil, the Westlake Market Company pushed itself into the situation, proposing that they would build a two-floor underground market at a building they owned on Fifth Avenue, four blocks from the existing Pike Place Market. The Goodwins, in response, proposed another counter-plan to leverage insurance bonds to finance another further expansion of the Market. As the city government began to quickly lean towards the Westlake proposal, the farmers began to formally organize {{together for the first time}} to protect their interests. The deciding Seattle City Council vote in April 1921 was in favor of retaining the existing Market location, and the Goodwins immediately began work on their next expansions.|$|E
25|$|In March 1968, {{the effort}} to control the private market price of gold was abandoned. A two-tier system began. In this system all central-bank {{transactions}} in gold were insulated from the free market price. Central banks would trade gold among themselves at $35 per troy ounce (112.53 ¢/g) but would not trade with the private market. The private <b>market</b> <b>could</b> trade at the equilibrium market price {{and there would be}} no official intervention. The price immediately jumped to $43 per troy ounce (138.25 ¢/g). The price of gold touched briefly back at $35 (112.53 ¢/g) near the end of 1969 before beginning a steady price increase. This gold price increase turned steep through 1972 and hit a high that year of over $70 (2.25 $/g). By that time floating exchange rates had also begun to emerge, which indicated the de facto dissolution of the Bretton Woods system. The two-tier system was abandoned in November 1973. By then the price of gold had reached $100 per troy ounce (3.22 $/g).|$|E

500|$|Secretary Boutwell {{was already}} {{keeping track of}} the {{situation}} and knew that the profits made in the manipulated rising gold <b>market</b> <b>could</b> ruin the nation's economy for several years. By September 21 the price of gold had jumped from $37 to $141, and Gould and Fisk jointly owned $50 million to $60 million in gold. Boutwell and Grant finally met on Thursday, September 23, and agreed to release gold from the treasury if the gold price kept rising. Grant wanted $5,000,000 in gold to be released while Boutwell wanted $3,000,000 released. [...] Then, on (Black) Friday, September 23, 1869, when the price of gold had soared to $160 an ounce, Boutwell released $4 million in gold specie into the market and bought $4,000,000 in bonds. Boutwell had also ordered that the Tenth National Bank be closed on the same day. The gold market crashed and Gould and Fisk were foiled, while many investors were financially ruined.|$|E
