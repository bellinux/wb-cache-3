40|$|Background: <b>Membranous</b> proliferative <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (MPGN) {{is a major}} {{primary cause}} of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Podocyte injury is crucial in the {{pathogenesis}} of glomerular disease with proteinuria, leading to CKD. To assess podocyte injuries in MPGN, the pathological features of spontaneous murine models were analyzed. Methods: The autoimmune-prone mice strains BXSB/MpJ-Yaa and B 6. MRL-(D 1 Mit 202 -D 1 Mit 403) were used as the MPGN models, and BXSB/MpJ-Yaa(+) and C 57 BL/ 6 were used as the respective controls. In addition to clinical parameters and glomerular histopathology, the protein and mRNA levels of podocyte functional markers were evaluated as indices for podocyte injuries. The relation between MPGN pathology and podocyte injuries was analyzed by statistical correlation. Results: Both models developed MPGN with albuminuria and elevated serum anti-double-strand DNA (dsDNA) antibody levels. BXSB/MpJ-Yaa and B 6. MRL showed severe proliferative lesions with T and B cell infiltrations and membranous lesions with T cell infiltrations, respectively. Foot process effacement and microvillus-like structure formation were observed ultrastructurally in the podocytes of both MPGN models. Furthermore, both MPGN models showed a decrease in immune-positive areas of nephrin, podocin and synaptopodin in the glomerulus, and in the mRNA expression of Nphs 1, Nphs 2, Synpo, Actn 4, Cd 2 ap, and Podxl in the isolated glomerulus. Significant negative correlations were detected between serum anti-dsDNA antibody levels and glomerular Nphs 1 expression, and between urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and glomerular expression of Nphs 1, Synpo, Actn 4, Cd 2 ap, or Podxl.

40|$|Patterns of nephrin {{and a new}} proteinuria-associated protein {{expression}} in human renal diseases. BackgroundMany factors contribute to the pathogenesis of glomerular proteinuria, but no exact molecular mechanisms are known to date.

MethodsImmunohistochemistry was used to detect possible changes in glomerular nephrin, and a new proteinuria-associated protein expression was developed in various diagnostic groups of human kidney biopsies. ResultsIn normal control kidney, antibodies to intracellular and extracellular nephrin domain showed a typical podocyte pattern of reactivity, while the 18 C 7 antibody to a normally inaccessible proteinuria-associated epitope was negative.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to report the outcome of pure {{membranous}} lupus nephropathy treated with prednisone and azathioprine (AZA). Methods: Consecutive patients with pure <b>membranous</b> lupus <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (World Health Organization [WHO] Va and Vb) from 4 regional hospitals were recruited for an open-label treatment trial consisting of prednisone and AZA. Remission status was evaluated at 12 months. Maintenance treatment with low-dose prednisone and AZA was continued indefinitely for those who achieved remission. Factors predictive of initial renal remission and subsequent relapse were studied by statistical analyses. Results: Thirty-eight patients (31 women and 7 men) were studied. The mean age was 35. 0 ± 9. 2 years, and the duration of systemic lupus erythematosus was 48. 5 ± 59 months. Seventeen (45 %) patients had WHO class Va lupus nephritis, whereas 21 (55 %) had class Vb disease. Two patients withdrew from the protocol because of idiosyncratic reactions to AZA. At 12 months, 24 (67 %) patients achieved complete remission (CR), 8 (22 %) achieved partial remission (PR), and 4 (11 %) were treatment resistant. Patients who achieved CR or PR were maintained on low-dose prednisone and AZA. Over a mean follow-up period of 90. 4 ± 59 months, 6 (19 %) patients had relapse of nephritis (proteinuric flare in 4 and nephritic flare in 2). The cumulative risk of renal relapse was 12 % at 36 months and 16 % at 60 months. No particular clinical variables were found to predict renal remission or relapses. Over a mean follow-up of 90 months, 13 % of patients had decline of creatinine clearance by 20 %, but none had doubling of serum creatinine. Renal outcome was not significantly worse in patients presenting with nephrotic syndrome. Treatment generally was well tolerated. Conclusion: A combination of prednisone and AZA is reasonably effective for the initial treatment of pure membranous lupus nephritis. Severe adverse effects are uncommon. The additional efficacy of AZA in comparison with prednisone alone has to be confirmed with randomized, controlled trials. © 2004 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} long-term outcomes of pediatric live kidney transplantation in patients with genitourinary anomalies relative to those with primary kidney diseases. The study included 35 pediatric patients who received a live kidney transplantation during the last 25 yr (28 males, six females). Median age at the time of transplantation was nine yr (range 1 – 15 yr), and the median follow-up period was 151 months (range 6 – 239 month). The patients were divided into two groups. The urological group (n = 14) included patients with primary obstructive/reflux nephropathy. The renal group (n = 20) included patients with primary renal disorders. Differences between groups in graft survival, clinical course, and final graft function were evaluated. Original diseases represented in the urological group included five cases with primary VUR and eight cases with secondary VUR. Diseases in the renal group included eight cases with bilateral hypo-dysplastic kidney, three cases with focal/segmental glomerular sclerosis, two cases with <b>membranous</b> proliferative <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> two cases with congenital nephrotic syndrome and five cases with other forms of chronic nephritis. Ten of 14 cases in the urological group, relative to six of 20 in the renal group, were preemptive. Median age at transplantation was 7. 5 or 10 yr old, respectively, in the urological or renal group. Twelve kidney recipients in the urological group had also undergone other urinary surgeries, including upper urinary tract drainage, ureteroneocystostomy, augmentation cystoplasty, endoscopic incision of posterior-urethral valve, urethroplasty, etc. Cumulative post-operative complications occurred in nine or 16, respectively, in the urological or renal group. The acute rejection free and overall graft survival were similar in both groups. One patient in the urological group lost his graft while six patients in the renal group lost their grafts.

Patients and methods: Eighteen adult nephrotic patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min were recruited. Histological pictures included ten of membranous nephropathy, three of <b>membranous</b> proliferative <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> three of minimal change, and two of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. All patients received the synthetic ACTH analog tetracosactide 1 mg intramuscularly {{once a week for}} 12 months. Estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, serum lipids, albumin, glucose, and potassium were determined before and during the treatment. Results: One of the 18 patients discontinued the treatment after 1 month because of severe fluid retention, and two patients were lost at follow-up. Complete remission occurred in six cases, while partial remission occurred in four cases (55. 5 % responder rate). With respect to baseline, after 12 months proteinuria had decreased from 7. 24 ± 0. 92 to 2. 03 ± 0. 65 g/day (P< 0. 0001), and serum albumin had increased from 2. 89 ± 0. 14 to 3. 66 ± 0. 18 g/dL (P< 0. 0001). Total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol had decreased from 255 ± 17 to 193 ± 10 mg/dL (P= 0. 01), and from 168 ± 18 to 114 ± 7 mg/dL (P= 0. 03), respectively. No cases of severe worsening of renal function, hyperglycemia, or hypokalemia were observed, and no admissions for cardiovascular or infectious events were recorded. Conclusion: Tetracosactide administration at the dosage of 1 mg intramuscularly per week for 12 months seems to be an acceptable alternative for nephrotic patients unresponsive or relapsing after steroid-immunosuppressive regimens.
