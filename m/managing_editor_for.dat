25|$|To {{those who}} worked with him at Bazaar, the {{pinnacle}} of Brodovitch's career as a designer was the unfailing elegance of his pages. This elegance, combined with an element of innovation was the ideal mix for a fashion magazine. The quality that guaranteed his success was his devotion to the new, unending surprise and vitality. Frances MacFadden, Bazaars <b>managing</b> <b>editor</b> <b>for</b> much of Brodovitch's tenure, explained his working method:It was a pleasure to watch him work. He was so swift and sure. In emergencies, like the time the Clipper bearing the report of the Paris Collections was held up in Bermuda, his speed was dazzling. A quick splash or two on the cutting board, a minute's juggling of the photostats, a slather of art gum, and the sixteen pages were complete. His layouts, of course, were the despair of copywriters whose cherished tone poems on girdles or minks had to be sacrificed to his sacred white space. Just before we went to press, all the layouts were laid out in sequence on Carmel Snow's floor, and there, under his eye, re-arranged until the rhythm of the magazine suited him.|$|E

Kevin Naff, a <b>managing</b> <b>editor</b> <b>for</b> Washington, D.C./Baltimore area gay newspaper the Washington Blade called for a boycott of the new Hairspray film, alleging that Scientology, in which Travolta believes, was patently homophobic, and allegedly supported workshops designed to [...] "cure" [...] homosexuals. Adam Shankman protested Naff's proposed boycott, stating that Travolta was not homophobic, as he (Shankman), Waters, Shaiman, Wittman, and several {{other members of the}} creative staff were homosexual, and Travolta got along well with the entire crew. [...] "John's personal beliefs did not walk onto my set," [...] said Shankman. [...] "I never heard the word 'Scientology.'" ...|$|E

He underwent post-graduate study in various fields from 1922 until 1927 while serving as an intern and resident at Toronto General Hospital under Duncan Archibald Graham.|$|E
500|$|Frank {{was criticized}} by {{conservative}} organizations for campaign contributions totaling $42,350 between 1989 and 2008.

In 2006, a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they [...] "did not participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005." [...] In response to criticism, Frank said, [...] "In 2004, it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages, because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low-income people. And I said at the time, 'Hey—(a) this is going to jeopardize their profitability, but (b) it's going to put people in homes they can't afford, and they're gonna lose them.'" ...|$|E

[...] He altered {{the look and feel of}} the magazine, changing its focus from a lifestyle magazine that focused on leisure sports, to one that covered the major American team sports, at a time when television vastly altered the way in which such sports were covered. [...] As such, he kept Sports Illustrated at the head of the growth of interest in these sports. [...] He also placed a heavy emphasis on the use of color photography and late deadline, to keep the magazine up to date and visually appealing. [...] He hired and encouraged writers who were masters at prose, emphasizing writing over sportswriting, and the crop of writers he brought to the magazine, including Frank Deford, Dan Jenkins, Budd Schulberg, and Gil Rogin, helped change the way people wrote about sports.|$|E
