The local {{fishermen}} use the frontal dunes in order to spot the shoals out at sea. This study evaluates characteristics of areas of the frontal dunes and the modifications occurring in sections used and unused by the “observers” at Pântano do Sul beach. The locations for sighting, named “Cabrito” and “Areias”, and two control areas were monitored. In each area, at the frontal dune, six permanent transects were determined {{for the evaluation of}} vegetation and the presence of trails and waste, before and after the <b>mullet</b> <b>fishing.</b> The areas showed a vegetation cover of around 80 % and 69 species of vascular plants, one of which was exotic. From the 15 observations of fishing, in 14 the fishermen used only the Areias site, which is more elevated than Cabrito and offers a better visualization of the shoals. The Cabrito site was not used for visualization in the year in question (2005), and only the trail near this site was used as an access to the beach by the local residents. At the Cabrito site, the human alterations observed included an increase in the trail area (1. 7 %) and in the waste deposition (3. 7 % - mainly of domestic materials). At the Areias site, effectively used in the <b>mullet</b> <b>fishing,</b> the environmental impacts due to increase in the trails (0. 7 %) and waste deposition (0. 2 %) were lower when compared to the Cabrito site, at least in the year of observation...|$|R

5000|$|The {{ingredients}} for bokkoms consists of small (juvenile) <b>mullet</b> (<b>fish),</b> coarse salt and fresh water. The original West Coast way of preparing bokkoms starts with catching the small (juvenile) mullets (called [...] "harders" [...] in Afrikaans). A large square tank {{built out of}} bricks or stone is filled with a strong pickle made of around 50 kg of coarse salt and fresh water, to which the fish is added. As soon as enough fish is added {{to reach the top}} of the tank, two or three spades full of dry coarse salt is spread on top of the fish. Thereafter more layers of fish and salt is put on top until all the fish is covered in salt. A thick layer of salt is added to the top. This is left for one day. On the second day, a press made with wood with weights on top, is placed on the fish in the tank. The purpose of the press is to ensure that the guts of the fish is pressed flat so that it does not go bad. After the third day in the tank, the fish is taken out and is then stringed up in bunches of 10 to 25 fish each on a rope, making use of a fish needle which is pushed {{through the eyes of the}} fish.

40|$|Aim. For {{the purpose}} of the {{assessment}} of golden mullet reproduction scientists have studied golden <b>mullet</b> <b>fish</b> distribution in the Western part of the Caspian Sea and determined biological indexes of spawners and the state of gonads before spawning. Methods. Collection and processing of ichtyological data was carried out according with the “Guide on materials collection and pre-processing of water biological bio-resources of the Caspian basin and their habitat”. Histological preparations of ovaries at the VI-th mature stage were fixed in Buena’s mixture; microscopic sections of gonads were colored by sour rosein with the Mallory’s method. Results. The researches have shown, that during the period 2009 - 2013 the golden <b>mullet</b> <b>fish</b> migration to the Russian part of the Caspian Sea was started in spring. In 2012 - 2013 spawners with higher biological indexes than in preceding year were the basis of sexually mature of the population. The terms of the golden <b>mullet</b> <b>fish</b> reproduction were different every year. The results of the histhological researcher noted to the partial resorption of oocytes in ovaries of females. Main conclusions. The golden mullet females aged 4 - 10 years (with the central group aged 6 - 8 years) with high linearweighting characteristics and fatness participated in spawning in 2012 - 2013. Pronounced changes of the oogenesis were observed in 2012. In 2013 the mass reproduction of the golden mullet was started earlier, but frequency of occurrence of the females with the caviar resorption was decreased.

40|$|Anisakiasis is a {{parasitic}} infection caused by larval stages of nematodes {{of the genus}} Anisakis, Pseudoterranova and Contracaecum, of the Anisakidae family. The lifecycle of these nematodes develops in aquatic organisms and their final hosts are marine mammals. However, humans can act as accidental hosts and become infected with infective stage larvae (L 3) by consuming raw or undercooked fish or shellfish carrying the parasite. Of this group of parasites, the genus Anisakis is the most studied: its presence in humans is associated with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms or allergic responses that can trigger anaphylactic shock. The lack of studies in anisakiasis and Anisakis in Colombia has resulted in this infection being little-known by medical practitioners and therefore potentially underreported. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify anisakid nematodes in the flathead grey <b>mullet</b> <b>fish</b> (Mugil cephalus), caught by artisanal fishing methods and commercialized in Buenaventura. Morphological identification was carried out by classical taxonomy complemented by microscopy study using the histochemical technique Hematoxylin-Eosin. Nematodes of the genus Anisakis were found in the host M.  cephalus. The Prevalence of Anisakis larvae in flathead grey <b>mullet</b> <b>fish</b> was 33 %.

Multi-factor Probit analysis toxicity tests (96 h) on L. klunzingeri showed the lowest observed effective concentration (LOEC) and median lethal concentration (LC 50) with NaOCl (0. 019 and 0. 027 µg L&# 713; 1) followed by HCHO (0. 058 and 0. 157 µg L&# 713; 1) and C 5 H 8 O 2 (0. 056 and 0. 072 µg L&# 713; 1). Site-wise analysis {{in the absence of}} feed showed high biocides toxicity in L. klunzingeri reared in seawater from Site I when compared to Sites II-III. Experiments were conducted (2 - 9 months) by rearing fish separately in seawater collected from three Kuwait Bay sites to test the bio-accumulated toxicity levels at LOEC of biocides fed fish using Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) calculation. The lowest FCR was observed in fish fed with biocides in the sequence of NaOCl (0. 40 - 1. 1) followed by C 5 H 8 O 2 (0. 91 - 1. 2) and HCHO (0. 92 - 1. 3) as well as with fish reared in seawater from Site I followed by Site II and Site III.

Disease investigation was carried out employing various diagnostic procedures such as virology, bacteriology, parasitology, haematology, histopathology, IFAT, IHC and nested RT-PCR. Brain and eye samples of affected fishes were collected in sterile conditions and then kept at - 80 °C for cell culture isolation and nested RT-PCR detection of the causative agent. Other tissue samples were also collected and fixed for histopathology, IHC and EM examinations. CPE was observed in cell cultures at 6 days after inoculation. Nine samples were found positive with virological assay. Nested RT-PCR, performed on suspected tissues and CPE positive samples, showed that about 21 tissue samples and all the CPE positive samples were positive for VNN virus (VNNV). IFAT was selected as a confirmatory method for detecting the presence of Betanodavirus antigen, cell culture isolation results and nested RT-PCR findings. Moreover, VNNV particles with 25 - 30 nm in diameter were also visualized in the infected brain and retina. In pathogenicity studies, guppy fishes bathed in VNNV-infected tissue culture (10 - 4 TCID 50) showed clinical signs similar to naturally infected mullet after 15 days post infection (dpi), with mortality rates reaching up to 100 % at 30 dpi.
