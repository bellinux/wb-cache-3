This piece is {{significant}} {{because it is the}} only known piece by this particular carver. Its stylistic links to other altarpieces in the Algarve suggests his participation in a Western Algarve “school”.|$|E

I don't think it is the role of the BBC to spend my money on a moral purpose." ...|$|E
500|$|As an actress, {{she entered}} Broadway {{as a star}} on sheer talent and little training... she sang abroad for two summers, fully expecting that the next step would be the Metropolitan Opera. In {{politics}} after five months {{of working with the}} [...] Women's Division, it seemed only natural that she head the state's organization and serve as Democratic National Committeewoman. Restless after three years in those positions, she saw the possibility of becoming a member of Congress as a logical next step. Only four years later, she felt ready to run for the Senate. But her lack of political experience and her inflexible stands on political issues, along with gender questions, eroded the support of the Democratic Party in 1950. What in fact may have hurt her the <b>most</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for which she is most remembered—her idealism.|$|E

500|$|The episode flashbacks to the {{previous}} developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the love triangle between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is she going to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her <b>most</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E
500|$|Connor’s {{characterization}} {{and main}} storyline {{with his father}} in season three and four received mixed reviews. Ben from thescifichristian.com was not fond of the initial episodes with baby Connor because Angel wasted time “baby-talking,” but he loved the development with teenage Connor, “The [...] season ends with a great storyline as Connor returns [...] and betrays Angel.” Jes Battis praised the father/son dynamics and described as “highly dramatic and (engagingly perverse)”. Journalist Sarah D. Bunting called Connor [...] "a frustrating character" [...] and wrote that while she [...] "gets where he is coming from" [...] and his ”twitchy, PTSD-ish interactions ring true", they become old too quick {{due to lack of}} real development of character and the relationship with Angel for most of season four. Kartheiser himself expressed this development concern, but he said that [...] "Towards {{the end of the season}} I was really happy about the chances I was getting." [...] This last statement is echoed in Jamie Pool's review, who called the “ending” to Connor [...] "emotionally satisfying", despite noting him to not have been particularly endearing through most of the remaining season. S.Wiebe of eclipsemagazine.com, described Connor’s overall characterization [...] "sharp" [...] with [...] "really intriguing sub-textual material" [...] and among the saving graces of the season. Strega of Television Without Pity, also praised the character's psychology, [...] "The thing I like <b>most</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they've not only created a teenager who doesn't just feel like he's the most alienated person in the world -- he actually is," [...] and [...] "I love how unloved Connor [...] is…” Jean Lorrah described the Darla-Angel-Connor-Jasmine arc as [...] "surely one of the most ambitious story arcs any television show has ever attempted“ Stacey Abbott of PopMatters called the Darla-Angel-Connor storyline [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "pure family melodrama".

2500|$|One of Romário's best {{performances}} was {{scoring a}} hat-trick in the memorable 5–0 win over Real Madrid in the El Clásico at the Camp Nou, with the spectacular opening goal seeing him drag the ball around the defender without it leaving his foot before finishing with a trademark toe-poke {{into the corner}} of the net. His highlight for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League came in the two games against Manchester United where he nutmegged Peter Schmeichel to score at Old Trafford, and scored again in the 4–0 win at the Camp Nou in front of 114,000 fans. Reflecting on the game at the Camp Nou, Manchester United captain Steve Bruce, who played in defence that night, states: “Of all the great things that happened during my career, the thing that sticks out the <b>most</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> night because we got our backsides kicked big-style. Stoichkov and Romário are still etched in my memory, especially Romário, who was arguably the best player I ever faced." ...|$|E
2500|$|De la Hoya next {{challenged}} Felix Sturm (20–0) for the WBO middleweight title on June 5, 2004, {{with the}} winner also getting {{a shot at}} the undisputed world middleweight champ Bernard Hopkins. De La Hoya was awarded a unanimous decision, becoming the first boxer in history to win world titles in six different weight divisions. All three judges scored the bout 115–113 in favor of De La Hoya. The decision was very controversial, far more so than his decision wins over Pernell Whitaker or Ike Quartey: Whereas the Whitaker & Quartey fights were considered close bouts that could've gone either way or called a draw, the feeling from <b>most</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> De La Hoya flat-out lost to Sturm. Compubox counted Sturm as landing 234 of 541 punches, while counting De La Hoya as landing 188 of 792. There had been some rumblings throughout the boxing community that {{the decision was made to}} insure that De La Hoya would fight Hopkins in a mega-dollar fight that would've drawn more money than a Hopkins-Sturm matchup would. Iain Darke of Sky Sports said the decision looked [...] "tailor made" [...] to set up De La Hoya versus Hopkins. [...] "(De La Hoya) got the benefit of high charity," [...] Darke said. Sturm & his promotional team, Universum Box-Promotion, filed a protest with the Nevada State Athletic Commission over the decision, but it was to no avail, and the decision still stands today.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Chad's introduction would cause {{trouble for the}} romantic pairing of Will Horton (Dylan Patton) and Mia McCormick (Taylor Spreitler). According to the actor, Chad is extremely sincere about getting custody of the baby from Nicole {{which is why he}} turns down her sexual advances. He refuses to let Mia [...] "whose been lying to him this whole time get in his way." [...] However, Deidrick commented that when Chad turns down Nicole, he is not [...] "acting [...] age." [...] Though he suspects Mia and Nicole are hiding something, Deidrick explained that Chad is completely blindsided when he finds the specifics. Of Chad's reaction to the baby reveal Deidrick said, [...] "There's nothing that can really prepare you for something like that." [...] However, what hurts the <b>most</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Chad has spent so much time trying to win Mia back, and his love for her is actually [...] "sincere." [...] According to Deidrick, it is a [...] "slap in the face," [...] to learn that Mia has been lying about such a huge part of their lives. For Chad, the revelation allows him to see Mia's true colors. Deidrick stated that [...] "here's always going to be tension" [...] between Chad and Mia but Deidrick maintained that despite her lies, Chad feels sorry what Mia has gone through and tries to stay by her side. [...] "It's a very hard situation." [...] Of his character during the storyline, Deidrick described Chad as a [...] "kid who doesn't know what to do and he's a fighting all these feelings." [...] Deidrick previewed that the reveal about the baby switch would put everything [...] "into place." [...] The actor admitted that the baby storyline kept him very isolated due to the significant age differences between himself {{and the rest of his}} teenage costars. When asked about a future love interest, Deidrick mentioned Gabriela Rodriguez who had recently been introduced to the canvas as Gabi Hernandez (Gabriela Rodriguez) but didn't believe a romantic pairing would work due to the age difference.|$|E
