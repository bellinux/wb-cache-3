Developing the city's strength in the medical and health sciences fields has seen some success, resulting in the expansion of the University District with two medical school branches.

Meanwhile, the community station C31 received no government assistance or funding to make the transition; this still remains a source of controversy.|$|E

The Godfrey show was the last daily longform entertainment program on American network radio when Godfrey and CBS agreed to end it in April 1972, when his 20-year contract with the network expired. Godfrey by then was a colonel in the United States Air Force Reserve and still an active pilot.|$|E
25|$|The league moved {{fully to}} {{overhand}} pitching in 1948, {{which made the}} game close to regulation baseball. Such change adversely affected the performance of underhand pitchers, because {{many of them were}} experienced submariners who could not <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> the new pitching style. Consequently, many teams converted their outfielders to pitchers since they were used to throwing the ball overhand with power. Batters, too, had to make adjustments, since underhand pitches tend to rise, overhand to drop. In that season also were incorporated the Chicago Colleens and the Springfield Sallies, and the AAGPBL expanded to a historical peak of ten teams divided into Eastern and Western Divisions.|$|E

40|$|In the *Science of Logic*, Hegel states {{unequivocally}} {{that the}} category of “life” is a strictly logical, or pure, form of thinking. His treatment of actual life – i. e., that which empirically constitutes nature – arises first in his *Philosophy of Nature* when the logic is applied under the conditions of space and time. Nevertheless, many commentators find Hegel’s development of this category as a purely logical one especially difficult to accept. Indeed, they find this development only comprehensible {{as long as one}} simultaneously assumes that Hegel breaks his promise to let the logic do the leading. However, if Hegel were to in fact allow the logical development to be led by biological analogies at this point, problems would ensue. Not only would it contradict his own speculative method, which should secure the necessity of the categories, but it would also endanger the ontological generality of {{the category of}} life itself. Beyond undermining his method and the logical integrity of the category, however, I will argue that such a reading <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next category of “cognition” unintelligible and problematic. My aim {{in the first part of}} this paper is to argue how logical life can be read as a pure category. I then argue in the second part how my reconstruction <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> cognition intelligible without resorting to profane or supernatural interpretations...|$|R
30|$|Electric power {{security}} is a prominent component of energy security. The electric power industry accounts for 68 %, 30 %, and 7 % respectively of total coal, natural gas, and oil consumption, together making 33 % of global fossil fuel consumption. After conversion and transmission losses, this provides more than 17 % of end-use energy consumption [34], yet the electric power industry is responsible for around 40 % of global CO 2 emissions and is the biggest single source of emissions. This <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> a low-carbon power system critical to enhancing the clean utilization of energy.|$|R

Specifically, rate control of a manipulator <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> force-force control when a force-reflecting hand controller is used with a local force accommodation algorithm running on the remote manipulator. <b>The</b> <b>transition</b> from rate <b>to</b> force occurs when contact is made with the environment...|$|R
25|$|The resounding {{victory of}} Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy in 2015 general {{elections}} has raised {{hope for a}} successful transition of Myanmar from a closely held military rule to a free democratic system.

The recent murder of Ko Ni, a prominent Muslim lawyer and a key member of Myanmar’s governing National League for Democracy party {{is seen as a}} serious blow to the country’s fragile democracy.

25|$|The Revolution of 1946 was a novel {{development}} in Haiti's history, as the Garde assumed power as an institution, {{not as the}} instrument of a particular commander. The members of the junta, known as the Military Executive Committee (Comité Exécutif Militaire), were Garde commander Colonel Franck Lavaud, Major Antoine Levelt, and Major Paul E. Magloire, commander of the Presidential Guard.

50|$|Any perfect {{conductor}} will prevent any change to magnetic flux passing through its surface due to ordinary electromagnetic induction at zero resistance.
