5|$|<b>Multiculturalism</b> in Canada {{was adopted}} as the {{official}} policy of the government during the premiership of Pierre Trudeau in the 1970s and 1980s. The Canadian government has often {{been described as the}} instigator of multicultural ideology, because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration. <b>Multiculturalism</b> is administered by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and reflected in the law through the Canadian <b>Multiculturalism</b> Act and section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge was {{designated}} a Cultural Capital of Canada for the 2004–2005 season. The Southern Alberta Ethnic Association (Multicultural Heritage Centre) promotes <b>multiculturalism</b> and ethnic heritage in the community.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{approach}} to governance emphasizing <b>multiculturalism,</b> {{which is based}} on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country's health care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Canada's post-war {{economic}} growth, {{combined with}} the policies of successive Liberal governments, {{led to the emergence}} of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of official <b>multiculturalism</b> in 1971. Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans, though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Dosanjh ran as the British Columbia New Democratic Party {{candidate}} in the Vancouver South riding in the 1979 and 1983 provincial elections. He lost both times to the BC Social Credit Party candidates. He ran in the 1991 provincial election in the Vancouver-Kensington riding where he won as his party came to power. He would be re-elected in that same riding in the 1996 provincial election. He spent his first few years as a Member of the Legislative Assembly as a backbencher. In 1993, he chaired the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and Private Bills. He served two years as caucus chair for his party until April 10, 1995, when Premier Mike Harcourt dismissed Robin Blencoe from his cabinet and replaced him with Dosanjh as Minister of Government Services and Minister Responsible for Sports. A month later, in a small cabinet shuffle upon the resignation of Moe Sihota, Harcourt added Minister Responsible for <b>Multiculturalism</b> and Human Rights to Dosanjh's portfolio. In another cabinet shuffle, as Sihota was re-instated into the cabinet in August, Dosanjh's portfolio was changed to Minister Responsible for <b>Multiculturalism,</b> Human Rights and Immigration and he was appointed Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|In The Artist Among the Missing (1949), Manning {{illustrates}} the racial tensions that are created when imperialism and <b>multiculturalism</b> mix, and, as in her other war novels, evaluates the political bind {{in which the}} British seek to defeat racist Nazism while upholding British colonial exploitation. The School for Love (1951) is the tale of an orphaned boy's journey of disillusionment {{in a city that}} is home to Arabs, Jews and a repressive, colonial presence represented in the novel by the cold, self-righteous, and anti-Semitic character of Miss Bohun.|$|E
5|$|The Nation Alliance Party was {{guided by}} a support for <b>multiculturalism.</b> Specifically, the party sought to {{increase}} translation services for people who could not read or speak English or people whose first language is not English, equivalency of academic standards, more supportive immigration services that assist transition into Canadian society, and better working conditions for recent immigrants and migrant labourers.|$|E
5|$|Millhouse, now the State Parliamentary Leader of the LM, {{announced}} the LM's {{policy for the}} 1975 state election at the Adelaide Town Hall on 2 July. He outlined the LM's plans for economic rejuvenation: an end to compulsory unionism, budget and tax cuts, and measures to curb rising inflation and cost of living. Social policy included proposals for an early form of <b>multiculturalism</b> and promotion of 'cultural diversity' and bilingualism. Energy policy appealed {{to a new generation}} of environmentalists, and promoted conservation and promotion of solar power. He slammed the proposed City of Monarto as a 'monument to socialist folly'.|$|E
5|$|The Nation Alliance Party {{was a minor}} {{political}} party in British Columbia, Canada. While the party was registered with Elections BC as a provincial party, it also participated in the 2008 federal election, the 2008 municipal election, {{as well as the}} 2009 provincial election. The party sought to promote <b>multiculturalism,</b> advocate for rights of ethnic minorities and recent immigrants focusing on employment access, security, health care, education and overall rights and status. It was an advocacy party that sought to politically empower and enable those who do not speak English as a first language to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a number of renowned {{facilities}} and institutions involving performing arts. The most prominent is the Neo-baroque theatre at the Avram Iancu Square. Built {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century by the Viennese company Helmer and Fellner, this structure is inscribed in UNESCO's list of specially protected monuments. Since 1919, shortly after the union of Transylvania with Romania, the building has hosted the Lucian Blaga National Theatre and the Romanian National Opera. The Transylvania Philarmonic, founded in 1955, gives classical music concerts. The <b>multiculturalism</b> in the city is once again attested by the Hungarian Theatre and Opera, home for four professional groups of performers. There is also a number of smaller independent theatres, including the Puck Theatre, where puppet shows are performed.|$|E
5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of race and}} of ethnic relations is {{the area of the}} discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of racism, residential segregation, and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or <b>multiculturalism.</b> Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
5|$|As Attorney General, Dosanjh {{oversaw the}} {{resolution}} of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation, set up a database for registering violent offenders, established a hate crime division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lobbied for more police officers, probation officers, and judiciary. At the same time his office drew criticism for reducing legal aid and closing courthouses. As the Minister Responsible for <b>Multiculturalism,</b> Human Rights and Immigration he successfully lobbied for laws giving same-sex couples the equal rights and responsibilities for child support, custody and access. In early 1999, a special prosecutor under the RCMP opened an investigation into possible influence peddling by Premier Glen Clark concerning casino licensing. On March 4, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) raided the Premier's house, they briefed Attorney General Dosanjh, whose office had to assist, and placed him under a gag order. The order was lifted on August 13, he informed Clark, and called a press conference, after which Clark resigned as Premier. Dosanjh's actions were variously criticized for not informing his party caucus and not going public sooner, and applauded for avoiding perceptions of conflict of interest despite his power to intervene.|$|E
5|$|The realist Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} 19th- and 20th-century Serbian painters. He was a native of the town of Vršac, then part of the Hungarian-administered Banat region of Austria-Hungary, which had a mixed population of Serbs, Hungarians and Germans. Most of the Serbs were descended from 14th-century migrants fleeing the Ottoman advance following the Battle of Kosovo in June 1389. Such diversity and <b>multiculturalism</b> ensured the town's reputation for prosperity and cultural enlightenment. Jovanović's artistic abilities were noticed at an early age, and nourished by his father, a professional photographer. His early development was informed by the portraits and religious paintings of artists such as Pavel Đurković, Jovan Popović and Arsenije Teodorović. Jovanović's early copies of the artworks available to him in Vršac brought him instant recognition and steered him towards a career in the arts. In his adolescence, the artist had observed people from the Vršac countryside and their customs, and compiled sketches of natural and man-made structures in and around the town. While a student, he was commissioned to draw a series of preparatory sketches for the bell tower of his hometown's main church.|$|E
5|$|One {{striking}} {{example of}} multilingualism {{as well as}} <b>multiculturalism</b> in the Empire is a 2nd-century epitaph for a woman named Regina, discovered in 1878 near the Roman fort at South Shields, northeast England. The inscription is written in Latin and Palmyrene Aramaic, the language of Regina's husband, Barates, who has been identified with a standardbearer (vexillarius) of that name from Palmyra, Syria. He was most likely in the military stationed along Hadrian's Wall. The Latin, however, is constructed grammatically {{in the manner of}} Greek honorific inscriptions typical of Palmyra, suggesting that Barates was bilingual in Aramaic and Greek, and added Latin as a third language. The Latin portion is larger and longer, and provides most of the information. The Palmyrene is carved in a fluid cursive script, and conveys only the name of Regina and an expression of grief. Since few people in Britain could have read Palmyrene, its use may be Barates' personal statement of his identity and emotions. A fourth linguistic element is the name Regina, which can be either Latin or Celtic. Such names seem often to have been chosen for their deliberate duality. Regina herself is identified as from the British Catuvellauni, a people whose civitas capital was Verulamium, but the Gallo-Brittonic spelling Catuallauna (feminine) is used in the Latin inscription.|$|E
5|$|A reformist, Dunstan brought {{profound}} {{change to}} South Australian society. His socially progressive administration saw Aboriginal land rights recognised, homosexuality decriminalised, {{the first female}} judge appointed, the first non-British governor, Sir Mark Oliphant, and later, the first indigenous governor Sir Douglas Nicholls. He enacted consumer protection laws, reformed and expanded the public education and health systems, abolished the death penalty, relaxed censorship and drinking laws, created a ministry for the environment, enacted anti-discrimination law, and implemented electoral reforms such as the overhaul of the Legislative Council of parliament, lowered the voting age to 18, enacted universal suffrage, and completely abolished malapportionment, changes which gave him a less hostile parliament and allowed him to enact his reforms. He established Rundle Mall, enacted measures to protect buildings of historical heritage, and encouraged a flourishing of the arts, with support for the Adelaide Festival Centre, the State Theatre Company, {{and the establishment of}} the South Australian Film Corporation. He encouraged cultural exchanges with Asia, <b>multiculturalism</b> and an increase in the state's culinary awareness and sophistication. He is recognised for his role in reinvigorating the social, artistic and cultural life of South Australia during his nine years in office, remembered as the Dunstan Decade. However, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan's pet projects, a plan to build a new city at Monarto to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan's administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a judicial investigation. In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as unsubstantiated rumours of corruption and personal impropriety. Dunstan became increasingly short-tempered, and the strain was increased by the death of his second wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he would live for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for progressive social policy.|$|E

Canada is also considered a mosaic because of the multi-culturalism.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{to fight}} the loss of {{regional}} diversity, many in France have promoted forms of <b>multiculturalism</b> and encouraged cultural enclaves (communautarisme), including reforms on the preservation of regional languages and the decentralization of certain government functions, but French <b>multiculturalism</b> has had a harder time of accepting, or of integrating into the collective identity, the large non-Christian and immigrant communities and groups {{that have come to}} France since the 1960s.|$|E
