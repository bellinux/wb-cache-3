A second wet treatment halts the production of hormone that had occurred during the dry period, and reduces a sensitization to injected ecdysone during the intervening dry treatment.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to find out the <b>minimal</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> of Leuplin depot to prevent premature LH surge in patients undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI). Materials and Methods: From January 2006 to December 2007, unexplained infertile patients who were going to undergo IUI were recruited into the study. They were assigned sequentially to one of the following treatment groups. The first 50 patients received the 1 / 3 -dose of Leuplin depot in the midluteal phase of the cycle preceding COS. If no premature LH surge occurred in the 50 patients, the study was continued with 1 / 4 -dose of Leuplin depot in the subsequent 50 patients. Similarly, if no premature LH surge occurred with 1 / 4 dose, the study was continued with 1 / 5 -dose of Leuplin depot in the following 50 patients. Ovarian stimulation was started with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) at 112. 5  IU/d after downregulation, then IUI was performed 36  hours after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection. Results: Premature LH surge was effectively prevented with 1 / 3 -dose and 1 / 4 -dose of Leuplin depot. Premature LH surge occurred in three of the 50 patients (6 %) in the 1 / 5 -dose group.

Conclusions Of 100 vomiting surgical patients receiving a 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist, 20 to 30 will stop vomiting who would not have done so had they received a placebo; less will profit from the anti-nausea effect. There is a lack of evidence for a clinically relevant dose-response; <b>minimal</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> may be used. There is a discrepancy between the plethora of trials on prevention of PONV and the paucity of trials on treatment of established symptoms. Valid data on the therapeutic efficacy of classic antiemetics, which have been used for decades, are needed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To compare {{results of}} low-dose tissue {{plasminogen}} ac-tivator (TPA) {{in children with}} arterial and venous thrombi relative to standard published dosing. Methods: Subjects consisted of all consecutive children with ob-jectively confirmed thrombi for whom TPA thrombolysis was clinically ordered by the authors. Initial dosing used published standard dose (0. 1 – 0. 5 mg/kg per hour). With experience, a low-dose regimen (0. 01 – 0. 06 mg/kg per hour) was given {{in an attempt to}} derive a <b>minimal</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose.</b> Results: Thirty-five children were treated with TPA. Either stan-dard or low-dose infusions of TPA resulted in complete throm-bolysis of 28 of 29 (97 %) acute thrombi, while all 6 chronic thrombi had a partial response. In contrast to the recommended adult-derived dosages of 0. 1 to 0. 5 mg/kg per hour, the authors found that initial doses of less than 0. 01 mg/kg per hour wer...|$|E

BAY 38 - 7271 was characterized as a CB 1 receptor agonist in 5 -[35 S]-thiophosphate triethylammonium salt binding assays using rat or human CB 1 receptors. In the rat hypothermia assay, BAY 38 - 7271 induced a dose-dependent reduction in body temperature (<b>minimal</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> 6 g/kg, i. v.); whereas in rats trained to discriminate the CB 1 / CB 2 receptor agonist () -cis- 3 -[2 -hydroxy- 4 (1, 1 -dimethyl-heptyl) phenyl]-trans- 4 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) cyclohexanol (CP 55, 940; 0. 03 mg/kg, i. p.) from vehicle, BAY 38 - 7271 induce...|$|E
40|$|A {{synthetic}} {{muramyl dipeptide}} (MDP, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine) is a minimal essential structure that is contained generally in bacterial cell walls and {{is responsible for}} their many biologic activities such as adjuvant activity, pyrogenicity, and a capacity to confer resistance against bacterial and viral infections. We found that this MDP evoked dose-dependently massive organized epithelioid granulomas in guinea pigs, when injected {{in the form of}} Freund-type water-in-oil emulsion. Granuloma formation reached a peak at 3 weeks. A <b>minimal</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> of MDP was 0. 1 microgram. Essentially, no difference was observed qualitatively among granulomas evoked by MDP, MDP plus antigen, and killed tubercle bacilli incorporated in the emulsion. Quantitatively, however, MDP was stronger in its granulomagenic capacity than tubercle bacilli. Antigenicity of MDP was not detectable. These findings support our proposal that MDP may be a chemical structure in tubercle bacilli essential for epithelioid granuloma formation and that the MDP-induced epithelioid granuloma may be of a nonallergic nature...|$|E
40|$|Opioids {{are widely}} used as {{additives}} to local anesthetics for intrathecal anesthesia. Benefit and risk remain unclear. We systematically searched databases and bibliographies to February 2011 for full reports of randomized comparisons of any opioid added to any intrathecal local anesthetic with the local anesthetic alone in adults undergoing surgery (except cesarean section) and receiving single-shot intrathecal anesthesia without general anesthesia. We included 65 trials (3338 patients, 1932 of whom received opioids) published between 1983 and 2010. Morphine (0. 05 - 2 mg) and fentanyl (10 - 50 μg) added to bupivacaine were the most frequently tested. Duration of postoperative analgesia was prolonged with morphine (weighted mean difference 503 min; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 315 to 641) and fentanyl (weighted mean difference 114 min; 95 % CI 60 to 168). Morphine decreased {{the number of patients}} needing opioid analgesia after surgery and decreased pain intensity to the 12 th postoperative hour. Morphine increased the risk of nausea (number needed to harm [NNH] 9. 9), vomiting (NNH 10), urinary retention (NNH 6. 5), and pruritus (NNH 4. 4). Fentanyl increased the risk of pruritus (NNH 3. 3). With morphine 0. 05 to 0. 5 mg, the NNH for respiratory depression varied between 38 and 59 depending on the definition of respiratory depression chosen. With fentanyl 10 to 40 μg, the risk of respiratory depression was not significantly increased. For none of these effects, beneficial or harmful, was there evidence of dose-responsiveness. Consequently, <b>minimal</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> of intrathecal morphine and fentanyl should be sought. For intrathecal buprenorphine, diamorphine, hydromorphone, meperidine, methadone, pentazocine, sufentanil, and tramadol, there were not enough data to allow for meaningful conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Background. Malignant {{melanoma}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} aggressive skin cancer and chemotherapeutic agents currently in use are still unsatisfactory. Prevention and early diagnosis are the only effective tools against this tumour whose incidence and mortality rates are highly increased during the last decades in fair skin populations. Therefore the search for novel therapeutic approaches is warranted. Aim of this work was to identify and test new compounds with antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity on melanoma cells. We tested eugenol together with six natural and synthetic eugenol-related compounds for their capability to inhibit cell growth on primary melanoma cell lines established from patients' tissue samples. Results. Eugenol and isoeugenol monomers and their respective O-methylated forms did not show to inhibit melanoma cells proliferation. Conversely, the dimeric forms (biphenyls) showed some antiproliferative activity which was mild for dehydrodieugenol, higher for its O,O'-methylated form (O,O'-dimethyl-dehydrodieugenol), and markedly pronounced for the racemic mixture of the brominated biphenyl (6, 6 '-dibromo-dehydrodieugenol) (S 7), being its enantiomeric form (S) the most effective compared to the other compounds. Such activity resulted to be selective against tumour cells, without affecting cultured normal human skin fibroblasts. Dose and time dependence curves have been obtained for the enantiomeric form S 7 -(S). Then IC 50 and <b>minimal</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> and times have been established for the melanoma cell lines tested. TUNEL and phosphatidylserine exposure assays demonstrated the occurrence of apoptotic events associated with the antiproliferative activity of S 7 -(S). Cytotoxic activity and apoptosis induced by treating melanoma cells with eugenol-related biphenyls was partially dependent by caspase activation. Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that the eugenol related biphenyl (S) - 6, 6 '-dibromo-dehydrodieugenol elicits specific antiproliferative activity on neuroectodermal tumour cells partially triggering apoptosis and its activity should be further investigated on in vivo melanoma models in order to evaluate the real anticancer effectiveness on such tumour...|$|R
40|$|Metastatic disease after {{successful}} {{treatment of}} the primary tumor {{continues to be a}} therapeutic challenge. Enhancement of therapeutic effects by the administration of unlabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) after radioimmunotherapy (RIT) may provide a means of preventing or delaying the development of metastatic disease. In the present study, Brown Norway rats with syngeneic grafted colon carcinomas were administered the <b>minimal</b> <b>effective</b> therapeutic <b>dose</b> of 400 MBq/kg lutetium- 177 ((177) Lu) -DOTA-BR 96. After 2 weeks, half of the animals were given 15 mg/kg unlabeled mAb BR 96 as consolidation therapy. Treatment response and toxicity were monitored 100 days after the treatment with unlabeled BR 96. The treatment with unlabeled mAb after RIT resulted in a complete response (CR) in 19 of 19 animals, while RIT alone resulted in a CR in 17 of 19 animals. The additional treatment did not affect the number of animals with metastatic disease or the time to clinical symptoms of metastases. RIT resulted in reversible myelotoxicity. The unlabeled mAb BR 96 did not cause any additional toxicity, making it possible to repeat the consolidation therapy...|$|R
