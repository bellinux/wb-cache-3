40|$|Abstract Psychopathy {{involves}} impaired {{capacity for}} prudential and moral reasoning due to impaired capacity for empathy, remorse, {{and sensitivity to}} fear-inducing stimuli. Brain abnormalities and genetic polymorphisms associated with these traits appear to justify the claim that psychopaths cannot be morally responsible for their behavior. Yet psychopaths are capable of instrumental reasoning in achieving their goals, which suggests that they have some capacity to respond to moral reasons against performing harmful acts and refrain from performing them. The cognitive and affective impairment of the psychopath justifies <b>mitigated</b> <b>responsibility,</b> but not excuse...|$|E

Many {{people seem to}} think so, holding that mental disorders nearly always <b>mitigate</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Against this Naïve view, we argue for a Nuanced account.

I argue that exemptions affect the explanatory relevance of the accused, while excuses fully or partially justify her, by affecting the evaluative claim involved in responsibility attributions. This distinction supports the claim that attributing responsibility is a two‑step process, each of them corresponding to a different kind of responsibility—agential and moral—whose attribution is guided by two different although related cognitive and argumentative tasks: explaining an outcome, and evaluating its moral significance...|$|R

40|$|Much {{psychological}} {{research examining}} the serial killer has adopted an essentialist theoretical focus {{concentrating on the}} `nature' of the individual who commits the murder. This study, in contrast, aims to analyse the talk of a serial killer using principles taken from discursive psychology. A courtroom transcript concerning the confession to 10 murders by the serial killer, Dennis Rader, was analysed. The transcript was read and reread {{in order to examine}} how the killer drew upon popular understandings of serial killing, until eventually three main discourses were identified: perpetrator as `sympathetic', `serial killer' and `driven by sexual fantasy'. The analysis demonstrated that these discourses all served to reinforce the widely shared construction of the serial killer, i. e. being sexually motivated. Furthermore, the findings show how this construction served the functions of <b>mitigating</b> <b>responsibility,</b> justifying certain actions and obscuring violence. Possible implications of this construction and its discursive functions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a segment}} of medical social life {{that has not been}} well studied: formal presentations of case histories by interns, residents, and fellows. Because they are presented by physicians in training to their status superiors who are evaluating them, case presentations are exercises in self presentation which serve as a vehicle for professional socialization. This analysis of the language of case presentation is based on case presentations collected in two intensive care nurseries and an obstetrics and gynecology service. Four features of case presentation are identified: 1) the separation of biological processes from the person (depersonalization); 2) omission of the agent (e. g., use of the passive voice,); 3) treating medical technology a s the agent; and 4) account markers, such a s "states", "reports", and "denies", which emphasize the subjectivity of patient accounts [...] The language of case presentation has signficant if unintended consequences for those who use it. First, some features of case presentation eliminate the element of judgment from medical decisions and <b>mitigate</b> <b>responsibility</b> for medical decision-making. Second, some are rhetorical devices which enhance the credibility of the fmdings that are presented. Third, the language o...|$|R

40|$|Manipulation {{arguments}} are commonly deployed to raise problems for compatibilist theories of responsibility. These arguments proceed by {{asking us to}} reflect on an agent who has been manipulated to perform some (typically bad) action but who still meets the compatibilist conditions of responsibility. The incompatibilist argues that it is intuitive that the agent {{in such a case}} is not responsible even though she met the compatibilist conditions. Thus, it is argued, the compatibilist has not provided conditions sufficient for responsibility. Patrick Todd has recently argued that incompatibilists have taken on a heavier dialectical burden than is necessary. Todd argues that incompatibilists need not argue that an agent in a manipulation case is not at all responsible, but only that her <b>responsibility</b> is <b>mitigated</b> in order to refute compatibilism. Hannah Tierney has responded to Todd’s argument by arguing that a compatibilist can admit that manipulation <b>mitigates</b> <b>responsibility</b> without eliminating it. I argue that Tierney’s response is unsuccessful on its own terms. But, I argue, Todd’s argument can be resisted by way of a parallel counter-argument for compatibilism. I argue that Todd’s argument for incompatibilism is no more powerful than my argument for compatibilism. And since Todd’s manipulation argument is offered as an objection to compatibilism, this amounts to a victory for the compatibilist; the objection is defused...|$|R

An analysis of sentencing hearings for offenders wih psychopathy and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia is presented to illustrate that psychopathy is often perceived as an aggravating factor, while {{this is not the case}} for FASD, which shares some common traits with psychopathy.

30|$|Interestingly, the net {{composition}} {{effect is}} very high (2.805; the total shown in Table  3) in Bulgaria (Type V), which was industrializing more rapidly than other countries between 1995 and 2008. Despite significant structural changes in Bulgaria, the composition effects of both intermediate product imports and final product imports were negative and these import activities contributed greatly to <b>mitigate</b> its <b>responsibility</b> for global warming. At 2.219, Indonesia (Type VIII) had the second highest net composition effect, but that is still markedly different from Bulgaria. Domestic structural changes in Indonesia have also caused emissions to increase, as in Bulgaria, but in Indonesia changes in import patterns have also contributed to global warming. Indonesia should therefore try to mitigate its contribution to global warming by encouraging the importation of substitutes for products that cause significant emissions. As for Bulgaria, it underwent its emissions-intensive industrial structural change relatively early compared to other countries and therefore should adopt policies aimed at reducing emissions from emissions-intensive industries. Thus, the impacts that structural changes have on CO 2 emissions vary and are independent of a nation’s level of development.|$|R

Whereas research elucidating the causes and mechanisms underlying {{child abuse and neglect}} has gained national recogni-tion and prominence, studies specifically addressing child homicide have historically been scant.

This current study used narrative analysis to examine how Relationships Australia’s men’s domestic violence group programs have changed language practices; in response to developing an increased knowledge and awareness of how domestic violence is misrepresented through language. It was found that program staff responded by reviewing and changing language practices in a deliberate effort to represent domestic violence accurately and align language with a feminist post-structural theoretical ideology across three sites in the program; program policy, practice and reporting.

However the chief of Israel's prison service rejected the claims saying that the cell was not specially supervised, nor was it considered suicide proof.

40|$|This Comment {{presents}} {{three major}} arguments concerning biological deficiency defenses, using, respectively, {{a critique of}} biosocial science research, a statistical model of biological and sociological data, and an examination of theories and philosophies on causation and behavior.

Second, this Comment argues that social science research has not successfully demonstrated sufficiently strong links between biological factors and criminal behavior to warrant major consideration in determining criminal responsibility. Third, this Comment demonstrates that no strong evidence supports either a strictly free will or a strictly deterministic philosophy in the criminal law regarding either the causes of crime or the determinants of criminal responsibility. Ultimately, the criminal justice system must confront the significance of the mounting evidence concerning the biological bases of behavior, weigh its importance, evaluate its strengths and weaknesses, and recommend a policy for its use. The direction of that policy will depend upon our notions of human nature, our assumptions of causality, and, undoubtedly, the politics and potentially broad applicability of the biological deficiency argument...|$|R

The definitive {{version of this article}} is available at [URL] this paper we will consider the question of mutation as it is manifested in press coverage of MRSA in UK hospitals. This represents a fertile field of discourse which brings into focus issues relating to microbes, people and working practices as well as the concepts of risk and vulnerability. A regular feature of reporting has been the presence of explanations for drug resistance involving repeated random mutations of the microbe to achieve progressively greater resistance and versatility, largely through a Darwinian process which is clever at overcoming human attempts at elimination. More recently a discourse has emerged which foregrounds also the vulnerability of patients who are very young, old or otherwise immunocompromised, or whose own genetic makeup might put them at risk from the microbe. The hospital is decentred as a source of infection, and attention is turned instead to nursing homes and gymnasia as sources of infection in the community. This latter development <b>mitigates</b> the <b>responsibilities</b> of hospitals and statutory healthcare providers and turns the risk back towards the individual as a responsible actor in an ecology of mutation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} {{the ways in which}} the rape of women by men is {{constructed}} in the advice column Dear Dolly, published in the South African periodical Drum Magazine. The data collected for the study spans from 1984 to 2004, encompassing both 10 years before and 10 years after the onset of democracy in South Africa. The article uses critical discourse analysis (Fairclough 2003) as main analytical tool, but also draws on critical feminist theory (Bourke 2007). The findings suggest that there has been a decrease in explicit victim blaming after 1994, but that subtle and opaque victim blaming is still evident in readers’ letters and in the responses. These rape discourses presented in Drum after 1994 are, as Bakhtin (1981) suggests, made up of multiple voices articulating different gendered discourses. In this article, we argue that even though the use of less explicit victim blaming might seem like a positive move in the representation of rape and gender, this is not always the case. The more subtle forms of victim blaming avoid contestation and consequently often go unchecked (Fairclough 2003 : 58). Additionally, new rape myths are created to <b>mitigate</b> the <b>responsibility</b> of males. These processes of subtle victim blaming and new myth-making manufacture consent and make it more difficult to counteract dominant discourses. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{cultural}} {{defense is}} an informal term {{that describes the}} use of cultural information to <b>mitigate</b> criminal <b>responsibility,</b> often {{used in conjunction with}} traditional defense strategies such as provocation or insanity. Arguments for the cultural defense include respecting cultural practices under the liberal narrative that frames the United States as a multicultural and pluralistic society. Advocates of the cultural defense recognize the harmful effects of the false universalism of the law. However, the cultural defense has been criticized as essentialist and harmful as it has been used in high profile cases to justify violence against women of color. The cultural defense superficially prioritizes the needs of marginalized communities by acknowledging the importance of culture in the administration of the criminal law. The rationale behind the cultural defense is politically appealing, but the impacts of the defense are incompatible with the goals of antisubordination, which will be further described by Critical Race Theory. Because the debate surrounding the cultural defense has yet to make significant advances, I argue that Critical Race Theory offers an essential starting point in intervening in the debate, ultimately transforming the realm of legal jurisprudence through its explicit race consciousness and examination of racialized power. In particular, I will examine the concepts of intersectionality and interest convergence which will offer valuable perspective into the cultural defense debate...|$|R

Theoretically, we show that since agents" votes are not always pivotal, majority rule suffers from a free-rider problem. Unanimity <b>mitigates</b> free-riding since <b>responsibility</b> for the committee's decision is equally distributed across all agents. We test our predictions in a controlled laboratory experiment.

5000|$|The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), one of North America's leading anti-sexual {{violence}} organizations, in {{a report}} detailing recommendations to the White House on combating rape on college campuses, identifies problems with an overemphasis {{on the concept of}} rape culture as a means of preventing rape and as a cause for rape, saying, [...] "In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming 'rape culture' for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of {{a small percentage of the}} community, to commit a violent crime." [...] It is estimated that in college, 90% of rapes are committed by 3-7% of the male population, though it is stipulated that RAINN does not have reliable numbers for female perpetrators. RAINN argues that rape is the product of individuals who have decided to disregard the overwhelming cultural message that rape is wrong. The report argues that the trend towards focusing on cultural factors that supposedly condone rape [...] "has the paradoxical effect of making it harder to stop sexual violence, since it removes the focus from the individual at fault, and seemingly <b>mitigates</b> personal <b>responsibility</b> for his or her own actions".|$|R
40|$|Employees’ {{trust in}} {{management}} {{is an important}} determinant of organizational effectiveness (Fukuyama, 1995). However, reports show that trust in management is generally low and reducing. The {{aim of the research}} documented in this thesis was to test the effectiveness of non-substantive responses (i. e., verbal) and substantive responses (i. e., behavioural) in the repair of employee trust in management, specifically supervisors, within a risk work context. The conditions under which these responses are effective, and the processes through which they operate, were also explored. Six empirical studies were carried out across gas, rail and healthcare industries. Using a combination of methods that drew on hypothetical, historical and real-time events, the studies revealed a number of key findings. First, the results showed an important role for the non-substantive response of an apology in the repair of employee trust. Non-substantive approaches that <b>mitigate</b> <b>responsibility</b> (i. e., justifications, denials, blame, excuses) were negatively related to trust. Second, a number of substantive responses were effective at repairing employee trust including a preventative procedure, monitoring and suspension. Analysis showed that these responses influenced employee trust by increasing perceptions of distributive justice, which increased the belief that management were repentant. Consistent with established research, repentance was positively related to trust. Interestingly, the results suggest that monitoring may reduce trust if it does not generate these mediating perceptions: a finding that was not shared with preventative procedures or suspension. Third, these main effects were moderated by the level of risk implicated in the event. When the risk is low, a non-substantive response was equally as effective in repairing employee trust as a substantive response. However, when risk is high, the combination of both a non-substantive and substantive response was required to repair trust. Fourth, in general, a substantive response implemented involuntarily (i. e., by the organization) was equally as effective as a response initiated voluntarily (i. e., by the member of management). Exceptions to this are when the target is of a high hierarchical status, and when an employee has been implicated in the event that reduced trust. In these cases, a voluntary response is more effective at repairing employee trust. Finally, preliminary results suggest implicit and explicit trust beliefs are largely separate constructs. Implicit trust beliefs are relatively stable therefore repair strategies need to be strong and targeted to impact upon these beliefs. This research has important practical and theoretical implications. At a theoretical level, the research supports proposals made in accordance with attribution theory, that responses that are internally attributed are most effective in the repair of trust, whereas externally attributed responses are less effective. As one of the first studies to empirically test the effectiveness of substantive responses, it also expands existing models of trust repair to show an important role that can be played by behavioural responses, especially in the repair of high-risk violations. At a practical level, the research suggests that organizations can {{take an active role in}} repairing relations between employees and management by implementing effective substantive responses that do not simply punish management, but serve as a learning tool to help address the underlying cause of the violation...|$|R
40|$|The recent ‘realist turn’ {{questions}} {{a certain}} {{conception of the}} very undertaking of political philosophy. Taking inspiration from Bernard Williams or Raymond Geuss, we may label this conception a ‘priority view’. Very roughly, the priority view represents {{the idea that a}} philosophical theory of morality or political reasonableness ought to create “the framework within which the political is played out”, (Newey 2001), 37 / Philosophy is assumed to impose from outside the aims to be achieved or the constraints to be respected by politics. However, overreacting against the priority view may land us with what Williams has called the “Manichean dualism of soul and body, of high-mindedness and the pork barrel”, (Williams 2005), 12. Manichean dualism proposes a division of labour between philosophy (and its idealised accounts of morality or reasonableness) and a supposedly objective or a cynical approach to politics which sees only self-interest and the struggle for power. 	Obviously, the priority view and Manichean dualism share a dichotomous conception of the relations between politics and normativity. Politics as the domain of coercive power may be subject to prudential reasonableness but otherwise is devoid of morality or reasonableness. If philosophical theory has any task it is to introduce norms of morality or reasonableness from the outside. The quarrel between the priority view and Manichean dualism concerns the relevance of this theoretical enterprise for politics. 	This paper explores a different approach. Starting out from the definitions of power and coercion by (Morriss 1987), (Wertheimer 1987), (Lukes 2005) and others and appealing to Donald Davidson’s views on interpretation and rationality, I develop a notion of coercive power as a hermeneutic or interpretative concept. I aim to enquire into its use in trying to understand our general political condition or a particular situation. For the presence of coercion cannot simply be read off a neutral description of a situation; in interpreting a particular situation as a situation where A coerces B, we make sense of B’s actions with a view of <b>mitigating</b> <b>responsibility.</b> This presupposes that we normatively judge the situation so as to establish 1) whether A’s proposal is coercive and 2) whether B was entitled to succumb to A’s coercive proposal, (Wertheimer 1987). Generalizing these claims and transposing them to politics I will argue that political philosophy needs not introduce theoretically validated criteria of reasonableness from outside politics. Our very use of the notion of coercive power in understanding politics already presupposes a normativity, a form of reasonableness that is not merely prudential. The first task of political philosophy is therefore not to develop a theory of morality or reasonableness to be imposed on politics. It is to understand the (connections between the) notions that we use {{to determine the extent to}} which are we coerced in complying with the decisions of those in power. Or, put differently, it is to understand the extent of our responsibility for (the decisions of) our society.

This culture is actively fostered by powerful cultural, economic and political currents which encourage an idea of society excessively concerned with efficiency. Looking at the situation from this point of view, it is possible to speak in a certain sense of a war of the powerful against the weak: a life which would require greater acceptance, love and care is considered useless, or held to be an intolerable burden, and is therefore rejected in one way or another. A person who, because of illness, handicap or, more simply, just by existing, compromises the well-being or life-style of those who are more favoured tends to be looked upon as an enemy to be resisted or eliminated. In this way a kind of 'conspiracy against life' is unleashed. This conspiracy involves not only individuals in their personal, family or group relationships, but goes far beyond, to the point of damaging and distorting, at the international level, relations between peoples and States.|$|R

Since the entry into force of the 169 ILO Convention, there have been some developments in the jurisprudence pertaining to the legal recognition of the ancestral property right to water; rights of use, exploitation and protection of the land; natural resources and ecosystems that make up indigenous habitats; and the right to consultation taking into account the ethnic specificity of indigenous peoples. However, Chilean jurisprudence tends to protect the hegemony of State law and its structuring principles, both in criminal matters, where customary law can be applied exceptionally as a ground for excluding or <b>mitigating</b> criminal <b>responsibility,</b> and in civil matters, where the rules and principles established in the Indigenous Act and in the 169 Convention have been reluctantly adopted with regard to indigenous people’s right to property and possession of the land. Finally, the courts have not recognized the jurisdiction of indigenous authorities to resolve community conflicts...|$|R
500|$|On {{his way to}} Italy, Servetus {{stopped in}} Geneva to visit [...] "d'Espeville", where he was {{recognized}} and arrested. Calvin's secretary, Nicholas de la Fontaine, composed a list of accusations that was submitted before the court. The prosecutor was Philibert Berthelier, {{a member of a}} libertine family and son of a famous Geneva patriot, and the sessions were led by Pierre Tissot, Perrin's brother-in-law. The libertines allowed the trial to drag on in an attempt to harass Calvin. The difficulty in using Servetus as a weapon against Calvin was that the heretical reputation of Servetus was widespread and most of the cities in Europe were observing and awaiting the outcome of the trial. This posed a dilemma for the libertines, so on 21 August the council decided to write to other Swiss cities for their opinions, thus <b>mitigating</b> their own <b>responsibility</b> for the final decision. While waiting for the responses, the council also asked Servetus if he preferred to be judged in Vienne or in Geneva. He begged to stay in Geneva. On 20 October the replies from Zurich, Basel, Bern, and Schaffhausen were read and the council condemned Servetus as a heretic. The following day he was sentenced to burning at the stake, the same sentence as in Vienne. Some scholars claim that Calvin and other ministers asked that he be beheaded instead of burnt, knowing that burning at the stake was the only legal recourse. This plea was refused and on 27 October, Servetus was burnt alive at the Plateau of Champel at the edge of Geneva.|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{address the}} {{persistent}} confusion over {{the meaning of}} a medical diagnosis of drug addiction or substance dependence in the courtroom, specifically in regard to legal judgments about the reasonable legal person, causation, and individual responsibility in civil actions. Using the example of the Engle tobacco litigation in Florida, where the plaintiffs have reduced mind to brain and claimed that the clinical status of addiction excuses or <b>mitigates</b> the smoker’s <b>responsibility</b> for the health consequences of smoking based on brain processes, I examine the conceptual difficulties presented by use of biomedical models of behavior in a legal system predicated on different assumptions altogether. For legal purposes, the biological system in question is the human organism as a whole, not a brain per se, and there is a functional identity between a smoker and his motivational states for purposes of responsibility attribution. J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 41 : 92 – 7, 2013 If, in short, there is a [neuronal] community of computers living in my head, there had also better be somebody who is in charge; and, by God, it had better be me. —Jerry Fodor 1 A few years ago, historianD. GrahamBurnett 2 wrote a fascinating book about a “nineteenth-century New York court case that put the whale on trial and chal-lenged the order of nature. ” It is recommended read-ing for trial lawyers. The case was Maurice v. Judd, which was tried in Manhattan in 1818; the book is Trying Leviathan. The case involved a dispute over a candlemaker’s refusal to pay a $ 75 fish oil inspection fee on the basis that a whale is not a fish. Like Mel-ville’s Ishmael in Moby-Dick, local whale men took the stand to testify on “the good old fashioned ground that a whale is a fish. ” There was a titanic clash of scientific experts and leading trial lawyers that transfixed the city for three days. The candle-maker lost. The jury was out all of 15 minutes, re-turning to announce a verdict for the plaintiff, “hav-ing decided that awhale is a fish andwhale oil fish oil” (Ref. 2, p 178).

Mokslinių šaltinių analizė parodė, kad administracinė atsakomybė yra,,savarankiška teisinės atsakomybės rūšis, taikoma administracinio proceso teisės normų nustatyta tvarka administracinės teisės pažeidimus padariusiems fiziniams ar juridiniams asmenims, skiriant jiems įstatymų numatytas administracines nuobaudas, kuriomis siekiama užtikrinti teisinę tvarką įgyvendinant valstybinį valdymą. Minėta atsakomybė atsiranda tik esant norminio, faktinio bei procesinio pagrindų visumai“. Administracinę atsakomybę lengvinančių aplinkybių reglamentavimas Lietuvoje įsigaliojus LR Administracinių nusižengimų kodeksui nėra labai konkretus ir detalus (nėra tiksliai apibrėžtos sąvokos, todėl jas galima nevienodai interpretuoti ir t. t.), todėl turėtų būti pildytinas, nes kuo objektyvesniam bylos nagrinėjimui būtini detalūs įstatymai, aiškūs ir informatyvūs kiti dokumentai. Analizuojant Administracinių nusižengimų kodekso nuostatas apie asmens administracinę atsakomybę sunkinančias aplinkybes, taip pat matyti, kad nepateikiamas detalus naudojamų sąvokų aiškinimas (trūksta detalesnių,,sunkių pasekmių“ ar,,didelio turtinio nuostolio“ sąvokų charakteristikų, nėra aišku, kas laikytina,,visuotinai pavojingu“ administracinio nusižengimo padarymo būdu, kokios aplinkybės gali,,turėti įtakos“ administracinio nusižengimo padarymui, kokios- negali ir kt.). Interviu su Kauno apskrities Kauno rajono PK Garliavos policijos pareigūnais rezultatai patvirtino, jog Lietuvoje įsigaliojusio Administracinių nusižengimų kodekso 35 str. ir 36 str. nuostatos nėra labai detalios ir aiškios. Todėl galima daryti išvadą, kad magistro baigiamojo darbo pradžioje formuluota hipotezė pasitvirtino. Siekiant tobulinti esamą situaciją, tikslinga detalizuoti Lietuvoje įsigaliojusio Administracinių nusižengimų kodekso 35 str. ir 36 str. nuostatas. O atsižvelgiant į aplinkybę, kad Lietuvoje Administracinių nusižengimų kodeksas galioja tik keli mėnesiai, panašaus pobūdžio tyrimus tikslinga atlikti ir ateityje. Master's thesis {{analyzes}} - or {{an administrative}} <b>responsibility</b> of <b>mitigating</b> and aggravating circumstances application in Lithuania after {{entry into force}} of the Code of administrative offenses may be dependent on the personal (official) subjective attitude. Master's thesis analyzes {{the relevance of the}} subject based on the circumstances that the Code of the Republic of Lithuania of administrative offenses is a completely new document, entered into force only in 2017, January 1 st., i. e., very recently, therefore, the provisions of the Code are still quite not analyzed of scientists and other researchers, administrative responsibility, interpretation of its mitigating and aggravating circumstances in the legislation of the Republic of Lithuania is not regulated in detail, wherefore administrative responsibility of the circumstances in cases, which law does not provide in detail, it may depend on the subjective attitude of officials and administrative authorities conducting the proceedings, as well as research work, studies or other researches carried out in the Republic of Lithuania, where it would be analyzed the mitigating and aggravating circumstances of administrative responsibilities application. Application problems are not abundant. Therefore, the specified situation can be changed. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the administrative <b>responsibility</b> of <b>mitigating</b> and aggravating circumstances of the administrative responsibility of legal and regulatory aspects of the application. In order to implement the specified aim, there were presupposed these master's thesis objectives: to analyze the theoretical aspects of administrative responsibilities (definition, the essential characteristics); to distinguish specific characteristics of administrative responsibility, discussing the borderline with other types of liability, to analyze the administrative <b>responsibility</b> of <b>mitigating</b> and aggravating circumstances regulation in legislation, to identify the regulation problems of administrative <b>responsibility</b> of the <b>mitigating</b> and aggravating circumstances and make recommendations for their solution. Assessing the Republic of Lithuania Code of administrative offenses of Article 35,,Mitigating circumstances” provisions and Article 36,,Aggravating circumstances” provisions it is seen that although the administrative <b>responsibility</b> of <b>mitigating</b> and aggravating circumstances lists in mentioned Code article are shown, they are not very detailed and complete, characterizing and <b>mitigating</b> administrative <b>responsibility,</b> and administrative aggravating circumstances there are left a number of concepts that can be interpreted subjectively (severe effects, personal accident, a very difficult financial situation of the perpetrator, great excitement, and others). In the Republic of Lithuania the administrative <b>responsibility</b> of <b>mitigating</b> and aggravating circumstances is not regulated in detail, wherefore administrative liability in cases, which law does not provide specifically, can depend on the attitude of subjective officials (institutions) dealing with administrative proceedings and applying administrative <b>responsibility</b> of <b>mitigating</b> and aggravating circumstances. Therefore, this master's thesis examines application problems of administrative <b>responsibility</b> of <b>mitigating</b> and aggravating circumstances which can be formulated in the following problem areas: what application features are characteristic (clarity, particularity, simplicity, uncertainty, dilution and other) of the Republic of Lithuania Code of administrative offenses of mitigating and aggravating circumstances? What problems in assessing the Republic of Lithuania Code of administrative offenses of administrative responsibility for the administrative offense mitigating and aggravating circumstances, can be identified? What proposals (recommendations) in the Republic of Lithuania Code of administrative offenses applying an administrative offense mitigating and aggravating circumstances can be made? Master's thesis conducted scientific sources showed, that the administrative responsibility is an independent type of legal responsibility, which is applicable to administrative offenses committed by individual or legal persons, this procedure established by law, giving them statutory administrative penalties to ensure the implementation of the legal order of the state management. The said responsibility arises only at a legislative, factual and procedural framework as a whole. Administrative regulation of mitigating circumstances in Lithuania after the entry of Code of administrative offenses is not very specific and detailed (there is no well-defined concepts, so they can be interpreted differently, etc.), so it should be filled in, because the objective hearing requires detailed laws, clear and informative other documents. Analyzing the administrative Code offenses on a person's administrative aggravating circumstances it is seen that there is no detailed interpretation of used terms (lack of detailed,,serious consequences” or,,large property losses" conceptual characteristics, it is not clear what is generally considered to be,,dangerous” in a way of administrative offense, what circumstances,,may affect” the administrative offense, what circumstances,,may not affect” and etc.). After interview with Kaunas region Kaunas district police of Garliava results also confirmed that entered Code of administrative offenses Article 35 and 36 Article provisions are not very detailed and clear. Also from the Police Headquarters employees responses it is clear that although the administrative <b>responsibility</b> of <b>mitigating</b> or aggravating circumstances regulation in Lithuania after the entry into force of the Code of administrative offenses is more detailed than in the past, there are still areas for improvement - it is necessary to revise the Code of administrative offenses 35 and 36 Articles and adjust them, specify (for example, there is no clear provision of Article 35. 2 d. in the Code of administrative offenses,,,that a court or an administrative offense case out of court investigating authority (official) may, and other paragraph 1 specified circumstances, recognize as extenuating circumstances”, or Article 36. provision that,, court or administrative offense case out of court investigating authority (official) having regard to the person's participation in the administrative offense attribution and scale or support, establishing an administrative offense circumstances and making it to the persons involved can not recognize this as an aggravating circumstance” and etc. It is assumed that in cases which is not provided by law, officer’s opinion can be seen as having the greatest impact on the application of the administrative <b>responsibility</b> of <b>mitigating</b> or aggravating circumstances. In order to avoid this kind of cases, statutory provisions should be detailed and clear – so that individuals and the officers themselves would be fewer questions on how to handle different situations. After analyzing the information, it can be concluded that the master's thesis has proved the hypothesis. In order to improve the current situation, it is appropriate to elaborate the entry into force of the Code of administrative offenses Article 35 and Article 36 provisions, where is said that,,administrative offense case out of court investigating authority (official) and other circumstances can recognize as an administrative <b>responsibility</b> <b>mitigating</b> circumstances” also,,administrative offense case out of court investigating authority (official) having regard to the person's participation in the administrative offense attribution and scale or support, establishing an administrative offense circumstances and making it to the persons involved can not recognize this as an aggravating circumstance”. And given the fact that the administrative offenses code is only valid for a few months, similar tests are appropriate to perform in the future...|$|R
