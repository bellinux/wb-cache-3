It {{can be used to}} identify not only global spatial patterns in the country, but also characteristic locations at micro levels. In this research, we used spatial autocorrelation methodologies, including Global Moran’s I and Local Getis—Ord Gi statistics to identify the intensity of the spatial clustering of municipalities in Serbia by the level of average <b>monthly</b> net <b>earnings</b> from 2001 to 2010. We identified and mapped local clusters (hot and cold spots) by the level of average <b>monthly</b> net <b>earnings</b> for the same period. The results show that overall spatial segregation between municipalities with high and low average <b>monthly</b> net <b>earnings</b> was predominantly increasing during the investigated period. Local statistics illustrated that overall spatial segregation followed a broad north—south divide, with a concentration of municipalities with high net earnings in the north of Serbia, and low net earnings in the south. Closer inspection showed that {{at the beginning of the}} study period, there were three statistically significant hot spots in the north. As time passed, only one highly clustered hot spot remained — the Belgrade region. One cold spot retained a relatively stable position in the country’s southeast.

2500|$|Before Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, Cuba {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{advanced}} and successful countries in Latin America. Cuba's capital, Havana, was a [...] "glittering and dynamic city". The country's economy in the early part of the century, fuelled by the sale of sugar to the United States, had grown wealthy. Cuba ranked 5th in the hemisphere in per capita income, 3rd in life expectancy, 2nd in per capita ownership of automobiles and telephones, and 1st in the number of television sets per inhabitant. Cuba's literacy rate, 76%, was the fourth highest in Latin America. Cuba also ranked 11th in the world in the number of doctors per capita. Several private clinics and hospitals provided services for the poor. Cuba's income distribution compared favorably with that of other Latin American societies. However, income inequality was profound between city and countryside, especially between whites and blacks. Cubans lived in abysmal poverty in the countryside. According to PBS, a thriving middle class held the promise of prosperity and social mobility. According to Cuba historian Louis Perez of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, [...] "Havana was then what Las Vegas has become." [...] In 2016, the Miami Herald wrote, [...] "... about 27 percent of Cubans earn under $50 per month; 34 percent earn the equivalent of $50 to $100 per month; and 20 percent earn $101 to $200.

The low income bias of the benefit calculation means that lower paid worker receives a much higher percentage of his or her salary in benefit payments than higher paid workers. Indeed, a married low salaried worker can receive over 100% of their salary in benefits after retiring at the full retirement age. High-salaried workers receive 43% or less of their salary in benefits despite having paid into the [...] "system" [...] at the same rate—(see benefit calculations above.) To minimize the impact of Social Security taxes on low salaried workers the Earned Income Tax Credit" [...] and the Child Care Tax Credit were passed, which largely refund the FICA and or SECA payments of low-salaried workers through the income tax system. By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations the lowest income quintile (0-20%) and second quintile (21-40%) of households in the U.S. pay an average federal income tax of -9.3% and -2.6% of income and Social Security taxes of 8.3% and 7.9% of income respectively. By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an average total federal tax rate of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively. However, these groups also have by far the smallest percentage of American household incomes – the first quintile earns just 3.2% of all income, while the second quintile earns only 8.4% of all income. Higher-income retirees will have to pay income taxes on 85% of their Social Security benefits and 100% on all other retirement benefits they may have.|$|E

While it is commonly accepted that price per earnings ratio and corporate earnings are the main determinants of stock market returns, this assertion may not hold equally for monthly and daily stock returns. In addition, does this assertion hold equally for stock returns regardless {{of the stock market}} index? This work uses nonparametric spectral estimation to study the underlying properties of stock returns and uses <b>monthly</b> corporate <b>earnings</b> (corporate profits after tax) and 3 -month Treasury bill interest rate (proxy for price per earnings ratio) to forecast the monthly stock returns of S&P 500, DJIA, and NASDAQ indices. Since corporate earnings are issued quarterly, this data set had to be interpolated to produce the <b>monthly</b> corporate <b>earnings.</b> Overall, the analyses and forecasting were facilitated with both statistical and digital signal processing techniques. Some examples of the techniques used include Hurst exponent to determine predictability, nonparametric spectral estimation to determine the underlying properties of the stock returns, and correlation and root mean square error to determine the forecasting accuracy. The results of this study provide evidence to support that economic and financial time series such as interest rates, corporate earnings, and stock market returns are time varying and nonGaussian with smooth compactly supported and essentially bandlimited power spectral density estimates. It further shows that the forecasts of the different stock market returns align well with the desired values and the S&P 500 forecasted stock returns were the best...|$|R
