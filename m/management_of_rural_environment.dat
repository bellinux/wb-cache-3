The average amount of chemical fertilizer of the three northeastern provinces is 61. 62 、 93. 12 、 80. 49 t/km 2 respectively, which exceeds the safety limit set by developed countries to protect the environment.

40|$|Traditionally, most {{irrigation}} {{practices in}} Southern Europe {{have been based}} on gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. Currently, these systems remain a relevant typology in the European Union (EU) member states of the Mediterranean areas, where it is often the only sustainable method for farmers due to the small size of agricultural holdings, their reduced capacity and readiness to invest and the low ratio between yield profits and irrigation costs. In the last several years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However, these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits. The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation water <b>management</b> <b>of</b> four <b>rural</b> <b>environments</b> located in Italy, Spain and Portugal were analyzed and compared to {{the current state of the}} gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency is not a driving criterion for the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the conveyance and distribution canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation, remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimizatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Community <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rural</b> {{water supply}} and {{sanitation}} services is considered as one of the options for achieving sustainability of the water services. International communities and donors are steering this concept. National water policy in Tanzania puts more emphasis on community participation and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> water and sanitation (WATSAN) schemes. This study on the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>rural</b> {{water supply and}} sanitation services focused on community management and participation as one strategy, which could contribute to the sustainability of WATSAN provision. A study was conducted in six water schemes in six villages in Tanzania, four of the villages had water schemes in operation and two schemes were under construction. Data was collected from water users, water management committees and water providers. A structured questionnaire was administered to 92 water users in four water schemes in operation, focus group discussion was conducted to water management committees in six water schemes and three water providers responded to the questionnaire. Given changes and increasing diversity in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> WATSAN schemes (village water committees, board of directors and public private partnership), it is apparent that community <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> water schemes without support is not an ideal solution for achieving sustainability. It was also affirmed that to achieve a real community participation in the project is difficult. Village government leaders and water management committees were mainly involved during the planning phase and local communities during implementation. Interference by the politicians, village government leaders and inability of the water schemes to recover costs were the main problems facing water schemes. The consequence was poor performance and failure of some schemes to deliver the services. Generally, the findings lead to a subjective inference that community <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> water schemes alone is not an ideal solution for attaining sustainability. Community <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> WATSAN schemes is a good idea if implemented where there is demand-driven community involvement right {{from the beginning of the}} projects. Nevertheless, with the right capacity building and continuous support, community <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rural</b> WATSAN schemes can deliver reliable and sustainable water and sanitation services...|$|R

The values <b>of</b> the Romanian <b>rural</b> <b>environment,</b> very little known and recognized at international level, are fundamental cornerstones for the exploitation of socio-economic development opportunities which are very much needed by the Romanian <b>rural</b> <b>environment.</b> The present paper aims to undertake a study that will analyze the advantages of international cooperation in the maintenance and valorisation <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> touristic heritage.

40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to socio-spatial {{polarisation}} {{with regard to the}} <b>rural</b> <b>environment</b> in Slovakia. In fact, ongoing polarisation processes do not take place only in the rural-urban continuum, but within every single category as well. This is evident especially in the <b>rural</b> <b>environment,</b> which has begun to change significantly in terms of its structure and to diversify to a greater extent. As a result, some parts of the countryside began to stagnate and decline gradually. These parts <b>of</b> the <b>rural</b> <b>environment</b> can thus be referred to as marginal, peripheral. With respect to the proclaimed diversity <b>of</b> the <b>rural</b> <b>environment,</b> this study focuses on selected rural structures, namely mountain areas, the borderland, and the area at the intersection of those two structures. Generally, these parts <b>of</b> the <b>rural</b> <b>environment</b> are often confronted with the phenomenon of marginality and peripherality, and because of the given local predisposition are even more vulnerable to its manifestations. Taking into account the dynamism and multidimensional character of this phenomenon, we can further assume that its manifestation changes in time and space.
