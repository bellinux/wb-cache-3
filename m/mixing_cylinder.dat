40|$|Diesel engine {{designers}} {{often use}} swirl flaps to increase air motion in cylinder at low engine speeds, where lower piston velocities reduce natural in-cylinder swirl. Such in-cylinder motion reduces smoke and CO emissions by improved fuel-air mixing. However, swirl flaps, {{acting like a}} throttle on a gasoline engine, create an additional pressure drop in the inlet manifold and thereby increase pumping work and fuel consumption. In addition, by increasing the fuel-air <b>mixing</b> in <b>cylinder</b> the combustion duration is shortened and the combustion temperature is increased; this {{has the effect of}} increasing NOx emissions. Typically, EGR rates are correspondingly increased to mitigate this effect. Late inlet valve closure, which reduces an engine’s effective compression ratio, has been shown to provide an alternative method of reducing NOx emissions. Recently introduced technologies combine these two effects by retarding only the swirl port valve, increasing in-cylinder swirl while simultaneously reducing the effective compression ratio. In this paper the effects of using a swirl flap and offset cams are compared. Four different swirl flap positions (ranging from fully open to fully closed) were investigated using standard cams and valve timings. Results were compared with the engine’s operation when using two offset cams providing two different levels of retard on the swirl port— 30 and 60 crank angle degrees (CAD) respectively. Engine emissions, fuel consumption, and combustion parameters were measured and compared in order to elucidate the effects of phased cam operation. The results show that the use of a cam retarding the opening of the swirl port can reduce NOx emissions at certain speed/load conditions without adversely affecting other emissions. In addition significantly retarding the swirl port closure can reduce FSN emissions to near zero with low NOx emissions, by a combination of high levels of swirl and a reduced effective compression ratio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{theoretically}} describes and experimentally verifies two mechanisms {{leading to}} longitudinal dispersion of a passive tracer {{in a random}} array of circular cylinders. We focus on moderate Reynolds numbers of order 10 – 1000, specifically the range characterized by unsteady cylinder wakes. In this regime, two mechanisms contribute to dispersion, each associated with a distinct region of the cylinder wakes: (i) the unsteady recirculation zone close to each cylinder, and (ii) the velocity defect behind each cylinder, which extends downstream of the cylinder over a distance {{of the order of}} the cylinder spacing. The first mechanism, termed vortex-trapping dispersion, is due to the entrainment of tracer into the unsteady recirculation zone, where it is momentarily trapped and then released. A theoretical expression for this dispersive mechanism is derived in terms of the residence time and size of the recirculation zone. The second mechanism is due to advection through the random velocity field created by the random distribution of the wake velocity defect. We derive an expression for the defect behind an average cylinder, and show that it decays owing to array drag over a length scale called the attenuation length, which is of the order of the cylinder spacing. The superposition of the wake defect behind each cylinder creates the random velocity field. Theoretical predictions for dispersion agree very well with observations of tracer transport in a laboratory cylinder array, correctly capturing the dependence on array density and Reynolds number. The laboratory studies also document a transition in small-scale <b>mixing</b> at <b>cylinder</b> Reynolds number ≈ 200. Below this limit, individual filaments of tracer remain distinct, producing significant fluctuations in the local concentration field. At higher Reynolds number, cylinder wakes contribute sufficient turbulence to erase the filament signature and smooth the tracer distribution...|$|R

It is assumed that the slender cylinder {{is in line with}} the flow. The unsteadiness in the flow and temperature fields is caused due to the impulsive change in the wall velocity and wall temperature of linearly stretching vertical slender cylinder. The effect of sur-face curvature is also taken into account, particularly for the applications as wire and fiber drawing where exact predictions are expected. The governing boundary layer equations are transformed into a non-dimensional form by a group of non-similar transformations.

For miscible liquids, Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) technique is applied to record the concentration field for one liquid. Intensity of Segregation (IOS) is used to describe the mixing status. For immiscible liquids, High Speed Camera is adopted to record the development of the interface. The experiment of RTI indicates that it plays a great role in the mixing process, and meanwhile the large-scale mixing is triggered, and subsequently the span of the stripes decreases, showing that the mesoscale mixing is coming into being. The rotation experiments show that the spin-down process has a great role in liquid mixing, during which the upper liquid falls down rapidly along the wall and crashes into the lower liquid. During this process, a lot of interface instabilities are excited. Liquids mix rapidly in the spin-down process. It can be concluded that no matter what ways have been adopted to speed up liquid mixing, the fundamental reason is the interface instabilities which increase the area of the interface between liquids and increase the relative velocity of the two liquids...|$|R

The study first entailed {{the evaluation of}} two different alkali pre-treatments at varying concentrations by subjecting treated and untreated bundled fibers to tensile testing. The suitable pre-treatment was then adopted while casting cement mortar mixes. The physical properties of fresh mortar was studied through setting times and, for mortar mixes cured up to 28 days, through parameters such as drying shrinkage and water absorption. The unconfined compressive strengths, split tensile strengths {{as well as the}} flexural strengths of the cured mortar mixes at two different ages were undertaken to assess their mechanical properties; while the durability was gauged based on their sulfate resistance for up to a period of four months. Observed stress–strain behavior under tension led to the choice of 0. 173 % Ca(OH) 2 as the preferred pre-treatment for the bundled fibers used in the mortar mixes. This was further supported by the microstructural examination on the hardened mortars which, revealed that the integrity of treated fibers remained intact within the cement matrix without hindering the hydration processes.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} theoretical {{results on the}} <b>mixing</b> inside a <b>cylinder</b> with a rotating lid. The helical flow that is created by {{the rotation of the}} disk is well known to exhibit a vortex breakdown bubble over a finite range of Reynolds numbers. The mixing properties of the flow are analyzed quantitatively by measuring the exponential decay of the variance as a function of time. This homogenization time is extremely sensitive to the asymmetries of the flow, which are introduced by tilting the rotating or the stationary disk and accurately measured by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). In the absence of vortex breakdown, the homogenization time is strongly decreased (by a factor 10) with only a moderate tilt angle of the rotating lid (of the order of 15 degrees). This phenomenon {{can be explained by the}} presence of small radial jets at the periphery which create a strong convective mixing. A simple model of exchange flow between the periphery and the bulk correctly predicts the scaling laws for the homogenization time. In the presence of vortex breakdown, the scalar is trapped inside the vortex breakdown bubble, and thus increases substantially the time needed for homogenization. Curiously, the tilt of the rotating lid has a weak effect on the mixing, but a small tilt of the stationary disk (of the order of 2 degrees) strongly decreases (by a factor 10) the homogenization time. Even more surprising is that the homogenization time diverges when the size of the bubble vanishes. All these features are recovered by applying the Melnikov theory to calculate the volume of the lobes that exit the bubble. It is the first time that this technique has been applied to a 3 D stationary flow with a non-axisymmetric perturbation and compared with experimental results, although it has been applied often to 2 D flows with a periodic perturbation...|$|R

Moreover gases emitted by petroleum fuel driven vehicles have an adverse {{effect on the environment}} and human health. There is universal acceptance of the need to reduce such emissions. Towards this, scientists have proposed various solutions for diesel engines, one of which is the use of gaseous fuels as a supplement for liquid diesel fuel. These engines, which use conventional diesel fuel and gaseous fuel, are referred to as 'dual-fuel engines'. Natural gas and bio-derived gas appear more attractive alternative fuels for dual-fuel engines in view of their friendly environmental nature. In the gas-fumigated dual-fuel engine, the primary fuel is <b>mixed</b> outside the <b>cylinder</b> before it is inducted into the cylinder. A pilot quantity of liquid fuel is injected {{towards the end of the}} compression stroke to initiate combustion. When considering a gaseous fuel for use in existing diesel engines, a number of issues which include, the effects of engine operating and design parameters, and type of gaseous fuel, on the performance of the dual-fuel engines, are important. This paper reviews the research on above issues carried out by various scientists in different diesel engines. This paper touches upon performance, combustion and emission characteristics of dual-fuel engines which use natural gas, biogas, producer gas, methane, liquefied petroleum gas, propane, etc. as gaseous fuel. It reveals that 'dual-fuel concept' is a promising technique for controlling both NOx and soot emissions even on existing diesel engine. But, HC, CO emissions and 'bsfc' are higher for part load gas diesel engine operations. Thermal efficiency of dual-fuel engines improve either with increased engine speed, or with advanced injection timings, or with increased amount of pilot fuel. The ignition characteristics of the gaseous fuels need more research for a long-term use in a dual-fuel engine.

Injection must be properly timed to maintain pressure below 6 bar (or little more) in the intermediate chamber and thus keep sonic flow through the electroinjector, to maximize volumetric efficiency and to avoid backfire in the intake pipe. A preliminary CFD study based on code KIVA 3 v {{was carried out in}} order to compare the behaviour of different injection valve and valve-seat geometries in controlling air-fuel <b>mixing</b> inside the <b>cylinder</b> and to address the choice towards the most suitable ones, i. e. those that allow adequate fuel distribution in the combustion chamber at ignition time for every operating condition. As well, all the modifications necessary to obtain the prototype engine from a production one were based on KIVA 3 v predictions, especially as regards the volume of the intermediate chamber and diameter, maximum lift and opening duration of the injection valve. The prototype derives from the single-cylinder Aprilia-Rotax 650 cm 3 with five valves (three intake and two exhaust). The cylinder head underwent deep changes to replace the central inlet valve and pipe with the ones for hydrogen injection. Special attention was paid to crankcase ventilation system to prevent the formation of hydrogen pockets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the solution. The engine proved to run correctly, without the typical drawbacks of hydrogen engines (preignition, knocking, backfire, roughness) even with stoichiometric or slightly rich mixture (for maximum power). Maximum power was higher than for the engine fed with gasoline. A new CFD study based on AVL_Fire code recently started taking engine actual details into account with the aims to better predict engine behaviour and to address the improvement of the whole system...|$|R

Scopo della tesi nello specifico è stato determinare mediante un’analisi numerica CFD condotta in parallelo ad una attività sperimentale le {{geometrie}} e le condizioni ottimali di funzionamento del sistema di iniezione. La ricerca è stata condotta su un motore monocilindrico di 650 cc a 5 valvole di derivazione motociclistica (Aprilia Pegaso 650 i. e. 2002). Abstract Mixture formation {{strategy is}} {{a key factor in}} hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines. External mixture formation is characterised by excellent homogeneity and low residual pressure requirement for hydrogen storage. However, the high specific volume of hydrogen leads to poor energy density with consequent low engine specific power, especially if far-from-stoichiometric mixtures are employed to avoid pre-ignition and backfire problems. The use of liquid injection, due to its low storage temperature and latent heat of vaporisation, allows increasing mixture density and preventing pre-ignition and backfire, but requires sophisticate and expensive technologies and does not save tank mass and size significantly. Direct hydrogen injection provides high mixture energy density (even higher than with gasoline) avoids backfire, but pre-ignition and combustion roughness can occur at heavy loads unless a certain amount of the fuel is injected during combustion to accomplish compression stroke with a lean mixture and to positively control the heat release rate. Yet, injection during combustion can cause combustion instability and of course leads to high residual hydrogen storage pressure. In this work, a low-pressure hydrogen direct-injection solution is presented that entails low storage residual pressure (~ 12 bar). The injection is realised in two steps. First, hydrogen is simply metered by an electro-injector (a conventional one for Compressed Natural Gas - CNG application) that feeds a small intermediate chamber. Next, hydrogen enters the cylinder by means of a mechanically-actuated valve which allows higher flow than any electro-injector. Injection must end early enough to allow good charge homogeneity and, in any case, before in-cylinder pressure rise constraints hydrogen admission. Backfire is avoided by starting injection at intake valve closing. A prototype has been realised modifying a single-cylinder 650 cc production engine with three intake valves. The central one has been modified and properly timed to in-cylinder inject hydrogen from the intermediate chamber. Hydrogen injection through different-shape poppet valves in a quiescent, constant volume has been simulated in order to investigate the effects of valve and seat-valve geometries in controlling fuel-air <b>mixing</b> in the <b>cylinder.</b> Additional predictions for the actual engine configuration indicate that an acceptable fuel distribution can be obtained in the combustion chamber at the spark timing, with equivalence ratios in the ignition region that are inside the flammability range of the mixture for all the operating conditions (loads and speeds) that have been considered...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensively}} used materials within the construction industry. Aggregates make up 70 - 80 % of the concrete mixture, making them the most important components in concrete production; this factor has unavoidably led to an increasing demand in sourcing these natural materials used for their production. The consumption of natural resources develops a growing concern into the sustainability of these practices and a need to preserve these by possibly partially replacing there resources with alternative materials which are recycled or waste materials. This thesis was conducted to explore the use of recycled automotive tyre rubber as a partial replacement for fine aggregates in concrete construction. The initial part of this thesis the background of the study and the extent of the problem were explored, a review of relevant literature into previous studies within this area was completed. The experimental research for this thesis was begun by conducting tests on the raw materials to determine their properties and suitability for their use in this thesis. Concrete mix designs were then prepared using the Design of Normal Concrete Mixes Second Edition, and a total of 4 mix designs were developed 3 with percentage replacements of fine aggregate of 5 %, 10 % & 15 % of rubber aggregate by volume as well as one control mix with no replacement of fine aggregate was produced for a comparative analysis. Laboratory tests were conducted on the prepared concrete <b>mixes</b> and test <b>cylinders</b> including; slump, unit weight and compressive strength tests, the test results were compared with the respective conventional concrete properties. The background reading into previous studies and the experimental work completed during this thesis were analysed and it can be concluded that the introduction of crumb rubber into the concrete mixture can decrease the compressive strength in comparison to conventional concrete. However, the presence of the higher levels of moisture in the crumb rubber and its low unit weight in comparison to traditional aggregates have shown potential for an increase in workability, impact resistance, the strength weight ratio and overall flexibility of the concrete. These favourable properties can potentially develop a large market for the rubberized concrete making it a suitable material for such applications as architectural and interior construction, areas where shock wave absorbing or vibration damping is necessary and where resistance to impact or explosion is required. The overall results show that it is possible to use recycled rubber tyres in concrete construction as a partial replacement for fine aggregates, nevertheless, the percentage of replacement should be limited to a specified amount and the application should be restricted to particular cases where the improved properties due to the rubber aggregates are desirable and when the corresponding demerits of the rubber aggregates don’t affect the use of the structure. To understand the extent of the capability of this composite construction material further study has to be done to achieve a standard for the mix design of this relativity unexplored technology...|$|R
