We present solutions for three problems. First we show that a form of piecewise linear segmentation allows strong compression of AIS data without much loss of important information. Second, we show that similarities between movements can well be measured using a form of edit-distance. These similarities are then used to predict properties of vessels and to discover clusters of vessel movement. Finally we show how knowledge that is represented in an ontology can be used in knowledge-intensive similarity which produces better results than using only movement data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of small UAVs as {{communication}} relay nodes for expanding communications links and improving communication quality, primarily for a fleet of ground or navy vessels. An airborne relay in ground/maritime space can effectively connect to units operating over the horizon, beyond normal communication range, or under limited satellite communication environments. For efficient UAV communication relay, this paper firstly deals with the UAV deployment for stationary communication nodes, which finds the fixed optimal location of UAVs to improve the connectivity of a wireless network. Then, considering <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> and constraints of the fixed-wing UAV in a dynamic environment, this paper proposes a decentralised nonlinear model predictive trajectory planning strategy. By exploiting motion estimates of vessels and states of UAVs, the trajectory planning algorithm finds a control input sequence over a certain time horizon, which optimises network connectivity. Numerical simulations are performed with different number of UAVs for both stationary and manoeuvring naval vessels to verify the feasibility and benefit of the proposed approach. © IFAC...|$|E
40|$|Human {{transport}} hubs, such as shipping ports, {{airports and}} mail centers are important foci for {{the spread of}} non-indigenous species. High relative abundance in a transport hub has been proposed as a correlate of invasion success, since abundant species are thought more likely to colonize vectors and to be transported more frequently. We here evaluate {{the relative importance of}} vector characteristics and local source assemblages in determining the pool of species that is transported by hull fouling on recreational boats. We compared the resident fouling communities of three recreational boat harbors in Australia with the assemblages on the hulls of boats that travel between them. We used data on the recent travel and maintenance history of the boats to evaluate correlates of transport probability and the potential for intra-coastal spread of fouling organisms. Invertebrate assemblages on heavily fouled vessels reflected the composition of biotic assemblages within the marina in which they were moored, but by itself, relative abundance in the source port was not a reliable predictor of transport probability. More important was the age of the antifouling paint on the vessels’ hulls, which acted selectively on some groups of organisms. <b>Movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> were characterized by “fidelity” (vessels remaining close to homeport) interspersed with “promiscuity” (vessels traveling to a diverse pool of destinations).

40|$|Malgorzata Swiatkowska-Freund, Krzysztof Preis Department of Obstetrics, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland Abstract: Uterine cervix {{is a part}} of {{the uterus}} {{responsible}} for maintaining pregnancy till term. As long as the cervix remains long and firm and its internal orifice (os) is closed, it can withstand enlargement of the uterine contents and resultant growing pressure. Mechanical properties of the cervix change during pregnancy; the cervix ripens prior to delivery, then effaces and dilates with contractions of the uterus. Ripening of the cervix can be assessed using the Bishop score and ultrasonographically determined length of the cervical canal and internal os. Consistency is one of the cervical properties that change during the course of the maturation process. Until recently, cervical consistency has been assessed only manually, but in 2007, the first report on elastographic imaging of the cervix during pregnancy has been published. Elastography presents the ability of a tissue to deform under pressure. The softer the tissue, the easier it changes its shape. Different methods of elastography are used – static, when tissue displacement in response to manual compression or physiological <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> is measured, or dynamic, when the speed of shear wave propagation is determined. Irrespective of the method, elastography provides information on the internal os stiffness; this parameter, impossible for manual assessment, was shown to correlate with pregnancy outcome and is a strong predictor of preterm delivery or successful labor induction. Although elastography seems to be a highly promising diagnostic option, still no consensus has been reached regarding an optimal method for uterine cervix assessment, and virtually all previous studies of various elastographic methods produced highly satisfactory results. Future studies need to identify the most promising and objective elastographic method which may serve as a novel tool for pregnancy management, preventing adverse events, such as preterm delivery and unsuccessful labor induction.

40|$|Much of the {{existing}} literature on fisheries bycatch {{has focused on the}} technological aspects of hycatch control. By contrast, there has been precious little consideration of the role of incentives in fostering or hindering bycatch avoidance and even less thought to the incentive structures found in many real-world fisheries. This thesis addresses this gap by developing analytical and empirical models for a particular case study: the flatfish fisheries of the Eastern Bering Sea. These fisheries are managed under a system of multiple common pool quotas on bycatch and target species enforced by quota-triggered closures. We develop a game theoretic model to explain how this system fosters suboptimal bycatch avoidance behavior due to fishermen's inability to fully capture the benefits of bycatch avoidance. We derive the bycatch penalty that aligns private incentives with the rent-maximizing solution and find, surprisingly, that this penalty must increase with improvements in the bycatch efficiency of the harvesting technology. We then develop an empirical discrete choice model of fishing location choice at a fine level of spatial and temporal resolution in order to reveal the implicit cost of bycatch to fishermen. We uncover substantial avoidance in the waning moments of the season but little otherwise. This avoidance is driven by a number of theoretically important factors on the fishing grounds. Even at its greatest, the implicit cost attached to bycatch is well below its value to the entire fleet. We also find substantial evidence that the common property quota system fosters excessive inertia in the <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> over the fishing grounds. Finally, we combine several modeling approaches to weigh the success of a voluntary program of information sharing and hycatch avoidance. The presence of data {{both before and after the}} program's inception and the initial nonparticipation of one cohort of vessels make our problem amenable to several variants of the difference-in-differences approach. Ultimately we find no basis for a positive impact of the voluntary program upon either bycatch outcomes or the implicit cost of bycatch to participating fishermen. We close by considering a number of hypotheses for the apparent failure of the cooperative program...|$|E
