5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead <b>Monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{management}} and conservation of the world’s oceans requires effective <b>monitoring,</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> reporting. Despite the growing {{political and social}} imperative for these activities, there are some persistent and emerging challenges that marine practitioners face in undertaking these activities. In 2015, {{a diverse group of}} marine practitioners came together to discuss the emerging challenges associated with marine <b>monitoring,</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> reporting, and potential solutions to address these challenges. Three emerging challenges were identified: (1) the need to incorporate environmental, social and economic dimensions in <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> reporting; (2) the implications of big data, creating challenges in data {{management and}} interpretation; and, (3) dealing with uncertainty throughout <b>monitoring,</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> reporting activities. We point to key solutions to address these challenges across <b>monitoring,</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> reporting activities: 1) integrating models into marine management systems to help understand, interpret, and manage the environmental and socio-economic dimensions of uncertain and complex marine systems; 2) utilising big data sources and new technologies to collect, process, store, and analyse data; and 3) applying approaches to evaluate, account for, and report on the multiple sources and types of uncertainty. These solutions point towards a potential for a new wave of evidence-based marine management, through more innovative <b>monitoring,</b> rigorous <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> transparent reporting. Effective collaboration and institutional support across the science–management–policy interface will be crucial to deal with emerging challenges, and implement the tools and approaches embedded within these solutions. </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{promotion}} and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise {{awareness about the}} benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavior change of the population. For this to work effectively, <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> are necessary. One example for handwashing promotion in schools is the “Three Star Approach” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements. When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars. Building hand washing stations can be a part of handwashing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.|$|E

40|$|AWT IMAGE Background and Objective: Academic {{procrastination}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} phenomena among students that can affect classroom management in different ways [...] This study aimed to investigate the relationship between classroom management and academic procrastination in graduate students at University of Sistan and Baluchistan. Materials and Methods: This study is descriptive-correlational (regression). The study population was all graduate students of the University of Sistan and Baluchestan {{in the first half of}} the academic year 2015 - 2016. By using stratified convenience sampling method, 328 students were selected and studied through applying two questionnaires of class management that were made by researchers and Savari’s academic procrastination questionnaire. To analyze the data, Pearson correlation coefficient, simultaneous multiple regression analysis, and SPSS 21 software were used. Results: Mean scores were as follows: designing and organizing (3. 49 ± 0. 452), leadership (3. 58 ± 0. 422), <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> control (3. 42 ± 0. 48), evaluation (2. 92 ± 0. 708), classroom management (3. 35 ± 0. 346), academic procrastination (2. 05 ± 1. 169). Correlation coefficients of designing <b>and</b> organizing, leadership, <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> control, <b>evaluation,</b> classroom management with academic procrastination were - 0. 3,- 0. 391,- 0. 414,- 0. 544 and - 0. 637 (p< 0. 01) respectively. Based on the results of regression analysis, class management components showed 41. 5 of the variance of academic procrastination (p< 0. 01). Conclusion The faculty can effectively and efficiently manage their classroom by improving designing <b>and</b> organizing, leadership, <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> control, <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> skills. This may result in reduction of students' academic procrastination.
