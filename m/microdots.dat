25|$|The Greeks of Classical {{times are}} said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale {{transposition}} cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military). Steganography (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair. More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink, <b>microdots,</b> and digital watermarks to conceal information.|$|E

In Fisher's New York hotel room the FBI found four thousand dollars, a hollow ebony block containing a 250-page Russian codebook, a hollow pencil containing encrypted messages on microfilm and a key to a safe-deposit box containing another fifteen thousand dollars in cash. Also discovered were photographs of the Cohens and recognition phrases to establish contact between agents who had never met before.|$|E
5000|$|During {{and after}} World War II, espionage agents used photographically-produced <b>microdots</b> to send {{information}} back and forth. <b>Microdots</b> were typically minute (less than {{the size of}} the period produced by a typewriter). World War II <b>microdots</b> were embedded in the paper and covered with an adhesive, such as collodion. That was reflective and so was detectable by viewing against glancing light. Alternative techniques included inserting <b>microdots</b> into slits cut into the edge of postcards.|$|E

The DNA <b>microdot</b> appears to be the secure modern alternative, exploiting the complexity of DNA in which a coded secret message is hidden.

50|$|An actual <b>microdot</b> {{technique}} {{was used for}} steganographic purposes in Germany between World War I and World War II. It was also later used by many countries to pass messages through insecure postal channels. Later <b>microdot</b> techniques used film with aniline dye, rather than silver halide layers, as this was even harder for counter-espionage agents to find. Professor Zapp from Germany is {{claimed to have been}} the inventor of the technique, and a World War II spy kit for <b>microdot</b> production was sometimes called a Zapp outfit. However, Emanuel Goldberg is also said to have invented the modern technique. Like much in the history of espionage and subversion, there is controversy.|$|R

5000|$|Schultz {{was dropped}} into Ireland on 12 March 1941 {{to make contact}} with IRA members {{sympathetic}} to the German cause and to transmit weather reports back to his handlers in Hamburg. Schultz readily gave up one of his codes to his Irish captors in the hope of diverting attention from his <b>microdots,</b> but a microscope in his luggage raised the suspicions of the authorities and his belongings were handed over to Hayes, who spotted Schultz's codes. In all, 30 pages of operating instructions as well as extensive lists of names and addresses of Nazi sympathisers in the Republic were secreted in random characters in newspaper cuttings that the German intelligence agent was carrying when he was picked up by gardaí in Wexford in 1941. Hayes studied two newspaper cuttings tucked into the spy's pocket book and in a testimonial letter affirming the curative qualities of Aspro, he identified messages, reduced in size 400 times, and secreted within three letter 'o's in the text. On an article about Oxford Pamphlets, he spotted a further four <b>microdots,</b> with three more in an ad for the Green Park Hotel. Within 10 days of Schultz's arrest, Hayes had found and translated the entire contents of his highly sensitive <b>microdots.</b> It would take the FBI a further four months to even identify that such a system of transmitting messages existed. [...] "The Germans were so cocksure that the <b>microdots</b> couldn't be discovered that they didn't even encode them", Schultz said after the war. [...] "They were to be a vital weapon in espionage. Finding them as the Irish intelligence officers did was an act of brilliance." ...|$|E
