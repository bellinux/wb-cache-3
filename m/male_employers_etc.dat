30|$|Differences between <b>male</b> {{and female}} <b>employers</b> and own-account {{professionals}} {{are even more}} striking. In middle and upper income countries, <b>male</b> <b>employers</b> and professionals earn a premium compared to employees, while women pay a penalty. These results suggest that women may be more willing than men to accept a negative compensating earnings differential for self-employment, and that this phenomenon is more pronounced in high income countries.|$|R
5000|$|Statistical {{discrimination}} {{is an economic}} theory of racial or gender inequality based on stereotypes. According to this theory, inequality may exist and persist between demographic groups even when economic agents (consumers, workers, <b>employers,</b> <b>etc.)</b> are rational and non-prejudiced. This type of preferential treatment is labeled [...] "statistical" [...] because stereotypes may {{be based on the}} discriminated group's average behavior.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by <b>male</b> and female <b>employer</b> to the <b>male</b> and female {{employees}} and also male and female employees to <b>male</b> and female <b>employers.</b> The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by both employers and employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by the <b>male</b> and female <b>employer</b> to the <b>male</b> and female employees and male and female employees to <b>male</b> and female <b>employers.</b> The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find {{the most frequently used}} types of request used by both <b>male</b> and female <b>employers</b> and both <b>male</b> and female employees, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that both <b>male</b> and female <b>employers</b> mostly used the same types of request expressions to both male and female employees. However, the writer found various types of request used by both male and female employees to both <b>male</b> and female <b>employers.</b> The result of this research showed that both <b>male</b> and female <b>employers</b> mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, both to their male and female employees. However, both male and female employees used various types of request, both to <b>male</b> and female <b>employer.</b> Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by both <b>male</b> and female <b>employers</b> and both <b>male</b> and female employees...|$|R

40|$|We examine {{behavioral}} {{gender differences}} and gender pairing effects {{in a laboratory}} experiment with face-to-face alternating-offers wage bargaining.

25|$|A general {{economic}} {{idea is that}} if {{sales taxes}} are high enough, people start engaging in widespread tax evading activity (like buying over the Internet, {{pretending to be a}} business, buying at wholesale, buying products through an <b>employer</b> <b>etc.).</b> On the other hand, total VAT rates can rise above 10% without widespread evasion because of the novel collection mechanism. However, because of its particular mechanism of collection, VAT becomes quite easily the target of specific frauds like carousel fraud, which can be very expensive in terms of loss of tax incomes for states.|$|R
5000|$|As blogs {{allow an}} {{individual}} to express his or her views in individual essays {{or as part of}} a wider discussion, it creates a public forum for expressing ideas. Bloggers often choose to use pseudonyms, whether in platforms such as WordPress or in interest-centered sites like Blogster, to protect personal information and allow them more editorial freedom to express ideas that might be unpopular with their family, <b>employers,</b> <b>etc.</b> Use of a pseudonym (and a judicious approach to revealing personal information) can allow a person to protect their [...] "real" [...] identities, but still build a reputation online using the assumed name.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{states have}} their own laws on the subject. Laws {{in the state of}} California, for example, require an {{employer}} to pay its interns working in California or offer the intern academic or college credit for their time and labor. As another example, in the state of New York, for For-Profit companies, the activities of trainees or students cannot provide an immediate advantage to the employer. On the other hand, trainees or students do not receive employee benefits like health and dental insurance, pension or retirement credit, discounted or free goods and services from the <b>employer,</b> <b>etc.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Male</b> <b>employers</b> and {{professional}} own-account workers {{in many developing}} countries enjoy a particularly large earnings premium compared to formal employees, while female employers {{and professional}}s do not. In fact, our estimates suggest that female employers and professionals in low and high income countries pay a statistically significant penalty compared to employees, while in middle income countries estimated penalties are statistically insignificant. These gender differences are consistent with the hypothesis that women are more willing to accept lower wages as compensating earnings differentials for the flexibility of self-employment.|$|R
50|$|The Shattered Chain {{presents}} the Renunciate organization and worldview {{in greater detail}} than previous books in the series. The first free Amazon character that Bradley created, Kyla Raineach in The Planet Savers, was a two-dimensional caricature who ended up rather conventionally {{falling in love with}} her <b>male</b> <b>employer.</b> As the series developed, the Renunciates evolved into a complex experiment in separatist feminism. The Renunciates {{are one of the most}} popular character groups in the Darkover series, resulting in a considerable amount fan fiction, some of which ended up in the 12 short story anthologies.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} distantly {{supervised}} system for extracting the temporal bounds of fluents (relations which only hold during certain times, such as attends school). Unlike previous pipelined approaches, our model does not assume independence between each fluent or even between named entities with known connections (parent, spouse, <b>employer,</b> <b>etc.).</b> Instead, we model what makes timelines of fluents consistent by learning cross-fluent constraints, potentially spanning entities as well. For example, our model learns {{that someone is}} unlikely to start a job at age two or to marry someone who hasn’t been born yet. Our system achieves a 36 % error reduction over a pipelined baseline. ...|$|R

50|$|Recently, {{professor}} Nick Drydakis (Anglia Ruskin University) examined {{religious affiliation}} and employment bias in Athens, by implementing an experimental field study. Labor market outcomes (occupation access, entry wage, and wait time for call back) were assessed for three religious minorities (Pentecostal, evangelical, and Jehovah's Witnesses). Results indicate that religious minorities experience employment bias Moreover, religious minorities face greater constraints on occupational access in more prestigious jobs compared to less prestigious jobs. Occupational access and entry wage bias is highest for religious minority women. In all cases, Jehovah's Witnesses face the greatest bias; female employers offered significantly lower entry wages to Jehovah's Witnesses than <b>male</b> <b>employers.</b>|$|R

In the first chapter is briefly explained the general concepts such as tax residence, the monthly wage taxation, permanent establishment {{and the difference between}} the economic and legal <b>employer,</b> <b>etc.</b> The next chapter deals with double taxation treaties with a focus on article No. 15. Next section focuses on the general description of the employment structures, which include - local employment contract, posting and lease of personnel. The greatest attention is paid to international lease of personnel, where I focus on defining the legal framework, taxation and social insurance. All the problems are shown on a practical example...|$|R
30|$|Gender {{differences}} are particularly striking for employers and professionals. Statistically significant measured earnings premiums for <b>male</b> <b>employers</b> and professionals {{are consistent with}} the hypothesis that men in these categories have a comparative advantage in self-employment, or are being compensated for the higher costs and risks of self-employment compared to wage and salaried employees. The sizeable average penalties for female employers and professionals suggests that men and women make different calculations when deciding to become and remain employers or professional workers. One possibility is that because women are primarily responsible for unpaid domestic work, women are more willing to accept lower earnings as employers and professional own-account workers as compensation for flexibility in hours and location of work.|$|R

5000|$|Beth is [...] "Country girl" [...] at heart, {{she went}} on a journey during her time in the serial.

She was portrayed as a virgin desperate to shed her innocence after Annalise Hartman's (Kimberley Davies) harsh words. She came across as over keen and desperate, on different occasions asked Brad Willis to sleep with her, later begging him to stay with her. She also didn't fit the female stereo-type and worked in the construction business, in the show she faced prejudice from <b>male</b> <b>employer</b> who would not offer her an apprenticeship.|$|R
5000|$|She wrote a book, Sexual Shakedown: The Sexual Harassment of Women on the Job, {{published}} by McGraw-Hill in 1978 {{and in a}} paperback version by Warner Books in 1980. In it she traced the history of sexual harassment as a longstanding issue and gave contemporary examples, such as help-wanted advertisements implying that acceptance of sexual interaction {{was part of the}} job description. The book established sexual harassment as an important topic on the feminist agenda. The Christian Science Monitor said the book was [...] "an overdue alert to the sexual harassment of working women by <b>male</b> <b>employers</b> which starkly reveals the emotional and physical degradations inflicted on women in the exploitive politics of power at their most base." ...|$|R
30|$|The issue arises {{that the}} {{regulations}} governing business practices, standards, and employee classification are outdated relics {{of the industrial}} era where the standards were meant to protect workers from factory exploitation [37]. Today, many workers work remotely as free agents and up to 90 % of workers in the USA want more freedom in their choice of employment [37]. One estimate states that up to one third of American workers are in some way free agents (whether part-time or full-time, primary or secondary, etc.) [37]. Identifying how big this group is can be challenging as different definitions encompass full-time and part-time free agents, 1099 workers, freelancers, <b>employers,</b> <b>etc.</b> This diversity of types of free agents makes it cumbersome to draft new laws regulating businesses that employ free agents.|$|R

But for Fidel, he doesn't want any help, as he has insisted that he purposely killed his employer, however Vega finds this hard to believe as she investigates his past of a loving boy-next-door type who has a loving family and that his profile doesn't fit {{the picture of a}} killer. Sister Lourdes, a Filipino nun who is based in Dubai and visits Fidel regularly in jail also wants to know the truth.|$|R
30|$|Following the {{defining}} of the construct {{is the most}} critical issue of mental ability scale construction, i.e., how to describe it? This would involve the style and scheme of description. In this project, we decided to follow the “can-do” statement style, the approach adopted {{in the design of}} the CEFR, since “can-do” descriptions can help to “establish a link between real world tasks and the language points and other competences that are necessary to perform those tasks effectively” (North 2014, p. 11), thus giving teachers and learners the learning objectives, and also giving other stakeholders (testers, policy makers, <b>employers,</b> <b>etc.)</b> the convenience to use the descriptors directly. “Can-do” statements should positively describe what kind of language activity the user can accomplish and how good the performance is. As the scheme of description determines the scale structure and the arrangement of descriptors, it should reflect the predefined listening construct.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its own aggregation and profiling tools, the government is able to access information from third parties — for example, banks, credit companies or <b>employers,</b> <b>etc.</b> — by requesting access informally, by compelling access {{through the use of}} subpoenas or other procedures, or by purchasing data from commercial data aggregators or data brokers. The United States has spent $370 million on its 43 planned fusion centers, which are national network of surveillance centers that are located in over 30 states. The centers will collect and analyze vast amounts of data on U.S. citizens. It will get this data by consolidating personal information from sources such as state driver's licensing agencies, hospital records, criminal records, school records, credit bureaus, banks, etc. -- and placing this information in a centralized database that can be accessed from all of the centers, as well as other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.|$|R
30|$|On average, {{across all}} {{countries}} in the sample, employers and own-account professional workers earn a premium compared to employees, although there are important differences across countries and between men and women. Gender differences are particularly strong when examining earnings premiums for employers and professionals. Overall, <b>male</b> <b>employers</b> and professionals earn an 18 percent premium compared with all employees, while women face a penalty of roughly the same magnitude. In terms of regional differences, earnings premiums for employers and professionals are largest for men in middle income Latin American countries. On the other hand, women employers and professionals do not earn a statistically significant premium compared to employees in any region of the world. In addition, neither <b>male</b> nor female <b>employers</b> and professionals earn premiums in either high income or developing countries in Europe and Central Asia. Conditions appear to be favorable for employers and professionals in Latin America, as they are more numerous and earn greater premiums versus formal employees. In contrast, conditions seem to be less favorable for the same group in Europe and Central Asia, where they are fewer and do not earn premiums vs. formal employees.|$|R
