5|$|On September 15, 1776, British forces under Howe {{landed on}} Manhattan. The next morning, some British troops marched toward Harlem, {{where the two}} armies clashed again, while others <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> the city.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius soon {{experienced}} a new event, the Muslim conquests. Emerging from the Arabian Peninsula, the Muslims quickly conquered the Sasanian Empire. In 634 the Muslims <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Roman Syria, defeating Heraclius's brother Theodore. Within {{a short period}} of time, the Arabs conquered Mesopotamia, Armenia and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Armatus, as magister militum, {{was sent}} with all {{available}} forces in Asia Minor, {{to oppose the}} advancing army of the Isaurians, but secret messages from Zeno, who promised {{to give him the}} title of magister militum for life and to confer the rank of Caesar on his son, induced him to betray his master. Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Isauria by another way. This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth and Mary {{were soon}} sent to Novigrad Castle, with John of Palisna as their new jailer. Margaret insisted that Elizabeth {{be put to}} death. She was tried and, after the Christmas {{adjournment}} of the proceedings, found guilty of inciting Charles' murder. Sigismund <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Slavonia in January 1387, with the intention to reach Novigrad and rescue the queens. Towards the middle of January, when news of Sigismund's approach reached Novigrad, Elizabeth was strangled by guards before Mary's eyes.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the chaos in Sparta, which effectively left Athens isolated, Darius decided to launch an amphibious expedition to finally punish Athens and Eretria. An army was assembled in Susa, and <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Cilicia, where a fleet had been gathered. Command of the expedition was given to Datis the Mede and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes.|$|E
5|$|A large {{army was}} {{assembled}} slowly and <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Scotland. Not only was no pitched battle ever attempted, but the king {{did not try}} and besiege Scotland's capital, Edinburgh. Henry's army left {{at the end of}} the summer after only a brief stay, mostly camped near Leith (near Edinburgh) where it could maintain contact with its supply fleet. The campaign ultimately accomplished little except to further deplete the king's coffers, and is historically notable only for being the last one led by an English king on Scottish soil.|$|E

5|$|Albanian {{intelligence}} groups informed Skanderbeg—the main {{leader of}} the revolt—that a large Ottoman army was preparing to march into Albania, the number of which was reported by some as being as high as 170,000. This army, however, {{is likely to have}} contained no more than 80,000 soldiers. Nevertheless, Murad marched his army into Monastir. Skanderbeg urgently called for material aid Venice. The answer, however, was negative. Instead, the only aid received came from the Neapolitans and the Ragusans. Nonetheless, Murad soon <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Ohrid and Black Drin valley, traveling near Svetigrad. In response, Skanderbeg strengthened the garrisons of Krujë, Stellushi, Svetigrad, and Berat by ordering the populations around these fortress to take up arms.|$|E
5|$|Arab sources {{indicate}} that at about his time, the Sogdian princes called upon the Western Turks or the Turgesh for help against the Arabs, although the chronology and veracity of these accounts {{is open to}} question. At any rate, {{over the next two}} years Qutayba engaged in an effort to push the Caliphate's borders further and gain control of the Jaxartes valley. A large force, supported by some 20,000 Transoxianian levies, <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> the valley in early 713. The native levies were dispatched against Shash, which was reportedly taken, while Qutayba with the Arabs marched in the direction of Khujand and Ferghana. Little is known of these expeditions, although successful battles are recorded before Khujand and at Minak in Ushrusana, and the dispatch of an Arab embassy to the Chinese court is verified by Chinese sources. Al-Tabari reports that Qutayba <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Chinese-held territory up to Kashgar, but this claim is dismissed by modern scholars. In 714, Qutayba renewed his expeditions along the Jaxartes, probably with Shash as his base, but his campaign was cut short upon receiving the news of the death of al-Hajjaj. Unsure of his position now that his patron was gone, he disbanded the army and returned to Merv.|$|E
5|$|Around 212AD, {{soon after}} Vologases VI of Parthia (r. c.208–222AD) took the throne, his brother Artabanus V of Parthia (d.224AD) rebelled {{against him and}} gained control over a greater part of the empire. Meanwhile, the Roman emperor Caracalla (r.211–217AD) deposed the kings of Osroene and Armenia to make them Roman provinces once more. He <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of Artabanus' daughters, but—because the {{marriage}} was not allowed—made war on Parthia and conquered Arbil east of the Tigris river.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{successful}} Bulgarian actions the Byzantines were no longer capable of taking the city with a direct assault. They also could not exhaust the defenders with hunger because, after their supplies were cut, the Byzantines themselves had to deal with that problem. In addition, an army led by Samuil <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> the mountains at the Byzantines' rear. In the meantime, instead of securing the way for retreat, Leon Melissenos pulled back to Plovdiv. That action was an additional reason for Basil II to lift the siege. The commander of the Western armies, Kontostephanos, persuaded him that Melissenos had set off to Constantinople to take his throne.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington and <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26. Washington's army unsuccessfully {{attacked}} the British garrison at Germantown in early October. Meanwhile, to the north, Burgoyne {{was beyond the}} reach of help from Howe, trapped and forced to surrender after the Battles of Saratoga. This was a major turning point militarily and diplomatically—the French responded to Burgoyne's defeat by entering the war, allying with America and expanding the Revolutionary War into a major worldwide affair.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} campaigns of World War II, Germany's light tanks, {{including}} the PanzerI, formed {{the bulk of}} its armoured strength. In March1938, the German Army <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Austria, experiencing a mechanical breakdown rate of up to thirty percent. However, the experience revealed to Guderian several faults within the German Panzerkorps and he subsequently improved logistical support. In October 1938, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland, and {{the remainder of the}} country in March 1939. The capture of Czechoslovakia allowed several Czech tank designs, such as the Panzer 38(t), and their subsequent variants and production, to be incorporated into the German Army's strength. It also prepared German forces for the invasion of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Minot's Ledge Lighthouse project in 1860, the secession of South Carolina {{and the beginning of the}} American Civil War allowed Alexander to put his skills to military use for the first time since the Mexican-American War. On May 24, 1861, he was among several hundred engineers who <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Virginia to begin building fortifications to protect Washington, D.C., which was located on the border between the Union state of Maryland and the Confederate state of Virginia. In July 1861, the force that had <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> northern Virginia on May 24 found itself opposed by a large Confederate States Army force that had marched up from the south. In the haste to meet the Confederates in battle, Alexander found himself serving as an infantry officer and was assigned to the 1st Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia, under the command of Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler. It was a situation common to the young Union Army, which found itself short of experienced officers. Many engineer officers building defenses south of Washington were assigned to a regiment or division during the First Battle of Bull Run. Alexander received a brevet to major in the regular army for his service during the battle.|$|E
5|$|General de Kalb's forces took {{almost a}} month to descend the Chesapeake Bay and did not arrive in Petersburg, Virginia {{until the middle of}} June, {{almost a month}} after Lincoln had {{surrendered}} his army. The Continental Congress appointed Horatio Gates to command the Southern Department. He assumed command on July 25, 1780 and immediately <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> South Carolina with the intent of engaging the British Army, now under the command of Charles Cornwallis. Williams served as Deputy Adjutant-General under Gates.|$|E
5|$|In 516 BCE, Darius {{embarked}} on a campaign to Central Asia, Aria and Bactria and then <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Afghanistan to Taxila in modern-day Pakistan. Darius spent the winter of 516–515 BCE in Gandhara, preparing to conquer the Indus Valley. Darius conquered the lands surrounding the Indus River in 515 BCE. Darius I controlled the Indus Valley from Gandhara to modern Karachi and appointed the Greek Scylax of Caryanda to explore the Indian Ocean {{from the mouth of}} the Indus to Suez. Darius then marched through the Bolan Pass and returned through Arachosia and Drangiana back to Persia.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to volunteers, Jefferson also {{arranged for a}} regiment of 200 regular Continental soldiers under Colonel John Gibson to accompany Clark. Longstanding tensions between Continental Army officers and the militia made such cooperation problematic, however. Colonel Daniel Brodhead, the Continental Army commander at Fort Pitt, refused to detach men for Clark's campaign because he was staging his own expedition against the Delaware Indians, who had recently entered {{the war against the}} Americans. Brodhead <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> the Ohio Country and destroyed the Delaware Indian capital of Coshocton in April 1781. This resulted in the Delaware becoming more determined enemies, and deprived Clark of badly needed men and supplies for the Detroit campaign.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, {{the second}} phase of the {{operation}} started when several hundred rebels <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Saigon dressed all in white, armed with only sticks and spears. Before the march, they had ingested potions that purportedly made them invisible. However, the French military were able to capture more than 80 of the supposedly invisible rebels during demonstrations against French rule. The police raided the homes of several people who were known to be involved with Long's plot, resulting in more arrests. They captured most of Long's main supporters, rendering the organisation impotent. However, Tri managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, the Texians {{watched from}} the walls as {{approximately}} 1,000 Mexicans <b>marched</b> <b>into</b> Béxar. The Mexican army celebrated loudly throughout the afternoon, both in honor of their reinforcements and at the news that troops under General José de Urrea had soundly defeated Texian Colonel Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27. Most of the Texians in the Alamo believed that Sesma had been leading the Mexican forces during the siege, and they mistakenly attributed the celebration {{to the arrival of}} Santa Anna. The reinforcements brought the number of Mexican soldiers in Béxar to almost 3,100.|$|E
