50|$|Beyond driver configuration, HP UPD also employs <b>managed</b> <b>printer</b> lists (MPLs) {{and managed}} print {{policies}} (MPP) to control access to devices and capabilities. These technologies are used with HP UPD in dynamic mode. If MPLs are used, then searching for devices is unnecessary. Users {{are presented with}} a predefined list of devices from which to choose. MPLs are XML files that can be created manually, with the HP MPA utility, or exported from HP Web Jetadmin. When the HP UPD is activated, it begins by searching the network for the MPL file as shown in Figure 6. MPPs are used to control which users have access to device features like color, duplex, etc. By default, HP UPD assumes that the HP MPA is installed on a server named managed-print. As a result, HP UPD searches the network for this server to find HP Managed Print Policies or HP <b>Managed</b> <b>Printer</b> Lists.|$|R

50|$|In dynamic mode, {{searching for}} devices is {{accomplished}} using the mDNS discovery protocol (aka Bonjour). The mDNS protocol performs satisfactorily for devices residing {{on the same}} subnet only. Users will need to enter IP addresses for remote devices unless they have been previously discovered or are available on a <b>managed</b> <b>printers</b> list. Whether discovered, entered, or chosen, the HP universal printing dialog box submits SNMP requests to the target deviceâ€™s IP address.|$|R

It {{provides an overview of}} the now available tools for management and monitoring the status of network printers from different manufacturers. Then it describes options with which the status and other information for the printer to receive can be checked. A new printers monitoring system was created using the acquiered knowledge about printers monitoring. The created system is able to <b>manage</b> <b>printer</b> supplies stored in local warehouse and calculate the estimated consumpstion for the selected period.

50|$|The {{complexity}} of printing a character as {{a sequence of}} columns of dots is <b>managed</b> by the <b>printer</b> electronics, which receives character encodings from the computer one at a time, with the bits transferred serially or in parallel.

Controller boards can drive various sensors such as paper low, paper out, door open and so on, and they are available {{with a variety of}} interfaces, such as RS-232, parallel, USB and wireless.

30|$|Multi-jet-modeling (MJM) {{is another}} method that acrylic photopolymer, the {{material}} of printing model, is jetted from the print head like a inkjet printer, and then its layers are added one by one. It enables high precision and excellent curve processing, and has an advantage of controlling the transparency since the material is acrylic resin (Noh and Lee 2016; Hara 2015). Stereo lithography apparatus (SLA) is the method that a model is made by shooting UV laser into the water tank containing photopolymer resin of epoxy series (polymer liquid material changing into solid when laser is shot), and then hardening each layer. A printer has a water tank containing photopolymer resin. Since this method enables to form a model {{by the use of}} laser, so the quality of printed object is excellent and the printing speed is fast. However, it has shortcomings of difficulty to <b>manage</b> the <b>printer</b> due to the use of liquid material makes, and of expensive photopolymer resin (Noh and Lee 2016; Hyun 2015).|$|R
40|$|Maintaining the {{printing}} configuration files {{for a large}} site (400 machines, 60 public printers, 40 private printers, 30 print spoolers) can be a major job. At RPI, we developed a system that will automatically generate the printer configuration file for any machine, depending on what printers are driven by that machine. It also allows us to only have a printer appear only on a subset of machines, rather than on all machines. This paper describes the design and deployment of the system. We use a relational database to <b>manage</b> the <b>printer</b> information, printer type attributes, host grouping and to track hosts using the system. All sources and related information are available for anonymous FTP. Motivation One of the first parts of the Simon project 1, was a program called printmaster, which was used to generate the /etc/printcap file for any of our workstations or print servers. 2 While it did have attribute matching for printer types, it did not support host groups, and in [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Charles' {{paternal}} grandfather Daniel Forster, {{an inspector}} of weights, {{was born in}} Otley, West Yorkshire in 1776, and died in 1844. He was buried on 30 December 1844 in the same town. His wife Bella, a school mistress and Charles' grandmother, was baptised in Otley in 1796, and died aged 78 in 1866 in Otley. Their seventh child was Henry Highmore Forster, Charles' father, who was born on 14 October 1821 in Otley and baptised on 11 August 1823 at All Saints Church, Otley. In 1841 {{at the age of}} 15, Henry was a grocer, as was his older brother. Henry died in Burmantofts aged 48 on 14 March 1869. Charles' mother was Martha Ann Farrar, who was born in 1825 in Halifax, West Yorkshire and died in Guisborough in North Yorkshire in 1897 aged 72. Henry and Martha married in 1846 in Halifax and had six children, of which Charles was the eldest. One of Charles' brothers was Edward Eustace Forster (died 1916), chairman and <b>managing</b> director of <b>printers</b> Knight & Forster Ltd., of Leeds.|$|R
40|$|Current inkjet {{printing}} systems {{are based on}} a RISC+ASIC architecture for image processing and printer control. Time critical control function such as print masking is implemented on an ASIC and computationally intensive tasks such as image processing and motion control are executed on a RISC processor. This paper considers the development of a DSP based media handling and cartridge motion control system for an inkjet printer, in which a single high performance DSP is desired to execute the printer control as well as image processing tasks and print with the novel {{inkjet printing}} approach of Dynamic Print Mode Control (DPMC). A motion control architecture is implemented to maximize the use of DSP processing power and system memory while taking into account the latencies of motion controllers in printing a swath. The architecture utilizes various real-time services of DSP/BIOS to effectively <b>manage</b> DSP and <b>printer</b> engine while increasing printer throughput and it can be easily extended to include image processing activities on the DSP. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed motion control architecture and the control scheme for cartridge motion control...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an innovative {{approach to the}} spectral-based characterization of ink-jet color printers. Our objective was to design a color separation procedure based on a spectral model of the <b>printer,</b> <b>managed</b> here as an RGB device. The printer was a four-ink device, and we assumed that the driver always replaced the black completely when converting from RGB to CMYK amounts of ink. The color separation procedure, which estimates the RGB values given a reflectance spectrum, {{is based on the}} inversion of the Yule-Nielsen modified Neugebauer model. To improve the performance of the direct Neugebauer model in computing the reflectance spectrum of the print, given the amounts of ink, we designed a method that exploits the results of the numerical inversion of the Neugebauer model to estimate a correction of the amount of black ink computed on RGB values. This correction can be considered a first step in optimization of the Neugebauer model; it accounts for ink-trapping and the lack of knowledge on how the black is actually replaced by the printer driver...|$|R
