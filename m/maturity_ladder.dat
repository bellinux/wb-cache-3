40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} twofold: first, to analyze the treatment of non-maturity deposits within the regulatory framework provided by the Basel Committe to measure the interest rate risk in the banking book; second, consistently with the criteria defined by the supervisory authority, to develop a model for distributing non-maturity deposits across the regulatory <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder</b> that accounts for their actual behavior in terms of both price sensitivity to changes in market rates and volume stability over time...|$|E
40|$|In today’s dynamic {{business}} environment, {{organizations are}} adapting asset management strategies {{as a means}} of gaining a competitive advantage. This is achieved largely through implementing effective maintenance program(s). However implementing such program(s) is often not straightforward due to lack of a structured decision making framework. This article proposes a generic asset maintenance maturity model as a structured guide to maintenance process maturity. The proposed model aims at assessing the maintenance decision making capabilities within organizations. A weighted maintenance performance assessment score is proposed that facilitates performance measurement and benchmarking. Based on the weighted score, organizations are situated on a five-level maintenance <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder.</b> Moreover, the proposed approach incorporates risk assessment methodologies {{as a means of}} directing improvement actions towards maintenance maturity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This work {{researched}} ad hoc {{decision making}} practices in multiple project environments. The {{aim of this}} research was to analyze the organisational motives and organisational structure that influences ad hoc behaviors and practices and explored the factors facilitating or impeding the practice. The methodology comprised both quantitative and qualitative data collection through a global web-based questionnaire survey and face-to-face semi-structured interviews. The study found that there are links between ad hoc, flexibility and the decision making process that influence organisational performance both positively and negatively. Flexibility was also found to be a key tool in leadership traits. The findings also indicate that successful organisations are efficient in management processes, implementing leadership and resource training programmes, have clear vision and are climbing the <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder.</b> Furthermore the results influenced the development of an agile, flexible decision making buffer model...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} writing on {{software}} process improvement (SPI), {{it was suggested}} that the group of people responsible for designing and implementing the SPI system should apply the principles of SPI on themselves, making sure their own processes were no less mature than the processes they were trying to improve. Looking at maturity level theory from various literature sources, it seems reasonable to say that the highest maturity level for people running SPI programs corresponds to the process of doing scientific research. We look at action research as a possible model for implementing SPI through a research driven climbing of the <b>maturity</b> level <b>ladder,</b> asking what sort of constraints the SPI theory puts on the design of the action research, and what sort of contributions can be made to SPI theory by applying action research. These two opposite questions are investigated by looking at a longitudinal case study of a SPI project that has gradually evolved into an action research project. The case illustrates a situation where it is unclear to which extent the practical problems need new theoretical insights to be solved, and also to which degree some theoretically chosen research problems are really relevant for solving the practical issues at hand. Based on this lack of convergence between relevant practical problem...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} in organisational sociology {{has focused on}} how organisational forms are evolved, transformed and sustained. This paper continues in this line of enquiry and tests the role of IT in organisational transformation. The transformation of an organisation can be gauged by observing key organisational attributes {{that are likely to}} feature in transformed (new) organisations. Following a review of previous literature, three major factors, that is, business strategy, IT strategy, IT strategic alignment were hypothesised to influence the dimensions of new organisational forms (NOFs). To test this model, data were collected from a survey of 312 Australian businesses. Structural equation modelling was employed to test the research hypotheses. Results from this study uncovered that the level of strategic alignment was significantly associated with the attributes of NOFs. This implies that organisations that have progressed well in the IT-business alignment <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder</b> are likely to change their structure and control mechanisms. This study concludes by highlighting some of the theoretical and practical implications of the findings...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{research on}} project maturity in organisations. The {{purpose is to}} {{develop an understanding of}} what project maturity is and to investigate the level of project maturity in organisations today. The hypothesis is that project maturity develops through a <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder</b> where the ladder steps are proposed to be project management, program management, and portfolio management. Maturity itself is measured along three dimensions. They are knowledge (capability to carry out different tasks), attitudes (willingness to carry them out), and actions (actually doing them). The different dimensions of maturity are further divided into sub-concepts, which should provide a good understanding of the project maturity of an organisation. A questionnaire is developed based on a preliminary understanding of project maturity, and an initial survey has been conducted. The survey gives some support to the ladder construct, and shows that attitudes and knowledge are stronger than the actions taken. Further work on the questionnaire and surveys are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Because {{publicly}} available measures of deposit runoff risk are scarce, regulators’ models to measure {{interest rate risk}} in the banking book are based on very coarse assumptions about the allotment of non-maturity deposits within the regulatory <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder.</b> Using well-established statistical approaches, we address this issue by developing a methodology that considers deposits’ actual behavior {{in terms of both}} price sensitivity to changes in market rates and volume stability over time. Our model extends the current knowledge of public measures of interest rate risk and can be applied to {{publicly available}} data in a manner replicable by those outside of banking institutions. We find that the use of different allotment criteria affects not only the size of the risk indicator but also the nature of banks’ risk exposure, determining the risk inversion phenomenon—that is, banks exposed to an increase in interest rates can experience a reduction in their equity economic value if interest rates decrease. Overall, our results confirm the importance of accurate non-maturity deposits modeling for estimating interest rate risk in the banking book...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of demand loans and deposits {{is crucial in}} measuring a bank’s actual exposure to the interest rate risk in the banking book. The repricing gap model, the most popular approach to measure this kind of risk, {{is based on a}} maturity/repricing schedule, according to which interest-sensitive assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions are allotted into different time bands, based on their maturity or time remaining to their next repricing. Due to the possibility for the depositor (borrower) to withdraw (drain) the money without any notice, these accounts should be allotted in the “at sight” time band. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that bank interest rates are characterized by a sluggish and sometimes asymmetric reaction to changes in the market rates. To overcome this limit, we first develop an error correction model to study the interest rate pass-through for the Italian banking system, with specific regard to the retail bank interest rates on the sight deposits and on the overdraft accounts; then, we translate the response dynamic of the interest rates of these two items into coefficients that we use to allot them in the regulatory <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder,</b> thus making the distribution process much more realistic...|$|E
40|$|BIM {{implementation}} is a {{major change}} management task, involving diversity of risk areas. The identification of the challenges and barriers is therefore an imperative precondition of this change process. This paper aims to diagnose UK’s construction industry to develop a clear understanding about BIM adoption and to form an imperative step of consolidating collective movements towards wider BIM implementation and to provide strategies and recommendations for the UK construction industry for BIM implementation. Through comprehensive literature review, the paper initially establishes BIM maturity concept, which paves {{the way for the}} analysis via qualitative and quantitative methods: interviews are carried out with high profile organisations in Finland to gauge the best practice before combining the results with the analysis of survey questionnaire amongst the major contractors in the UK. The results are established {{in the form of the}} initial phase of a sound BIM implementation guidance at strategic and operational levels. The findings suggest three structured patterns to systematically tackle technology, process and people issues in BIM implementation. These are i) organisational culture, ii) education and training, and iii) information management. The outcome is expressed as a roadmap for the implementation of BIM in the UK entailing issues that require consideration for organisations to progress on the BIM <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder.</b> It paves a solid foundation for organisations to make informed decisions in BIM adaptation within the overall organisation structure. This research consolidates collective movements towards wider implementation of BIM in the UK and forms a base for developing a sound BIM strategy and guidance...|$|E
40|$|The {{changing}} {{banking environment}} {{has led to}} financial innovation {{which has led to}} the development of new financial instruments, some of which are complicated and highly volatile; thus, exposing banks to new or higher risks. This exposure to new risks does not only affect individual banks but the whole banking system (Schoenmaker, 1996). With internationalization, the possibility of contagion has risen as seen from the 1997 Asian financial crisis (Greuning & Bratanovic, 2000). The change in banks' ways of doing business has amplified the necessity for risk management. This research assesses the extent to which South African banks practice risk management techniques in dealing with different types of risks. In this research, questionnaires are used to assess risk management approaches adopted by four South African banks; Standard Bank of South Africa (SBSA), First National Bank (FNB), Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (ABSA) and Nedbank Limited. Furthermore, the research uses accounting ratios and other risk management quantitative techniques such as Gap analysis and <b>Maturity</b> <b>ladder</b> to analyze credit risk, market risk and operational risk. The research found that the banks chosen for this research are to a large extent efficient in all aspects of risk management such as Understanding risk and Risk Management (URM), Risk Identification (RI), Risk Assessment and Analysis (RAA), Risk Monitoring and Control (RMC) and Risk Management Practices (RMP). The research also provides a risk management framework to assist key role players in South African banking industry in establishing policies, standards and practices in risk management The research is of value to those interested in the banking industry, specifically on risk management. It is also the first of its kind in assessing risk management practices on three major types of risks in South African banks. The findings and the framework developed can be used by key role players for decision-making in improving or maintaining risk management frameworks...|$|E
40|$|Organisations are {{increasingly}} delivering their business through multiple complex programs and facing {{the challenge of}} building project management capability. An organisational Project Management Maturity Assessment is an effective method for establishing a baseline and provides an impetus for organisational change. The methodology allows for the setting of organisationally specific maturity goals, {{with the ability to}} implement improvements in a staged approach at a pace which is logical to that company. Over the past decade Project Management Maturity Models have become effective tools for benchmarking and driving improvements in organisational performance. This paper presents a case study in applying a project management maturity model to review, assess, and analyze the degree of organisational project management maturity of one of the national departments of the South African Government. This reflects the project management practices and capabilities of a national department of government. This model was a critical guide to setting targets for project management maturity and providing a clear path for organisational improvement. The focus {{of this paper is to}} not only to demonstrate the methodology and results of the assessment, but to also aim to report on the outcome of the study and make necessary recommendations for improvement. The attention of the research was focused on those departments which are involved in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects. For reasons of confidentiality this strategic department in this dissertation is referred to as “The Agency”. There is currently one similar study that was carried out by Rwelamila (2007), in one of the large infrastructure departments in South Africa. Rwelamila (2007) found that the department’s programme management system was very poor and at the lowest level of maturity (level 1 out of 5). However, since Rwelamila’s (2007) findings the researcher’s underlying proposition of this research is that the levels of maturity of these organisations have improved and climbed to level 2 of the Project Management <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder,</b> based on the reasons indicated in the following two paragraphs. The fact of the modern business landscape is that organisations are changing in fundamental ways within a short space of time and at a fast pace — structurally, operationally, culturally — in response to globalization, new technology, competition, and the world economy that is at a historic turning point. The researcher further considered the fact that organisations are under pressure to improve performance in order to continue to be successful in the global marketplace and therefore they strive on daily basis to improve on their projects or program delivery in order to attain competitive advantage and sustained growth. Therefore, in light of these factual considerations, the researcher deemed it appropriate to evaluate without delay the current levels of maturity in similar organisations to those evaluated by Rwelamila (2007). Effective organisational project management is a source of competitive advantage and as such places the levels of organisational project maturity at the nexus of the indicated fundamental shifts. Today, effective Organisational Project Management is top of mind as a competitive weapon and the most successful firms are innovating not only their offerings and business models, but changing their project management processes. To achieve dramatic performance gains, companies find that they must rethink, or transform, the way they manage their projects or programs. In order to achieve the study objectives two models were used, the first model being called “Organisational Project Management Maturity (OPM 3) ” and second being “Project Management Maturity Matrix Model” were used as a tools to assess the degree of The Agency’s project management maturity/competence and highlighted a recommended path for improvement of its overall effectiveness. OPM 3 is an acronym for the Organisational Portfolio, Program, and Project Management Maturity Model- a standard developed under the stewardship of Project Management Institute. The purpose of the OPM 3 model is to provide a way for organisations to understand organisational project management and to measure their maturity against a comprehensive and broad–based set of organisational project management Best Practices. OPM 3 also helps organisations wishing to increase their organisational project management maturity to plan for improvement. An evaluation of the performance of The Agency and its projects/programs was carried out in relation to its scope of mandate in order to assess its PM competence and maturity. The assessment of the degree of organisational project management maturity of The Agency provided the basis to evaluate its success in achieving the best-in-class project management practices. The results of the assessment provided the opportunity to make recommendations designed to channel The Agency to a path that will continually improve and develop its competitive position and promote its business by projects. The researcher therefore considered it imperative to examine the degree of maturity of project management in the national department of a public sector based on the OPM 3 and Project Management Maturity Matrix maturity models. The project management maturity model is a widely accepted concept in business. It shows different stages of the project management development in a corporation. It is worth mentioning that these systems and process do not guarantee success, they just increase the probability of success. The findings of this study indicate that The Agency is at Ad Hoc/Standardize phase (level 1) of maturity. The study is concluded with recommendations which could assist The Agency to plan for improvement and increase its degree of maturity against the Best Practices and capabilities identified in the OPM 3 Standard...|$|E
