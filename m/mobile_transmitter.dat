5|$|The most wide-reaching {{psychological}} {{weapon was}} {{the radio station}} Voice of Liberation. It began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist propaganda, telling its listeners to resist the Árbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting from deep within the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message which many listeners believed. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in Miami by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a <b>mobile</b> <b>transmitter.</b> The Voice of Liberation made an initial broadcast that was repeated four times, after which it took to transmitting two-hour bulletins twice a day. The transmissions were initially only heard intermittently in Guatemala City; a week later, the CIA significantly increased their transmitting power, allowing clear reception in the Guatemalan capital. The radio broadcasts {{have been given a}} lot of credit by historians for the success of the coup, due to the unrest they created throughout the country. They were unexpectedly assisted by the outage of the government-run radio station, which stopped transmitting for three weeks while a new antenna was being fitted. These transmissions continued throughout the conflict, broadcasting exaggerated news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributing to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population.|$|E

500|$|Castillo Armas's army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with US-supplied planes. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas's victory as a fait accompli to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The US propaganda campaign began well before the invasion, with the United States Information Agency writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded the governments that were friendly to it to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the US version of events. The most wide-reaching psychological weapon was the radio station known as the [...] "Voice of Liberation".

40|$|Physical layer {{security}} techniques {{have emerged as}} promising candidates {{in order to achieve}} perfect secrecy in wireless communication systems. In this framework, an approach is proposed to enhance secrecy, taking advantage of topological and mobility asymmetries between a legitimate user and potential eavesdroppers. As a specific example, an Alamouti Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system with distributed <b>mobile</b> <b>transmitters</b> is investigated for underwater acoustic and radio frequency applications. The <b>mobile</b> <b>transmitters</b> independently emit pre-equalized - in terms of Doppler shifts - Alamouti OFDM symbols. As a result, the legitimate receiver effortlessly receives Doppler shift free copies of the OFDM symbols with standard diversity gains. On the contrary, eavesdroppers experience diversity gain compression and cross-symbol interference. A positive ergodic secrecy capacity is achievable {{even in the absence of}} an SNR advantage at the legitimate user. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
