40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{aeration}} ratio on organic <b>materials</b> <b>removal</b> rate in sequencing batch reactors was considered. Eight hours cycles, including 6 h aeration period, were applied. Raw wastewater with COD equal 350 ± 20 mg L - 1 was prepared by dried confectionary milk and tap water.

Taking into account nitrification and denitrification processes, five aeration ratios: 1. 1, 3. 14, 5. 44, 6. 97 and 8. 83 are applied.

50|$|Some of {{the main}} factors which govern the {{performance}} of an electrochemical grinding process include current supplied, rotation speed of the grinding wheel, the workpiece feed rate, the type of electrolyte used, electrolyte feed rate, and the workpiece's chemical properties.

Increasing the supplied current, rotation speed of the wheel, electrolyte feed rate, or the workpiece feed rate will {{lead to an increase}} in <b>material</b> <b>removal</b> rate (MRR), while decreasing these properties will do the opposite.
