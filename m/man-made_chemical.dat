25|$|Enzyme {{promiscuity}} is {{the ability}} of an enzyme to catalyse a fortuitous side reaction in addition to its main reaction. Although enzymes are remarkably specific catalysts, they can often perform side reactions in addition to their main, native catalytic activity. These promiscuous activities are usually slow relative to the main activity and are under neutral selection. Despite ordinarily being physiologically irrelevant, under new selective pressures these activities may confer a fitness benefit therefore prompting the evolution of the formerly promiscuous activity to become the new main activity. An example of this is the atrazine chlorohydrolase (atzA encoded) from Pseudomonas sp. ADP which evolved from melamine deaminase (triA encoded), which has very small promiscuous activity towards atrazine, a <b>man-made</b> <b>chemical.</b>|$|E

500|$|A General Circulation Model (GCM) is a {{mathematical}} model {{that can be used}} in computer simulations of the global circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean.
