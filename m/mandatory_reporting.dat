This study reports results from a survey of cattle feeding companies located primarily in Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, and Iowa. Results indicate a diversity of opinions regarding the effectiveness of <b>mandatory</b> price <b>reporting.</b> On average, producers are neutral to slightly negative regarding the value of <b>mandatory</b> price <b>reporting.</b> Some of the dissatisfaction was associated with excessive or unrealistic expectations. Feedlot size, amount of custom feeding, and the percentage of cattle sold by the feedlot to its largest buyer had little systematic relationship to the manager’s perceptions regarding the usefulness of <b>mandatory</b> price <b>reporting.</b> In contrast, feedlot location and feedlot manager opinions about market structure were related to their opinions regarding <b>mandatory</b> price <b>reporting...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{characterize}} the adverse event reports on silicone gel breast implants (SGBIs), including death reports, {{submitted to the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 1984 through 1995 and to analyze changes in the type and complexity of reports following extensive media coverage of breast implants. METHODS: The authors analyzed <b>mandatory</b> and voluntary <b>reports</b> from the adverse events reporting system for medical devices at the FDA. RESULTS: In 1988, adverse event reports related to SGBIs accounted for 2. 4 % of the 14, 473 <b>mandatory</b> <b>reports</b> entered into the FDA database on medical devices. In 1992, SGBI-related reports accounted for 30. 3 % of the total 66, 476 <b>mandatory</b> <b>reports</b> of adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse event in 1988, before the widespread publicity on breast implants, was implant burst or rupture. In contrast, in 1992 the most frequently reported event was reaction, a term used to describe a range of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: The numbers of <b>mandatory</b> and voluntary <b>reports</b> of SGBI-related adverse events increased exponentially, as did {{the complexity of the}} reports, following publicity over the lack of safety data on breast implants and a short voluntary moratorium on their sale.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{increase}} the knowledge of how complaints and <b>mandatory</b> <b>reports</b> of mistreatments function in the care of old people. The objective is to make an analysis grounded in the experiences of the complainants to provide an analytic mapping where the experiences of the subject can be connected to social and ruling relations. The assumption guiding this objective is that local experiences are inﬂuenced, and to different degrees ruled, by other people’s activities elsewhere. The material consists of interviews with complainants, care staff, managers and ofﬁcials, ﬁeld-notes from observations in home care, special housing and service users’ councils, written complaints and <b>mandatory</b> <b>reports</b> collected from two urban areas in Sweden and from different municipalities as well as from regulatory authorities. The theoretical and methodological framework used in the study is institutional ethnography. An extended concept of work is employed as an orienting concept. Social and ruling relations are traced by identifying explanation repertoires. Part of the analysis is inspired by analytic induction. The method of ghostwriting is used in part to elucidate the dialogic process between the researcher and the researched. The results show that complaints have a limited signiﬁcance for improvements in the care of individual care recipients and that complaints are often ignored. This is made possible due to a folk logic recognizing complainants as “annoying” people. In the complaining processes the caring work disappears and is replaced by a “documentary work,” which is in line with the reinforcements of quality assurance. The care recipients do not take part in this work, neither with an active voice nor as passive recipients of care. Many <b>mandatory</b> <b>reports</b> are initiated by complaints. From the care recipient's point of view, the <b>mandatory</b> <b>reports</b> have little value. Generally, mistreatments are not related to the consequences of abusive acts and neglect for the care recipient's health and well-being, but to systematic appearance of the mistreatment and whether intent can be established. Two prominent functions with the obligation to report are 1) ﬁnding systems of error and 2) that the conceptual framework following the act evokes a moral discourse identifying unsuitable care staff. Two main types of complaints processes are distinguished: a closed and an extended process. Three ideal-type models are delineated, showing the institutional practices that complainants and reporters meet in this context and their possibilities to make change through complaint procedures. None of these models seem to be of much help for the care recipient. A model where they can act and be treated as citizens is called for. The potential and drawbacks of institutional ethnography are discussed...|$|R

The livestock <b>mandatory</b> price <b>reporting</b> system was approved by Congress in July of 1999, signed into law on October 22, 1999, and launched on April 2, 2001. In announcing the implementation of the <b>mandatory</b> price <b>reporting</b> system, the USDA claimed that it would provide information on 80 % to 95 % of the volume of all cattle, boxed beef, slaughter hogs, sheep and lamb meat, and imported lamb meat transactions. The new law had three explicit objectives: (1) facilitate price discovery, (2) make livestock markets more open, and (3) provide all market participants with market information that can be easily understood (USDA 2001 a). This study attempts to determine if the new <b>mandatory</b> price <b>reporting</b> system had achieved these objectives in the perspective of the sheep and lamb industry during the period of the study. Survey questionnaires were developed to determine the perceptions of lamb producers and feeders regarding the effect of the <b>mandatory</b> price <b>reporting</b> system on: (1) the price discovery process, (2) the openness and transparency of lamb buying and selling transactions in the market, and (3) the quantity, accuracy, availability, and timeliness of information needed to make production and marketing decisions. First, the cross-tabulation or descriptive categorical analysis provided the basis for an aggregate evaluation of the perceptions of the survey respondents. Second, a logit regression analysis based on the ordinal regression models was built to consider the relationship between the perceptions of the responding sheep and lamb producers and feeders regarding the new <b>mandatory</b> price <b>reporting</b> system and key characteristics of those respondents (such as age, gender, years of experience, size of operations, etc.). During the period of the study, most respondents believed that the new <b>Mandatory</b> Price <b>Reporting</b> Act has not facilitated or enhanced their power to negotiate prices. Although producers from bigger ranches and feeders from larger capacity ranches reported some improvement in the price discovery process, most respondents believed that packers and feeders were still manipulating the sheep and lambs markets. Neither producers nor feeders perceived any improvements in the availability and openness of private transactions. The <b>mandatory</b> livestock price <b>reports</b> about the sheep and lamb market prices are considered the least useful information source for majority of respondents, as well as the most difficult to understand. The most useful and understandable source is perceived to be the voluntary USDA market reports and other ranchers and feeders...|$|R
