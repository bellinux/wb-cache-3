50|$|As {{regard to}} the {{mechanism}} for pulsing the core, the pulsed mode can be produced using a different variety of configurations depending of the desired frequency of the pulsations. For instance, the use of standard control rods in a single or banked configuration with <b>motor</b> <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{or the use of}} standard pneumatically operated pulsing mechanisms are suitable for generating up to 10 pulses per minute, for the production of pulses at rates up to 50 pulsations per second, the use of rotating wheels introducing alternately neutron poison and fuel or neutron poison and non-neutron poison can be considered. However, for pulsations ranking the thousands of pulses per second (kHz), optical choppers or modern wheels employing magnetic bearings allow to revolve at 10 kHz. If even fast pulsations are desired, then, it would be necessary the use of a new type of pulsing mechanism that does not involve mechanical motion, for example, lasers (based in the 3He polarization) as early proposed by Bowman, or proton and neutron beams. For the nuclear thermal rocket frequencies in the order of 1 kHz to 10 kHz are the choice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aiming {{at the low}} {{generating}} {{efficiency of}} the current solar energy generating system, solar energy {{maximum power point tracking}} control system based on STC 89 C 52 is designed and made. The photoelectric detection and tracking is adopted as the control mode in the system. By using stepping <b>motor</b> as <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism,</b> comprehensive trace of the sun is realized by controlling the movement of tracking mechanism in the horizontal and pitching directions. Based on this, real-time detection of wind velocity and change of wind direction is realized by wind velocity and direction transducer which is equipped on the tracking mechanism, which makes the system automatically avoid the typhoon above level 8 to weaken the damage to panel by the storm. The experiment results of model machine indicate that the system has reliable performance which can satisfy the need of auto-solar track, it can also make the panel orient towards east again after darkness to realize daily circular run and it is of relatively high practical value...|$|R

The paper consists of mathematical modeling, simulation, and an experimental work. Adopt the position coordinate method of three-dimensional space trajectory tracking.

40|$|Bond {{graph theory}} {{is applied to}} the {{modeling}} and analysis of the vibration characteristics of the in-wheel <b>motor</b> <b>driving</b> vehicle. First, an 11 -degree-of-freedom vibration model of the in-wheel <b>motor</b> <b>driving</b> vehicle is established based on bond graph, and then the correctness of the model is verified. Second, under the driving condition of class B road excitations and a speed of 50 [*]Km/h, the vibration characteristics of the in-wheel <b>motor</b> <b>driving</b> vehicle are simulated and analyzed, and the activity of each part in the system is then calculated. Third, these parts that have less of an effect on the vibration characteristics of an in-wheel <b>motor</b> <b>driving</b> vehicle are identified according to the magnitude of the activity, and then the model is simplified by removing these parts. Finally, the reliability of the simplified model is verified by comparing the vibration characteristics of the model before and after simplification.
