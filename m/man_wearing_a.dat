5|$|Ladislaus is {{a patron}} saint of Hungary, {{especially}} along the borders. In particular, soldiers and the Székely people venerate him. A late medieval legend says that Ladislaus appeared {{at the head of}} a Székely army fighting against and routing a plundering band of Tatars in 1345. He is also called upon during times of pestilence. He is often depicted as a mature, bearded <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> royal crown and holding a long sword or banner. He is also shown on his knees before a deer, or in the company of two angels.|$|E
5|$|To-Me Ku-Pa (a name phonetically {{similar to}} that of British comedian Tommy Cooper) is an evil necromancer who {{regularly}} crosses paths with Thrud and is depicted as a bald <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> large cloak. Thrud first encounters To-Me Ku-Pa in an early White Dwarf strip and is turned into a frog. Subsequently, in The Three Tasks of Thrud, To-Me Ku-Pa takes advantage of Thrud's drugged state, following Lymara's failed assassination attempt, to hypnotise him and force him to obtain three items necessary for a spell.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E

5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled dollar bills {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> dress shirt and tie with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy.|$|E

25|$|On February 14th, Roger Craig, a Dallas deputy sheriff, {{testified that}} during the {{assassination}} {{he was standing on}} the far side of Dealey Plaza across from the Texas School Book Depository. Craig said that immediately afterwards he ran to where the shooting occurred and saw a man that he later identified as Oswald run down the slope away from the building and get into a green station wagon driven by a man with dark complexion. That same day, Carolyn Walther, a Dallas resident, testified that she observed within an open window of the School Book Depository a man in a white shirt holding a gun accompanied by another <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> brown suit coat.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 February 1942, lookouts on Christmas Island spotted an object out at sea, which on closer inspection {{turned out to be}} a carley float carrying the body of a Caucasian <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> blue boilersuit that had been sun-bleached white. The flesh of his right arm had been eaten away by fish, and his eyes and nose consumed by birds. Shrapnel was embedded in the float's outer covering, while the proliferation of marine growth indicated that it had been adrift for some time. As the island was under threat of Japanese invasion, after a brief examination, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near Flying Fish Cove. Evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March.|$|E
25|$|The entity {{claims a}} unique {{tradition}} that unlike {{the rest of}} the state national guards, also includes the early American period that preceded the creation of the Thirteen Colonies. This claim is reflected in its first Coat of Arms which depicts the defeat of the British in the second Battle of San Juan and the patch worn by the 295th Regiment, designed by John Roqueña in 1953, which features a <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> morion. The first coat of arms of the PRNG featured a lion guarding a tower on top of an isle located in the middle of a blue field representing the ocean, the beast representing the militia guarding San Juan, three sailboats that represent the defeated British float in 1798, and a sheep next to a red book representing Puerto Rico as seen in the coat of arms. Since its early days, the units stationed in Puerto Rico used a yellow and red patch that features a guerite, similar to those at El Morro.|$|E

25|$|In Renaissance {{paintings}} of the adoration of the Trinity, God may be depicted in two ways, either with emphasis on The Father, or the three elements of the Trinity. The most usual depiction of the Trinity in Renaissance art depicts God the Father using an old man, usually with a long beard and patriarchal in appearance, sometimes with a triangular halo (as {{a reference to the}} Trinity), or with a papal crown, specially in Northern Renaissance painting. In these depictions The Father may hold a globe or book (to symbolize God's knowledge and as a reference to how knowledge is deemed divine). He is behind and above Christ on the Cross in the Throne of Mercy iconography. A dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit may hover above. Various people from different classes of society, e.g. kings, popes or martyrs may be present in the picture. In a Trinitarian Pietà, God the Father is often symbolized using a <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> papal dress and a papal crown, supporting the dead Christ in his arms. They are depicted as floating in heaven with angels who carry the instruments of the Passion.|$|E
25|$|Aaron, {{the brother}} of Moses, is on the first icon {{on the right side}} of the tier. He {{represented}} the priestly functions of his tribe, becoming the first High Priest of the Israelites. In his right hand he holds a crosier decorated with flowers, and a thurible in his left. The next image depicts Gideon, one of the judges of Israel, with a fleece. In the Old Testament, an angel appeared to Gideon, telling him that he would save his tribe from the invading Midianites. Gideon asked for proof of God's message; he laid a fleece of wool on the ground and asked the Lord to make the fleece wet and keep the ground dry by next morning, if the victory were to be his. Next morning the fleece was wet and the ground was dry; Gideon demanded a second test in which the fleece should remain dry while dew covered the rest of the ground and this also happened. Later this narrative was understood as a reference to Jesus' birth. In these explanations the fleece stood for Mary, and the dew signified Christ. King Solomon is portrayed on the next icon. He was the son of King David, and he holds an image signifying the First Temple of Jerusalem. The Old Testament credits Solomon with its completion. Another unidentified icon stands close to Solomon's painting. The aged man reaching for the sky is probably Jeremiah, son of a landowner. In the Bible Jeremiah was chosen to prophesy God's anger at the Israelites who worshiped idols. He had to prepare his people for the fall of Jerusalem and for being enslaved. Knowing the fate of his tribe he is usually depicted as an old, worn man looking up to the skies, praying for God's forgiveness. The next icon shows a traditional depiction of Isaiah, in which an angel touches his lips. According to the iconographical traditions the angel fills Isaiah's lips with fire to preach his prophecies without fear. In another interpretation the fire refers to the Book of Isaiah, in which he mentions the burning anger of God. The last icon on the Prophets tier depicts a young <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> turban. It is the last uncertain icon in the row, probably portraying Habakkuk. He holds a package containing the stew he took for Daniel when he was in the lion's den with the help of an angel.|$|E
