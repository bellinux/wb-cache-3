25|$|Just {{before the}} new series was to begin, {{producers}} were forced {{to find a new}} host when Convy was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor in April 1990. Although original host Gene Rayburn expressed interest in returning, the producers brought in Ross Shafer, the former host of Fox's Late Show and the USA Network dating series Love Me, Love <b>Me</b> <b>Not,</b> <b>to</b> take Convy's place. Charles Nelson Reilly returned as a regular panelist and Brett Somers appeared as a guest panelist for several weeks. Vicki Lawrence, Sally Struthers, Brad Garrett, Bill Kirchenbauer, and Ronn Lucas were among the semi-regulars for this version of the show. Gene Wood returned as announcer, with Bob Hilton filling in for one week. Marcia Wallace, Betty White, Dick Martin, Dolly Martin, Jo Anne Worley, Edie McClurg & Jimmie Walker were among other panelists who also appeared on earlier versions of the show.|$|E
25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

The song [...] "Mama Told <b>Me</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Come", written {{four years earlier}} for Eric Burdon, was delivered in stripped-down form, and helped Newman establish himself as a composer of note. Newman appeared in solo engagements beginning in June 1970 on an NBC TV special hosted by Liza Minnelli. [...] "Mama Told <b>Me</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Come" [...] yielded a #1 chart topper for Three Dog Night in July 1970. Newman's career was in high gear.|$|E

Tweedy's relationship with his wife Sue Miller became the inspiration for several of the songs, although she was portrayed mostly in a negative sense. Miller was reluctantly willing to give Tweedy the creative license to write songs, but was concerned about lyrics such as [...] "she begs <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hit her" [...] from [...] "She's a Jar".|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} year {{following}} the election defeat, Romney generally kept a low profile, with his ordinary daily activities around San Diego being captured via social media glimpses. In December 2012, he joined the board of Marriott International for a third stint as a director. In March 2013, Romney gave a reflective interview on Fox News Sunday, stating, [...] "It kills <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be there, {{not to be in}} the White House doing what needs to be done". He again expressed regret at the [...] "47 percent" [...] remark, saying [...] "There's no question that hurt and did real damage to my campaign." [...] (He was still echoing both of these sentiments a year later.) [...] Romney began working as executive partner group chairman for Solamere Capital, a private capital firm in Boston owned by his son Tagg. He was also involved in supporting several charitable causes.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} edited by Bob Murawski {{on the set}} using a then {{state-of-the-art}} computerized editing unit that allows the user to edit the film as the movie was being shot. The film was then scored by Graeme Revell who utilized Kodo drummers from Japan. Woo was contractually obligated to release a R rating by Universal Pictures. When submitting the film to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), it was judged as too violent and intense for an R rating and received an NC-17 rating. Woo re-edited the film six times for the MPAA as they never indicated what specific scenes they found objectionable. During this editing period, Van Damme went with his own editor {{to make his own}} edit of the film. Van Damme's version excises whole characters to insert more scenes and close-ups of his character Chance. When asked about this edit, Van Damme replied that [...] "People pay their money to see <b>me,</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see Lance Henriksen". The MPAA accepted the film after Woo had made 20 cuts to the film. Scenes cut include the opening chase sequence and the Mardi Gras warehouse sequence. A non-action scene that is cut from the film is a romantic scene between Chance and Natasha.|$|E

500|$|Although {{known as}} one of Hollywood's most {{exciting}} on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with [...] "warm brown eyes" [...] and [...] "extraordinary charm". In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings inside, later recalling, [...] "He never guessed I had a crush on him ... {{it never occurred to me}} that he was smitten with me, too." [...] Flynn later wrote, [...] "By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade, I was sure that I was in love with her." [...] Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] at the hotel's Coconut Grove nightclub. [...] "I was deeply affected by him," [...] she later remembered, [...] "It was impossible for <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be." [...] The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn reunited with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.|$|E
500|$|According to Reuters, some {{neighbors and}} {{relatives}} of the dead saw a group of U.S. soldiers arrive at their village at about 2 a.m., enter homes and open fire. [...] "They were all drunk and shooting all over the place," [...] said neighbor Agha Lala. [...] According to The New York Times, one of the attack's survivors and [...] "at least five other villagers" [...] described seeing a number of soldiers, while some other Afghan residents described seeing only one gunman. [...] One mother-of-six, whose husband was killed during the incident, reported involvement {{of a large number}} of people: [...] "When they shot dead my husband, I tried to drag him into the house... I saw more than 20 people when I looked out the house. The Americans pointed their guns at me and threatened me, telling <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> leave the house or they'd kill me." [...] An eight-year-old girl named Noorbinak, whose father was killed, reported that [...] "one man entered the room and the others were standing in the yard, holding lights." [...] The brother of another victim claimed his nephews and nieces had seen [...] "numerous soldiers" [...] with headlamps and lighted guns. [...] Some elected officials said that they believed the attack was planned, claiming that one soldier could not have carried out such an act without help. In response, Afghan President Hamid Karzai appointed General Sher Mohammad Karimi to investigate the claims.|$|E
500|$|A {{sequel to}} her first {{greatest}} hits album, The Immaculate Collection (1990), GHV2 included fifteen singles released during Madonna's second decade in the recording industry, starting from [...] "Erotica" [...] (1992) to [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] (2001). Unlike the former release, GHV2 did not feature any new material. In an interview with BBC's Jo Whiley, Madonna spoke about {{the selection of the}} tracks, [...] "I only wanted songs that I could listen to five times in a row." [...] She also added that [...] "If you listen to the record, you can really see my evolution as a singer, songwriter, and, more important, a human being." [...] Madonna felt that because it was a [...] "greatest hits", it should only contain previously released hit songs. Several of her popular singles of that period were excluded from the album. Despite being a worldwide number-one hit in 2000, [...] "American Pie" [...] was not included because Madonna had regretted putting it on her eighth studio album, Music (2000). [...] "It was something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing, but it didn't belong on the album so now it's being punished... My gut told <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> , but I did it and then I regretted it so just for that reason it didn't deserve a place on GHV2." [...] she said. Other notable exclusions were [...] "This Used to Be My Playground", [...] "Rain", [...] "I'll Remember" [...] and [...] "You'll See"—all of which had been included on her ballads compilation Something to Remember (1995).|$|E

500|$|The {{cover of}} the first {{printing}} of The Great Gatsby {{is among the most}} celebrated pieces of art in American literature. It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald {{was in the midst of}} writing it. The cover was completed before the novel; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had [...] "written it into" [...] the novel. Fitzgerald's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg (depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop) which Fitzgerald described as [...] "blue and gigantic– their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose." [...] Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting, a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the [...] "girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs." [...] Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read, he immediately disliked the cover, but [...] "Scott told <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be put off by it, that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story. He said he had liked the jacket and now he didn't like it." ...|$|E
