40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{investigate}} whether {{it is true that the}} new Danish 7 -point <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> is clearly compatible with the ECTS <b>grading</b> <b>scale,</b> as commonly assumed. The analysis explores the verbal descriptions of the two grading scales; whether the ECTS <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> relative percentage values can be derived from the 7 -point <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> <b>grade</b> values, and if these represent the percentage distribution of the ECTS grading scale; and finally whether the scales are directly compatible during averaging calculation. In all three analyses, there are significant differences between the two <b>grading</b> <b>scales,</b> which lead to the project's conclusion that the two <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> are not necessarily directly compatible. The analysis also reveals, however, that the ECTS-scale percentage values actually can be derived correctly from the 7 -point <b>scales</b> <b>grade</b> values, but that they do not represent the ECTS scale relative dimension. During the average calculation of the ECTS <b>scale</b> sequential <b>grade</b> values is used as a replacement for the ECTS <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> sequential letter <b>grades.</b> This is in line with other countries' <b>grading</b> <b>scales,</b> but may also compromise the analysis of the average calculation.

40|$|Purpose:  The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the extent and pattern of use of <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> for contact lens complications (‘grading scales’) in optometric practice. Methods:  An anonymous postal survey was sent to all 756 members of the Queensland Division of Optometrists Association Australia. Information was elicited relating to level of experience, practice type and location, and mode of usage of <b>grading</b> <b>scales.</b> Results:  Survey forms were returned by 237 optometrists, representing a 31 per cent response rate. The majority of respondents (61 per cent) reported using <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> frequently in practice, while 65 per cent of these preferred to use the Efron <b>Grading</b> <b>Scales</b> for Contact Lens Complications. Seventy-six per cent of optometrists use a method of incremental grading rather than simply grading with whole numbers. <b>Grading</b> <b>scales</b> are more likely to be used by optometrists who have recently graduated (p < 0. 001), have a postgraduate certificate in ocular therapeutics (p = 0. 018), see more contact lens patients (p = 0. 027) and use other forms of <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> (p < 0. 001). The most frequently graded ocular conditions were corneal staining, papillary conjunctivitis and conjunctival redness. The main reasons for not using <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> included a preference for sketches, photographs or descriptions (87 per cent) and unavailability of scales (29 per cent). Conclusion:  <b>Grading</b> <b>scales</b> for contact lens complications are used extensively in optometric practice for a variety of purposes. This tool can now be considered as an expected norm in contact lens practice. We advocate the incorporation of such <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> into professional guidelines and standards for good optometric clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{variety of}} facial nerve <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> have been {{developed}} over the years with the intended goals of objectively documenting facial nerve function,tracking recovery, and facilitating communication between practitioners. Numerous scales have been proposed; however, all are subject to limitation because of varying degrees of subjectivity, reliability, or longitudinal applicability. At present, such scales remain the only widely accessible modalities for facial functional assessment. The authors' objective was to ascertain which scales(s) best accomplish the goals of objective assessment. METHODS: A systematic review of the English language literature was performed to identify facial nerve grading instruments. Each system was evaluated against the following criteria: convenience of clinical use, regional scoring, static and dynamic measures, features secondary to facial palsy (e. g., synkinesis), reproducibility with low interobserver and intraobserver variability, and sensitivity to changes over time and/or following interventions. RESULTS: From 666 articles, 19 facial nerve <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> were identified. Only the Sunnybrook Facial <b>Grading</b> <b>Scale</b> satisfied all criteria. The Facial Nerve <b>Grading</b> <b>Scale</b> 2. 0 (or revised House-Brackmann Scale) fulfilled all criteria except intraobserver reliability, {{which has not been}} assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Facial nerve <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> intend to provide objectivity and uniformity of reporting to otherwise subjective analysis. The Facial Nerve <b>Grading</b> <b>Scale</b> 2. 0 requires further evaluation for intraobserver reliability. The Sunnybrook Facial <b>Grading</b> <b>Scale</b> has been robustly evaluated with respect to the criteria prescribed in this article. Although sophisticated technology-based methodologies are being developed for potential clinical application,the authors recommend widespread adoption of the Sunnybrook Facial <b>Grading</b> <b>Scale</b> as the current standard in reporting outcomes of facial nerve disorders...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{concurrent}} validity and sensitivity to change of three knee osteoarthritis (OA) <b>grading</b> <b>scales.</b> The Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) joint space narrowing (JSN) <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> are well-established. The third <b>scale,</b> the compartmental <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> for OA (CG) is a novel <b>scale</b> which <b>grades</b> JSN, femoral osteophytes, tibial erosion and subluxation to create a total score. MethodsOne sample of 72 posteroanterior (PA) fixed-flexion radiographs displaying mild to moderate knee OA was selected from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) to study validity. A second sample of 75 radiograph pairs, which showed an increase in OA severity over 30 months, was selected to study sensitivity to change. The three radiographic <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> were applied to each radiograph in both samples. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to correlate the radiographic grades and the change in grades over 30 months with a Whole-organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) -based composite score which included five articular features of knee OA. ResultsCorrelations between the KL, OARSI JSN and CG <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> and the magnetic resonance image (MRI) -based score were 0. 836, 0. 840 and 0. 773 (P <  0. 0001) respectively while correlations between change in the radiographic <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> and change in the MRI-based score were 0. 501, 0. 525 and 0. 492 (P <  0. 0001). ConclusionsAll three radiographic <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> showed high validity and are suitable to assess knee OA severity. They showed moderate sensitivity to change; therefore caution should be taken when using ordinal radiographic <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> to monitor knee OA over time...|$|R

DesignDevelopment and validation study of <b>grading</b> <b>scales.</b> MethodsLid margin and meibomian gland photographs were taken in the multicenter, prospective cross-sectional study for MGD and control subjects. New <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> for MGD signs (abnormal lid margin findings of vascularity, plugging of gland orifices, lid margin irregularity, lid margin thickening, partial glands, and gland dropout) in both upper and lower eyelids were developed. Three MGD experts, 3 general ophthalmologists, and 3 non-physicians independently tested the scales by evaluating photographs. The levels of interrater and intrarater agreement for each <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> were estimated {{with the use of}} kappa statistics. ResultsThirty-eight patients with MGD and 20 control subjects were enrolled and photographed. New <b>grading</b> <b>scales</b> were developed using a total of 226 photographs. The interrater kappa values for MGD experts and for general ophthalmologists and non-physicians with reference to an MGD expert ranged from 0. 36 to 0. 87 (median of 0. 66), 0. 41 to 0. 73 (0. 60), and 0. 30 to 0. 77 (0. 59), respectively.

Patients and Methods A cross-sectional observational study included 160 patients with knee pain who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and 20 patients with knee pain who have not fulfilled the ACR criteria for KOA. All patients were subjected to clinical assessment (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index of Osteoarthritis and global visual analog scale) and radiological assessment in the form of X-ray grading according to K&L <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> and ultrasonographic assessment of medial femoral osteophytes according to a scale that was proposed by the first author and consisted of five grades (0 – 4), where grade 0 denoted no osteoarthritis and grade 4 denoted the most advanced grade of KOA. Grade 2 was divided into two subgrades A and B with grade 2 B considered as a more advanced stage than grade 2 A. Results The proposed US <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> had high sensitivity and specificity in detecting the different grades of KOA compared with K&L <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> (a total sensitivity of 94. 6 % and a total specificity of 93. 3 %). Intra- and interreader reliability of US was excellent (kappa > 0. 93 and > 0. 85, respectively). Conclusions US can reliably detect the severity of KOA. Good agreement was found between the proposed US <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> and K&L <b>grading</b> <b>scale.</b> The proposed US <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> is simple and reliable...|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} described supplementary <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> may {{be superior}} to the widely used Spetzler-Martin <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> in the prediction of microsurgical outcomes for cerebellar arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We report two cases of ruptured cerebellar AVMs with the same Spetzler-Martin grade but different supplementary grades treat-ed with microsurgical resection. Both patients had symptomatic brainstem compression from cerebellar hematomas and subsequently underwent uncomplicated surgeries; however, their outcomes were significantly different. It has previously been proposed that AVMs dis-tort cerebellar anatomy in a different manner than supratentorial cer-ebral anatomy thereby potentially resulting in misrepresentation when utilizing the Spetzler-Martin <b>grading</b> <b>scale.</b> However, the com-ponents of the supplementary <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> are independent of cer-ebellar anatomy, {{which may explain why}} it {{has been shown to be}} better than the Spetzler-Martin <b>grading</b> <b>scale</b> for prediction of surgi-cal outcomes. In addition, due to the smaller volume of the posteri-or fossa compared to the supratentorial compartment, rupture of cerebellar AVMs may result in rapid and catastrophic neurological compromise. Therefore, the role of microsurgery may be more critical for AVMs of the cerebellar than for those located elsewhere. Simple and effective grading systems are invaluable tools for clinical and surgical decision-making, although the decisions rendered should al-ways be made in conjunction with the patient's presentation and the physician's experience.
