25|$|Ruse {{is a large}} {{industrial}} centre. It has a duty-free zone and 2 industrial zones: East and West. Ruse Iztok Power Plant has an energy producing capacity of 400 MW and the Ruse West Power Plant has 41 MW. There are a logistics park and a business park in the city. The city's economy is dominated by light industry — tailoring, textiles and food processing. Big manufactures are Fazan (the first factory for socks in Bulgaria), Fenix 94 (socks), Ariston S (women's fashion)Bordo (women's fashion), Danini (lady's fashion), Top Man (men's fashion), Karina (lady's fashion) and Sirma Prista (dairy products). The petroleum industry and the chemical industry are represented by companies, producing paints and <b>motor</b> <b>oils</b> – Orgachim, Prista Oil, Lubrica, Megachim, EKON 91, Ninachim and Polysan. The machinery industry and ships construction are well developed. Also, one of the world's leading companies in yacht design Vripack has an architecture and engineering studio in Ruse. Big metal-working companies are Zhiti — a leading producer of low-carbon steel wires, nails, fasteners, chain-link nettings, barbed wires; Precis Inter Holding produces electro-welded steel and aluminum tubes and profile; At Sparky welded parts, road construction machines, transportation and agricultural machines are being designed, engineered and built; Express Service LTD is the only locomotive producer in Bulgaria; Witte Automotive is a big producer of mechanical and mechatronic latches / locks for doors and hoods, hinges or door check arms, door handle modules and safety products for car seats. Keros is a major producer of ceramic floor wall tiles and porcelain tiles. Steiner Elektronik Technologie is specialized {{in the production of}} single-sided, double-sided and multi-layer PCBs; Naiden Kirov JSC manufactures low-voltage electrotechnical accessories for households. Dunarit is a big manufacturer of military and engineering products, founded in 1903. The main production of Zita is devices and appliances for control of temperature and passing of different fluids designed for automatics, pneumatics, hydraulics and everyday life technology. Woodworking and furniture production is represented by Ergodesign, Apex, Stefany Style, Gold Apolo and IRIM.|$|E

Later, the Elcor Mercantile diversified into the up-and-coming petroleum business, selling Conoco gasoline, kerosene, fuel oils, <b>motor</b> <b>oils,</b> grease and even outboard motors. Concrete sidewalks were built to line the shady streets, and bright red fire hydrants were installed. Homes were insulated, and people began to purchase refrigerators. Manilla Street and Maritana Avenue were paved. Greyhound Bus Lines established {{a stop at the}} Elcor Mercantile. A baseball team was entered in the old East Mesaba League, and the Elcor Mercantile sponsored the Elcor-Conocos, an ice-hockey team that became one of the best on the Iron Range. Chicago Blackhawks ice-hockey goaltender Sam LoPresti was born in Elcor.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>motor</b> <b>oil</b> is {{manufactured}} {{with numerous}} additives, aftermarket oil additives exist, too. A glaring inconsistency of mass-marketed aftermarket oil additives {{is that they}} often use additives which are foreign to <b>motor</b> <b>oil.</b> On the other hand, commercial additives are also sold that are designed for extended drain intervals (to replace depleted additives in used oil) or for formulating oils in situ (to make a custom <b>motor</b> <b>oil</b> from base stock). Commercial additives are identical to the additives found in off-the-shelf <b>motor</b> <b>oil,</b> while mass-marketed additives have some of each.|$|R

2500|$|Military {{operations}} {{in the early years}} at Otis AFB included the use of petroleum products and other hazardous materials such as fuels, <b>motor</b> <b>oils,</b> and cleaning solvents and the generation of associated wastes. Consistent with practices of other industries at the time, it was common practice for many years to dispose of such wastes in landfills, dry wells, sumps, and the sewage treatment plant. Spills and leaks also occurred. [...] These activities have resulted in serious impacts to the Upper Cape’s groundwater resources. [...] As {{a direct result of the}} threats from waste plumes in the groundwater, much of the water supply in the surrounding area was converted from wells to municipal water sources.|$|E
2500|$|Sliding {{friction}} between {{the surface of the}} cam and the cam follower which rides upon it can be considerable. In order to reduce wear at this point, the cam and follower are both surface hardened, and modern lubricant <b>motor</b> <b>oils</b> contain additives specifically to reduce sliding friction. The lobes of the camshaft are usually slightly tapered and the faces of the valve lifters slightly domed, causing the lifters to rotate to distribute wear on the parts. The surfaces of the cam and follower are designed to [...] "wear in" [...] together, and therefore each follower should stay with its original cam lobe and never be moved to a different lobe. You can put new lifters on an old cam but never old lifters on a new cam. In some engines the followers have rollers which eliminate the sliding friction and wear but add mass to the valvetrain.|$|E
40|$|Oil spills are a {{universal}} threat impacting local, national and world communities alike. Bioremediation that is natural, efficient, economical and safe {{is the best}} solution for protecting the environment from oil related damages. In this study, <b>motor</b> <b>oil</b> degrading bacteria were isolated from oil-contaminated soil samples from a suburban Atlanta, Georgia community. Mineral salt broth containing 1 Ow- 40 <b>motor</b> <b>oil</b> as the sole carbon source was used to isolate <b>motor</b> <b>oil</b> degrading bacteria. <b>Motor</b> <b>oil</b> tolerant and metabolizing bacteria were identified using morphological and biochemical tests. Two bacterial isolates were then tested for their tolerance varying concentrations of diesel and kerosene oils for comparison with <b>motor</b> <b>oil</b> consumption. Observed {{results suggest that the}} isolated bacteria from oil contaminated soil possess abilities to metabolize <b>motor</b> <b>oil,</b> kerosene and diesel.

50|$|Nearly all {{commercial}} <b>motor</b> <b>oils</b> contain additives, {{whether the}} oils are synthetic or petroleum based.
