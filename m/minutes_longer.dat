5|$|The {{original}} {{scenario for}} the short involved a magician who incorporates an autograph seeking rabbit into his act after his previous rabbit leaves him. Complications arise as the new rabbit suffers from stage fright. Sweetland compared it to the plot of A Star Is Born.

5|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} Jackson's King Kong, Universal Studios Home Entertainment issued a double-sided director's cut DVD of the film in November 2005, which featured a version of The Frighteners that was 12 <b>minutes</b> <b>longer.</b> The other side includes a documentary prepared by Jackson and WingNut Films originally for the Laserdisc release. The director's cut was also made available in HD DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray on December 29, 2009 in the United States and Canada. In Australia, the DVD and Blu-ray {{was released on}} May 18, 2010. The film opened at #11 at the DVD sales chart, making $1.6 {{million in the first}} week off 104,000 DVD units. There is a rated and an unrated version, with the unrated version running about five <b>minutes</b> <b>longer</b> than the theatrical version. The UK Blu-ray lacks most of the extras found on the locked US release.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} case of orbital {{resonance}} in exoplanets {{has been noted}} between Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c. The two planets, whose orbits correspond in a roughly 1:2 ratio, maintain the orbit of the other by gravitational tug. Kepler-9b's orbit grows, on average, four <b>minutes</b> <b>longer</b> every orbital period. Eventually, this trend will reverse and increase. Over time, {{it can be seen}} that the planets' orbits oscillate slightly above and below the 1:2 ratio. Alycia Weinberger of the Carnegie Institution has stated that the Kepler-9 gas giants probably formed further away from the star than they are, and the appearance of the orbital resonance phenomenon may help explain the history of their inward migration.|$|E

5|$|Film of {{the concert}} was {{produced}} for television broadcast and the home video market. It was produced by James Signorelli, and directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, a specialist in music documentaries who had worked on The Beatles' film Let It Be, and executive produced by Lorne Michaels, who had recently departed the NBC-TV comedy/variety series Saturday Night Live. Simon himself financed the US$750,000 cost of the staging and the video recording. It is unknown how much HBO paid for the television and video rights of the recording; US$1 million according to some sources, over US$3 million according to others. The film includes the two songs that had not appeared on the album, and with an 87-minute duration, is 12 <b>minutes</b> <b>longer</b> than the album.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Jeunet {{included}} an alternate {{version of the}} film on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set with different opening and closing credits, which were originally cut due to budget restrictions. The deleted scenes included references to the character Newt from Aliens, Vriess making a joke to Call, Ripley's clone {{waking up in the}} middle of her operation, an extended conversation in the mess hall that reveals the details of Ripley's former employers, Weyland-Yutani, an extended dialogue between Call and Ripley's clone in the chapel and scenes of the Betty landing on Earth and the planet's landscape during the final dialogue between Ripley and Call, as they view the ruins of Paris. The special edition restores 13 minutes and 5 seconds worth of footage (including the new opening and ending), and is 7 <b>minutes</b> <b>longer</b> than theatrical version. Jeunet has stated that the special edition is not a director's cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Nobody was {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in France on 21 July 2010, through Pathé, in two formats: a single-disc wide-screen version which special features include a trailer, making-of and a photo gallery; and a two-disc wide-screen special edition. The latter contains the director's cut of the film which has 1 re-cut, 23 extended scenes and 12 additional scenes integrated into the original footage, running about 16 <b>minutes</b> <b>longer</b> than the theatrical version.

5|$|When {{originally}} editing Donnie Darko in 2001, Kelly {{was required}} to keep the final film shorter than two hours, with its final runtime coming to 113 minutes. With more freedom in 2004, his director's cut is 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>longer</b> than the original release. Most of the deleted scenes that had been included as extras on the Donnie Darko DVD were added to narrative, bringing the runtime {{to a total of}} 133 minutes. Such scenes include additional sequences with Donnie and his parents, Donnie's therapist Dr Thurman telling him that his drugs are placebos, and his English teacher Karen Pomeroy teaching Watership Down to her class. Close-up shots of Donnie's eyeballs were included, as well as footage of waves crashing on a beach, and a scene in which Donnie and Gretchen play the 1986 arcade game Out Run.|$|E
5|$|A remastered and {{extended}} {{cut of the}} film, named the Signature Edition, was shown in one-off screenings across the United States and Canada on September 30, 2015, and October 4, 2015. The edition is approximately two <b>minutes</b> <b>longer</b> than the original cut, and features a brief scene with Annie and Dean and the sequence of the Giant's dream. Both scenes were storyboarded by Bird during the production on the original film but never finished due to time and budget constraints. Before they were fully completed for this new version, they were available as deleted storyboards on the 2004 DVD bonus features. They were animated in 2015 by Duncan Studio, which employed several animators that worked on the original film. The film's Signature Edition was released on DVD and for digital download on February 16, 2016. An official Blu-ray release was available on September 6, 2016. Along with the additional scene, it also showcases abandoned ideas that were not initially used due to copyright reasons, specifically a nod to Disney via a Tomorrowland commercial, which was also a reference to his then-recently released film of the same name, and a joke regarding the film being shot with CinemaScope cameras.|$|E
5|$|Although 1 ATF {{was well}} placed {{to deny the}} communists the use of its AO, it was {{increasingly}} obvious {{that there was little}} role for the SAS. Indeed, the heavy presence of Viet Cong prevented them from operating normally, and the first attempt to insert a patrol was called off due to the presence of hostile forces {{in the vicinity of the}} landing zone; two Viet Cong were subsequently killed and the patrol was extracted after only 30 minutes. A second attempt lasted only fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>longer,</b> and they were also extracted following a brief contact. Finally, two patrols were joined together in an effort to provide more protection, and on 29 January they patrolled out from 7 RAR battalion headquarters. After only 30 minutes the Australians encountered a small party of Viet Cong; however, they tried again two hours later but were detected. The following day they tried for a third time and were contacted. Unable to operate effectively, the SAS patrols were withdrawn and returned to Nui Dat on 1 February.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, Kitase knew {{he wanted}} a {{thematic}} combination of fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed to include a cast of characters {{who appeared to be}} ordinary people. Character designer and battle visual director Tetsuya Nomura and art director Yusuke Naora strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned characters—a departure from the super deformed designs used in the previous title. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game, and the use of motion capture technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's full motion video sequences. The FMV sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people, with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour, approximately 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>longer</b> than the FMV sequences in VII. Motion capture was used to give a general realism to character movement, but the team favored manual animation over relying on motion capture. A major challenge was the technical advances made since the release of VII, and the aim for more realistic characters. A major issue with the cutscenes was having real-time character models moving across environments within an FMV.|$|E
5|$|Leading up to Turning Point 2007, TNA {{officials}} {{began to}} suspect Scott Hall would not {{show up at the}} event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was earlier that morning. TNA officials soon received word from Hall that he was suffering from food poisoning and {{would not be able to}} attend. As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five <b>minutes</b> <b>longer</b> than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he asked a person off-screen if they were angry and to go ahead and fire him, as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held a meeting and announced that anyone unhappy with their job could void their contract with the company. Senshi was the only one who wished to void his contract. During the meeting, Joe apologized for his actions at the event.|$|E
