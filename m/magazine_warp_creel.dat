This also housed the offices. Weaving was not possible without a continuous supply of weft on pirns, and beams carrying the warp. Starting with the warp, {{it had to be}} <b>warped</b> from <b>creels</b> of thread, in a multistage process onto the weavers' beam. This could be done in the mill or the warp could be bought in and delivered on the tapers beam. The beam of thread had to be sized in a tape sizing machine by sizers.|$|R

5000|$|Five new {{buildings}} were constructed on the complex by 1907. The following year, Barber-Colman diversified to produce Milling Cutters. These {{were used by}} large mills for cutting metal. Their Gear Hobbing Machine came out in two sizes in 1910 and could precisely cut teeth in gears. In 1919, the company purchased {{the rights to the}} Warp Drawing Machine from the American Warp Drawing Machine Company. This machine eased the transition of switching warping patterns. In 1921, Barber-Colman introduced a High Speed <b>Warper</b> & <b>Creel</b> and Automatic Spoolers. By 1931, the company also had production facilities in Framingham, Massachusetts; Greenville, South Carolina; Munich, Germany; Chicago; Cincinnati, Ohio; Rochester, New York; and Manchester, England.Howard Colman died in a car accident in 1942. Harry Severson, one of the three original directors, took over leadership of the company. In 1953, the [...] "Park Plant" [...] was built, a one-story, 125000 sq ft building in nearby Loves Park. In 1954, the company purchased the Hendey Machine Company. By 1965, three other additions were complete on the Loves Park facility. In 1968, a 200000 sq ft facility was built just north of the original plant. By 1975, Barber-Colman employed 4000 workers among its 150 locations. The company was family-owned until the death of Walter Colman (Howard's son) in 1983. Following Colman's death, the company was sold off to various companies. Reed-Chatwood purchased the textile operations and continued to manufacture from the original factory until 2001. The machine tool division was sold to fellow Rockford company Bourn & Koch, Inc. Bourn & Koch provides parts, service and support for their machines to this day. Barber-Colman henceforth focused on cutting tools and process controls. The remaining divisions were eventually sold off. The Barber-Colman trademark is held by Eurotherm Controls, Inc. The historic complex has been vacated since Reed-Chatwood relocated in 2001. The City of Rockford currently owns the property, purchasing it for $750,000 in 2002. On August 8, 2006, it was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
