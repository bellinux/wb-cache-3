Jossa, in 2012, wanted Lauren and Abi to bond more. She commented: [...] "I think realistically they would when they're going through a family problem like this. It would bring the family a little bit closer. I think they are quite close already and {{they have a lot of}} family banter! They <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> each other as people, but they love each other as family".

Van Duyn similarly {{stated that the}} soundtrack was not as [...] "legendary" [...] as it was in its previous instalment, however he still admitted that it had some [...] "great" [...] tracks. In addition, Van Duyn criticised the Game Boy Advance's port for replacing all of the original music with remixed versions.

500|$|Game {{director}} and composer Junichi Masuda stated that {{to keep the}} games fresh, he looks at every previous element {{to decide what to}} adapt to the new game, stating [...] "people <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> what they like in the past, trend wise". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pokémon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players {{would not be able to}} know what is a good Pokémon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.|$|E

That they are better off not measuring their entire self or their [...] "being" [...] and give up the narrow, grandiose and ultimately destructive notion to give themselves any global rating or report card. This is partly because all humans are continually evolving and are far too complex to accurately rate; all humans do both self-defeating / socially defeating and self-helping / socially helping deeds, and have both beneficial and un-beneficial attributes and traits at certain times and in certain conditions. REBT holds that ideas and feelings about self-worth are largely definitional and are not empirically confirmable or falsifiable.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are among}} them {{a few things that}} are not {{completely}} worthless. The music is a bit infantile, plain, spirited; but in the end, the people, our Spanish people, are something of all that. I believe that the people are right when they continue to be moved by Córdoba, Mallorca, by the copla of the Sevillanas, by the Serenata, and Granada. In all of them I now note that there is less musical science, less of the grand idea, but more color, sunlight, flavor of olives. That music of youth, with its little sins and absurdities that almost point out the sentimental affectation ... appears to me like the carvings in the Alhambra, those peculiar arabesques that say nothing with their turns and shapes, but which are like the air, like the sun, like the blackbirds or like the nightingales of its gardens. They are more valuable than all else of Moorish Spain, which though we <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> it, is the true Spain.|$|E
2500|$|On April 29, 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush {{declared}} {{during a}} press conference that [...] "85 percent of the world's food prices are caused by weather, increased demand and energy prices", and recognized that [...] "15 percent has been caused by ethanol". He added that [...] "the high price of gasoline is going to spur more investment in ethanol {{as an alternative to}} gasoline. And {{the truth of the matter}} is it's in our national interests that our farmers grow energy, as opposed to us purchasing energy from parts of the world that are unstable or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> us." [...] Regarding the effect of agricultural subsidies on rising food prices, Bush said that [...] "Congress is considering a massive, bloated farm bill that would do little to solve the problem. The bill Congress is now considering would fail to eliminate subsidy payments to multi-millionaire farmers", he continued, [...] "this is the right time to reform our nation's farm policies by reducing unnecessary subsidies".|$|E
2500|$|For example, some {{countries}} and cultures value the trait of assertiveness and personal accomplishment while others instead place more merit on cooperation and interpersonal connection. [...] Countries scoring high on assertiveness consider PA to {{be a way}} of assuring equity among employees so that higher performing employees receive greater rewards or higher salaries. [...] Countries scoring low on assertiveness but higher in interpersonal relations <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the social separation and pay inequity of higher/lower performing employees; employees from this more cooperative rather than individualistic culture place more concern on interpersonal relationships with other employees rather than on individual interests. [...] High assertive countries value performance feedback for self-management and effectiveness purposes while countries low in assertiveness view performance feedback as [...] "threatening and obtrusive". [...] In this case, the PA of the high assertive countries would likely not be beneficial for countries scoring lower in assertiveness to employ. [...] However, countries scoring lower in assertiveness could employ PA for purposes of improving long-term communication development within the organization such as clarifying job objectives, guide training and development plans, and lessen the gap between job performance and organizational expectations.|$|E

2500|$|Arriving at the cave, Cornelius is {{intercepted by}} Dr. Zaius and his soldiers. Taylor holds them off, {{threatening}} to shoot them {{if he has}} to. Zaius agrees to enter the cave to disprove their theories and to avoid physical harm to Cornelius and Zira. Inside, Cornelius displays {{the remnants of a}} technologically advanced human society pre-dating simian history. Taylor identifies artifacts such as dentures, eyeglasses, a heart valve and, to the apes' astonishment, a talking children's doll. More soldiers appear and Lucius is overpowered, but Taylor again fends them off. [...] Dr. Zaius is held hostage so Taylor can escape, but he admits to Taylor that he has always known that a human civilization existed long before apes ruled the planet and that [...] "the Forbidden Zone was once a paradise, your breed made a desert of it… ages ago!" [...] Taylor nonetheless thinks it best to search for answers, but Dr. Zaius warns him that he <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> what he finds. Once Taylor and Nova have ridden off, Dr. Zaius has the gorillas lay explosives to seal off the cave and destroy the remaining evidence of the human society. He then has Zira, Cornelius and Lucius charged with heresy.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that professional military culture has also reclaimed ownership of the term. Admiral Dennis C. Blair, former Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command, and former U.S. Director of National Intelligence, said, [...] "There's a standard term for the military child: 'Brat.' While it sounds pejorative, it's actually a term of great affection." [...] This trend is also visible among notable and influential civilians: Senator Ben Nelson, {{a member of the}} United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, wrote, [...] "when the word 'brat' is used to describe someone it is not meant as a compliment, but when it is preceded by another word and becomes [...] "military brat" [...] it becomes a term of endearment." [...] Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter said, [...] "I married what is affectionately known as an Army brat." [...] Senator John Cornyn identifies himself as a military brat, and also identified Judge Janice Brown as one, during her confirmation hearing before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Military culture has created numerous positive backronyms for [...] "brat", such as [...] "Born, Raised And Transferred" [...] or [...] "Brave, Resilient, Adaptable, and Trustworthy." [...] While some <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the origins of the term, most are comfortable with it.|$|E
2500|$|Rock {{music was}} not viewed favorably by most {{traditional}} and fundamentalist Christians {{when it became}} popular with young people from the 1950s, although early rock music was often influenced by country and gospel music. In 1952 Archibald Davison, a Harvard professor, summed up the sound of traditional Christian music and why its supporters <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> Rock music when he said: [...] "... a rhythm that avoids strong pulses; a melody whose physiognomy is neither so characteristic nor so engaging as to make an appeal in its own behalf; counterpoint, which cultivates long-breathed eloquence rather than instant and dramatic effect; a chromaticism which is at all times restricted in amount and lacking in emotionalism; and modality which creates an atmosphere unmistakably ecclesiastical." [...] Based upon Archibald Davison's statement {{it is easy to}} see how different these two genres of music are. [...] Religious people in many regions of the United States did not want their children exposed to music with unruly, impassioned vocals, loud guitar riffs and jarring, hypnotic rhythms. Rock and roll differed from the norm, and thus it was seen as a threat. Often the music was overtly sexual in nature, as in the case of Elvis Presley, who became controversial and massively popular partly for his suggestive stage antics and dancing. However, Elvis was a religious person who even released a gospel album: Peace in the Valley. Individual Christians may have listened to or even performed rock music in many cases, but it was seen as anathema to conservative church establishments, particularly in the American South.|$|E
