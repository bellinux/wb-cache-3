40|$|Soil {{moisture}} temporal variability is {{an important}} concept in understanding forest management. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyse the effect of planting density on soil profile moisture in a clonal Eucalyptus plantation. Soil moisture was observed every 15 days at 25 points distributed throughout the eucalyptus stand between November 2013 and October 2015 to characterize the moisture according to the following three types of spacings: 3 x 2, 3 x 3, and 3 x 5 m. At each point, the 0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30, 30 – 40, and 60 - 100 cm layers were evaluated using a Profile Probe PR 2 model. Soil moisture showed high spatial variability in the 0 - 10 cm layer, whereas from 30 to 100 cm deep, the moisture tended to become more homogeneous throughout the area. The dry periods presented greater temporal soil <b>moisture</b> <b>stability</b> when compared to the rainy seasons.

30|$|This work {{presents}} a novel method for preparing perovskite films using a simple processing technique. Perovskite paste was prepared by dispersing an equimolar mix of PbI 2 and methyl ammonium iodide powders into terpineol with stirring. From these precursors, perovskite films were fabricated using doctor blading and drying for 24  h at room temperature. The prepared films were then placed into relative humidity (RH) levels of 30, 50, and 70  % {{to test the}} <b>moisture</b> <b>stability.</b> The crystal structure, phases, and morphology were investigated with XRD and SEM/EDX. These samples exhibited good stability against long time exposure to moisture for 70  days. The XRD results showed that samples stored at RH 70  % contained {{only a small amount}} of hydrate compound after 70  days storage, while in the sample stored at RH 50  %, the formation of PbI 2 was observed. The sample at RH 30  % manifested almost no change when stored for the same storage period. We attribute the enhanced <b>moisture</b> <b>stability,</b> compared with the spin-coated samples, to a passivated surface of the perovskite film by terpineol which exhibits a hydrophobic moiety. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that the passivation of surface defect states by the formation of either PbI 2 or hydrated compound leads to prolonged charge carrier recombination times.|$|E

LiNiO 2 with a low degree of cationic mixing and good electrochemical performance was prepared either from pure β-NiOOH, γ-NiOOH, or a mixture of both where the γ phase was the majority. The synthesized product (LT-LiNiO 2) presents electrochemical properties similar to LiNiO 2 prepared by conventional powder synthesis (HT-LiNiO 2) {{in spite of the}} difference in Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surfaces, around 20 m 2 /g for LT-LiNiO 2 and 0. 7 m 2 /g for HT-LiNiO 2. The thermal and <b>moisture</b> <b>stabilities</b> of LT-LiNiO 2 were studied and turned out to be much lower than those of HT-LiNiO 2. This moisture instability was found (i) to be intrinsic to LiNiO 2, since ground HT-LiNiO 2 samples presented a similar behavior, (ii) to be enhanced by decreasing the LiNiO 2 particle size, and (iii) to be much larger than that of LiCoO 2. In view of electrochemical applications, cobalt-substituted products should be used in order to ensure the stability against both reduction-delithiation and hydrolysis...|$|R

Many Schiff base complexes show excellent catalytic activity in various reactions and in the presence of moisture. Over the past few years, there have been many reports on their applications in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. The high thermal and <b>moisture</b> <b>stabilities</b> of many Schiff base complexes were useful attributes for their application as catalysts in reactions involving at high temperatures.

40|$|The AMU added {{three years}} of data to the POR from the {{previous}} work resulting in a 22 -year POR for the warm season months from 1989 - 2010. In addition to the flow regime stratification, <b>moisture</b> and <b>stability</b> stratifications were added to separate more active from less active lighting days within the same flow regime. The parameters used for <b>moisture</b> and <b>stability</b> stratifications were PWAT and TI which were derived from sounding data at four Florida radiosonde sites. Lightning data consisted of NLDN CG lightning flashes within 30 NM of each airfield. The AMU {{increased the number of}} airfields from nine to thirty-six which included the SLF, CCAFS, PAFB and thirty-three airfields across Florida. The NWS MLB requested the AMU calculate lightning climatologies for additional airfields that they support as a backup to NWS TBW which was then expanded to include airfields supported by NWS JAX and NWS MFL. The updated climatologies of lightning probabilities are based on revised synoptic-scale flow regimes over the Florida peninsula (Lambert 2007) for 5 -, 10 -, 20 - and 30 -NM radius range rings around the thirty-six airfields in 1 -, 3 - and 6 -hour increments. The lightning, flow regime, <b>moisture</b> and <b>stability</b> data were processed in S-PLUS software using scripts written by the AMU to automate much of the data processing. The S-PLUS data files were exported to Excel to allow the files to be combined in Excel Workbooks for easier data handling and to create the tables and charts for the Gill. The AMU revised the Gill developed in the previous phase (Bauman 2009) with the new data and provided users with an updated HTML tool to display and manipulate the data and corresponding charts. The tool can be used with most web browsers and is computer operating system independent. The AMU delivered two Gills - one with just the PWAT stratification and one with both the PWAT and TI stratifications due to insufficient data in some of the PWATITI stratification combinations.

30|$|We {{demonstrated}} a novel method to produce perovskite paste by dispersing equimolar mixed PbI 2 and MAI powders into the terpineol {{by way of}} stirring. The perovskite film prepared by blading the paste showed very good <b>moisture</b> <b>stability.</b> By placing the samples at three different moisture levels, {{it can be found}} that all three samples exhibit good stability at long time exposure to moisture for 70  days. The XRD and SEM/EDX results showed that there is a small amount of hydrate compound in the sample stored at RH 70  % for 70  days, while the PbI 2 as the degraded phase was observed in the sample stored at RH 50  %. However, the sample stored at RH 30  % exhibited almost no change in the meantime. The modified perovskite film by hydrophobic terpineol molecules presented significantly enhanced <b>moisture</b> <b>stability.</b> Water diffusion into perovskite crystal lattice was effectively blocked chemically by the hydrophobic repulsion at the molecular level and physically by the layer encapsulation on a macroscopic scale. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed that there was some degradation of perovskite films stored under the humid conditions. However, XRD and SEM reveal that this degradation is quite minimal. In the most humid atmospheres, prolonged charge carrier recombination lifetimes due to the passivation of surface states by the formation of either a PbI 2 or a hydrated perovskite rich surface are observed.|$|E

40|$|The {{threat of}} {{anthropogenic}} climate change has seen a renewed focus on understanding contemporary patterns of species distribution. This is especially {{the case for the}} biota of tropical mountains, because tropical species often have particularly narrow elevational ranges and there are high levels of short-range endemism. Here we describe geographic patterns of ant diversity and distribution in the World Heritage-listed rainforests of the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT), revealing seasonal <b>moisture</b> <b>stability</b> to be an important environmental correlate of elevational patterns of species composition. We sampled ants in leaf litter, on the litter surface and on tree trunks at 26 sites from six subregions spanning five degrees of latitude and elevation ranges from 100 - 1, 300 m. A total of 296 species from 63 genera were recorded. Species richness showed a slight peak at mid elevations, and did not vary significantly with latitude. Species composition varied substantially between subregions, and many species have highly localised distributions. There was very marked species turnover with elevation, with a particularly striking compositional disjunction between 600 m and 800 m at each subregion. This disjunction coincides with a strong environmental threshold of seasonal stability in moisture associated with cloud 'stripping'. Our study therefore provides further support for climatic stability as a potential mechanism underlying patterns of diversity. The average height of orographic cloud layers is predicted to rise under global warming, and associated shifts in seasonal <b>moisture</b> <b>stability</b> may exacerbate biotic change caused by rising temperature alone...|$|E

40|$|Measuring of the {{variation}} of atmospheric and surface quantities such as <b>moisture</b> and <b>stability</b> at small scales {{is an important step}} to monitoring, understanding and forecasting mesoscale processes. For instance, <b>moisture</b> and <b>stability</b> products from the geostationary platform VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) exhibit interesting detail at the meso B (20 - 200 km) level (Chesters et al., 1986; Smith et al., 1985). However, variations at the meso C scale (2 - 20 km) and {{at the lower end of}} the meso B scale (20 - 100 km) suffer from the effects of noise. Noise can be greatly reduced by using a high resolution data collection system. The Multispectral Atmospheric Mapping Sensor (MAMS), with its 100 -m resolution over a 36 km swath, is well suited to provide high resolution mesoscale information about the atmosphere and surface of the earth. A more complete depiction of the atmospheric state at the smaller scales is possible through the combination of the high horizontal resolution MAMS data with the vertical sounding data of the VAS. This paper demonstrates a procedure for combining MAMS and VAS data in a physical retrieval to produce high resolution derived products of precipitable water (PW), lifted index (LI), and skin temperature (TS). The variability of these products is evaluated in a structure function analysis similar to that of Hillger and Vonder Haar (1979).

However, phosphor development for near UV LEDs is a challenging problem and a vibrant area of research. In addition, using the proper synthesis technique is an important consideration {{in the development of}} phosphors. In this research, efficient blue-, green-yellow, red- emitting, and color tunable phosphors for near UV LEDs based white light are identified and prepared by various synthetic methods such as solid state reaction, sol-gel/ Pechini, co-precipitation, hydrothermal, combustion and spray-pyrolysis. Blue-emittingLiCaPO₄:Eu²⁺, Green/yellow- emitting (Ba,Sr) ₂SiO₄:Eu²⁺, color tunable solid solutions of KSrPO₄₋(Ba,Ca) ₂SiO₄:Eu²⁺, and red-emitting (Ba,Sr, Ca) ₃MgSi₂O₈:Eu²⁺,Mn²⁺ show excellent excitation profile in the near UV region, high quantum efficiency, and good thermal stability for use in solid state lighting applications. In addition, different synthesis methods are analyzed and compared, with the goal of obtaining ideal phosphors, which should have not only have high luminous output but also optimal particle size (~ 150 - 400 nm) and spherical morphology. For Sr₂SiO₄:Eu²⁺, the sol-gel method appears to be the best method. For Ba₂SiO₄:Eu²⁺, the co- precipitation method is be the best.
