5|$|Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing, {{and turned}} to selling {{underwater}} electrical detonators and waterproof cable of his own invention. Soon after {{the failure of the}} Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel <b>Morse</b> to lobby the US government for funds. Colt's waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when <b>Morse</b> ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, bays, and in his attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. <b>Morse</b> used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.|$|E

5|$|F. Augustus Heinze's {{association}} with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved {{too much for the}} board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time, by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. <b>Morse.</b> Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and <b>Morse</b> could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city's banks) forced <b>Morse</b> and Heinze to resign all banking interests. By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.|$|E
