To be more precise, a language is listed here as missing if: • Extant published literature {{can make a}} convincing case that the language exists (or existed, see below), and, • Extant published literature can make a convincing case that the language is not intel-ligible to any language already listed in E 16 /E 17 /E 18, and, An important note {{is that we do}} not list languages which are missing solely in virtue of the interpretation of a dialect situation correctly understood (but interpreted differently) in E 16 /E 17 /E 18. This matter is separately treated in Section D 1. For example, if an E 16 /E 17 /E 18 entry subsumes a number of varieties with borderline intelligibility, and the facts are correctly indicated (e. g., the names of the varieties as dialects and comments on intelligibility) we do not list such cases here, even if there are good reasons to interpret the same facts as yielding different entries. However, if an E 16 /E 17 /E 18 entry shows signs of misunderstanding (missing the existence of a variety, has an erroneous indication of intelligi-bility level, or a blanket statement with no indicated basis etc.), we do list any variety that is arguably not intelligible as a <b>missing</b> <b>language</b> here.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} supporting programming conventions in a general-purpose language.

Examples include to make up for <b>missing</b> <b>language</b> constructs, to apply programming idioms, to follow coding conventions, to apply design patterns, to use programming libraries and frameworks in the intended ways, and to support application-domain specific programming. Programming conventions are rarely made explicit and formal. This leads to problems with maintenance: It is usually not clear from the existing code that it was written with certain programming conventions in mind. This makes the code more difficult to understand, and later changes which break the conventions will go undetected. Furthermore, there [...] ...|$|E
30|$|Another {{issue of}} {{concern is the}} time or {{condition}} in which the learner {{is assumed to be}} incapable of articulating a piece of language. It has been frequently stated (e.g., Littlewood 2004; Swain and Suzuki 2008) that the teacher supports the student to complete a task he or she would otherwise be unable to do on his or her own. The argument sparks a number of controversial issues in practical terms. First, except in certain frequently-used collocational constructions, how can a teacher or peer, who is assumed by the researchers to be more knowledgeable, etc., ever recognize the ‘immediate gap’ between what the student has already constructed and what is missing? To substantiate the point, it is argued that for the most part, interactional or collective scaffolding (see Donato 1994) takes place at the level of microgenesis, i.e., at the micro level of interaction, which is “neither predicted nor premeditated” (italic original) (Van Lier 2004, p. 148). Furthermore, we cannot assume any symmetrical interaction in a classroom in which the discourse members are heterogeneous in (development of) knowledge of different types, talk speed, false start, repetition, reformulation, simplification, code switching, topic shifting, etc. Therefore, the interaction is always asymmetric, and within the enormity of heterogeneity, this asymmetry is in most instances unknown to the interacting students. Moreover, non-native English learners, as well as inexperienced instructors, more often try to fill the coming parts of their own speech to convey the message, rather than paying heed to their partner’s <b>missing</b> <b>language.</b> More importantly, the teacher is not always cognitively ready for, and even prone to, assisting a single learner to advance their discourse.|$|E

A Nutrition Diagnosis Validation Instrument was developed that contained the definition, etiologies, and {{signs and symptoms of}} the diagnosis plus items added from literature review. Questions on clarity and completeness of the language were included. The Nutrition Diagnosis Validation Instrument used a Likert-type scale for deriving a Diagnostic Content Validity (DCV) score for all items in the definition, etiology, and signs and symptoms components to define major, minor, and nonrelevant characteristics and a mean total DCV score for the term. In 2008, all Board Certified Specialists in Gerontological Nutrition (CSGs) were recruited by mail. CSGs (n = 110, 73 % response) reported 15 ± 10 (mean ± standard deviation) practice years in gerontological nutrition. The total DCV component scores were 0. 80 ± 0. 17 (definition), 0. 63 ± 0. 08 (etiology), and 0. 69 ± 0. 12 (signs and symptoms). The mean total DCV score of the diagnostic term was 0. 69 ± 0. 11.

40|$|Abstract. Programmers rely on {{programming}} idioms, design patterns, and workaround {{techniques to}} make up for <b>missing</b> programming <b>language</b> support. Evolving languages often address frequently encountered problems by adding language and library support to subsequent releases. By using new features, programmers can express their intent more directly. As new concerns, such as parallelism or security, arise, early idioms and language facilities can become serious liabilities. Modern code sometimes benefits from optimization techniques not feasible for code that uses less expressive constructs. Manual source code migration is expensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. In this paper, we present the notion of source code rejuvenation, the automated migration of legacy code and very briefly mention the tools we use to achieve that. While refactoring improves structurally inadequate source code, source code rejuvenation leverages enhanced program language and library facilities by finding and replacing coding patterns that can be expressed through higher-level software abstractions. Raising the level of abstraction benefits software maintainability, security, and performance. ...|$|R
