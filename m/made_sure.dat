5|$|Avici/Avicimat (waterless/waveless): A person, who lies on oath or in business, is {{repeatedly}} thrown head-first from a 100 yojana {{high mountain}} whose sides are stone waves, but without water. His body is continuously broken, {{but it is}} <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> {{that he does not}} die.|$|E
5|$|Carleton {{addressed}} the weak {{points of the}} town's defensive fortifications: he had two log barricades and palisades erected along the Saint Lawrence shoreline, within the area covered by his cannons; he assigned his forces to defensive positions along {{the walls and the}} inner defenses; and he <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> his inexperienced militia were under strong leadership.|$|E
5|$|Although Manekshaw was conferred {{the rank}} of field marshal in 1973, it was {{reported}} that he was not given the complete allowances that he was entitled to as a field marshal. It was not until President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam took the initiative, when he met Manekshaw in Wellington, and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that the field marshal was presented with a cheque for Rs 1.3 crores (13 million)—his arrears of pay for over 30 years.|$|E

5|$|Andrea Martin {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Apu's mother, recording her part in New York City. She {{wanted to get the}} voice perfect, so in between takes she listened to tapes of Hank Azaria reading lines for Apu, to make sure her voice could realistically be Apu's mother's. During the flashback to Apu's childhood, the animators <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> not to show Manjula, as they wished to reveal her {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} if Swift allowed Faulkner {{to publish the}} works {{in order to allow}} an Irish publisher to compete against an English publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to Motte in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's legal right to publish the works but <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> to admonish the attitude and action of Motte as a publisher for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that Faulkner would be allowed to reprint the copyrighted material.|$|E

5|$|The art {{department}} <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> {{that the}} 2035 underground world would only use pre-1996 technology {{as a means}} to depict the bleakness of the future. Gilliam, Beecroft, and Crispian Sallis (set decorator) went to several flea markets and salvage warehouses looking for materials to decorate the sets. The majority of visual effects sequences were created by Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio that Gilliam founded in the late 1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston (The Golden Compass, Casino Royale). Additional digital compositing was done by The Mill, while Cinesite provided film scanning services.|$|E
5|$|Then, whilst {{the army}} was camped in Macedon, the Brygians, a local Thracian tribe, {{launched}} a night raid against the Persian camp, killing many of the Persians, and wounding Mardonius. Despite his injury, Mardonius <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that the Brygians were defeated and subjugated, before leading his army back to the Hellespont; {{the remnants of the}} navy also retreated to Asia. Although this campaign ended ingloriously, the land approaches to Greece had been secured, and the Greeks had no doubt been made aware of Darius's intentions for them.|$|E
5|$|Though Sam Manekshaw was conferred {{the rank}} of field marshal in 1973, it was {{reported}} that he was never given the complete allowances he was entitled to as a field marshal. It was not until President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam took the initiative when he met Manekshaw in Wellington, and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that the field marshal was presented with a cheque for Rs 1.3 crores–his arrears of pay for over 30 years. Even more surprisingly, Manekshaw's funeral was not attended by the top brass from civil, military, or political leadership.|$|E

6000|$|The {{professor}} had <b>made</b> himself <b>sure</b> {{that the}} guards who accompanied him spoke nothing but French. Without referring to Banker's proposed bargain, {{he said to}} him, [...] "Was {{the captain of the}} bandits under whom you served a Spaniard?" ...|$|R
5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
5|$|Colton, the Clerk of the Court and {{preparer}} of the writs {{and process}} of the court, had set the first session of county court {{to be held at}} his home, in Coltonville. In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status. Colton <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that Coltonville would win the election by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the Illinois General Assembly, after the DeKalb County court intervened. When court convened the sheriff served a court order declaring a courthouse be built in Sycamore. Afterward, Coltonville eventually suffered the same fate as Brush Point and disappeared from the map. These events seemingly settled the issue of where the courthouse and, in turn, the DeKalb County seat was going to be located.|$|E
5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall in the public eye and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was adamant that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that this was emphasised even in his final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should be}} allowed to come to you if you were ill, darling," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, rather timidly, as she pressed the hand to her bosom. Something had <b>made</b> her <b>sure</b> today that her child loved her--needed her as much as ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "With pleasure, Roland. I have an {{outstanding}} engagement with you, you know, and I have been hoping {{that you would}} call and remind me of it; in fact I <b>made</b> so <b>sure</b> you would, that I considered myself engaged and refused two invitations yesterday." ...|$|R
5|$|During Becket's exile Foliot {{collected}} {{and sent to}} Rome Peter's Pence, the annual payment from England to the papacy. Foliot observed during the conflict {{that it was not}} a theological or moral dispute, merely one over church government. During Becket's exile, the king confiscated the archbishop's estates, and also confiscated the benefices of the clerks who had followed Becket into exile. Foliot was made custodian of those benefices in the diocese of Canterbury. Becket blamed both Foliot and Roger of York for the confiscations, but evidence appears to show that the confiscations were Henry's decision, and that Foliot, at least, was a conscientious custodian who <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that little profit went to the king, and most of the revenues from the benefices went to religious purposes.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occupation}} of Norway, {{three members of the}} Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden. These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the Nobel Foundation, together with the three members in exile, <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.|$|E
5|$|Graeme Le Saux and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink {{were passed}} fit for Chelsea, but John Terry was {{omitted from the}} {{starting}} lineup, having woken up ill {{on the morning of}} the final. For Arsenal, goalkeeper David Seaman came in place of Richard Wright, who deputised for him in the earlier rounds of the competition. Chelsea were led onto the field by Roberto Di Matteo, who had been forced to retire from football earlier in the season due to a serious injury. After an uneventful first half, Chelsea settled much the quicker of the two and created several chances to score. Arsenal withstood the pressure and took the lead in the 70th minute, when Ray Parlour scored from 25 yards. They <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> of victory after Fredrik Ljungberg scored from a similar distance.|$|E

60|$|Unconsciously {{the two men}} quickened their pace. Yet {{they did}} not relax from their caution. Twice they changed their course {{in order to avoid}} policemen, and they <b>made</b> very <b>sure</b> that they were not {{observed}} when they dived into the dark hallway of a cheap rooming house down town.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do better. I see it. This was, before I met him, what I {{wondered}} whether I WAS to see. But {{as soon as}} I met him I ceased to wonder, and our second meeting <b>made</b> me <b>sure.</b> I took him all in. He was acting--he is still--on his daily instructions." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{order for}} these {{developments}} to occur, Playford personally had {{to attend to}} the bureaucracy that stood in the way. He confronted public service workers, and successfully negotiated with the heads of private companies. But it was negotiations with the Federal Government that were to prove the hardest. In his time as Premier, Playford was to confront seven different Prime Ministers: Lyons, Page, Menzies, Fadden, Curtin, Forde and Chifley. Strangely, he enjoyed best relations with the Laborite Chifley, and had a poor rapport with his fellow conservative, Menzies. During the wartime years, Menzies' reluctance to meet with Playford initially hampered industrial efforts, but Playford's other federal colleagues <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that deals could be made.|$|E
5|$|Islanders {{struggled}} with food shortage {{in the last}} months of the occupation. Hathaway organised a raid on German grain stocks and saved many families from starvation with her secret potato hoard. Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945. Three British officers arrived and, explaining that no British troops were available, asked the Dame to take command of 275 men belonging to the defeated German garrison. She <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> the garrison cleared up the island of land mines. She was, however, so concerned about the legal status of the decisions she had issued during the war that she sailed to Guernsey to validate them as soon as the island was liberated. Her experience of the German occupation inspired William Douglas-Home's play The Dame of Sark. Hathaway's manner of receiving Germans has been described as both impressive and overly cordial.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} a time of great {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, and he <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, {{were in the process of}} converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E
6000|$|Death favoured me {{from the}} first, well knowing I could not endure [...] To wait on him day by day. He quitted my betters and came [...] Whistling over the fields, and, when he had <b>made</b> all <b>sure,</b> [...] 'Thy line is at end,' he said, 'but at least I have saved its [...] name.' ...|$|R
60|$|And then it {{appeared}} that his own observations had <b>made</b> him <b>sure</b> of what Ethel had learnt from Tom; {{but as long as}} it was unavowed by his friend, he had thought himself bound to ignore it, and had so dreaded the protracted suffering, that the actual stroke was accepted as a loving dispensation.|$|R
60|$|Again, one noon, in {{the same}} direction, I marked, over dimmed tops of terraced foliage, a broader gleam, as of a silver buckler, held sunwards over some croucher's head; which gleam, {{experience}} in like cases taught, must come from a roof newly shingled. This, to me, <b>made</b> pretty <b>sure</b> the recent occupancy of that far cot in fairy land.|$|R
