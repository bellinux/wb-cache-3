5|$|The third era {{deviates}} {{from the}} original plot considerably. When Lara was young she travelled with her parents on many of their archaeological expeditions which helped to shape the woman she was becoming. It was {{on one of these}} expeditions that her mother vanished and was presumed dead and a few years later her father presumably took his own life, she was then left in the care of Conrad Roth. Even though she was left with a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London. This decision required her to pay her tuition and rent by working many jobs. Though this was a much tougher choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been. She also ended up <b>meeting</b> <b>her</b> best friend, Samantha Nishimura, during her time at UCL. It was because of Sam's free spirit and wild streak that Lara was able to experience much more of London than just the universities and museums that she loved so much. After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end up on an expedition to the Dragon's Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilisation of Yamatai. It is on this expedition that Lara is stranded on a remote island full of natural, human and supernatural dangers, which enables her to develop from a vulnerable girl to a survivor. And after experiencing the supernatural powers of the ancient world, she comes to realise her father was right about his theories and her hunger for adventure awakens.|$|E
