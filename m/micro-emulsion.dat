40|$|Dedicated to {{the memory}} of {{professor}} Vojko Ozim Enzymes may act in different solvent systems. Water as the solvent in vivo may be replaced partially or mostly with ot-her solvents, such as <b>micro-emulsions,</b> organic solvents, reversed micelles, ionic liquids and supercritical fluids (SCFs). Several types of enzymatic reactions were performed in SCFs. Influence of SCFs on enzyme stability and activity is pre-sented on different examples; on different reaction systems (hydrolysis, transesterification …) and on the use of non-im-mobilized (Subtilisin carlsberg, Aspergillus niger …) as well as immobilized enzymes. Several types of high-pressure enzymatic reactors (batch-, stirred-tank-, extractive semibatch-, recirculating batch-, semicontinuous flow-, continuous packed-bed-, and continuous-membrane reactors) have been used for the performance of enzymatic reactions. In the studies on stability of biocatalysts in a high-pressure batch-stirred tank reactor changes in biocatalysts activity due to pressurization/depressurization steps were observed. Interesting alternative to overcome this inconvenience is the use of the high-pressure continuous membrane reactors, where just single compression and expansion step is necessary...|$|R
