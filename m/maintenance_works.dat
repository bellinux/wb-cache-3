5|$|After the war, {{plans to}} {{complete}} the Northern Heights project were reviewed but no work was carried out. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>works</b> and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority {{was given to the}} completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act {{was passed}} by Parliament and Pembroke College took the {{opportunity}} to place Framlingham into the guardianship of the Commissioner of Works. The undulating Inner Court was levelled up to its present form as part of the Commissioner's <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> During the Second World War, Framlingham was an important defensive location for British forces; at least one concrete pill box was built near to the castle as part of the plans to counter any German invasion, and Nissen huts were erected and a lorry park created in the Bailey.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{plans to}} {{complete}} the Northern Heights project were reviewed. In early 1946, {{the conversion of the}} LNER line from Mill Hill East to Edgware was scheduled by the LPTB for completion between January 1947 and June 1948. No work was carried out as <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds.

5|$|During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E
5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E

Furthermore, they had a value for the quality of <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> done for four consecutive periods that was less than 80 % during rework maintenance activity. The full-time mechanical maintenance workers were the only maintenance worker category which had at least a period in which the value of the quality of <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> done was more than 90 %.

In May 2011 ownership of the reservoir passed to Staffordshire County Council to ensure successful completion of the works.

25|$|The {{marshalling}} yard, {{despite having}} been renovated in the 1960s, was partly closed after Deutsche Bundesbahn became the private Deutsche Bahn AG. Of the three humps originally {{present in the}} yard, two of them (near signal boxes Hro and Vmo) were closed. The marshalling yard nowadays operates at only 10% of its original 10,000wagon per day capacity. The two depots and the <b>maintenance</b> <b>works</b> are also operating at reduced capacity. The mail station, which even had its own hump, has been completely closed as mail trains were abolished soon after the privatization of the former Deutsche Bundespost in the early 1990s. The access tracks have been removed and the area was sold off to investors.|$|E

25|$|The SD70ACe-T4 is the Tier 4 {{emissions}} standards-compliant {{version of}} the SD70ACe. The first locomotive was built in summer 2015, and made its debut at the Railway Interchange Expo in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the weekend of October 3–4, 2015. It features a new 4-stroke engine called the EMD 12-1010 - a V12 with 1010 cu.in displacement for each cylinder. This new prime mover has a two-stage turbocharger system consisting of three turbos; one turbo (the primary/high pressure turbo) for low-mid RPM and two turbos (the secondary/low pressure turbos) for mid-high RPM. The results of this setup are bigger power throughout the broader RPM range, better fuel efficiency, and lower emission. An EGR system is applied as well, allowing the engine to achieve Tier 4 {{without the use of}} urea after treatment. Another new feature of this engine is the Double-Walled Fuel Injection System that increases safety and provides simplified <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{transport}} plan {{released by}} the New South Wales Government in 1998 reported that the line carried an average of 5000 passengers on weekdays. 2.8 million journeys were made in 2009-10, increasing to 4.2 million in 2012-13. The partial integration of the line into the broader Sydney ticketing system was a major driver of the increase. In the 12 months to June 2015, the line carried 6.1 million passengers, compared to 3.9 million passengers in the prior year. The increase in the 2014-15 figure {{was influenced by the}} opening of the extension to Dulwich Hill in March 2014, while the 2013-14 figure was affected by the suspension of services for much of October 2013 and closures for <b>maintenance</b> <b>works.</b> In the period from 2015-2016, 9.7 million journeys were made, followed by 9.1 million in 2016-2017.
