40|$|The {{changing}} social, {{economic and}} environmental challenges {{in the developing world}} call for an amplification {{of the role of the}} architect. Rather than continue standing by the old principle of non-compatibility between the production of cultivated advice (e. g. design) and the production of goods (e. g. construction), architects must find a way to bring the ambitions of design and the realities of construction together - devising, if possible, coalitions and solutions to make sociotechnical novelty manageable in terms of labour skills as well as building results. In Sri Lanka, such an outlook requires change in both professional attitude and cultural appreciation. In such context, professional architectural education cannot be steeped in a cultural framework that is merely context-selective and impinges on a specific narrative celebrating the picturesque alongside nostalgic representation of traditional building products and processes. If poetic transcendence cannot be contaminated by <b>modicums</b> <b>of</b> enlightened technocracy, necessary managerialism and social activism, it will be very hard for other design domains to enter the picture. By exploring the notions of 'design', 'technology', and 'design teaching' as relevant to the building production in the developing world, this paper argues that architectural education must move away from a mono-disciplinary academic culture that can infuse a sharp divide with engineering, construction and social and economic sciences. Instead, alternative models for teaching must be explored to promote cultural dialogue and reflections, and facilitate professional development in critical directions...|$|R
6000|$|Poor Caneback;--and poor Lord Rufford! The Major {{was quite}} {{certain that it}} was all over with himself. He had broken so many of his bones and had his head so often cracked that he {{understood}} his own anatomy pretty well. There he lay quiet and composed, sipping small <b>modicums</b> <b>of</b> brandy and water, and taking his outlook into such transtygian world as he had fashioned for himself in his dull imagination. If he had misgivings he showed them to no bystander. If he thought then that he might have done better with his energies than devote them to dangerous horses, he never said so. His voice was weak, but it never quailed; and the only regret he expressed was that he had not changed the bit in Jemima's mouth. Lord Rufford's position was made worse by an expression from Sir John Purefoy that the party ought to be put off. Sir John was in a measure responsible for what his mare had done, and was in a wretched state. [...] "If it could possibly affect the poor fellow I would do it," [...] said Lord Rufford; [...] "but it would create very great inconvenience and disappointment. I have to think of other people." [...] "Then I shall send my wife home," [...] said Sir John. And Lady Purefoy was sent home. Sir John himself of course could not leave the house while the man was alive. Before they all sat down to dinner the Major was declared to be a little stronger. That settled the question and the ball was not put off.|$|R
5|$|A <b>modicum</b> <b>of</b> {{peace was}} {{eventually}} established, {{leading to the}} National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and {{between them and the}} National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The Boston Americans of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion. In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.|$|E

His instruction encompassed a broad array of subjects that included mathematics, political economy, logic, history and geography. He learned to speak and write not only in Portuguese, but also Latin and French. He could translate from English and understood German. Even later on, as an emperor, Pedro would devote at least two hours of each day to study and reading.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians {{depicted}} in literature were relatively {{rare in the}} 1950s. It was the publisher's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship. One or both usually ended up committing suicide, going insane, or leaving the relationship. Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of Spring Fire: she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because the books were distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to stores, postal inspectors would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively. The Postal Service relaxed their censorship after several First Amendment obscenity trials, including Roth v. United States and another regarding Allen Ginsberg's Howl in the mid-1950s, which gave Bannon a <b>modicum</b> <b>of</b> freedom in her plots. Although the ending to Odd Girl Out did not veer {{too far from the}} unsatisfactory resolution formula of Spring Fire, Women's Barracks, and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, it examined Laura's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity, she was deeply in love with another woman, and at the end she embraced it, which was rare in lesbian fiction.|$|E
40|$|Political {{stability}} {{is necessary for}} the proper conduct of both private and public life in so-ciety. The old-standing question is whether and how political stability depends on political participation: who participates, how many participate, and how do they participate in pol-itics? Based on an original data file that includes information about political institutions and political events since independence, I employ three measures of political stability- coups d’etat, constitutional change, and executive turnover- to confront the leading hypotheses in the literature that relate political participation to political stability. While the data did not provide definitive support on whether political participation affected political stability, a fas-cinating finding emerged from the analyses. The empirical evidence indicated that allowing for at least a <b>modicum</b> level <b>of</b> political opposition promoted political stability throughout the independent histories of Latin American countries, regardless of political participation...|$|R

On August 29, Senator McCain announced Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running-mate, making her the first woman on a Republican Presidential ticket. McCain surged ahead of Obama in the national polls following the nominationm but amid a financial crisis and a serious economic downturn, McCain and Palin went on to lose the election to Democrats Barack Obama and running mate Joe Biden. Since 1992, the 2012 presidential election was the sixth consecutive election in which the Republican candidate failed to win at least 300 electoral votes, suggesting a ceiling on GOP strength and a <b>modicum</b> margin <b>of</b> error should an election become highly competitive.|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} {{of resistance to}} post-emergence herbicides in Lolium spp. (ryegrass species) has complicated weed management in cereals. Ensuring good pre-emergence control is therefore increasingly important to protect yields. Prosulfocarb is a broad spectrum thiocarbamate herbicide that kills plants by disrupting the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids. This is the first report of resistance to prosulfocarb in Lolium species from farm sites and glasshouse selection. The recurrent selection process with prosulfocarb applied pre-emergence at its maximum labelled rate (4, 000 gai/ha) on a susceptible Lolium multiflorum Lam. population showed that the {{evolution of}} resistance due to repetitive use was possible but slow. Over three generations, it resulted in <b>modicum</b> levels <b>of</b> resistance which were not significant at practical field rates. For the last progeny obtained, {{there was no evidence}} of either cross-resistance or increased sensitivity to an herbicide under-development with a mode of action similar to prosulfocarb (RF 50 = 0. 99, 95 % CI = 0. 77 - 1. 27). Likewise, high and increasing levels of non-target-site based resistance to clodinafop-propargyl did not result in cross-resistance to prosulfocarb. Prosulfocarb exerted low levels of negative cross-resistance on LL 1781, SS 1999, GG 2078 and RR 2088, four different ACCase mutant L. multiflorum sublines (average RF 50 = 0. 67). In order to control susceptible and resistant populations in winter cereals, prosulfocarb was mixed with diflufenican, metribuzin, pyroxasulfone and the formulated mixture {iodosulfuron:mesosulfuron}. Over the 86 mixtures tested, 11 showed a high potential. Prosulfocarb + diflufenican at 2, 400 + 32 gai/ha presented interesting levels of synergism (+ 20 points on average). A non-random survey in 34 farm sites from England showed that most Lolium samples (80 %) were sensitive or only partially resistant to prosulfocarb. However, prosulfocarb efficacy was lower where other herbicides had been used intensively. Future research may now concentrate on the determination of prosulfocarb resistance pathways in Lolium spp. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
5|$|The team's strong stretch did not continue, however, as the Phillies {{entered the}} second period of interleague play with five {{consecutive}} series against the American League East.

The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a <b>modicum</b> <b>of</b> horizontal movement.

25|$|Many {{effective}} altruists {{believe that}} reducing animal suffering {{should be a}} major priority and that, at the current margin, there are cost-effective ways of accomplishing this. Peter Singer quotes estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the British organization Fishcount according to which 60 billion land animals are slaughtered and between 1 and 2,7 trillion individual fish are killed each year for human consumption. He argues that effective animal welfare altruists should prioritize factory farming over more overfunded popular causes such as pet welfare. Singer also argues that, if farm animals such as chickens are assigned even a <b>modicum</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, efforts to reduce factory farming (for example, by reducing global meat consumption) could be an even more underfunded and cost-effective way of reducing current global suffering than human poverty reduction.

On 16 June 1386 Darras authorised an exchange of clergy, by which the local priest went to St Katherine's chapel in Hereford Cathedral and the former cathedral chaplain, Philip Kentles, became rector of Sidbury. St Katherine's chapel served the Bishop's Palace, so this exchange must have been of importance to John Gilbert, presumably earning Darras a <b>modicum</b> <b>of</b> episcopal favour.

However, while he had effective control of Ribbesford, the advowson must have been his to exercise, as it went with the manor. In the case of Rock, however, the principal manor in the parish was not Rock itself but Alton, and the advowson of the church went with it: although there had been challenges from the Ribbesford family, the advowson was held by the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in Normandy during the 14th century.|$|E
