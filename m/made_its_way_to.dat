5|$|Greek {{influence}}, {{which had}} <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Phoenicia during the Persian period, now became stronger. Figurines found in Kharayeb show Aegean influence on local craftsmen. This spreading Hellenization interacted {{with the local}} Semitic population substratum, which remained faithful to its gods and its language. It resulted in an artistic and architectural symbiosis best illustrated in the artifacts of Umm el 'Amed and Bustan esh Sheikh.|$|E

The epidemic <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Puerto Rico's western coast in July 1856, {{and hit the}} city of Mayagüez particularly hard. At the time, Betances was one of five doctors {{that would have to}} take care of 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and colleagues from that point on) would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action.|$|E
5|$|Following von Spee's {{withdrawal}} from the Pacific, Australia was belatedly ordered on 8 November 1914 to join with several Japanese cruisers off Mexico to resume {{the hunt for the}} German cruisers. By this time, the German squadron had <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the South Atlantic, and in early December was destroyed by a British squadron in the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Australia was sent to join the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron at Rosyth, Scotland, and was made flagship of the squadron after a short refit.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the Chautauqua {{movement}} <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Gladstone. Judge Cross {{established a}} fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park {{for this event}} after he was convinced by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing so would {{be a boon to}} the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would reoccur annually, until Gladstone's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.|$|E

I./JG lost a further Fw 190 to friendly anti-aircraft fire as it <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Ursel. III./JG 1 lost at least two further Fw 190s to friendly anti-aircraft fire. Casualties could have been heavier, had the British anti-aircraft defences of Maldegem airfield not been removed in December.|$|E
5|$|After several false {{starts in}} early September, the Continental Army {{established}} a siege around Fort St. Jean. Beset by illness, bad weather, and logistical problems, they established mortar batteries that {{were able to}} penetrate into the interior the fort, but the defenders, who were well-supplied with munitions, but not food and other supplies, persisted in their defence, believing the siege would be broken by forces from Montreal under General Guy Carleton. On October 18, the nearby Fort Chambly fell, and on October 30, an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted. When word of this <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> St. Jean's defenders, combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort, the fort's defenders capitulated, surrendering on November 3.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{television}} series Smallville, the character of Chloe Sullivan appeared in her own web-based spin-off series, titled Smallville: Chloe Chronicles. Allison Mack continued her duties as the investigative, high school reporter, with the series originally airing exclusively on AOL.com. The first volume aired between April 29, 2003 and May 20, 2003. The web series eventually <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Britain's Channel 4 website. Smallville: Chloe Chronicles was created by Mark Warshaw, with the scripts written by Brice Tidwell; Allison Mack was given final script approval. This final approval allowed Mack to review and make changes to the script as she saw fit. Warshaw also communicated regularly with Gough and Millar {{so that he could}} find more unique ways to expand Smallville stories over to Chloe's Chronicles.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though some}} of his {{soldiers}} came within 60 meters of the pillbox, after 19 of them (over a third) were killed and the sun began rising in the horizon, Kotzer decided to retreat, unable to receive official permission due to communication problems. He ordered all of his troops to collect the wounded and any weapons they could carry, helping with the task himself. The dead were left in the field, including the medics (not a single medic survived). The injured were brought under fire into the wadi and at about 07:00 the force <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> an unoccupied two-storey building on the east bank. After the Egyptians started shelling the building with mortars, Kotzer's company began to move towards Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|Four {{motorized}} {{companies from}} the Negev Brigade left Be'er Tuvia.

A reinforced company also left Be'er Tuvia and took up positions between Hill 69 and the military base near Nitzanim to cut off Egyptian reinforcements coming from Majdal. The 57th Battalion (consisting of Irgun veterans) left Hatzor to assault Isdud from the northeast. The 53rd Battalion {{was accompanied by a}} reinforced platoon of 44 soldiers from the temporary 58th Battalion (a new recruit unit), which <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Nitzanim in order {{to be replaced by a}} more experienced platoon from the 53rd.|$|E

5|$|Near the Ellipse, {{and within}} sight of the White House, the hearse halted and Reagan's body was {{transferred}} to a horse-drawn caisson for the procession down Constitution Avenue to Capitol Hill. Nancy Reagan stepped out of her limousine to witness the body's transfer; she was met with a warm greeting, including applause. The cortege began the 45-minute journey just after 6:00pm EST, with the Reagan family following in limousines. Military units escorted the caisson as it <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the sounds of muffled drums. Behind the caisson was a riderless horse named Sergeant York, carrying Reagan's riding boots reversed in the stirrups. The caisson paused at 4th Street and Constitution Avenue, where 21 Air Force F-15's from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, flew over in missing man formation.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1859 {{the last}} {{subscriber}} {{to the main}} tontine died, having for over five years received the full £800 per annum set aside for subscribers to the first tontine, and {{with the death of}} its last member the scheme expired. On 25 March 1859 Richmond Bridge became toll-free. A large procession <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the bridge, where a team of labourers symbolically removed toll gates from their hinges. The toll houses were demolished, replaced by seating in 1868; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83years the tolls had been charged was sufficient to pay for the bridge's maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Saffron <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the New World when {{thousands}} of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who {{became known as the}} Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to Americain a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold.|$|E
50|$|Graveside, the orations were emotional.

5|$|The {{original}} home of Clan MacIntyre is likewise {{the subject of}} conjecture. There is general agreement that the clan arose in the Hebrides, the islands west of the Scottish mainland. Some accounts, however, identify Skye as the ancestral home, while another tradition holds Islay {{to have been the}} locale. The story of how the clan <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the mainland and settled along the shore of Loch Etive in the vicinity of Ben Cruachan is again shrouded in myth and magic. It is said that seeking fresh pastures for their cattle they were initially obstructed by a mountain spirit. After testing their perseverance and courage the spirit instructed them to make their new home where the white cow in their herd should first lie down to rest. This site became known as Glen Noe.|$|E
5|$|Marie died on 18 July 1938, at 5:38p.m., {{eight minutes}} after lapsing into a coma. Her two eldest children, Carol and Elisabeth, {{accompanied}} by Prince Michael, were at her deathbed. Two days later, on 20 July, Marie's body {{was brought to}} Bucharest, where she lay in state in the white drawing room at Cotroceni Palace. Her coffin was surrounded by flowers and glowing tapers and was guarded by officers of the Fourth Hussars. Thousands of people filed by Marie's bier during the three-day lying in state and, on the third day, the palace was opened for factory workers. Marie's funeral cortege <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the train station, passing under the Arch of Triumph. Her coffin was taken to Curtea de Argeș Monastery, where she was interred. Marie's heart, according to her own wishes, {{was placed in a}} small golden casket embellished with the emblems of the Romanian provinces and interred in her Stella Maris chapel in Balchik. In 1940, after Southern Dobrudja was ceded to Bulgaria during World War II, her heart was transferred to Bran Castle. There, Ileana built a chapel to house the heart, kept in two nested boxes placed inside a marble sarcophagus.|$|E
5|$|The Thermopylae Line was {{defended by}} the 2nd New Zealand Division and 6th Australian Division, with the 4th Brigade held in reserve while the 5th and 6th manned the front lines. However, on 22 April, the Allies decided to abandon Greece and the {{battalion}} moved {{out the same}} day {{with the rest of}} the 4th Brigade as part of an intended rearguard. Originally the battalion was to hold a gorge through which other units would pass for 24 hours but it ended up remaining there for three days. During the intervening period, the intended embarkation route for the battalion's departure from Greece was cut off by the Germans and so the entire brigade <b>made</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Porto Rafti, east of Athens, where the battalion was one of the first units of the 2nd New Zealand Division to be shipped to the island of Crete. Total casualties during the campaign in Greece were 23 killed in action and 42 wounded. In addition, 117 men, mostly personnel recuperating in hospitals in Athens and unable to evade the Germans, were captured.|$|E
