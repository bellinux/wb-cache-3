But behold, the sinner has one spark of enmity still. If he must needs turn now, he will either turn from one sin to another, from great ones to little ones, from <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>few,</b> or from all to one, and there stop. But perhaps convictions will not thus leave him. Why, then, he will turn from profaneness {{to the law of}} Moses, and will dwell as long as God will let him upon his own seeming goodness. And now observe him, he is a great stickler for legal performance; now he will be a good neighbour, he will pay every man his own, will leave off his swearing, the alehouse, his sports, and carnal delights; he will read, pray, talk of Scripture, and be a very busy one in religion, such as it is; now he will please God, and make him amends for all the wrong he hath done him, and will feed him with chapters, and prayers, and promises, and vows, and a great many more such dainty dishes as these, persuading himself that now he must needs be fair for heaven, and thinks besides that he serveth God as well as any man in England can. 16 ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are reasons}} that osteoderms have such high {{variability}} between and within species. The first being {{the lack of}} specific predator species. As predator species change there are rapid changes in osteoderms. The numbers of plates fluctuate from <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>few,</b> depending on the absence or presence of predators. A prey species habitat location can influence osteoderm presence as well. For example, if the habitat decreases their ability to hide in their surroundings, they need to move at increased speeds which occurs {{at the expense of}} the body armor. The habitat also influences food availability. The food the species eats can affect mineral deposit and re-uptake levels and that would influence the amount of osteoderm present.|$|E
50|$|Polygonum erectum grows 10 - 75 cm {{tall with}} <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>few,</b> non-wiry branches. The leaves have {{distinct}} veins and entire edges or have jagged cut edges. The pedicels are shorter or equal {{the length of}} the calyx and typically longer than the ocreae. The closed flowers have a calyx that is typically 3 mm long, green in color and 5-lobed. Flowers in clusters of 1 to 5 in cymes that are produced in the axils of most leaves. The calyx segments are unequal with the outer lobes longer and not keeled and the inner ones narrowly keeled. The tepals are greenish, with yellowish tinting or sometimes with whitish tints. The seeds are produced in fruits called achenes that can be of two different types; one type is dark brown with a shiny surface and is broadly egg-shaped, typically about 2.5 mm (1-10 inch) long. The other achene type is dull brown, exsert and egg-shaped, and 3 - 3.5 mm long. Late season fruiting is uncommon and if produced the achenes are 4 to 5 mm long.|$|E

Those with high income/wealth or high occupation/social class switch from having relatively <b>many</b> <b>to</b> <b>fewer</b> or the same number of children as others.

40|$|In both {{organizational}} and social arenas, people {{make decisions for}} themselves and for other people. But research in decision making has provided little input into how these decisions are psychologically different. In this paper, I propose that decisions- depending on whether people are deciding for themselves or others-vary according to regulatory focus, such that, people who make decisions for themselves are in a prevention focus, whereas people who make decisions for others are in a promotion focus. Drawing on regulatory focus, in particular work on errors of omission and commission, I hypothesize that people who make decisions for others experience {{a reversal of the}} choice overload effect. In seven studies, including a field study and a mini meta-analysis, I found that people who make decisions for themselves are less satisfied after selecting among <b>many</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>few</b> options, yet, people who make decisions for others are more satisfied after selecting among <b>many</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>few</b> options.

40|$|The use of {{replicates}} {{is essential}} in logistic measurement error models with random, additive error, as it gives a consistent estimate of the variance of the measurement error. In this paper, we investigate two {{different aspects of the}} use of replicates. We look into the efficiency gain in using more than two replicates in situations where the replicates are correlated. We find that, unlike the situation with independent replicates, the efficiency gain is an almost linear function of the number of replicates. Further, we study the allocation of replicates among study subjects, and find that the optimal way of doing this is <b>to</b> allocate <b>few</b> replicates <b>to</b> as <b>many</b> subjects as possible, rather than allocating <b>many</b> replicates <b>to</b> <b>fewer</b> subjects.
