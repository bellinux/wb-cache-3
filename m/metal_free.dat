Instead, t he free ion activity model (FIAM) states that the <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion concentration is the determining factor in heavy-metal uptake. Even though several exceptions have been found to the FIAM, the <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion is often responsible for binding at an organism's surface. Competition between metal ions at this biotic surface is accounted for by the Biotic Ligand Model (BLM), which is an extension of the FIAM. One of the techniques {{that can be used to}} measure many different <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion concentrations simultaneously in a multicomponent sample is the Donnan Membrane Technique (DMT). With the DMT, the <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ions equilibrate over a hydrophilic cation-exchange membrane between a sample compartment and an acceptor compartment, in which the <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion concentration is measured. The laboratory tests on the DMT showed that there is a high agreement between the calculated and observed <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion concentrations in solutions containing synthetic and natural ligands at various pH values. A new field DMT cell was developed to measure <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion concentrations in situ in surface waters. Be cause <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion concentrations in surface waters are commonly below the detection limit of the inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), the detection limit of the DMT was decreased by making use of a ligand in the DMT. The field DMT measured <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion concentrations in situ in the River Rhine in the Netherlands, the Furtbach Stream and Lake Greifen in Switzerland and in the River Wyre in the UK. The measured fractions of <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ions ranged from 0. 015 - 0. 63 % for Cu to 4. 3 - 13 % for Zn. The variability of the <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> fractions has a large influence on metal uptake and metal transport. The field DMT could detect small fluctuations in the <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion concentration due to changing water temperatures. Uptake studies with Lolium perenne in nutrient solutions showed that the metal content in the shoots of the plants depends on the metal content in the roots and that the metal content in the roots is linearly related to the adsorption of metals on the root surface. In a multicomponent system at metal concentrations of 1 μM, humic acid decreased Cu, Pb, and Fe adsorption at the root surface, but humic acid increased Cd, Zn, and Mn adsorption at the root surface. Apparently, complexation of cations with high affinity for (dissolved) organic matter may lead to increased uptake of cations with low affinity for organic matter because of competition between cations at the root surface. T hese plant studies show that a ligand is able to do both, decrease and increase the bioavailability of heavy metals. In a pot experiment using ten different contaminated soils it was found that the metal adsorption at the root surface of Lolium perenne is pH dependently related to the free, labile or total metal concentration in CaCl 2 extractions of these soils. <b>Free</b> <b>metal</b> ion concentrations in the CaCl 2 extractions were measured by DMT, whereas Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films (DGT) and Scanning Chronopotentiometry (SCP) were used to measure the sum of <b>free</b> and labile <b>metal</b> fractions. Because of the pH dependent metal binding at the root surface, t he pH of the soil has to be taken into account when CaCl 2 extractions are used as a basis for risk assessment towards plants. The rate-limiting steps in the metal transport from soil to plant, which can be controlled by metal diffusion in solution or metal uptake by the plant, can be determined by comparing the total, labile and <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> fractions...|$|R

Total dissolved concentrations and accumulated metal levels in four taxa (Leuctra sp., Simuliidae, Rhithrogena sp. and Perlodidae) were determined and <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion activities were calculated in 36 headwater streams located in the north-west part of England. Observed invertebrate body burdens were strongly related to <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion activities and competition among cations for uptake in the biota. Taking into account competitive effects generally provided better fits than considering uptake {{as a function of}} total dissolved metal levels or the free ion alone. Due to the critical importance and large range in pH (4. 09 to 8. 33), the H+ ion activity was the most dominant factor influencing metal accumulation. Adding the influence of Na+ on Cu 2 + accumulation improved the model goodness of fit for both Rhithrogena sp. and Perlodidae. Effects of hardness ions on metal accumulation were limited, indicating the minor influence of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + on metal accumulation in soft-water streams (0. 01 to 0. 94 mM Ca; 0. 02 to 0. 39 mM Mg). DOC levels (ranging from 0. 6 to 8. 9 mg L− 1) significantly affected Cu body burdens, however not the accumulation of the other metals. Our results suggest that 1) uptake and accumulation of <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ions are most dominantly influenced by competition of free H+ ions in low-hardness headwaters and 2) invertebrate body burdens in natural waters can be predicted based on the <b>free</b> <b>metal</b> ion activity using speciation modelling and effects of H+ competition...|$|R
