40|$|International audienceIn [8] an {{algorithm}} {{has been}} presented that computes a maximal independent set (MIS) within O(log^ 2 n/F + log n polyloglog n) rounds in an n-node <b>multichannel</b> <b>radio</b> network with F communication channels. The paper uses a multichannel variant of the standard graph-based radio network model without collision detection and it assumes that the network graph is a polynomially bounded independence graph (BIG), a natural combinatorial generalization of well-known geographic families. The upper bound of [8] {{is known to be}} optimal up to the polyloglog n factor. In this paper, we adapt this algorithm and its analysis to improve the result of [8] in two ways. Mainly, we get rid of the polyloglog n factor in the running time and we thus obtain an asymptotically optimal <b>multichannel</b> <b>radio</b> network MIS algorithm. In addition, our new analysis allows to generalize the class of graphs from those with polynomially bounded local independence to graphs where the local independence is bounded by an arbitrary function of the neighborhood radius...|$|R

40|$|A {{digital signal}} {{processing}} solution for <b>multichannel</b> <b>Radio</b> communication systems {{of the future will}} require a large increase in user capacity. To achieve this, cell sizes will reduce and the number of base stations will increase. Current base station architectures use analogue combining techniques which are expensive, voluminous and inflexible. This thesis investigates a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) solution which produces a cheaper, smaller and more flexible multichannel base station transmitter design. The main design challenges of the new DSP low power combining architecture are the multichannel combining algorithm, the frequency translation of the <b>multichannel</b> signal to <b>radio</b> frequency, the Digital to Analogue Conversion (DAC) interface and the wideband ultra-linear power amplifier.
