5000|$|Since the {{formation}} of wetting layers occurs in a commensurate fashion at a crystal surface, there is often an associated misfit between the film and the substrate due to the different lattice parameters of each material. Attachment of the thinner film to the thicker substrate induces a <b>misfit</b> <b>strain</b> at the interface given by [...] Here [...] and [...] are the film and substrate lattice constants, respectively. As the wetting layer thickens, the associated strain energy increases rapidly. In order to relieve the strain, island formation can occur in either a dislocated or coherent fashion. In dislocated islands, strain relief arises by forming interfacial misfit dislocations. The reduction in strain energy accommodated by introducing a dislocation is generally greater than the concomitant cost of increased surface energy associated with creating the clusters. The thickness of the wetting layer at which island nucleation initiates, called the critical thickness , {{is strongly dependent on}} the lattice mismatch between the film and substrate, with a greater mismatch leading to smaller critical thicknesses.

5000|$|The {{prediction}} of high-temperature superconductivity transition temperatures is rightly {{considered to be}} one of the most difficult problems in theoretical physics. The problem remained elusive for many years since these materials have generally a very complex structure making unuseful theoretical modelling for a homogeneous system. The advances in experimental investigation on local lattice fluctuations have driven the community to the conclusion that it is a problem of quantum physics in complex matter. A growing paradigm for high-temperature superconductivity in superstripes is that a key term is the quantum interference effect between pairing channels, i.e., a resonance in the exchange-like, Josephson-like pair transfer term between different condensates. The quantum configuration interaction between different pairing channels is a particular case of shape resonance belonging to the group of Fano Feshbach resonances in atomic and nuclear physics. The critical temperature shows a suppression, due to a Fano antiresonance, when the chemical potential is tuned at a band edge where a new Fermi surface spot appears i.e., an [...] "electronic topological transition" [...] (ETT) or 2.5 Lifshitz transition or, a metal-to-metal topological transition. The Tc amplification is switched on when the chemical potential is tuned above the band edge in an energy region away from the band edge of the order of 1 or 2 times the energy cut off of the pairing interaction. The Tc is further amplified at the shape resonance if in this range the Fermi surface of the appearing fermi surface spot changes its dimensionality (for example the Lifshitz transition for opening a neck in a tubular Fermi surface).The tuning of the chemical potential at the shape resonance can be obtained by changing: the charge density and/or the superlattice structural parameters, and/or the superlattice <b>misfit</b> <b>strain</b> and/or the disorder. Direct evidence for shape resonances in superstripes matter is provided by the anomalous variation of the isotope effect on the critical temperature by tuning the chemical potential.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>misfit</b> <b>strain</b> and deadlayer on the {{polarization}} switching of epitaxial ferroelectric thin film is investigated using a phase field model. Simulation {{results show that}} a compressive <b>misfit</b> <b>strain</b> increases the coercive field and remanent polarization of ferroelectric thin film with deadlayers, whereas a tensile <b>misfit</b> <b>strain</b> decreases these factors. The presence of a deadlayer between the ferroelectric thin film and the electrode prevents charge compensation on the ferroelectric surface and reduces the coercive field and remanent polarization of the film. A periodic a/c/a/c multiple domain structure is found in ferroelectric thin film with tensile <b>misfit</b> <b>strain</b> {{when there is no}} deadlayer. However, when a deadlayer is present in the film, the c domains vanish and the out-of-plane component of polarization degrades. The degradation of the out-of-plane polarization makes ferroelectric thin films with tensile <b>misfit</b> <b>strain</b> and deadlayers lose their ferroelectric property in the thickness direction, which {{can be attributed to the}} combined effects of the deadlayer and tensile strain.

Compressive <b>misfit</b> <b>strains</b> stimulate appearance of the spontaneous in-plane structural order parameter. Gradients of the structural order parameter components, which inevitably exist {{in the vicinity of}} film surfaces due to the termination and symmetry breaking, induce improper polarization and pyroelectric response via the flexoelectric and rotostriction coupling mechanism. Flexoelectric and rotostriction coupling results in the roto-flexoelectric field that is antisymmetric inside the film, small in {{the central part of the}} film, where the gradients of the structural parameter are small, and maximal near the surfaces, where the gradients of the structural parameter are highest.
