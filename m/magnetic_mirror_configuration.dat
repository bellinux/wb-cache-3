40|$|A {{study is}} made of a toroidally linked mirror system with a zero {{rotational}} transform and a three-dimensional magnetic field that ensures good confinement of charged particles. A toroidally linked <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration</b> at low plasma pressures is calculated by numerically solving the isometry equation for the magnetic field to second order in the small parameter of the paraxial approximation. The calculations carried out with the VMEC code for a particular linked <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration</b> demonstrate the possibility of achieving good confinement of drifting particles. The calculated results show that it is, in principle, possible to link mirror cells into a toroidal configuration capable of providing plasma confinement at a tokamak level.

40|$|A Monte Carlo {{model has}} been {{developed}} for investigating the electron behavior in a dual-magnetron sputter deposition system. To describe the three-dimensional (3 D) geometry, different reference frames, i. e. a local and a global coordinate system, were used. In this study, the influence of both closed and <b>mirror</b> <b>magnetic</b> field <b>configurations</b> on the plasma properties is investigated. In {{the case of a}} closed magnetic field configuration, the calculated electron trajectories show that if an electron is emitted in (or near) the center of the cathode, where the influence of the magnetic field is low, it is able to travel from one magnetron to the other. On the other hand, when an electron is created at the race track area, it is more or less trapped in the strong magnetic field and cannot easily escape to the second magnetron region. In the case of a <b>mirror</b> <b>magnetic</b> field <b>configuration,</b> irrespective of where the electron is emitted from the cathode, it cannot travel from one magnetron to the other because the magnetic field lines guide the electron to the substrate.

40|$|Plasma {{propulsion}} is {{an advanced}} propulsion concept {{with the potential}} to realize very high specific impulse. Present designs for plasma propulsion devices share a common feature, the incorporation of a magnetic mirror. A magnetic mirror is a plasma confinement scheme whereby charged particles are trapped (or reflected) between two regions of high magnetic field strength. A cylindrical geometry is most often employed to create a magnetic mirror, which is a natural geometry for propulsion devices. To utilize the <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration</b> in a plasma propulsion device, however, will require efficient coupling of power into the system. With the development of compact and efficient electron sources, such as hollow cathode sources, coupling power into a magnetic mirror using electron beams may be an attractive approach.

40|$|The Maryland Centrifugal eXperiment (MCX) is a {{hydrogen}} plasma confinement experiment with a rotating <b>mirror</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration.</b> This experiment was de-signed {{to test the}} concepts of centrifugal confinement and velocity shear stabilization which may allow scaleability to a fusion reactor. These two concepts, however, rely on supersonic plasma fluid velocities, which, apart from possible plasma instabilities, could be greatly reduced by fluid drag with neutral hydrogen, leading to decreased confinement. Resonant charge exchange between {{a hydrogen}} ion and a hydrogen atom {{is believed to be}} the dominant drag mechanism on the rotating plasma. Neu-tral hydrogen emission lines (particularly the Balmer-α line, Hα) are therefore of primary interest in diagnosing how neutral hydrogen affects plasma confinement. For this purpose, a multi-chord Hα emission detector (multi-chord HED) was designed and constructed by the author in order to measure emissivity profiles. These pro-files, together with an atomic collisional-radiative model, provide estimates of neutral hydrogen density and local charge-exchange times.

40|$|International audienceTrapCAD is a PC-code {{available}} for simulating both the lost and non-lost electrons moving inside an ECRIS (electron-cyclotron-resonance ion source) plasma.

40|$|A shear Alfvén wave at {{slightly}} below the ion-cyclotron frequency overcomes the ion-cyclotron damping and grows {{because of the}} strong anisotropy of the ion temperature in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration,</b> and is called the Alfvén ion-cyclotron (AIC) wave. Density fluctuations caused by the AIC waves and the ion-cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) waves used for ion heating have been detected using a reflectometer in a wide radial region of the GAMMA 10 tandem mirror plasma. Various wave-wave couplings are clearly observed in the density fluctuations {{in the interior of}} the plasma, but these couplings are not so clear in the magnetic fluctuations at the plasma edge when measured using a pick-up coil. A radial dependence of the nonlinearity is found, particularly in waves with the difference frequencies of the AIC waves; bispectral analysis shows that such wave-wave coupling is significant near the core, but is not so evident at the periphery. In contrast, nonlinear coupling with the low-frequency background turbulence is quite distinct at the periphery. Nonlinear coupling associated with the AIC waves may {{play a significant role in}} the beta- and anisotropy-limits of a mirror-confined plasma through decay of the ICRF heating power and degradation of the plasma confinement by nonlinearly generated waves...|$|E
40|$|The gasdynamic mirror {{propulsion}} {{system is a}} device that utilizes a <b>magnetic</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration</b> to confine a hot plasma to allow fusion reactions to take place while ejecting {{a fraction of the}} energetic charged particles through one end to generate thrust. Because the fusion fuel is generally an isotope of hydrogen, e. g., deuterium or tritium, this propulsion device is capable of producing very large specific impulses (e. g., 200, 000 seconds) but at modest thrusts. Since large thrusts are desirable, not only for reducing travel time but also for lifting sizable payloads, we have examined methods by which GDM’s thrust could be enhanced. The first consists of utilizing the radiation generated by the plasma, namely bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation, to heat a hydrogen propellant which upon exhausting through a nozzle produces the additional thrust. We asses the performance in this case by using an ideal model that ignores heat transfer considerations of the chamber wall, and one that takes into account heat flow and wall temperature limitations. We find {{in the case of a}} DT burning plasma that although thrust enhancement is significant, it was more than offset by the large drop in the specific impulse and a concomitant increase in travel time. The second method consisted of not altering the original GDM operation, but simply increasing the density of the injected plasma to achieve higher thrust. It is shown that the latter approach is more effective since it is compatible with improved performance in that it reduces trip time but at the expense of larger vehicle mass. For a D-He 3 D-He 3 burning device the use of hydrogen to enhance thrust appears to be more desirable since the radiated power that goes into heating the hydrogen propellant is quite large. © 1997 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
