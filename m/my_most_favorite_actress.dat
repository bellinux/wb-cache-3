Bittersweet optimism is <b>my</b> <b>most</b> <b>favorite</b> of tones, and always has been. That Community can still pull it off (on a somewhat regular basis, no less) is a good sign for its creative renewal." ...|$|R

40|$|Last {{summer was}} {{different}} for me: no camps for a change! I stayed {{home with my}} younger brother and did things that I would normally {{not have time to}} do. One such day I finished playing many board games with my parents and when they got bored (actually they kept losing and didn’t want to play anymore) I went to the computer to do coding and then thought today has been an amazingly cool day.

5000|$|Julia M. Heinen, Professor of Clarinet, California State University, Northridge, United States": [...] ""Based on the {{recommendation}} of the wonderful clarinetist, Michele Z. I {{have to tell you that}} this is now <b>my</b> <b>most</b> <b>favorite</b> recording of the Mozart Concerto. I can only hope all clarinetists near and far will learn from this unique interpretation. Bravo Mr.Ognenovski, you've set a new standard."; David Gilman, orchestral & solo clarinetist, Lake Forest, California: [...] "I must concur with my colleague, Michele Z., for her astute observations regarding Mr. Ognenovski's artistry. His subtle phrasing and amazing tone leave one breathless. Words cannot adequately describe the impression his recordings make. One must experience them to believe it. I can still hardly believe it myself."Erika Borsos: [...] "This reviewer is familiar with the three B's of classical music: Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms and can distinguish their styles, one can *now* add a fourth [...] "B" [...] which stands for [...] "Balkan" [...] as played by Tale Ognenovski. Mr. Ognenovski plays Mozart with his own inimitable personal style making the classical music take on mysterious and exotic characteristics and overtones… Ognenovski explodes with passion as he performs his own [...] "Tale Ognenovski Concerto for Clarinet No. 1" ... The labyrinthine musical pathways he creates are enormously pleasing to the listener. The pentatonic scale and odd metered rhythms of Macedonia awaken the listener to new vistas of musical excitement and enjoyment. Anyone who loves jazz improvisation and the sounds of the clarinet will immediately recognize the superior creativity, breath control and complete mastery of this instrument as played by Mr. Ognenovski…" ...|$|R
5000|$|Smith {{learned about}} cartooning from comic strips, comic books, and {{animated}} TV shows. The strip he {{found to be}} the most entertaining was Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts, which he had his father read to him every Sunday, and which inspired him to learn to read. Smith was also inspired by Scrooge McDuck creator Carl Barks, whom Smith calls a [...] "natural comic genius" [...] for his ability to move characters effectively from panel to panel, and for their expressiveness. Alluding to the influence of Barks' influence on Bone, Smith commented, [...] "I always wanted Uncle Scrooge to go on a longer adventure. I thought, 'Man, if you could just get a comic book of that quality, the length of say, War and Peace, or The Odyssey or something, that would be something I would love to read, and even as a kid I looked everywhere for that book, that Uncle Scrooge story that was 1,100 pages long." [...] Another seminal influence began when Smith was nine, and he saw The Pogo Special Birthday Special on TV, which was created by Walt Kelly and Chuck Jones, whom he would later call [...] "two of <b>my</b> <b>most</b> <b>favorite</b> people". The day after that program aired, a girl brought her father's Pogo book to school and gave it to Smith, who says it [...] "changed comics" [...] for him. Smith keeps that book on a table next to his drawing board today, and refers to Kelly as his [...] "biggest influence in writing comics".|$|R
