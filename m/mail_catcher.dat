50|$|Carson's {{chocolate}} factory occupied {{the centre of}} the triangle (along with its own cricket pitch) and had its own siding which saw chocolate trains until the early 1960s. The station also handled a lot of racing pigeon traffic, the birds being loaded into special vans. The mail train, which {{in the days of the}} Travelling Post Office always had to have the <b>mail</b> <b>catcher</b> on the left, was turned every day on the triangle until the mid-1960s.|$|E
50|$|The mail {{on-the-fly}} was not {{a smooth}} operating technique. One problem with the technique was that the postal clerk had {{to pay close attention}} when he raised the train's catcher arm. If it was raised too early there was a chance of hitting and destroying switch targets, telegraph poles, and railway semaphore signals, as well as the train's <b>mail</b> <b>catcher</b> arm. If the clerk was too late in raising the train's catcher arm, he might miss the catcher pouch altogether.|$|E
50|$|Back in Toad Hall, Rat and Mole are evicted by the Weasels, {{who have}} annexed Toad Hall for themselves. Rat and Mole tunnel under the castle to free Toad, {{but he is}} helped by the {{sympathetic}} Jailer's Daughter and her reluctant Tea Lady Aunt. Toad escapes, disguised as the latter. Having forgotten Toad's wallet in his cell, Toad, Rat, and Mole board a train. The police however, have stowed away on the carriages, demand the train be stopped. Toad confesses the truth and begs the driver to help him evade his captors. If only to protect his train, the driver agrees to help. He tosses coal at the police, but gets caught in a <b>mail</b> <b>catcher.</b> Toad takes control of the train and is separated. He eventually crashes the engine, though he miraculously survives. Toad sets off again but is caught again by the Weasels.|$|E
50|$|Catcher pouches {{could not}} be used for any other purpose. The catcher pouch was to be used only for letters (sometimes {{newspapers}} were an exception). The maximum weight of a filled catcher pouch was to be 50 pounds. The catcher pouch was to be locked and placed upside down on the mail crane no sooner than 10 minutes before the scheduled arrival of the <b>Mail</b> Train. The <b>catcher</b> pouch was to be tied in the middle before it was to be transferred. If a small amount of mail, it should be put in the lower half below the tie strap. If a large amount of mail, it should be divided equally between the upper half and {{the lower half of the}} catcher pouch.|$|R
