25|$|Where the Host {{is carried}} in {{procession}} (often {{encased in a}} <b>monstrance),</b> it is covered always by a canopy, and accompanied by lights. At the litaniae majores and minores and other penitential processions, joyful hymns are not allowed, but the litanies are sung, and, if {{the length of the}} procession requires, the penitential and gradual psalms. As to the discipline regarding processions the bishop, according to the Council of Trent (Sess. 25 de reg. cap. 6), appoints and regulates processions and public prayers outside the churches.|$|E
5000|$|The museum {{collections}} of early prints include the priceless manuscript of St. Augustine of Hippo from 1425 titled [...] "De civitate Dei".

5000|$|<b>Monstrances</b> {{are usually}} {{elaborate}} in design; most are {{carried by the}} priest. Others may be much larger fixed constructions, typically for displaying the host in a special side chapel, often called the [...] "Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament".

25|$|Since 1885 (before {{construction}} {{had been}} completed) the Blessed Sacrament (Christ's body, consecrated during the Mass) has been continually {{on display in}} a <b>monstrance</b> above the high altar. Perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament has continued uninterrupted in the basilica since 1885. Because of this, tourists and others are asked to dress appropriately when visiting the basilica and to observe silence as much as possible, {{so as not to}} disturb persons who have come {{from around the world to}} pray in this place of pilgrimage.|$|E
25|$|Eucharistic adoration is a {{practice}} in the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic and some Lutheran traditions, in which the Blessed Sacrament is exposed to and adored by the faithful. When this exposure and adoration is constant (twenty-four hours a day), it is called Perpetual Adoration. In a parish, this is usually done by volunteer parishioners; in a monastery or convent, it {{is done by the}} resident monks or nuns. In the Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, the Eucharist is displayed in a <b>monstrance,</b> typically placed on an altar, at times with a light focused on it, or with candles flanking it.|$|E
25|$|St Catherine of Alexandria, {{the patron}} saint of nuns, sits {{to the left of the}} throne with her emblems, the {{breaking}} wheel on which she was tortured and the sword used for her beheading. She wears a crown and is dressed in a surcoat over a costly brocade skirt, symbols of royal status. St Barbara, patron of soldiers, sits opposite reading a missal in front of her emblem (the tower in which her father held her prisoner), which is shaped as a <b>monstrance</b> meant to hold the sacramental bread. Weale thought Catherine was an early portrait of Mary of Burgundy and that Memling's Barbara is perhaps the earliest likeness of Margaret of York.|$|E

50|$|In architecture, the sunburst {{is often}} used in window designs, {{including}} fanlights and rose windows, {{as well as in}} decorative motifs. The sunburst motif is characteristic of Baroque church metalwork, especially <b>monstrances</b> and votive crowns, and Art Deco and Art Nouveau styles as well as church architecture. A sunburst is frequently used in emblems and military decorations.|$|R
50|$|The Cathedral of Toledo, Spain boasts one of {{the most}} famous <b>monstrances</b> in European medieval history. Made of pure silver and encrusted with several jewels, it has merited several papal processions, acclamations and uses. Most {{recently}} among these is Pope Benedict XVI in his World Youth Day Apostolic Visit in 2011. It has also been immortalized in several 18th-century and 19th-century devotional handbooks.|$|R
25|$|A second {{purpose of}} {{reservation}} {{is that it}} might be a focus of prayer. In the 3rd century, catechumens baptized at Easter or Pentecost might spend eight days in meditation before the Blessed Sacrament, reserved in a home-church, before Christianity was legalized. However, only since the year 1000, or even later, was the Blessed Sacrament kept in churches so that the faithful might visit It or pray before It. Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament in the Roman Catholic Church and Anglican Churches for the purposes of adoration has been current since the 14th century and may be either private (expositio privata), where only the doors of the tabernacle are opened, or public exposition where the Host is placed in a <b>monstrance</b> so that it may be more readily seen. Public exposition, formerly permitted only on the feast of Corpus Christi, developed only in recent centuries into a formal service known as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin County {{saw many}} {{distinct}} immigrant groups {{moving into the}} area in the late 19th century, particularly from Western Europe, and Daphne was the site of the first group which arrived in 1888. Alesandro Mastro Valero purchased land in Daphne to locate a refuge for Italian immigrants looking for a more pastoral alternative to the large urban cities of the north. In June 1895, land was purchased in Daphne for a Catholic church in what is now the center of Old Daphne to be built by the early Italian colonists. Father Angelo Chiariglione, a Scalbrini missionary from Torino, Italy, was the first resident pastor (1898-1909) of the church, known as the Church of the Assumption. This small-town church quickly gained the recognition of the Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, who in 1898 sent a gift of rich vestments, an illuminated missal, a chalice, <b>monstrance,</b> candlesticks and other articles, and all are still on display in the present Christ the King Catholic Church, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1937.|$|E
500|$|Between 1879 and 1881 he {{drew up a}} {{proposal}} for the decoration {{of the church of}} Sant Pacià, belonging to the Colegio de Jesús-María in Sant Andreu del Palomar: he created the altar in a Gothic style, the <b>monstrance</b> with Byzantine influence, the mosaics and the lighting, as well as the school's furniture. The church caught fire during the Tragic Week of 1909, and now only the mosaics remain, of [...] "opus tesselatum", probably the work of the Italian mosaicist Luigi Pellerin. He was given the task of decorating the church of the Colegio de Jesús-María in Tarragona (1880–1882): he created the altar in white Italian marble, and its front part, or antependium, with four columns bearing medallions of polychrome alabaster, with figures of angels; the ostensory with gilt wood, the work of Eudald Puntí, decorated with rosaries, angels, tetramorph symbols and the dove of the Holy Ghost; and the choir stalls, which were destroyed in 1936.|$|E
50|$|During a {{visit to}} the priory in 1228 or 1229 to consecrate an altar, Jacques de Vitry, C.R.S.A., Bishop of Saint-Jean d'Acre and later cardinal, became a patron of his work. Around that time, Hugo created what are {{considered}} among his masterpieces, an Evangeliary and a reliquary. He crafted a series of pieces in silver: reliquaries, <b>monstrances,</b> and other objects of worship, of which three signed pieces still exist.|$|R
50|$|This {{part of the}} {{treasure}} suffered most during the French period (1794-1814). Many chalices, patens, <b>monstrances</b> and other liturgical objects made of gold or silver were melted down {{in order to pay}} the war taxes that the French demanded from the canons. However, a few liturgical vessels from the Middle Ages survived and quite a few from the Baroque period (notably some Maastricht silver pieces) are still in the collection.|$|R
