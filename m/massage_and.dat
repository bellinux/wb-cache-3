5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, <b>massage</b> <b>and</b> other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{descriptions}} of Yoshiaki Omura, Brazilian psychic surgery appears {{to be different from}} that practiced in the Philippines.

Some patients are also injected with a brown liquid, and alleged minor surgery was performed in about 20% of the cases observed. While Arigó performed his procedures using kitchen knives in improvised settings, Omura reports that the clamping of blood vessels and the closing of the surgical wounds are now performed by licensed surgeons or licensed nurses.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the harsh}} discipline, gladiators {{represented}} a substantial investment for their lanista and were otherwise well fed and cared for. Their daily, high-energy, vegetarian diet consisted of barley, boiled beans, oatmeal, ash and dried fruit. Gladiators were sometimes called hordearii ("eaters of barley)". Romans considered barley inferior to wheat— a punishment for legionaries replaced their wheat ration with it— {{but it was}} thought to strengthen the body. Regular <b>massage</b> <b>and</b> high quality medical care helped mitigate an otherwise very severe training regimen. Part of Galen's medical training was at a gladiator school in Pergamum where he saw (and would later criticise) the training, diet, and long term health prospects of the gladiators.|$|E
25|$|Wright met Pamela Wright (the shared surname was coincidental) in 2001 in Felixstowe, {{and they}} moved {{to the house in}} Ipswich {{together}} in 2004. Wright had always admitted that he used sex workers and had done since he was in the Merchant Navy, and continually throughout his life. In Ipswich, he admitted he went to certain <b>massage</b> <b>and</b> sauna establishments that were actually brothels. Throughout his trial, he had stated that he had used professional sex workers on many occasions, including three of the victims and when his partner began working night shifts and their sex life became almost non existent, he returned to using professional sex workers who were based on the nearby streets, procuring a dozen in the final three months of 2006.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatments}} such as nerve grafting, tendon lengthening, tendon transfers, {{and limb}} lengthening and shortening were used extensively during this time. Patients with residual paralysis {{were treated with}} braces and taught to compensate for lost function {{with the help of}} calipers, crutches and wheelchairs. The use of devices such as rigid braces and body casts, which tended to cause muscle atrophy due to the limited movement of the user, were also touted as effective treatments. <b>Massage</b> <b>and</b> passive motion exercises were also used to treat polio victims. Most of these treatments proved to be of little therapeutic value, however several effective supportive measures for the treatment of polio did emerge during these decades including the iron lung, an anti-polio antibody serum, and a treatment regimen developed by Sister Elizabeth Kenny.|$|E
