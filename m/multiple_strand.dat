40|$|Aims: To {{establish}} a reliable protocol to extract DNA from Pasteuria penetrans endospores {{for use as}} template in <b>multiple</b> <b>strand</b> amplification, thus providing sufficient material for genetic analyses. To develop a highly sensitive PCR-based diagnostic tool for P. penetrans. Methods and Results: An optimized method to decontaminate endospores, release and purify DNA enabled <b>multiple</b> <b>strand</b> amplification. DNA purity was assessed by cloning and sequencing gyrB and 16 S rRNA gene fragments obtained from PCR using generic primers. Samples indicated to be 100 %P. penetrans by the gyrB assay were estimated at 46 % using the 16 S rRNA gene. No bias was detected on cloning and sequencing 12 housekeeping and sporulation gene fragments from amplified DNA. The detection limit by PCR with Pasteuria-specific 16 S rRNA gene primers following <b>multiple</b> <b>strand</b> amplification of DNA extracted using the method was a single endospore. Conclusions: Generation of large quantities DNA will facilitate genomic sequencing of P. penetrans. Apparent differences in sample purity are explained by variations in 16 S rRNA gene copy number in Eubacteria leading to exaggerated estimations of sample contamination. Detection of single endospores will facilitate investigations of P. penetrans molecular ecology. Significance and Impact of the Study: These methods will advance studies on P. penetrans and facilitate research on other obligate and fastidious micro-organisms where it is currently impractical to obtain DNA in sufficient quantity and quality...|$|E

40|$|Architectural {{designs for}} DNA {{nanostructures}} typically fall within {{one of two}} broad categories: tile-based designs (assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides) and origami designs (woven structures employing a biological scaffold strand and synthetic staple strands).

Goals for the new design were to use only chemically synthesized DNA, to minimize the number of component strands, and to mimic the back-and-forth, woven strand routing of the origami architectures. The resulting architectural strategy employs "weave tiles" formed from only two oligonucleotides as basic building blocks, thus decreasing the burden of matching <b>multiple</b> <b>strand</b> stoichiometries compared to previous tile-based architectures and resulting in a structurally flexible tile.

40|$|A new {{interconnection}} technique {{has been developed}} that allows versatile <b>multiple</b> <b>strand</b> connections between microsensors, sensor arrays, and chips designed for wire bonding. The new technique has been termed "Microflex interconnection" technique (MFI). Conventional wire bonding technique is commonly-restricted to planar interconnects with a limited degree of freedom for placing microsystem components in hybrid assemblies. The MFI technique has overcome this limitation by interconnecting microsystem components through custom designed flexible substrates with embedded metallized conductors, pad arrays for integrated circuits assembly and substrate integrated electrodes. Standard CMOS components without additional pad metallization can be used. The integration density of the MFI technique corresponds to flip-chip technology. Special advantages of the MFI technique are three-dimensional interconnects, the flexibility in design and shape, and easy visual inspection of alignment qualities. The method is especially suitable for small volumes of customer specified devices and biomedical implants because all materials used are biocompatible. In this paper, the MFI technique is introduced, described in detail, and tested according to international standards. The evaluation of the electrical and mechanical properties of the interconnection sites exhibited promising results regarding stability and reliability.

We show this structure persists under high Dehn filling, giving results on the torus decomposition of knots with generalized twist regions and a high amount of twisting. As an application, we give lower bounds on the Gromov norms of these knot complements and of generalized augmented links. 1...|$|R

In this report, we examine the structure of in vivo Ty 1 replication intermediates, specifically {{with regard to the}} behavior of reverse transcriptase upon reaching template ends and to the precision with which RNase H might generate these ends. While the expected 3 ′ termini were always identified, terminal nontemplated bases were also observed at all of the RNA and DNA template ends examined. Nontemplated A residues were most common at all 3 ′ ends, although C residues were preferentially added to minus-strand termini paused at the 5 ′ end of capped Ty 1 RNA. In addition, we observed that RNase H removal of the tRNA primer and of the polypurine tract was not always precise or efficient. Finally, we noted numerous instances of Ty 1 reverse transcriptase transferring from normal Ty 1 template ends to various tRNA templates, with continued synthesis to specific modified bases. A similar pattern was obtained for Ty 2, indicating that template ends offer unique opportunities for these two related reverse transcriptases to generate errors...|$|E

40|$|An Impulsive Heating <b>Multiple</b> <b>Strand</b> (IHMS) Model {{is able to}} {{reproduce}} the observational characteristics of EUV (~ 1 MK) active region loops. This model implies {{that some of the}} loops must reach temperatures where X-ray filters are sensitive (> 2. 5 MK) before they cool to EUV temperatures. Hence, some bright EUV loops must be preceded by bright X-ray loops. Previous analysis of X-ray and EUV active region observations, however, have concluded that EUV loops are not preceded by X-ray loops. In this paper, we examine two active regions observed in both X-ray and EUV filters and analyze the evolution of five loops over several hours. These loops first appear bright in the X-ray images and later appear bright in the EUV images. The delay between the appearance of the loops in the X-ray and EUV filters is as little as 1 hour and as much as 3 hours. All five loops appear as single ``monolithic'' structures in the X-ray images, but are resolved into many smaller structures in the (higher resolution) EUV images. The positions of the loops appear to shift during cooling implying that the magnetic field is changing as the loops evolve. There is no correlation between the brightness of the loop in the X-ray and EUV filters meaning a bright X-ray loop does not necessarily cool to a bright EUV loop and vice versa. The progression of the loops from X-ray images to EUV images and the observed substructure is qualitatively consistent with the IMHS model.

Genomic DNA of boiled cells was amplified by <b>multiple</b> <b>strand</b> displacement amplification (MDA), followed by several specific PCR reactions to characterize the genotype of each colony. Sequences of 3 different housekeeping genes (ftsZ, gltX, and recA), of 3 MC biosynthesis genes (mcyA, mcyB, and mcyE), and the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) were analyzed for 11 colonies of Microcystis. MCs were detected and quantified by ELISA in 7 of the 11 Microcystis colonies tested, {{in agreement with the}} detection of mcy genes. Sequence types (ST) based on the concatenated sequences of housekeeping genes from cyanobacterial colonies from Belgian water bodies appeared to be endemic when compared to those of strains described in the literature. One colony appeared to belong to a yet undiscovered lineage. A similar protocol was used for 6 colonies of the genus Woronichinia, a taxon that is very difficult to cultivate in the laboratory. The 16 S rRNA sequences of 2 colonies were obtained and were quasi identical to that of W. naegeliana 0 LE 35 S 01. For one Woronichinia colony, the mcyE PCR gave a non-specific PCR product. The corresponding amino acid sequence was 50 % identical to a Microcystis ketoacyl carrier protein transferase. This approach for the simultaneous detection and quantification of MCs with mcy genotyping, at single colony level, offers potential for the ecotoxicological characterization of environmental populations of cyanobacteria without the need for strain isolation and culture.

40|$|A new {{interconnection}} technique {{has been developed}} that allows versatile <b>multiple</b> <b>strand</b> connections between microsensors, sensor arrays, and chips designed for wire bonding. The new technique has been termed `microflex interconnects' (MFI). Conventional wire bonding technique is commonly restricted to planar interconnects with a limited degree of freedom for placing microsystem components. The MFI technique has overcome this limitation by interconnecting microsystem components through custom designed flexible foils with embedded metallized conductors. The MFI foils may also serve as circuit substrates. This basic foil material is polyimide (Du Pont PI 2611) or BCB which are patterned photolithographically. Platinum, gold or either conductive metals are sputtered or evaporated on the foil and patterned using lift-off technique. Several metallization layers can be embedded in the material. Pitch {{and shape of the}} MFI contact pads correspond to the one of the chips to be interconnected. A via hole is placed {{in the center of the}} MFI contact pads. MFI pads and chip pads are adjusted. Metal balls or wedges generate the electrical and mechanical contact through the vias between the chips and the MFI substrate. An commercial wire bonder is the only equipment needed to perform the MFI method. The MFI technique was applied to bond standard CMOS integrated circuit bond pads with a width of 30 micrometers and a pitch of 70 micrometers to a 10 micrometers thick MFI foil.

40|$|Orderly {{chromosome}} segregation {{during the first}} meiotic division requires meiotic recombination to form crossovers between homologous chromosomes (homologues). Members of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase family have been implicated in meiotic recombination. In addition, they have roles in initiation of DNA replication, DNA mismatch repair and mitotic DNA double-strand break repair. Here, we addressed the function of MCMDC 2, an atypical yet conserved MCM protein, whose function in vertebrates has not been reported. While {{we did not find}} an important role for MCMDC 2 in mitotically dividing cells, our work revealed that MCMDC 2 is essential for fertility in both sexes due to a crucial function in meiotic recombination. Meiotic recombination begins with the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks into the genome. DNA ends at break sites are resected. The resultant 3 -prime single-stranded DNA overhangs recruit RAD 51 and DMC 1 recombinases that promote the invasion of homologous duplex DNAs by the resected DNA ends. <b>Multiple</b> <b>strand</b> invasions on each chromosome promote the alignment of homologous chromosomes, which is a prerequisite for inter-homologue crossover formation during meiosis. We found that although DNA ends at break sites were evidently resected, and they recruited RAD 51 and DMC 1 recombinases, these recombinases were ineffective in promoting alignment of homologous chromosomes in the absence of MCMDC 2. Consequently, RAD 51 and DMC 1 foci, which are thought to mark early recombination intermediates, were abnormally persistent in Mcmdc 2 -/- meiocytes. Importantly, the strand invasion stabilizing MSH 4 protein, which marks more advanced recombination intermediates, did not efficiently form foci in Mcmdc 2 -/- meiocytes. Thus, our work suggests that MCMDC 2 {{plays an important role in}} either the formation, or the stabilization, of DNA strand invasion events that promote homologue alignment and provide the basis for inter-homologue crossover formation during meiotic recombination...|$|E
