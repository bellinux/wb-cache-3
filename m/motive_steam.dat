For this reason, a thermocompression evaporator often features a vapor condenser, {{due to the}} possible excess of steam necessary for the compression if compared with the steam required to evaporate the solution.The quantity Qm of <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> per unit suction quantity {{is a function of}} both the motive ratio of <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> pressure vs. suction pressure and the compression ratio of delivery pressure vs. suction pressure. In principle, the higher the compression ratio and the lower the motive ratio the higher will be the specific <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> consumption, i. e. the less efficient the energy balance.|$|E
5000|$|Thermocompression {{evaporators}} {{may reach}} higher compression ratios - at a cost. A compression ratio of 2 is possible (and sometimes more) but unless the <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> is at a reasonably high pressure (say, 16 bar g - 250 psig - or more), the <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> consumption {{will be in}} the range of 2 kg per kg of suction vapors. A higher compression ratio means a smaller heat exchanger, and a reduced investment cost. Moreover, a compressor is an expensive machine, while an ejector is much simpler and cheap.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{abrasive}} {{effect of}} the creping blade {{the surface of the}} yankee becomes irregular and rough. Therefore periodically (with very varying frequency: from every 6 months to some years)cast iron yankees have to be ground or polished. This decreases the thickness of the shell, and since the yankee is a pressure vessel, also the maximum pressure which can be used for paper production. A way to avoid this declassing of pressure is to make a metallisation, i.e. to spray onto the surface a special Chrom-Nickel alloy, similar to a high allyed stainless steel, which is then ground with the foreseen crown of the shell surface, leaving a coated thickness of ca. 0,7-1 mm. The metallised surface is then much more resistant to the abrasion and only a very mild polishing may be necessary ca. every 2 to 4 years.The thermal conductivity of the metallisation is a bit less than that of the original material, so that cast iron cylinders are metallised after some grindings of the shell, in order to gain thorugh thickness decrease some conductivity which is then again lost with the metallisation. Steel yankees are instead always metallised since the beginning. The big dimension generates a problem with the elimination of the condensate forming inside the cylinders, therefore all yankees use a system with blow through steam which than it is re-compressed by help of a thermocompressor (ejector). In the inner surface of the yankee circular grooves are present which accommodate small pipes (s.c. [...] "straw pipes" [...] or [...] "straws") through which the mixture of steam and condensate is sucked ba means of a pressure difference between the yankee and the tank collecting the condensate (separator). The straws are combined in racks and these go to typically 6 collectors which take the condensate-steam mixture towards the center of the cylinder from which then it is taken out into usual piping and brought to the separator. Here the condensate and the blow through steam separate at a lower pressure than that inside the yankee.In order not to spoil the blow through steam, a thermocompressor uses <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> (at a pressure ca. the double of that in the yankee) in order to increase again the pressure of the blow through steam to the value of the yankee.|$|E

40|$|Multiple -effect {{evaporator}} (MEE) is {{used for}} concentrating the liquor. A substantial energy saving {{can be achieved by}} integrating MEE with a thermo-vapor compressor (TVC). TVC is a device in which the lowpressure vapor produced from MEE is compressed {{with the help of the}} high-pressure <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> supplied externally, to produce a medium pressure vapor. This medium pressure vapor acts as a heat source for MEE. The high-pressure <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> can be produced from concentrating solar thermal system, which is a renewable and non-polluting source of energy. The present study deals with the integration of linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) with MEE-TVC system. The objective of the present work is to minimize the total annual cost for the integrated MEE-TVC and LFR system. The important parameters affecting the annual cost for the integrated system are solar design radiation and temperature of the <b>motive</b> <b>steam.</b> A methodology is developed to determine the optimal solar radiation and steam temperature. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study for manufacturing of corn glucose. The annual cost for the system is 87, 106 Sly, with optimal steam temperature 250 degrees C and optimal design radiation 600 W/m(2). Sensitivity analysis is also carried out for the selection of the optimal operating parameters. The cost of the auxiliary heating source plays a dominating factor on the economic feasibility of the integrated system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The use of modular {{parallel}} plate falling film heat exchangers, optimization of thermal vapor compressor (TVC) entrainment ratio, and overall process thermal management increase the flexibility and overall efficiency of Multiple Effect Distillation (MED). A generic computational MED system {{model with a}} TVC and heat addition using classical compressible gas dynamic relationships is employed. An algorithm is presented which optimizes the performance ratio (PR) thru variation {{of the number of}} TVC and entrainment ratio. The result is minimization of exergetic losses at the lowest possible inlet pressure condition to the first MED stage, reducing required <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> pressure. Capture of unused thermal losses from low temperature sources, to heat the TVC inlet <b>motive</b> <b>steam,</b> reduces the required <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> temperature. The results of a parametric study confirm the Brayton power cycle analysis that the use of MED-TVC thermal harvest configuration for integration into a Concentrated Solar Power - Desalination of Seawater (CSP-DSW) dual-purpose plant improves the overall performance of both systems. Furthermore, the integration of a control system related to the inlet seawater temperature and fluctuations from the thermal heat input into the MED significantly increase the performance of the system by around 20 %. Preliminary modeling of the MED-TVC with heat addition shows a decrease in overall thermal losses of the dual-purpose plant; the system generates more power and similar potable water for the same solar flux.

40|$|Thermo-vapor {{compressor}} (TVC) is {{used for}} compressing the low-pressure vapor {{with the help of}} the high-pressure <b>motive</b> <b>steam,</b> to produce the medium pressure vapor. A substantial portion of energy may be conserved by integrating TVC with the multiple-effect evaporator (MEE). The common practice in desalination industry is to compress the vapor produced in the last effect of a MEE using TVC to reduce the overall <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> requirement. Such integration does not necessarily guarantee energy optimality. The objective of the present work is to optimally integrate TVC with a MEE system to maximize the gain output ratio (GOR). GOR is defined as the ratio of the mass flow rate of vapor produced in MEE to the mass flow rate of the <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> supplied to TVC. GOR is the measure of the energy efficiency of MEE system. Using the principles of Pinch Analysis and techniques of mathematical optimization, a new methodology for integration of TVC with MEE is proposed in this paper. This is the first analytical methodology to optimally integrate TVC with MEE, avoiding multiple simulations of the overall system. A Theorem is proposed to directly calculate the optimal location of TVC suction position. The proposed methodology gives the designer the freedom to design an MEE-TVC with minimum energy consumption and without carrying out the detailed simulation of the entire system. The methodology is demonstrated through the illustrative case studies for concentrating corn glucose, and freshwater production through thermal desalination. In the case of corn glucose, the optimal integration of TVC with 2 -effect MEE resulted in the increase in GOR by 10. 1 % with a decrease in the specific area requirement by 4. 1 %. For a desalination system with 11 -effect MEE, the optimal integration of TVC improves the GOR by 1. 5 % and reduces the specific area by 4. 3 %. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the optimal operating parameters for both case studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Super-atmospheric operation is profitable for small-scale applications by eliminating infiltration of non-condensable gases. The two main devices that are used to eliminate the non-condensable gases with a cycle operating with sub-atmospheric fluids are steam jet air ejectors (SJAE) and liquid ring vacuum pumps. SJAE use high pressure <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> to evacuate the non-condensables from the condenser (jet pump).

The systems analyse reveals that the consumption of <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> and cooling water can be reduced when (i) the last stage of vacuum systems employs a water-ring vacuum pump instead of steam ejectors; (ii) four-stage vacuum systems are applied when cooling water with temperature above 30 ° is used; (iii) the first stage of vacuum system is without a condenser when the plant uses cooling water with temperature above 30 °C; (iv) the values of intermediate pressures in {{the end of the first}} and the second stages are optimized by means of a minimization of the total consumption of <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> and cooling water in these stages. An engineering approach was developed for determining the eligible surface roughness of ejectors depending on Re number and the diameter of actual section. This approach assures to be obtained a minimal linear friction factor in each section. On this basis the eligible values of roughness average Ra for seven representative sec- tions of ejectors were specified.

40|$|Multiple-effect {{evaporators}} {{are commonly}} used in various industries such as food process, desalination, pulp and paper, etc. for increasing the liquor concentration. Multiple-effect evaporator is an energy intensive equipment. It is often integrated with various energy saving techniques for minimizing the energy consumption. A common technique is integration of multiple-effect evaporator with thermovapor compressor. In thermo-vapor compressor the low-pressure vapor produced in multiple-effect evaporator is compressed {{with the help of}} the high-pressure <b>motive</b> <b>steam</b> to produce an intermediate-pressure vapor, which in turn acts as a heat source for the multiple-effect evaporator. The optimal location of vapor suction position for thermo-vapor compressor can significantly affect the energy consumption of integrated multiple-effect evaporator and thermo-vapor compressor system. The other way of reducing the energy consumption is by integrating multiple-effect evaporator with the background process. The present work focuses on the development of a methodology to minimize the overall energy consumption by thermally integrating multiple-effect evaporator, thermo-vapor compressor, and the background process. A theorem for optimal location of vapor suction position for thermo-vapor compressor is proposed. Two examples are considered in this study for demonstrating the proposed methodology. An economic analysis is also carried out for calculating the cost benefit for the overall integration. Overall integration leads to 28 % of energy saving and 22 % reduction in annual cost for corn glucose example compared to standalone system. Similarly, for desalination example, 44 % energy and 20 % annual cost savings are observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
