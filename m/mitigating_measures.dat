Secondly, there was the identification of the osteophagia and pica syndrome which led to the feeding of bone-meal as a successful <b>mitigating</b> <b>measure</b> as well as the establishment that botulism was not due to a plant poisoning. Thirdly, the solution of the problem depended on the integration of experience and knowledge from diverse disciplines such as soil science, animal behaviour and husbandry, nutrition, botany and ultimately advanced bacteriology and the science of immunology.

40|$|Abstract: Waste {{management}} in Nigeria and {{other developing countries}} has remained chaotic in spite of institutional and legal framework initiated to check the menace of reckless waste disposal.

Stakeholder relations recognizes waste control/management as a project whose success aptly depend on the active role of each stakeholder; hence, those who manage waste control projects must identify, analyze the relevant stakeholders and engage them appropriately so that they can willingly participate and take responsibility and ownership of the environment. This article assumes that when effective stakeholder relations are adopted it will engender hygienic behavior change amongst relevant stakeholders. It concludes that active cooperation of individuals and community participation in waste management is a function of effective stakeholder relations...|$|R

50|$|Mainly {{due to the}} {{international}} arms embargo to Portugal, the Air Force had to struggle with a limitation of means, being obliged to extend the use of old aircraft or to employ aircraft that were not suited {{for the kind of}} warfare that was being fought. As an example, in 1972, to cover Angola - a territory with almost the size of all the Western Europe - the FAP had available only 30 helicopters, 44 light aircraft, 13 transport planes, six light bombers and four jet fighters, most of these being old aircraft from the 1940s and 1950s.On the other side, the nationalist movements that opposed Portugal were generously supported by the Soviet Union, by other Communist countries and even by some countries of Western Europe, receiving state of the art equipment, what made them to be in many cases equipped with more modern weapons than the Portuguese. A large challenge faced specifically by the Air Force was the increasing antiaircraft capacity of the nationalist forces. This evolved to a dramatic situation in the Guinea theater, when the PAIGC forces received SA-7 Strela surface-to-air missiles and began using them against the Portuguese aircraft. The Portuguese pilots were able to evade the first detected missile launches, but in March 1973, a Fiat G.91 jet is hit and shot down, followed by another G.91 in the same month and then by two Dornier Do 27 and one T-6 in the following month. This originated the loss of FAP's air supremacy, limiting its air activities, namely in the air support to the ground forces and the air casualty evacuation, what caused a negative impact on the morale of the Portuguese forces, especially amongst the constantly flagellated border garrisons. After the initial surprise, the Air Force was however been able to quickly fully resume air operations, adopting <b>mitigating</b> <b>measures,</b> like the changing of the flight profiles or the painting of the aircraft with anti-radiation paint.|$|E

The initial fresh-salt water distribution is based on an existing map of the depth of the fresh-salt water interface with additional electromagnetic borehole loggings. MOCDENS 3 D is used to simulate the 3 D groundwater flow. After this first simulation the evolution of the fresh-salt water distribution and flow is simulated for a period of 50 years taking into account the expansion of the estuary and its surrounding tidal flats with a surface of 120 hectare. This action results in an increase of the salt water seepage area in the adjacent polder area.
