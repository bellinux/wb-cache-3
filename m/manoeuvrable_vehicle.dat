50|$|The SPA-Viberti AS.42 Sahariana was an Italian {{reconnaissance}} car of World War II. The AS 42 Sahariana {{was developed}} by SPA-Viberti using the same chassis as the AB 41 armoured car, including its four-wheel steering, specifically for desert operations, primarily in a reconnaissance role. Its origins trace back to requests stemming from units operating on the North African Front for a long range, highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> <b>vehicle,</b> similar to those widely used by the highly successful British reconnaissance forces, the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{three-wheeled}} vehicle, {{called an}} “auto-rickshaw”, with a four-stroke petrol, LPG or CNG engine {{is one of}} the most common and affordable means of transportation (for hire) in Indian cities. It is a small, highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> <b>vehicle</b> and ideally suited for the narrow and traffic clogged streets of urban India. Electric and hybrid vehicles are particularly suited for use in urban areas since city transportation is mainly characterized by relatively short driving distances, low continuous power requirements, long idling times and high availability of regenerative braking energy. These characteristics, when carefully incorporated into the design process, create valuable opportunities for developing clean, efficient and cost effective urban vehicle propulsion systems. A novel, low cost, test-bed for experimenting with hybrid propulsion systems for urban areas is developed and presented in this work. The main objective of this work is to study the performance of a parallel hybrid configuration with a DC hub motor and an IC engine. The hybrid configuration in this case adds speed at the wheel output unlike the normal power split configuration which adds torque. The addition of speed is done by connecting the output of engine and CVT to the stator of an electric hub motor. This novel setup is compared with torque addition where the output of the engine is coupled with the output of the DC motor using a gear transmission arrangement...|$|E

30|$|Heterogeneous traffic mixes are {{the common}} sight of {{appearance}} {{in all the}} developing economies including India. The behaviour of heterogeneous traffic mix on urban arterials is described in various studies [4, 5, 6]. In brief, the traffic streams comprise small and highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as motorised two wheelers (MTW) and motorised three-wheelers (MThW). They continuously search for the gaps in the stream to move downstream even in the congested condition, which is described as creeping behaviour. Highway capacity is greatly affected by widely varying physical and dynamical characteristics of vehicles {{in addition to the}} absence of lane discipline. There is {{a significant difference between the}} behaviour of homogenous and heterogeneous traffic streams. Thus, it is interesting to study the relationship between traffic stream variables under heterogeneous traffic flow conditions and the functional forms that represent it.|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{atmospheric}} re-entry onto Earth and Mars is analysed concerning uncertainties. These uncertainties can {{arise in the}} modelling and the initial entry angle and velocity during the re-entry leading to hazards and malfunctions influencing the mission success. Therefore, the temporal evolution of uncertainties throughout the re-entry, descent and landing is examined using the Stochastic Liouville Equation. This equation yields probability density functions depending on {{the states of the}} system dynamics and the time. From this a most probable trajectory together with 1 -sigma and 3 -sigma error bars can be estimated giving an impression on the influence of uncertainties. Furthermore, the covariance matrices are deduced from the probability density functions generating landing dispersions at the end time of the re-entry. Beside ballistic trajectories also optimal trajectories for <b>manoeuvrable</b> re-entry <b>vehicles</b> are analysed. In this case, the re-entry vehicle is controllable in its flight path angle and the trajectories are optimized concerning the descent time...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{enhanced}} automation {{in the marine}} and maritime fields is fostering research into robust and highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> autonomous underwater <b>vehicles.</b> To address these needs we develop design principles {{for a new generation}} of soft-bodied aquatic vehicles similar to octopi and squids. In particular, we consider the capability of pulsed-jetting bodies to boost thrust by actively modifying their external body-shape and in this way benefit of the contribution from added-mass variation. We present an analytical formulation of the coupled fluid-structure interaction between the elastic body and the ambient fluid. The model incorporates a number of new salient contributions to the soft-body dynamics. We highlight the role of added-mass variation effects of the external fluid in enhancing thrust and assess how the shape-changing actuation is impeded by a confinement-related unsteady inertial term and by an external shape-dependent fluid stiffness contribution. We show how the analysis of these combined terms has guided us to the design of a new prototype of a squid-inspired vehicle and to the tuning of the natural frequency of the coupled fluid-solid system with the purpose of optimizing its actuation routine...|$|R
40|$|The {{missions}} {{being proposed}} for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), by both marine scientists and industry, {{are becoming increasingly}} complex and challenging. In order to meet these demands {{the next generation of}} AUVs will need to be faster, to operate for longer durations, and to be more <b>manoeuvrable</b> than existing <b>vehicles.</b> It is therefore vital that the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on a self-propelled manoeuvring AUV can be predicted accurately at the initial design stage. In order to achieve this, the use of a computational-fluid-dynamics-based analysis is suggested. The approaches developed are predominantly steady state and suitable for running on a workstation personal computer using a commercial software licence. It is estimated that the proposed simulations would take a competent user less than 1 month for a new concept design. The total cost of these simulations is significantly lower than the cost of building a model and having it commercially tested to capture the same level of detail for the resistance, propulsion, and manoeuvring performance. Based on the validation studies presented, it is estimated that on a 2 × 106 element structured mesh a competent user should be able to predict hydrodynamic forces to within at least 10 per cent and moments to within 20 per cent of in-service performance...|$|R
40|$|CubeSats {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} one of the easiest and cheapest ways to exploit space. At the same time the effort in expanding and enhancing their capabilities is rapidly leading to the definition of a very responsive standardized platform with a number of possible applications. One of the major performance-limiting factors for CubeSats, however, is the near- impossibility of selecting, maintaining or changing operational orbits at will. So far, CubeSats have been launched as piggyback payloads; as such, they have no command on the operational orbits in which they will be released. A cost-effective and flexible solution to deploy a swarm of nanosatellites into different orbits is represented by a <b>manoeuvrable</b> deployment <b>vehicle</b> equipped with electric propulsion currently under development at Alta. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present this new approach for the CubeSat deployment system. Instead of going through the endeavour of embedding a propulsion system into a single CubeSat, the idea is to provide the deployment system with thrusting capabilities and to use this platform to deliver the various CubeSats into different orbits. The alternative presented here is to consider a manoeuvrable platform as an effective solution to deploy a set of CubeSats into different orbits. Following this approach, it would be possible to have a whole CubeSat constellation deployed on different planes and/or at different altitudes, thus offering a wide range of opportunities to have different kinds of experiments and/or observational data. The use of electric propulsion allows for a larger payload mass fraction with respect to standard chemical thrusters, thanks to the higher specific impulse of these devices. The vehicle design, tailored to the fairing volume and launch mass capability of the Shtil‟ launcher and compatible with standard Cubesat deployers (P-POD), is based on Alta‟s HT- 100 Hall effect thruster system. With a specific impulse in excess of 1200 s, the HT- 100 can operate at 100 to 400 W for extended periods. The paper outlines the vehicle design and several mission scenarios. A trade-off study among propellant mass, platform architecture, number of deployed CubeSats, and system cost is presented, highlighting the potential benefits to multiple CubeSat or nanosatellite missions...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} {{a great deal of}} interest within the aviation community in the design of small, slow-flying but <b>manoeuvrable</b> uninhabited <b>vehicles</b> for reconnaissance, surveillance, and search and rescue operations in urban environments. Inspired by observation of birds, insects, fish and cetaceans, flapping wings are being actively studied in the hope that they may provide greater propulsive efficiencies than propellers and rotors at low Reynolds numbers for such Micro-Air Vehicles (MAVs). Researchers have posited the Strouhal number (combining flapping frequency, amplitude and forward speed) as the parameter controlling flapping wing aerodynamics in cruising flight, although there is conflicting evidence. This thesis explores the effect of flapping frequency and amplitude on forces and wake structures, as well as physical mechanisms leading to optimum propulsive efficiency. Two-dimensional rigid airfoils are considered at Reynolds number 2, 000 – 40, 000. A compressible Navier-Stokes simulation is combined with numerical and analytical potential flow techniques to isolate and evaluate the effect of viscosity, leading and trailing edge vortex separation, and wake vortex dynamics. The wake structures of a plunging airfoil are shown {{to be sensitive to the}} flapping frequency independent of the Strouhal number. For a given frequency, the wake of the airfoil exhibits ‘vortex lock-in’ as the amplitude of motion is increased, in a manner analogous to an oscillating circular cylinder. This is caused by interaction between the flapping frequency and the ‘bluff-body’ vortex shedding frequency apparent even for streamlined airfoils at low Reynolds number. The thrust and propulsive efficiency of a plunging airfoil are also shown to be sensitive to the flapping frequency independent of Strouhal number. This dependence is the result of vortex shedding from the leading edge, and an interaction between the flapping frequency and the time for vortex formation, separation and convection over the airfoil surface. The observed propulsive efficiency peak for a pitching and plunging airfoil is shown to be the result of leading edge vortex shedding at low flapping frequencies (low Strouhal numbers), and high power requirements at large flapping amplitudes (high Strouhal numbers). The efficiency peak is governed by flapping frequency and amplitude separately, rather than the Strouhal number directly...|$|R

In order to meet these demands {{the next generation of}} AUVs will need to be faster, operate for longer and be more <b>manoeuvrable</b> than existing <b>vehicles.</b> It is therefore vital that the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on a self propelled manoeuvring AUV can be predicted accurately at the initial design stage. The flow around a typical AUV is both turbulent and three dimensional with significant interactions between the hull, propeller and control surfaces. An unsteady computational fluid dynamics analysis based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations is too expensive for AUV design. In order to capture the action of the propeller at an acceptable computational cost, a novel method of coupling a commercial RANS solver with a body force propeller model based on blade element momentum theory has been developed. This discretises the propeller plane into a series of radial and circumferential sectors. The local axial and tangential inflow conditions at each sector of the propeller plane can then be considered. This allows analysis of non-uniform propeller inflow conditions due to the interaction of hull, propeller and control surfaces. During a manoeuvre the hull boundary layer may separate due to the adverse pressure gradient, resulting in free vortex sheets which roll up to form a pair of body vortices. An adaptive mesh strategy is required to ensure a suitable mesh structure and density to capture these flow features. Modifications to a vortex capture algorithm (VORTFIND) are proposed, optimising it as a tool for identifying the path of vortex structures. This enables it to be used as part of an iterative meshing strategy, capturing vortical flow features more accurately and consequently their influence on the pressure loading experienced by the hull. To demonstrate the pertinence of the numerical methods developed in this work a series of case studies has been analysed. These include: determining the hydrodynamic derivatives of an AUV, propeller-rudder interaction studies, steady state manoeuvring performance of the self propelled KVLCC 2, and in-service straight line performance prediction of Autosub 3. These highlight the roles of the numerical methodologies in the design process for future AUVs. The techniques developed in this work enable the designer to accurately predict the hydrodynamic loading acting on a self propelled manoeuvring AU...|$|R
