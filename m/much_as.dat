The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas. A {{portion of the}} southwestern flank of Mount Fee comprises no volcanic glass, but rather composed of an abnormal cryptocrystalline matrix. This indicates {{that it might have}} developed as part of a subvolcanic intrusion.|$|E
