The French were <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> off than the Americans {{in terms of}} casualties, with 7 Frenchmen killed and 33wounded {{compared}} to 3 Americans killed and 7wounded.

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Dakar on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at Dakar, Cape Verde and Gibraltar; the Allies {{believed that this}} area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through. As such, the Brazilian unit's mission was to patrol for mines laid by German minelaying submarines {{and to make sure}} that convoys passing through would be safe. Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul had problems with their condensers, a matter which was made <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.|$|E

5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become <b>much</b> <b>worse.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Rick had a {{temporary}} economic impact when, during its time off {{the shore of}} Chiapas and Oaxaca, it caused the price of coffee to rise 4.7 percent to $1.5685 per pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest total it reached since October 16. Mexico is the United States's largest source of coffee imports and Oaxaca and Chiapas are the largest coffee growing regions in Mexico. Like the impact in El Tomatal, Rick's effects were <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> than Pauline's because Rick threatened the coffee crop when the beans were more susceptible to winds that could blow them off.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Junior Campers, led by Ernest Borgnine, take the correct route, but {{they end up}} in a <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> position: after finding {{themselves}} trapped in a dark, tangled swamp (while being hunted by mountain men), they are attacked by a bear that Borgnine tries but fails to fight off (due to Homer stealing his Swiss Army Knife), and they finally flee to an abandoned summer camp. At the camp, they start singing songs, but are soon attacked by an unseen figure lurking in the woods, and their fates are left unknown.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} (ROP) {{in infants}} frequently regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years. Where {{the disease has}} progressed to the stages requiring surgery, the outcomes are generally good {{for the treatment of}} stage 3 ROP, but are <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> for the later stages. Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the progression of the disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision. The presence of other complicating diseases also reduces the likelihood of a favourable outcome.|$|E
5|$|Brock's {{successor}} at Detroit, however, fared <b>much</b> <b>worse.</b> Colonel Henry Procter {{faced an}} attack from a resurrected American Army of the Northwest under future President William Henry Harrison. Harrison {{set out to}} retake Detroit, but a detachment of his army was defeated at Frenchtown on 22 January 1813. Procter, displaying poor judgement, left the prisoners {{in the custody of}} his First Nations allies, who proceeded to execute an indeterminate number of them. Subsequent American victories allowed Harrison to attempt another invasion of Canada, which led to the Battle of the Thames on 5 October 1813. After a successful American charge, Procter's forces turned and fled, leaving Tecumseh and his American Indian troops to fight alone. They fought on, eventually being defeated. Perhaps of more importance to the British, at this battle Tecumseh died, and their alliance with the American Indians effectively ended.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E
5|$|Hol {{stood for}} {{election}} {{again in the}} 1924 parliamentary election, when the voting system had changed completely. The constituency was now Market towns of Telemark and Aust-Agder counties, {{and it was a}} plural-member constituency where representatives were selected from the party lists with the most votes. Hol was fielded as the second candidate on the ballot of the Radical People's Party (Labour Democrats), the new name of the Labour Democrats. The first candidate was A. Jørgensen, police chief of Kragerø. The Radical People's Party fared well in Skien and Kragerø. With 1,050 votes in Kragerø the party prevailed over the Social Democrats and Communists. With 2,075 votes in Skien the party prevailed over Labour. However, it fared <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> in the other six cities, carried 4,571 votes in total and lost the election in the Market towns of Telemark and Aust-Agder counties.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Tara {{was one of}} {{the deadliest}} Pacific hurricanes on record. The final {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1961 Pacific hurricane season, Tara formed on November10 about 230mi (365km) off the coast of Mexico. It strengthened to reach maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) before making landfall in the Mexican state of Guerrero near Zihuatanejo. Hurricane Tara dissipated on November12, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to locations inundated by 10days of precipitation. Damage was light in the major port city of Acapulco, though further west along the coast, the effects of Tara were <b>much</b> <b>worse.</b> The city of Nuxco in Tecpán de Galeana municipality received the most damage and deaths from the hurricane. Throughout Mexico, at least 436fatalities were reported, and damage exceeded $16million (1961USD, $115million 2009USD).|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be {{lightened}} forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{produced a}} storm surge of 13feet (4m) {{in only one}} hour at Battery Park, a record only broken 191 years later by Hurricane Sandy. Manhattan Island was completely flooded to Canal Street; one hurricane researcher remarked that the storm surge flooding would have been <b>much</b> <b>worse,</b> had the hurricane not struck at low tide. However, few deaths were reported in the city, since the flooding affected neighborhoods much less populated than today. The hurricane brought light rainfall as it passed New York City, though strong winds left severe damage across the city. High tides occurred along the Hudson River. Strong waves and winds blew many ships ashore along Long Island. One ship sank, killing 17people. Along Long Island, the winds destroyed several buildings and left crops destroyed.|$|E
5|$|When the {{rebellion}} finally {{broke out in}} Batoche in March, Irvine advanced quickly through the snow from Regina to Prince Albert, which he garrisoned with 90 police. Superintendent Leif Crozier took a force of police, civilian volunteers and a 7-pounder (3kg) gun to Fort Carlton and attempted to seize a cache of supplies. In the process, Crozier confronted a larger force of rebels at Duck Lake, where his detachment came off <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> in the resulting fight. Emboldened, some of the Cree leaders, including Poundmaker and Big Bear, now joined the Métis in their revolt, although others continued to tacitly support the government, in part {{the result of the}} good relationship the police had built up with them. The police rapidly abandoned most of their posts along the valley, falling back to more easily defensible locations; Inspector Francis Dickens was forced to flee Fort Pitt with his men on a makeshift boat.|$|E

5|$|Coach Leeman Bennett {{treated the}} season as a {{building}} season, but was disappointed with the team's mental errors and lack of progress. Later in the season, he would begin to privately admit that the Buccaneers' talent was <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> than he had realized. Steve DeBerg won the starting quarterback job after outplaying Steve Young in the preseason, but was benched in favor of Young after struggling {{in the first two}} games. Kevin House and Jimmie Giles were released after an October loss to the New Orleans Saints, along with ex-Dallas Cowboys fullback Ron Springs. Bennett showed up at a press conference held after the season by owner Hugh Culverhouse, unaware {{that the purpose of the}} press conference was to announce Bennett's firing. Giles, then with the Detroit Lions, criticized the move, saying that no coach could compensate for the Buccaneers' lack of talent. He also claimed that administrator Phil Krueger destroyed team chemistry by demeaning players during contract negotiations, pointing to guard Sean Farrell's disgruntlement as an example.|$|E
5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E
5|$|PTV {{becomes a}} huge success, and Brian and Stewie, {{impressed}} by the hits, join in to help Peter expand his television programming, as well as performing their own show Cheeky Bastard sitcom on PTV. Lois is furious about everyone's lust for perverted TV, as she is concerned {{over the issue of}} how children will be influenced by his programming (in the episode's DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of Jackass, defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians are the ones who should take full responsibility for what kids watch on TV and also points out that there are <b>much</b> <b>worse</b> influences besides TV. Regardless of that, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, Brian, and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC's regulations are. Despite being impressed with the song, the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can't stop people from being who they are or how they live their lives, they decide to take on the challenge.|$|E
