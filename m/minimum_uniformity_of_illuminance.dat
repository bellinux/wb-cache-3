In addition, the heat transfer process of the LED array package assembly in natural convection is also simulated using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The optical performance of the LED array is monitored and investigated {{in accordance with the}} environmental variations.

40|$|Every year {{hundreds}} of night time road collisions result in fatalities and injuries in Canada. Roadway lighting is considered {{as the main}} countermeasure to prevent nighttime crashes. Provision of lighting follows two industry standards in North America: one for the warrants {{and the other for}} minimum recommended levels. The warrant system assigns scores to highway segments based on geometrical, operational and functional characteristics as well as the collision history through a night-to-day crash-ratio. Transportation agencies in North America had manifested their interest in simplifying the warrant system; eliminating elements and/or modifying lighting values, however, {{there is a need for}} a method to support lighting decisions over its effectiveness as a countermeasure. This thesis presents a novel method to calibrate lighting warrants and to identify effective levels of lighting in order to reduce the severity and frequency of night-time collisions. This new method uses an evidence-based mechanism to connect lighting warrants with statistical analysis of collisions in order to adjust the scores of the warrant. It also connects the estimation of lighting levels with evidence-based statistical analysis of crash-history in order to identify recommended levels <b>of</b> luminance, <b>illuminance</b> and <b>uniformity</b> variations. The method expands the industry standards by providing the decision maker with two alternate non-exclusive approaches supported over collisions’ frequency and severity criteria. A large-scale case study for highways in Quebec was used to calibrate the warrants and identified recommended levels of luminance of at least 1. 5 cd/m 2, maximum <b>uniformities</b> <b>of</b> <b>illuminance</b> <b>of</b> 1. 5 and of luminance of 8 times to prevent severe and frequent collisions. A case study of Arthabaska region in Quebec found that levels of luminance should be increased for every functional classification of roads that values <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> must be reduced, and that levels <b>of</b> <b>illuminance</b> increased to reduce severe collisions.

Thermal performance and experimental verification of heat transfer via convection of a high-brightness LED array on PCB under different placement configurations were addressed in this study. The configuration design includes the change of thermal conductivity of the PCB materials and LED array placement method in a system module. The computational fluid dynamics method was used to simulate the heat transfer process of the LED array on PCB. Infrared camera and thermocouples are {{used to assess the}} thermal profile of the distribution of heat for the LED array on PCB in different specific regions. Using the developed placement configuration, the thermal distribution profile of a commercial high-brightness LED array on PCB was compared to that of conventional design. The output performance of the LED array was subsequently recorded in terms of the change in <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>illuminance,</b> LED efficacy, and radiant flux. The new placement configuration for the LED array could be used to lower the individual LED temperature in the array by 26. °C and improve its luminous efficacy.

40|$|This study investigates how indoor {{daylight}} environments affect patient Average Length of Stay (ALOS), by evaluating {{and analyzing}} daylight levels in patient rooms {{in comparison to}} their ALOS. The patient ALOS data were taken at one general hospital in Inchon, Korea {{and the other in}} Bryan, Texas, U. S. A.; physical, environmental and daylighting conditions were assessed at each building site. The gathered data were analyzed using SPSS statistical package to determine the trends in patients?????? length of stay in hospital wards with 95 % and 90 % statistical significances. The data were categorized based on the orientation of a patient room and were compared between different orientations and types of patient rooms in the same ward of each hospital. Selected hospital wards were classified based on their orientations and types of patient rooms. The other variables considered in the study were: the differences in daylighting environments (illuminance, luminance ration, daylight factor, diversity and <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>illuminance),</b> and physical environment properties of the patient rooms of each hospital, and how these affected patient ALOS in both locations (Inchon and Bryan). To analyze the daylighting environment, on-site measurements, RADIANCE simulations and physical scale model measurements were conducted. This study also investigated patients?????? feelings and opinions, and their preferences in daylighting environments with the questionnaire survey. Through this study, three hypotheses were tested and was evidence for the following conclusions. First, there may be a positive relationship between indoor daylight environments and ALOS. Second, seasonal weather differences cause different indoor daylighting levels and may influence the length of patient hospitalization. Third, overall patient satisfaction and reactions to patient rooms may be related with indoor daylight environments. More controllable shading devices, naturally lighted indoor environments, and glare prevention create positive outcomes for patient ALOS and visual comfort. To increase the validity and confidence about the positive effects of daylight on human physiological conditions, further studies are necessary which provide more samples, facilities and other variables. This study was created as a basis for the development of recommendations for designing patient rooms in healthcare facilities and, as a result, should be used to achieve more effective healing environments...|$|R

This was critical for both image color balancing and minimizing image resolution mismatch between horizontal and vertical directions. For evaluating <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> image brightness, we applied optical ray tracing simulations. The simulations took effects of PB orientation misalignment into account. The simulation results were then compared with recorded experimental data. Our optimal simulated system produced significantly enhanced image uniformity at around sweet spots in viewing zones. However this was contradicted by real experimental results. We offer quantitative treatment <b>of</b> <b>illuminance</b> <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> view images to estimate misalignment of PB orientation, which could account for brightness non-uniformity observed experimentally. Our study also shows that slight imperfection in the adjustment of PB orientation due to practical restrictions of adjustment accuracy can induce substantial non-uniformity of view images’ brightness. We find that image brightness non-uniformity critically depends on misalignment of PB angular orientation, for example, as slight as ≤ 0. 01 ° in our system. This reveals that reducing misalignment of PB angular orientation from the order of 10 − 2 to 10 − 3 degrees can greatly improve the brightness uniformity...|$|R

Previous studies have shown strong connections between eyestrain and musculoskeletal strain. The eyes “lead the body” and if the picture on the retina is unfocused the body adjusts the posture, trying to improve the image through changing the viewing distance. This can lead to an unnatural body posture which can contribute in the development of musculoskeletal disorders. A good visual environment with proper illuminance, good luminance contrast relationship, good <b>uniformity</b> value <b>of</b> the <b>illuminance</b> and no glare are the best conditions in order to function well at a visually demanding work. Sorting mail is a task that needs good visual ergonomics and can therefore be improved by a change in the visual environment. The overall purpose of this thesis is to investigate if a good visual environment have an impact on eyestrain, musculoskeletal strain, productivity, wellbeing, and work induced stress. This thesis is based on a literature review and a lighting intervention, with one part before the intervention and two follow-up parts, summer and winter. The results are based on objectively measurements; lighting, time studies, and optometric eye examinations, and two questionnaires. The first questionnaire concerned visual ergonomics and the second had a focus on wellbeing and experience of work related tasks. The postmen experienced the new lighting and labeling as improvement.

When the lighting was improved another factor that could cause strain appeared, the need for good correction in their glasses was identified as the main remaining factor that could cause the observed strain.
