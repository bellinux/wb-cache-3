5|$|As Carlson's {{battalion}} {{was ending}} its patrol, Shōji and his surviving troops were reaching friendly positions {{west of the}} Matanikau. In addition to the losses sustained from attacks by Carlson's raiders, a lack of food and tropical diseases felled many more of Shōji's <b>men.</b> <b>By</b> the time Shōji's forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300men remained with the main body. When Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700-800 survivors were still with him. Survivors from Shōji's force later participated in the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse in December 1942 and January 1943.|$|E

5|$|As Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came on line, they flanked the 19th Indiana {{and drove}} the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest {{regiment}} in the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 <b>men.</b> <b>By</b> {{the end of the}} three-day battle, they had about 152 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South. Slowly the Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added Maj. Gen.

5|$|In 1896, {{huge amounts}} of gold were {{discovered}} in the Klondike valley. Once news of this circulated the following year, around 100,000 people rushed to the Klondike in search of wealth, most with no experience in the mining industry. To reach the area, many prospectors travelled by foot over arduous mountain routes and along rivers using primitive boats, although no more than 40,000 of them successfully reached the goldfields. A substantial and expensive mounted police detachment {{was established in the}} Klondike, amounting to 288 <b>men</b> <b>by</b> 1898, representing around a third of the entire force and including many of its most experienced personnel.|$|E

On October 20, 1934 the communists {{broke out of}} Chiang's encirclement and began the Long March.

5|$|On 11 June, the French bombarded {{the fort}} from land and sea. The fort's {{garrison}} fought back, and its commander, Rechberg, managed {{to bring in}} more ammunition from Floriana. On 12 June, the bombardment of the fort continued, but by then the French had captured Valletta, Floriana, and Fort Manoel. The Maltese militia left the fort, reducing its garrison to 80 <b>men.</b> <b>By</b> the end of the day, the ammunition had run out, and parts of the fort were damaged during the bombardment. When Rechberg and his soldiers attempted to escape, the French captured them, and the fort was in French hands by 13 June.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, 1864, the 22nd broke {{camp and}} marched {{southeast}} from Rappahannock Station.

The resulting campaign during the spring of 1864 was known as the Overland Campaign and saw relentless attacks {{on the part of the}} Union army under Grant. The reinforced 22nd began the campaign with about 300 <b>men.</b> <b>By</b> the close of the campaign, the regiment would be reduced to about 100.|$|E

Out of concern for Falle's safety, they taught her how to put a condom on a penis by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle.

5|$|The men at {{the front}} had to {{struggle}} with supply problems–there was a shortage of food; and disease was rife in the damp, rat-infested conditions. Along with enemy action, many soldiers {{had to contend with}} new diseases: trench foot, trench fever and trench nephritis. When the war ended in November 1918, British Army casualties, as the result of enemy action and disease, were recorded as 673,375 killed and missing, with another 1,643,469 wounded. The rush to demobilise {{at the end of the}} conflict substantially decreased the strength of the British Army, from its peak strength of 4,000,000 men in 1918 to 370,000 <b>men</b> <b>by</b> 1920.|$|E
5|$|The two armies met near Peritheorion on 7 July 1345.

The locals did let in Momchil's cousin Rayko along with 50 men, which they hoped would persuade Momchil not to take vengeance on the city if he defeated his opponents. In the subsequent battle before the city walls, Momchil's forces used the Peritheorion's ruined old fortifications as a first line of defence, with the city walls behind them.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than <b>men</b> <b>by</b> a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E
