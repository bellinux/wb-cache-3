50|$|Overhead cam engines {{were first}} {{developed}} as high performance aircraft and racing engines, with the camshafts mounted {{directly over the}} valves and driving them through a simple bucket tappet. To give the best valve position for gasflow through a crossflow cylinder head, valves were usually mounted in two rows and with two separate camshafts. These bucket tappets were usually adjusted by a small shim, either above or below the tappet. Shims were made {{in a range of}} standard thicknesses and a mechanic would swap them to change the tappet gap. The engine would first be assembled with a default shim of known thickness, then the gap measured. A set of different shims would then be installed, each one chosen according to the change needed from the <b>measured</b> <b>gap</b> to the ideal gap. The gaps would then be measured again, in case of mistakes and also in case the cam position had shifted slightly. As the camshaft had to be removed to change the shims, this was an extremely time consuming operation, especially as the precise height of the camshaft above the cylinder head could change, depending on how carefully it was re-installed.|$|E

40|$|We re-process the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) long-baseline science {{verification}} data taken toward HL Tauri. As {{shown by}} the previous work, we confirm that the high spatial resolution (0. " 019, corresponding to 2. 7 AU) dust continuum images at λ = 0. 87, 1. 3, and 2. 9 mm exhibit a multiple ring-like gap structure in the circumstellar disk. Assuming that the observed gaps are opened up by currently forming, unseen bodies, we estimate the mass of such hypothetical bodies based on following two approaches; the Hill radius analysis and a more elaborated approach developed from the angular momentum transfer analysis in gas disks. For the former, the <b>measured</b> <b>gap</b> widths are used for calibrating {{the mass of the}} bodies, while for the latter, the <b>measured</b> <b>gap</b> depths are utilized. We show that their masses are likely comparable to or less than the mass of Jovian planets, and then discuss an origin of the observed gap structure. By evaluating Toomre's gravitational instability (GI) condition and cooling effect, we find that the GI might be a possible mechanism to form the bodies in the outer region of the disk. As the disk might be gravitationally unstable only in the outer region of the disk, inward planetary migration would be needed to construct the current architecture of the hypothetical bodies. We estimate the gap-opening mass and show that type II migration might be able to play such a role. Combining GIs with inward migration, we conjecture that all of the observed gaps may be a consequence of bodies that might have originally formed at the outer part of the disk, and have subsequently migrated to the current locations. While ALMA's unprecedented high spatial resolution observations can revolutionize our picture of planet formation, more dedicated observational and theoretical studies are needed in order to fully understand the HL Tau images.

40|$|Much recent {{monetary}} policy analysis has featured stochastic simulations with small structural macroeconomic models that include: a spending vs. saving (IS') sector; a price-adjustment sector; and {{an interest rate}} policy rule. The first two are frequently specified so as to reflect optimizing behavior; policy {{may or may not}} be specified as optimizing depending on the study's objectives. Some leading issues concern modifications to simple quantitative optimizing models that are needed to generate realistic degrees of persistence in inflation and output-gap variables. A major policy issue is whether it is desirable for {{monetary policy}} to respond strongly to the output gap. The paper argues that the latter is unobservable and considers the implications of using a trend-type measure while the true concept is of a type more in keeping with basic theory. In such circumstances, highly undesirable consequences are likely to ensue if policy responds strongly to the <b>measured</b> <b>gap.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a multiband metal with deep primary bands and a shallow secondary one. In the normal state the system undergoes Lifshitz transition when {{the bottom of}} the shallow band crosses the Fermi level. In the superconducting state Cooper pairing in the shallow band is induced by the deep ones. As a result, the density of electrons in the shallow band remains finite even when {{the bottom of the}} band is above the Fermi level. We study the density of states in the system and find qualitatively different behaviors on {{the two sides of the}} Lifshitz transition. On one side of the transition the density of states diverges at the energy equal to the induced gap, whereas on the other side it vanishes.

30|$|We have {{performed}} transport measurements on a gallium phosphide antimonide (GaPSb) film grown on GaAs. At low temperatures (T), transport {{is governed by}} three-dimensional Mott variable range hopping (VRH) due to strong localization. Therefore, electron–electron interactions are not significant in GaPSb. With increasing T, the coexistence of VRH conduction and the activated behavior with a gap of 20 meV is found. The fact that the <b>measured</b> <b>gap</b> {{is comparable to the}} thermal broadening at room temperature (approximately 25 meV) demonstrates that electrons can be thermally activated in an intrinsic GaPSb film. Moreover, the observed carrier density dependence on temperature also supports the coexistence of VRH and the activated behavior. It is shown that the carriers are delocalized either with increasing temperature or magnetic field in GaPSb. Our new experimental results provide important information regarding GaPSb which may well lay the foundation for possible GaPSb-based device applications such as in high-electron-mobility transistor and heterojunction bipolar transistors.|$|E
30|$|The {{results for}} women are unambiguous—for the whole sample {{and the two}} sub-periods the wage {{disadvantage}} of women grows when and where unemployment is temporarily higher, {{just as it did}} in all the various alternative specifications of (1). Thus, the positive relationship between the unemployment rate and the wage disadvantage faced by women is the result of cyclical movements in pure wage discrimination. Table  3 even shows that the apparent reversal of sign of the relationship between unemployment and the male–female wage gap during {{the latter half of the}} sample period was due to a change in the impact of unobservable, unemployment-related composition effects on the <b>measured</b> <b>gap</b> rather than a change in the cyclicality of wage discrimination. This latter observation is consistent with Mulligan and Rubinstein’s (2008) finding that the nature of selection into the female labor force changed between the 1970 s and the 1990 s, which may have resulted in changing selectivity over the cycle as well.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} from a search for events with a rapidity gap between high transverse momentum jets produced by the Fermilab Tevatron proton anti-proton Collider at √s = 1. 8 TeV.

The observed rapidity gap fraction is in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations for color-singlet exchange, but uncertainties in the color-octet contribution and the background from particle detection inefficiencies make this association difficult. The <b>measured</b> <b>gap</b> fraction is used to place an upper limit at the 95 % confidence level of 1. 1 x 10 ⁻² on the fraction of events with no particles between the jets for events with Δη(c) > 3.

30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that the phonon dispersion spectrum of Py/BARC differs substantially {{from those of the}} 1 D Py/Fe(Ni) arrays of[7]. For instance, the <b>measured</b> <b>gap</b> opening of 1.0 GHz at the BZ boundary of the former, is much wider than the first bandgap of 0.4 GHz observed for the latter. This is primarily due to the elastic and density contrasts between two metals (Fe or Ni and Py) being much lower than that between the polymer BARC and the metal Py. The 4.8 GHz center of this gap opening is also higher than those (≈ 3.4 GHz) of Py/Fe(Ni). This is expected as the 350 -nm period of our Py/BARC is shorter than the 500 -nm one of Py/Fe(Ni). Another reason is that our Py/BARC is directly patterned on a Si substrate, while the Py/Fe(Ni) samples contain an 800 -nm-thick SiO 2 sub-layer between the patterned arrays and the Si substrate which has the effect of red shifting the SAW frequencies. Another notable difference is that the 2.2 -GHz bandgap is considerably larger than those of the Py/Fe(Ni) arrays, whose maximum gap is only 0.6 GHz. One explanation for this is the high elastic and density contrasts between the materials in Py/BARC.|$|E
