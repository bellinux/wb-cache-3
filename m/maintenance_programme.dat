25|$|A further {{major upgrade}} {{programme}} from the GR7 standard was conducted; the Harrier GR9. The GR9 was developed via the Joint Update and <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Programme</b> (JUMP), which significantly upgraded the Harrier fleet's avionics, communications systems, and weapons capabilities during scheduled periods of maintenance in an incremental manner. The {{first of these}} increments started with software upgrades to the communications, ground proximity warning and navigation systems, followed by {{the integration of the}} AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile. Capability C added the RAF's Rangeless Airborne Instrumentation Debriefing System (RAIDS), Raytheon's Successor Identification Friend or Foe (SIFF) system and the Paveway guided bombs. The Digital Joint Reconnaissance Pod (DJRP) was added as part of Capability D.|$|E
25|$|The {{airfield}} was host to No. 30 Operational Training Unit {{from its}} inception in June 1942 up until February 1945 when the OTU left for RAF Gamston in Nottinghamshire. At {{the same time that}} the OTU was moving out, thirty-seven Beauforts of No.12 (P)AFU from RAF Spitalgate moved in. No. 12 (P)AFU did not last long though, it was disbanded in June 1945 and the site was given over to 16 Maintenance Unit from RAF Stafford as a sub-site. 16 MU needed access to storage sites for the recently returned and surplus military items at the war's end. 16 MU stayed on until November 1957 when the base was put under the care and <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme.</b> The site was disposed of by sale in August 1962.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} acceptance that follow-up or maintenance sessions {{are an important}} part of the change process for those who have completed offender rehabilitation programmes, there have been few attempts to articulate the basis upon which such sessions might be developed.

2500|$|These days [...] Scillonian III [...] runs between Penzance and Hugh Town, St. Mary's {{for about}} eight months only, from early spring (March/April) until autumn (October/November). Through the winter months, she is laid up in Penzance harbour and a cargo-only {{service to the}} Isles of Scilly is then {{provided}} by Gry Maritha. The annual winter period is used {{to carry out a}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme,</b> during which Scillonian III is painted and undergoes technical inspections as well as surveys for passenger vessel certification by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The ferry's season thus largely coincides with the tourist season on the Isles of Scilly, which normally runs from Easter to the first weekend in October. The ferry is in fact so closely associated with the summer season on Scilly that for many people, [...] "the sight of the ship Scillonian III [...] is a celebrated indication that spring has sprung." ...|$|E

This systematic review aimed to synthesise {{the available evidence}} on the efficacy of supervised <b>maintenance</b> exercise <b>programmes</b> compared to usual care following pulmonary rehabilitation completion on health-care use and mortality. Methods: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and PEDro) and trial registers (Clinicaltrials. gov and Current Controlled Trials) were searched for randomised trials comparing supervised <b>maintenance</b> exercise <b>programmes</b> to usual care following pulmonary rehabilitation completion. Primary outcomes were respiratory-cause hospital admissions, exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids, and mortality. Results: Eight trials (790 COPD patients) met the inclusion criteria, six providing data for meta-analysis. Continued supervised maintenance exercise compared to usual care following pulmonary rehabilitation completion significantly reduced the risk of experiencing at least one respiratory-cause hospital admission (risk ratio 0. 62, 95...|$|R

This was a national ecological study conducted in November 2008 in Norway. Marked variations between the centres in caseload, choice of agonists, prescribing doctor, as well as in the use of supervised dispensing and urine drug screening were found. Only prescribed agonist dose was consistent across all centres. Centres in which patients had more illicit drug use had fewer patients with long-term living arrangements, more unemployment, and more patients who reported social security benefits as main income. The differences occurred despite government regulations, policies and guidelines, and frequent national meetings between centre managers.
