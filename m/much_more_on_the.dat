In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said {{that it had been}} considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E
25|$|Jesus' {{death and}} resurrection {{underpin}} a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place {{on the death of}} Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement. Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance.|$|E

[...] The quality of the fiction was very poor—sf historian Mike Ashley comments that Ray Cummings' lead story, [...] "Coming of the Giant Germs", was [...] "one of his most appalling stories". [...] Ashley speculates {{that the only reason}} the magazine was issued was to use up some remaining material that had been acquired for Marvel Science Stories, perhaps because at this time the Goodmans were beginning to focus <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> growing comic-book market.|$|E

2500|$|Some landowners {{have set}} aside {{some of their}} {{property}} as a reserve for the deer, as well as keeping cattle instead of sheep. [...] Sheep graze <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land and are more {{of a threat to}} the deer. [...] The owners that choose cattle are doing it as a service, because more money is made from raising sheep than cattle. [...] Conservationists encourage this trend by sharing research that more edible vegetation is available on ranches with cattle and deer during times of drought than on ranches with cattle and sheep.|$|E

In {{her view}} Hugh Greene as BBC Director General was [...] "more {{than anybody else}} ... responsible for the moral collapse in this country." [...] The campaign of Whitehouse and her supporters soon became the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association; Mrs Whitehouse was opposed to the policies of liberalisation pursued by Greene and largely sustained by his successors at the Corporation. Whitehouse's campaign focused <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> BBC than on ITV, {{and she had a}} high public profile for several decades. The tabloid press also criticised the BBC for what it perceived as lapses in programming quality.|$|E

60|$|He did {{not mention}} his nephew's affairs. Philip fancied that it was by way of precaution, in case he asked for money, that his uncle kept {{dwelling}} on the financial calls upon him.

Philip felt angrily inclined to say he need not be afraid, he was not going to borrow from him, but he held his tongue. It seemed to him that everything had left the old man now but two things, pleasure in his food and a grasping desire for money. It was a hideous old age.|$|E
60|$|There {{was indeed}} another objection, which in later times {{would have been}} of {{considerable}} weight--Gwenwyn was already married.

In the meanwhile, if Raymond Berenger (as was suspected) was not liberal enough in his opinions to permit Eveline to hold the temporary rank of concubine, which the manners of Wales warranted Gwenwyn to offer as an interim, arrangement, he had only to wait for a few months, and sue for a divorce through the Bishop of Saint David's, or some other intercessor at the Court of Rome.|$|E

6000|$|... 63. Pardon me, I am not {{prepared}} to admit that. I rather side with the selfish objectors, and believe that art {{ought not to be}} made cheap, beyond a certain point; for the amount of pleasure that you can receive from any great work, depends wholly on the quantity of attention and energy of mind you can bring to bear upon it. Now, that attention and energy depend <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> freshness of the thing than you would at all suppose; unless you very carefully studied the movements of your own minds. If you see things of the same kind and of equal value very frequently, your reverence for them is infallibly diminished, your powers of attention get gradually wearied, and your interest and enthusiasm worn out; and you cannot in that state bring to any given work the energy necessary to enjoy it. If, indeed, the question were only between enjoying a great many pictures each a little, or one picture very much, the sum of enjoyment being in each case the same, you might rationally desire to possess rather the larger quantity than the small; both because one work of art always in some sort illustrates another, and because quantity diminishes the chances of destruction.|$|E

If he does this, {{he ought to be}} met and prevented from getting north of the Tennessee River. If you were to cut loose, I do not believe you would meet Hood's army, but would be bushwhacked by all the old men and little boys, and such railroad guards as are still left at home. Hood would probably strike for Nashville, thinking that by going north he could inflict greater damage upon us than we could upon the rebels by going south. If there is any way of getting at Hood's army, I would prefer that, but I must trust to your own judgment. I find I shall not be able to send a force from here to act with you on Savannah. Your movements, therefore, will be independent of mine; at least until the fall of Richmond takes place. I am afraid Thomas, with such lines of road as he has to protect, could not prevent Hood from going north.

"Sunday, November 26th,--that is, {{nineteen}} days ago,--the {{first of}} these Tea Ships, the DARTMOUTH, Captain Hall, moored itself in Griffin's Wharf: Owner and Consignee is a broad-brimmed Boston gentleman called Rotch, more attentive to profits of trade than to the groans of Boston:--but already on that Sunday, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Monday following, there had a meeting of Citizens run together,--(on Monday, Faneuil Hall won't hold them, and they adjourn to the Old South Meeting-house),--who make it apparent to Rotch that it will much behoove him, for the sake both of tea and skin, not to 'enter' (or officially announce) this Ship DARTMOUTH at the Custom-house in any wise; but to pledge his broad-brimmed word, equivalent to his oath, that she shall lie dormant there in Griffin's Wharf, till we see. Which, accordingly, she has been doing ever since; she and two others that arrived some days later; dormant all three of them, side by side, three crews totally idle; a 'Committee of Ten' supervising Rotch's procedures; and the Boston world much expectant.
