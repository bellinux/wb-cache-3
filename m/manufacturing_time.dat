2500|$|Their {{efforts were}} {{supported}} by a light aircraft manufacturer in the United States, Piper Aircraft Corporation of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. As an expression of encouragement to the RAF, Piper's President William T. Piper decided to donate a single Piper J-3 Cub as a grand national prize, with all proceeds going to the RAFBF. [...] At the start of April 1941, Bill Strohmeier, Piperâ€™s Sales and Promotion Manager, then encouraged Piper dealers {{across the country to}} order further ones for their own use. The special silver finish with RAF-style insignia was included at no additional cost to the dealers. [...] Strohmeier requested the 48 U.S. Piper dealers donate one Cub, which would represent the state of their choice. [...] For every donation, Piper set aside 20 minutes of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>time,</b> which was sufficient to build one aircraft. [...] A total of 49 Cubs were donated to support the fund raiser, one named for each of the 48 then states, plus William Piper's initial donation, registered as NC1776. All funds collected went to the RAFBF and none went toward expenses.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "C-type" [...] wing, or [...] "Universal wing" [...] was a {{more heavily}} {{modified}} wing, redesigned to reduce labour and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>time,</b> {{as well as to}} allow different armament configuration options to be fitted in a single, universal wing structure which could accommodate several different armament layouts without serious structural modification or alteration (a similar kind of wing was developed for the Hawker Hurricane, allowing anything from 8 to 10 [...]303 Brownings, to four 20mm Hispanos, to twin anti-tank 40mm Vickers [...] "S" [...] guns and a pair of [...]303's to be fitted into the same wing). Without modification, the [...] "universal" [...] wing could accept [...] "A", [...] "B", [...] "C" [...] or [...] "E-type" [...] armament configuration, although the [...] "E" [...] type wasn't used until later marks of Spitfire. The [...] "B" [...] type, 2-cannon, 4-Browning layout was by far the most commonly seen on [...] "C" [...] wing Spitfires, until the Mk IX and the [...] "E" [...] wing. Differences in the [...] "C" [...] wings include a second cannon-bay added directly alongside the first, and the #3 Browning gun being moved slightly outboard from ribs 13 to 14, making the two outer machine guns closer together than in the older [...] "B" [...] type wing. Although officially any aircraft with a universal wing is a [...] "C" [...] variant regardless of their armament configuration (excepting [...] "E" [...] types), in later popular (and incorrect) usage, [...] "C" [...] variants with the same armament as the [...] "B" [...] type are often called [...] "B" [...] variants, even though it's technically a [...] "C", and structurally it is different than the older [...] "B" [...] wing Spitfire. The new wing now had two inner gun bays able to accommodate cannon, although one bay was usually left empty. The outer two [...]303 machine guns were also moved closer together than in [...] "A" [...] or [...] "B" [...] type wings, {{which is one of the}} primary visual aids to distinguishing an original [...] "B" [...] type from later universal wing [...] "B types", along with the second pair of cannon ports, which are visible even though typically no weapons are fitted in the second cannon bay. In this case, the empty port is usually closed off with a rubber plug. The cannon mounts were also moved further back in the wing, so the barrel fairings of the cannon are shorter than on an original [...] "B" [...] Spitfire.|$|E

A requirement to allow practitioners to tailor the approach to the implementation of Just In <b>Time</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> according to the context of the particular manufacturing system, is endorsed. Three case studies of Just In <b>Time</b> <b>manufacturing</b> implementation within the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry, conducted as part of this research, are presented and analysed. The benefits of Just In <b>Time</b> <b>manufacturing</b> implementation in the cases are shown to be signficant and immediately apparent.

These are the concepts of perceived opportunity for improvement and distributed support for implementation. These concepts are supported by other researchers.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn recent years, carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) mirrors been proposed {{for use in}} future imaging satellites. Compared to traditional glass-based mirrors, CFRP mirrors offer reduced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>times,</b> lower coefficients of thermal expansion, lower areal density, and higher strength-to-weight ratios. Shorter <b>manufacturing</b> <b>times</b> promise to reduce program schedule requirements and cost. These advantages {{come at the expense}} of surface quality, which results in wavefront errors that are outside of the diffraction limit for optical imaging. To compensate for the reduced surface quality of CFRP mirrors, a deformable mirror (DM) is required in the optical path. During this research, the surface quality of a CFRP mirror was evaluated to establish a root-mean-square (RMS) error threshold for the DM corrections. An integral DM control law that employed a constrained least-squares solution was utilized to reduce the overall system wavefront error to below the specified CFRP error threshold. The application of this control law yielded a 38 % reduction in RMS wavefront error (as compared to the CFRP error threshold), thus reducing the CFRP RMS surface performance requirements by the same amount. Reducing the surface performance requirements of CFRP mirrors is a critical step toward employing these mirrors in future imaging satellites. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
