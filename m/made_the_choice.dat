25|$|Einstein was {{the first}} {{physicist}} to say that Planck's discovery of the quantum (h) would require a rewriting {{of the laws of}} physics. To support his point, in 1905 he proposed that light sometimes acts as a particle which he called a light quantum (see photon and wave–particle duality). Bohr {{was one of the most}} vocal opponents of the photon idea and did not openly embrace it until 1925. The photon appealed to Einstein because he saw it as a physical reality (although a confusing one) behind the numbers. Bohr disliked it because it <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of mathematical solution arbitrary. He did not like a scientist's having to choose between equations.|$|E

The episode was initially written to feature a lesbian kiss between Hearst's character and Keri Lynn Pratt's character, Hallie, when the two were discovered to be having an affair. However, The CW, the network the series aired on, stepped in and decided to cut the scene before it was filmed. Hearst reported, [...] "I meet Keri and I'm like, 'Hello.'

500|$|Before its {{standalone}} {{version was}} announced in June 2017, many criticized the decision that Modern Warfare Remastered would only be available through purchasing a premium version of Infinite Warfare, with Activision being accused of anti-consumerism practices and coercing fans into paying more than necessary. Joey Thurmond disagreed with how a re-release of a classic that had shaped both the series' formula and first-person shooter genre in general had been coupled with a new, poorly-received title, calling the choice [...] "preposterous" [...] and [...] "a bullet {{in the face to}} consumers". He argued that selling Remastered separately would actually benefit Activision, forecasting an eventual influx of pre-owned copies of the bundle being sold, devaluing Infinite Warfares worth in the process. Forbes Paul Tassi described the bundling as being [...] "a way to essentially blackmail players into picking up a more expensive version of a base game they may not have even wanted (Infinite Warfare) in order to get something they desperately wanted (Modern Warfare Remastered)", but understood why Activision had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> due to it being [...] "pro-money".|$|E
500|$|By 1938, Campbell was {{planning}} a fantasy companion to Astounding: Weird Tales {{was still the}} leader in the fantasy genre, though competitors such as Strange Stories were also being launched. [...] Campbell began acquiring stories suitable for the new magazine, without a definite launch date in mind. When Eric Frank Russell sent him the manuscript of his novel Sinister Barrier, Campbell {{decided it was time}} to put his plans into action. [...] The first issue of Unknown appeared in March 1939. It was a monthly at first, but poor sales forced a switch to a bimonthly schedule beginning in February 1941. In December 1940 the subtitle Fantasy Fiction was added, and in October 1941 the main title was changed to Unknown Worlds; both changes were intended to make the genre of the magazine clearer to potential readers. [...] When wartime paper shortages became severe in late 1943, Campbell <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> to keep Astounding monthly and cancel Unknown, rather than switch the former to a bimonthly schedule as well.

500|$|In 1938 Basil Rathbone {{was cast}} as Sherlock Holmes for the 20th Century Fox {{adaptation}} of The Hound of the Baskervilles; Nigel Bruce {{was chosen to}} play Dr. John Watson. Darryl F. Zanuck, Gregory Ratoff and Gene Markey <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of Rathbone as Holmes during a conversation {{at a party in}} Hollywood. Filming began on 29 December 1938 under the direction of Sidney Lanfield and the film was released on 31 March 1939. Later that year a second film, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, followed, which was based on Sherlock Holmes, an 1899 stage play written by William Gillette. Although 20th Century Fox planned to make further Holmes films with Rathbone and Bruce, complications in negotiations between the company and the estate of the character's creator, Arthur Conan Doyle, brought a premature end to the studio's involvement; their decision to withdraw from further productions was also because the Second World War meant that [...] "foreign agents and spies were much more typical and topical than the antiquated criminal activities of Moriarty and the like". On 2 October 1939, a month after the release of Adventures, Rathbone and Bruce resumed their roles on radio, in The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with episodes written by Dennis Green and Anthony Boucher. Rathbone left the series in May 1946, while Bruce remained until 1947, with Tom Conway replacing Rathbone.|$|E

Since then, Neji abandons his belief in determinism and resolves to get strong enough to never lose a battle and change the fates of his loved ones. As the series progressed, Neji refined his Gentle Fist and devised original variations that either increase their potency or fix flaws such as the blind spot in his Byakugan. Neji also remedies the estranged relations between himself {{and the members of the}} main house, resulting in his training with Hiashi and Hinata at the end of Part I. Neji is killed during the Fourth Great Ninja War as he sacrifices himself to protect Naruto and Hinata from Obito Uchiha's attack, telling Naruto that he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> to die protecting those dear to him as his father had. Following the war's conclusion, a memorial is held in Neji's honor.

500|$|Storylines they {{featured}} in met with both praise and negative reactions. With the plot centering on Maddie Grey's paternity and kidnappings, All My Children [...] "fans revolted en masse." [...] Yet Soap Opera Digest hailed the plot as [...] "one {{of the best}} told, most fascinating storylines of the year." [...] In the Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund triangle, viewers took two opposing views on which brother should end up with Alex. Soap Opera Weekly proclaimed the triangle a hit, while Soap Opera Update rated it a ten out of ten. In the storyline, Alex and Edmund fall in love while her husband Dimitri is presumed dead. They eventually become engaged. When he returns and witnesses their happy relationship, Dimitri decides not to interfere. [...] "The dilemma for Dimitri is his brother's happiness," [...] Nader said. [...] "As much as he loves Alex, he's <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> to give her to Edmund." [...] Alex discovers Dimitri alive first. They reunite and engage in sex. Edmund finds out and feels betrayed by them both. The scenes of the confrontation between all three characters was written to express the views of both the Dimitri and Alex and the Edmund and Alex fans. The viewers who rooted for Edmund argued that Dimitri and Alex betrayed him by having sex immediately after reuniting. Viewers who supported Dimitri argued that the reunion was not a betrayal since Dimitri was Alex's husband. Alex ends up with Dimitri, which changes [...] "Edmund from a jaded, one-note character into a far more multidimensional and intriguing hero." [...] Soap Opera Weekly praised All My Children for not dragging the triangle out and instead {{using it as a}} catalyst for character development.|$|E
