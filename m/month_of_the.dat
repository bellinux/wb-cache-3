40|$|The Pedi year: A {{comparison}} with <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other biblical nations The investigation grounds arguments on facts {{that there is}} correlation between Sepedi and Hebrew calendars particularly in relation to similarity as well as {{difference between the two}} nations� beliefs which are related to <b>the</b> number (twelve <b>months)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. This means that Sepedi and Hebrew believe that the year comprised twelve months. Adding to this, the four Hebrew�s early names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, namely Abib, Ziv, Ethanim and Bul, of uncertain meaning, differ from the contemporary Hebrew calendar months. This featuristic phenomenon appears also in <b>the</b> Sepedi naming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year where a month is named after two or more names, such as Dibokwane (February), Hlakola (March), Mopitlo (May), Phupu (June) and Ngwatobo�ego (June) as well as Mosegamanye (July). <b>The</b> arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year brings forth certain similarity to <b>the</b> two calendars <b>of</b> these two languages.
