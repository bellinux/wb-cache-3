5|$|Queen Mary of Hungary {{was a great}} {{patron of}} music.

5|$|Between 1994 and 2009 a {{complete}} {{new edition of}} Nielsen's works, the Carl Nielsen Edition, was commissioned by the Danish Government (at a cost of over 40 million kroner). For many of the works, including the operas Maskarade and Saul and David, and the complete Aladdin music, this was their first printed publication, copies of manuscripts having previously been used in performances. The scores are now all available for download free of charge at the website of the Danish Royal Library (which also owns most of Nielsen's <b>music</b> <b>manuscripts).</b>|$|E
5|$|Opened in April 2013, the Woody Guthrie Center in the Tulsa Arts District is Tulsa's newest {{museum and}} archive.

The archives of Guthrie protégé, singer-songwriter Bob Dylan will also be displayed in Tulsa when a new facility designed to showcase The Bob Dylan Archive is completed.|$|E

25|$|Of {{greatest}} {{significance to}} musicologists is a manuscript by Veggio which survived {{in the archives}} of Castell'Arquato.

Many of the compositions are transcriptions for keyboard of vocal compositions, now lost, probably by other composers.|$|E
25|$|Edgar never {{discussed}} his early musical training in detail with {{anyone in the}} science fiction, fantasy, or mystery fields. It was known that he studied the piano and violin, but that was all. In 2003, however, a large stack of handwritten <b>music</b> <b>manuscripts</b> were discovered in the attic of the Bearsville house in which Edgar died. These manuscripts included original string quartets, sonatas, nocturnes, and other orchestral forms written by Edgar during his music conservatory days.|$|E

25|$|After he died, Graupner's works {{fell into}} obscurity {{for a number}} of reasons. His manuscripts became the object of a long legal battle between his heirs and the rulers of Hesse-Darmstadt. A final court {{decision}} denied the Graupner estate ownership of the <b>music</b> <b>manuscripts.</b> The heirs were unable to obtain permission to sell or publish his works and they remained inaccessible to the public. Dramatic changes in music styles had reduced the interest in Graupner's music. On the positive side however, the Landgrave's seizure of Graupner's musical estate ensured its survival in toto. Fate was not so kind to J. S. Bach's musical legacy, for example. Another factor that contributed to Graupner's posthumous obscurity was that, unlike Bach, Graupner had very few pupils other than Johann Friedrich Fasch to carry on his musical legacy.|$|E
25|$|The Library of Congress was {{established}} {{by an act of}} Congress in 1800. It is primarily housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill, but also includes several other sites: the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in Washington, D.C.; the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, Virginia; a large book storage facility located at Ft. Meade, Maryland; and multiple overseas offices. The Library had mostly law books when it was burned by a British raiding party during the War of 1812, but the library's collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of Thomas Jefferson's private library. One of the Library's missions is to serve the Congress and its staff as well as the American public. It is the largest library in the world with nearly 150 million items including books, films, maps, photographs, <b>music,</b> <b>manuscripts,</b> graphics, and materials in 470 languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} of the Baroque was more lasting in church/sacral music, which was the musical form that was systematically nurtured in numerous monasteries (especially Franciscan ones) {{as well as in}} parish and cathedral churches. The preservation of <b>music</b> <b>manuscripts</b> and prints became widespread practice in the mid-18th century. Simple vocal-instrumental music for two voices with organ continuo was the form most frequently performed in churches; more prominent individuals active in the sphere of music could be found only in larger urban centres. They were mostly organists and maestri di cappella, skilful composers who had small vocal and/or instrumental ensembles and who frequently acted as music teachers (private or in church schools). The gradual development of the middle class had as one of its consequences the corresponding secular organisation of musical life, particularly in {{the first decades of the}} 19th century, a period that saw the establishment of music ensembles, music societies (1827 in Zagreb, then in Varaždin, Rijeka, Osijek etc.) and music schools.|$|E

25|$|Viewed {{from the}} main {{entrance}} to Peterhouse on Trumpington Street, the altar end of the Chapel is the most immediately visible building. The Chapel was built in 1628 when the Master of the time Matthew Wren (Christopher Wren's uncle) demolished the college's original hostels. Previously the college had employed the adjacent Church of St Mary the Less as its chapel. The Chapel was consecrated on 17 March 1632 by Dr Francis White, Bishop of Ely. The building's style reflects the contemporary religious trend towards Arminianism. The Laudian Gothic style of the Chapel mixes Renaissance details but incorporated them into a traditional Gothic building. The Chapel's Renaissance architecture contains a Pietà altarpiece and a striking ceiling of golden suns. Its placement in the centre of {{one side of a}} court, between open colonnades is unusual, being copied for a single other college (Emmanuel) by Christopher Wren. The original stained glass was destroyed by Parliamentarians in 1643, with only the east window's crucifixion scene (based on Rubens's Le Coup de Lance) surviving. The current side windows are by Max Ainmiller, and were added in 1855. The cloisters {{on each side of the}} Chapel date from the 17th century. Their design was classicised in 1709, while an ornamental porch was removed in 1755. The Peterhouse Partbooks, <b>music</b> <b>manuscripts</b> from the early years of the Chapel, survive, and are one of the most important collections of Tudor and Jacobean church music. The Chapel Choir, one of the smallest in Cambridge, has recently attracted wider interest for its regular performances of this material, some of which has not been heard since the 16th century. The restoration of the 1763 John Snetzler organ in the Chapel was by Noel Mander.|$|E
500|$|Aubrey {{eliminated}} {{hundreds of}} jobs when he relocated corporate headquarters from New York City to Culver City {{to be closer}} to production facilities, a move which was announced on April 29, 1970. Aubrey ordered the sale of MGM's historic collection of costumes and props such as the Ruby Slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz, Vivien Leigh's dresses from Gone with the Wind and the suit Spencer Tracy wore in Inherit the Wind. (It was bought by one of the defense attorneys defending Charles Manson, who regularly wore it to court.) The studio's camera department was auctioned. Most of the studio's Culver City backlot and its 2,000 acre (8km²) ranch in the Conejo Valley were sold to developers, moves already planned under Polk. Aubrey literally threw the company's valuable archives into the trash and brought production to a standstill. Composer and conductor André Previn, in his memoir, No Minor Chords. My Days in Hollywood, describes how Aubrey had MGM's collection of film <b>music</b> <b>manuscripts</b> discarded into the trash. [...] Aubrey was criticized for these actions. In 1986, he recalled, [...] "the buck had to stop somewhere, and it was with me. Nostalgia runs strong out here, so we were criticized for selling Judy Garland's red shoes. To us they had no value, and they had no intrinsic value." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between 1515 and 1518, {{under cover}} as a {{merchant}} of manuscripts, chaplain, singer, and instrumentalist, he traveled between London and the continent, {{as a spy}} for Henry VIII against the pretender to the English throne, Richard de la Pole, who mainly resided in Metz. [...] He was aided in this enterprise by a Flemish sackbut player, Hans Nagel.

2500|$|Given {{the almost}} {{complete}} elimination of 15th century <b>music</b> <b>manuscripts</b> in England, largely by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s, {{it is not}} surprising that most of Morton's music survives in sources from the Continent, and if he was ever active as a musician in his native land, all trace is lost. [...] Eight pieces survive, all rondeaux. [...] One of the most famous of them is the earliest known setting of the tune l'homme armé, which was used by many early Renaissance composers as a cantus firmus for the Mass. [...] This piece, a quodlibet, is probably datable to May 1464; it seems to have been written as a departure gift for another court composer, Simon le Breton.|$|E
