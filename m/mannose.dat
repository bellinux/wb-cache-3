5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, <b>mannose</b> receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E

Here, we report {{an essential component}} of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-mannosyltransferase I (GPI-MT-I), which transfers the first of the four <b>mannoses</b> in the GPI-anchor precursors. We isolated a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant defective in GPI-MT-I but not its catalytic component PIG-M.

Immunogloblulin and, to some extent, CD 20, can each escape antibody attack in vitro by modulation, but this is difficult to demonstrate clinically. Instead, studies of anti-CD 20 therapy of FL suggest that effector modulation, similar to that seen in the suppression of autoimmune inflammation by infusions of normal human IgG, may be important.

In this context, a relevant question arises: What can chemistry do {{in the search for}} new strategies and approaches to solve this emergent problem? Although initially a variety of known chemical compounds-for other purposes-proved disappointing in tests against Ebola virus (EBOV) infection, more recently, specific molecules have been prepared. In this Perspective, we present new approaches directed at the design of efficient entry inhibitors to minimize the development of resistance by viral mutations. In particular, we focus on dendrimers as well as fullerene C-with a unique symmetrical and 3 D globular structure-as biocompatible carbon platforms for the multivalent presentation of carbohydrates. The antiviral activity of these compounds in an Ebola pseudotyped infection model was in the low micromolar range for fullerenes with 12 and 36 <b>mannoses.</b> However, new tridecafullerenes-in which the central alkyne scaffold of [60]fullerene is connected to 12 sugar-containing [60]fullerene units (total 120 <b>mannoses)</b> -exhibit an outstanding antiviral activity with IC in the sub-nanomolar range!

However, additional studies are needed to determine the optimized fullerene-based leads for practical applications. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis cisterna are associated with the removal of <b>mannose</b> residues. Removal of <b>mannose</b> residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.|$|E
25|$|Galectin-1 {{has been}} shown to enhance HIV {{infection}} due to its galactose binding specificity. HIV preferentially infects CD4+ T cells and other cells of the immune system, immobilising the adaptive immune system. HIV is a virus that infects CD4+ cells via binding of its viral envelope glycoprotein complex, which consists of gp120 and gp41. The gp120 glycoprotein contains two types of N-glycan, high <b>mannose</b> oligomers and N-acetyllactosamine chains on a trimannose core. The high <b>mannose</b> oligomers are pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) and are recognised by the C-type lectin DC-SIGN found on dendritic cells. The N-acetyllactosamine chains are ligands for galectin-1. Galectin-1 is expressed in the thymus. In particular it is secreted in abundance by Th1 cells. In its normal function, galectin-1 binds to glycans on the CD4 co-receptor of T cells to prevent auto reactivity. When HIV is present, the galectin bridges between the CD4 co-receptor and gp120 ligands, thus facilitating HIV infection of the T cell. Galectin-1 is not essential for HIV infection but assists it by accelerating the binding kinetics between gp120 and CD4. Knowledge of the mechanism between galectin and HIV may provide important therapeutic opportunities. A galectin-1 inhibitor can be used in conjunction with antiretroviral drugs to decrease the infectivity of the HIV and increase the efficacy of the drug.|$|E

Previously, we isolated a GPI deficient yeast mutant accumulating a GPI intermediate containing only two <b>mannoses,</b> suggesting that it has difficulty in adding the third, alpha 1, 2 -linked Man of GPI anchors. The mutant thus displays a similar phenotype as the mammalian mutant cell line S 1 A-b having a mutation in the PIG-B gene. The yeast mutant, herein named gpi 10 - 1, contains a mutation in YGL 142 C, a yeast homolog of the human PIG-B. YGL 142 C predicts a highly hydrophobic integral membrane protein which by sequence is related to ALG 9, a yeast gene required for adding Man in alpha 1, 2 linkage to N-glycans. Whereas gpi 10 - 1 cells grow at a normal rate and make normal amounts of GPI proteins, the microsomes of gpi 10 - 1 are completely unable to add the third Man in an in vitro assay. Further analysis of the GPI intermediate accumulating in gpi 10 shows it to have the structure Manalpha 1 - 6 (EtN-P-) Manalpha 1 - 4 GlcNalpha 1 - 6 (acyl) Inositol-P-lipid. The presence of EtN-P on the alpha 1, 4 -linked Man of GPI anchors is typical of mammalian {{and a few other}} organisms but had not been observed in yeast GPI proteins. This additional EtN-P is not only found in the abnormal GPI intermediate of gpi 10 - 1 but is equally present on the complete GPI precursor lipid of wild type cells.

To dissect the contribution of xylose and core fucose residues to plant stress responses and immunogenic potential, we prepared Arabidopsis hgl 1 xylT double and hgl 1 fucTa fucTb triple mutants by crossing previously established T-DNA insertion lines and verified them by mass spectrometry analyses. Root growth assays revealed that hgl 1 fucTa fucTb but not hgl 1 xylT plants are more salt-sensitive than hgl 1, hinting at the importance of core fucose modification and masking of xylose residues. Detailed immunoblot analyses with anti-β 1, 2 -xylose and anti-α 1, 3 -fucose rabbit immunoglobulin G antibodies as well as cross-reactive carbohydrate determinant-specific human immunoglobulin E antibodies (present in sera of allergy patients) showed that xylose-specific reactivity of hgl 1 N-glycans is indeed reduced. Based on three-dimensional modeling of plant N-glycans, we propose that xylose residues are tilted by 30 ° because of untrimmed <b>mannoses</b> in hgl 1 mutants. Glycosidase treatments of protein extracts restored immunoreactivity of hgl 1 N-glycans supporting these models. Furthermore, among allergy patient sera, untrimmed <b>mannoses</b> persisting on the α 1, 6 -arm of hgl 1 N-glycans were inhibitory to immunoreaction with core fucoses to various degrees. In summary, incompletely trimmed glycoprotein N-glycans conformationally prevent xylose and, to lesser extent, core fucose accessibility.
