40|$|This article {{presents}} the design simulation, implementation and measurement of a miniaturized 900 / 1800 MHz dual-band low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) chip antenna for mobile communication applications. The {{use of a}} helix-monopole type dual-band antenna is realized in a multi-layer printed LTCC structure. The Ansoft HFSS 3 -D EM simulator, based on the finite-element method (FEM), is employed for design simulation. In the simulated structure, the PCB board of the RF circuit, connected to the chip antenna, is also included. A helix/three-monopole structure chip antenna is designed to achieve enough bandwidth at the 900 and 1800 MHz bands. Although the measured antenna performance is shifted to a higher frequency for both the 900 and 1800 MHz bands, the antenna patterns of the realized chip antenna {{are very close to}} the omnidirectional pattern of a dipole antenna at 900 and 1800 MHz. Recently, multi-layer LTCC technology has been used extensively for the miniaturization of RF passive components and antennas. In addition to the high integration by embedding components and interconnects, high Q passive elements have been demonstrated with LTCC technology. 1 It is suitable to integrate antennas and other passive components, even with active devices. Higher integration and more compact structures make LTCC technology popular in RF applications.

The efficiency, gain and bandwidth of cylindrical wire <b>meander</b> <b>line,</b> dipole, and Yagi-Uda antennas were compared for materials with conductivities in the range 10 ^ 3 to 10 ^ 9 S/m. In this range, the absorption efficiency of both the dipole and <b>meander</b> <b>line</b> changed little, however the conductivity significantly impacts on radiation efficiency and the absorption cross section of the antennas.

Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} initially the particles prop- agate systematically along <b>meandering</b> field <b>lines,</b> and only later reach the time-asymptotic diffusive cross-field propagation. In this paper, we analyse cross-field propagation of 1 – 100 MeV protons in composite 2 D-slab turbulence superposed on a constant background magnetic field, using full-orbit particle simulations, to study the non-diffusive phase of particle propagation with a wide range of turbulence parameters. We show that the early-time non-diffusive propagation of the particles is consistent with particle propagation along turbulently <b>meandering</b> field <b>lines.</b> This results in a wide cross-field extent of the particles already at the initial arrival of particles to a given distance along the mean field direction, unlike when using spatial diffusion particle transport models. The cross-field extent of the particle distribution remains constant for up to tens of hours in turbulence environ- ment consistent with the inner heliosphere during solar energetic particle events. Subsequently, the particles escape from their initial <b>meandering</b> field <b>lines,</b> and the particle propagation across the mean field reaches time-asymptotic diffusion.
