25|$|When {{an outline}} font is used, a {{rasterizing}} routine (in the application software, operating system or printer) renders the character outlines, interpreting the vector instructions {{to decide which}} pixels should be black and which ones white. Rasterization is straightforward at high resolutions such as those used by laser printers and in high-end publishing systems. For computer screens, where each individual pixel can <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between legible and illegible characters, some digital fonts use hinting algorithms to make readable bitmaps at small sizes.|$|E

This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into monoculture, since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity.

25|$|Flags are {{particularly}} important at sea, where they can <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between life and death, and consequently where {{the rules and regulations}} for the flying of flags are strictly enforced. A national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign. A courteous, peaceable merchant ship or yacht customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a courtesy flag). To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or {{in the face of a}} foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do can <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E
500|$|N64 Magazine journalists {{described}} Wave Race 64 as [...] "one of {{the deepest}} racing games" [...] they had played, stating that the game's dynamic waves [...] "constantly tests and re-tests" [...] the player's control and that the buoys system offers [...] "tactical decisions about whether to spend time taking a wide corner or dash straight on to catch the leader before it's too late." [...] Similarly, Game Informer remarked that the waves can strike players on every turn and that [...] "one mistake can <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between victory and defeat." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot praised the controls, stating that Wave Race 64 [...] "makes the best use yet" [...] of the Nintendo 64 analog stick. Although he highlighted the multiplayer mode for offering a [...] "fairly good competition", he criticized its small split-screen play areas for detracting from the drama. Alex Huhtala of CVG felt that the game was too short, but admitted that the multiplayer and stunt modes give the game longevity.|$|E

500|$|Moments {{before being}} {{propelled}} off the table, the athlete undergoes a sudden increase in g-force {{due to the}} curvature – or 'compression' – of {{the bottom of the}} inrun. They then initiate a very powerful, explosive jump that requires great leg strength. At this instant, the skis are opened up into a horizontal [...] "V" [...] angle, the legs are straightened and spread apart, and the athlete adopts their own unique aerodynamic flying position in what is called the 'transition'; all of this taking place in only a tenth of a second. Timing is crucial and there is next to no margin for error at this phase: a jump that begins too early or late off the table can <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between an excellent, average or poor effort. Each athlete has their own method of generating as much inrun speed as possible, depending on such intricacies as crouch depth, hip and knee angle, arm placement, or how far the torso is positioned over the knees. Body weight is also a factor (see power-to-weight ratio), which has led to some athletes' health becoming a concern over the years.|$|E

2500|$|A popular myth {{states that}} Gurkha soldiers, {{fighting}} for Britain, crawled along the ground, feeling the laces {{of the soldiers}} they encountered. British soldiers employed straight- or bar-lacing, while Japanese troops employed a criss-cross pattern. Criss-cross laces could therefore <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between life and death. The importance of correct lacing was thus emphasized to British troops. [...] Whether true or not, there is an account of Gurkha soldiers checking the boots and laces of soldiers they encounter in the dark to find if they are friend or foe.|$|E

2500|$|New Zealand's Naultinus {{are highly}} prized by {{international}} lizard collectors for three main reasons; firstly {{they have very}} attractive colouration and indeed, have been referred to by some as [...] "the world's most beautiful geckos". Secondly, they are day active and so are out and about when their keepers are awake and thirdly, they are cold tolerant, coming from New Zealand's strongly seasonal temperate habitats – since most collectors are wealthy hobbyists in developed countries in places like North America, Europe and Japan – also temperate areas – this means they do not require heat lamps when kept in terrariums. All this adds up to strong demand for these animals {{on the black market}} for the illegal pet trade – [...] "dozens of these protected reptiles are poached from the wild each year, when even low-level poaching could <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between survival and extinction for small, isolated populations". All endemic New Zealand lizard species including all species of Naultinus [...] are protected by law both under the New Zealand Wildlife Act (1953) and the United Nations Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In an effort to clamp down on continual poaching, DOC attempted to get tighter controls placed on trade in Naultinus in 2002 under the CITES agreement but the request was denied, however, fines and periods of imprisonment under the New Zealand Wildlife act and trade in endangered species acts were increased in 2004 in an attempt to deter further illegal collecting and trading of these animals.|$|E
