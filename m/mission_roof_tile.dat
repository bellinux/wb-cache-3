The building includes Spanish or <b>Mission</b> architecture (red <b>roof</b> <b>tile,</b> tall chimney pots, and curvilinear gables) and replaced an earlier stone depot constructed in 1852 by the Macon & Western Railroad.

The building was extended to the rear in 1936, and received interior modernizations in 1960 and 1971. It was vacated and extensively rehabilitated during 1992-96.|$|R
25|$|The {{base was}} {{originally}} built via contract awarded December 5, 1933; {{most of the}} buildings were complete by late 1934. Captain Howard B.

He departed from traditional base design by rendering the buildings in the Spanish Eclectic (Spanish Revival) style then popular in California. Churrigueresque elements adorn the more important buildings. Reinforced concrete walls were covered in stucco to appear similar to earlier California missions; <b>mission</b> <b>tile</b> <b>roofs</b> topped the buildings.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship of}} certain red ceramic <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> properties to <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> biodeterioration. The following properties were studied: apparent porosity, roughness, and {{the presence or absence}} of two types of coatings. The effect of apparent porosity was studied by varying the peak firing temperature of a standard industrial red ceramic <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> composition and by preparing several clay mixtures, of different chemical and mineralogical composition, that were fired at various peak temperatures. The effect of <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> roughness was determined by either polishing or sanding fired standard red <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles.</b> A waterproof ceramic glaze coating and a photocatalytic coating were formulated to analyse the effect of the presence of different types of coatings. <b>Roofing</b> <b>tile</b> bioreceptivity was evaluated with a method developed in a previous study using the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp, which enabled <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> resistance to microbial colonization to be determined. As expected, bioreceptivity rose as apparent porosity (measured as water absorption) increased, enabling possible water retention, which favours biological growth. Similarly, greater roughness encouraged micro-organism adhesion and 2 raised bioreceptivity. It was found that, after prolonged exposure periods (several months) under very favourable conditions for biological colonization, <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> coated with the waterproof ceramic glaze were colonized. However, glazed standard red <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> covered with a TiO 2 photocatalytic coating exhibited practically no biological growth under the test conditions used, even after long exposure times, owing to the chemical-physical effect of the TiO 2 -based coating...|$|R

Objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of waste RHA collected from a brick kiln on structural and thermal properties of clay <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> <b>Roof</b> <b>tile</b> specimens with different RHA percentages (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %) were manufactured in industrial scale. Structural properties of clay <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> such as transverse breaking load, bulk density and water absorption were determined. In addition, thermal behaviour of <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> was examined. Furthermore, the physical and chemical properties of RHA and clay were also determined in order to find the reasons for characteristic behaviour of RHA added clay <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> For 10 % RHA replacement, transverse breaking load can be increased by 47. 24 %. Bulk density is reduced with the percentage of RHA added, which is a favourable property for <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> as a <b>roofing</b> material. RHA increases water absorption property. However, addition of RHA up to 15 % is acceptable, as it satisfies the limits specified in standards. Heat transmitted through the <b>roof</b> clay <b>tile</b> is reduced with increasing RHA percentage. Hence, cooler environment can be built under RHA added <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> than under conventional <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> It was found that the brick kiln RHA contains high amount of SiO 2 content of 84. 14 % and that may be the most probable reason for the strength gain property of RHA added <b>roof</b> <b>tiles...</b>|$|R

In this thesis a commercial <b>roof</b> <b>tile,</b> which was taken from a company, was used.

One way of adjusting the CTE values, the chemical analysis of the <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> was analyzed and based on these different engobe recipes with high purity raw materials and frit that was made in the laboratory with high purity raw material were prepared. The <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> were rich in SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, (Na+K) 2 O. Therefore, by changing the percentage of these oxides new engobe recipes were prepared to find the most suitable composition for <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> After application on surfaces of <b>roof</b> <b>tiles,</b> the samples were fired at 1000 oC for 75 min. 70 % SiO 2, 20 % Al 2 O 3, 10 % (Na+K) 2 O with 10 % laboratory frit and 70 % SiO 2, 20 % Al 2 O 3, 10 % (Na+K) 2 O with 30 % laboratory frit were found to be two of the most proper engobe compositions for the <b>roof</b> <b>tile.</b> Later these engobe recipes were prepared with lower purity industrial grade raw materials and industrial frit because the cost of producing frit is high for a <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> manufacturer. The low purity engobes were applied successfully on the surface. However, lower purity raw materials containing little Fe and Ti led to a slightly darker color compared to higher purity engobes.
