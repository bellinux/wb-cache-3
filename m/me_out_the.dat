500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Coodie and Chike and it premiered in November 2003. Kanye West, who financed the video, conceived ideas for the clip after seeing an Adidas advertisement in BlackBook magazine. He stated, [...] "I don't like gettin' ideas from direct shit ... I like to pull ideas from {{all the way over}} here. Sometimes my vision can't be explained in words, 'cause I couldn't have even told you in words how I envisioned that video ending up." [...] Chike recalled the making of the clip, saying, [...] "one day Coodie calls <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> blue about a concept he and Kanye had for a video revolving around Polaroid snapshots. I was leaving work at 7 PM only to come back at 10 PM, work all night then go home at 7 AM". Coodie stated that [...] "If we would have wrote a treatment" [...] for the video, [...] "they would have shot that down. They had to see it to understand. Otherwise they'd have said, 'No, Kanye should be rapping at a party, with lots of girls poolside'". It was awarded the Video of the Year at the 2004 Source Hip Hop Awards.|$|E
500|$|After {{expanding}} their musical boundaries with The Hot Rock, the band {{decided not to}} worry about what their next album was going to sound like. Tucker explained, [...] "It was so spontaneous [...] The songs just kept popping up one after another. We didn't really talk about anything. It just kind of happened." [...] She also said that they wanted to write songs that were [...] "really straightforward but also a bit more mature in their structure and delivery than [...] earlier songs." [...] All Hands on the Bad One is also the first Sleater-Kinney album where drummer Janet Weiss provides backing vocals on some tracks. Tucker remarked that they initially wanted her to sing on The Hot Rock, but the idea was ultimately rejected due to the album's complex melodies. All Hands on the Bad One was produced by John Goodmanson, who previously produced the band's third studio album, Dig <b>Me</b> <b>Out.</b> <b>The</b> band decided to work with him again because, according to Weiss, Goodmanson [...] "has the incredible ability of capturing our live sound and heightening it, so we sound better". The album was recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot! Recording Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington.|$|E
