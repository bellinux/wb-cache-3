5|$|The {{proper motion}} {{of a star}} is its amount of {{movement}} across the celestial sphere, determined by comparing its position relative to <b>more</b> <b>distant</b> background objects.

5|$|As {{the years}} went by with further childlessness, Ernest became <b>more</b> <b>distant</b> to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine continued to be devoted, choosing to ignore those relationships she was aware of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest in his wife.|$|E
5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that makes use of gravitational microlensing events. These occur when a massive object passes {{in front of the}} <b>more</b> <b>distant</b> star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E
5|$|In {{a school}} of Pacific blue-eyes that is threatened, a few {{individuals}} accelerate and change direction, which initiates an escape wave that spreads through the whole cohort. Animals are known to dart in random directions and speeds as an escape response when threatened. Pacific blue-eyes on their own dart in this manner for up to ten seconds after being faced with a threat at close range. This period is briefer when faced with <b>more</b> <b>distant</b> threats or for fish in schools.|$|E

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined How intense {{do people}} expect their future {{emotional}} reactions to be? This should {{depend on the}} fit between the social perspective (near vs. distant) involved in the emotion and the emotion-eliciting event’s temporal distance. Temporal distance and social distance are interrelated (Trope & Liberman, 2010). We therefore argue that people should anticipate experiencing emotions that involve taking a socially distant perspective (e. g., guilt and shame in contrast to pleasure and sadness) with greater intensity when they predict their emotional reactions for distant-future events. The results {{from a series of}} experiments confirmed this prediction. Moreover, it was found that when people imagine emotional experiences that necessitate taking a <b>more</b> socially <b>distant</b> perspective, they construe these experiences to be <b>more</b> temporally <b>distant...</b>|$|R
5|$|In later years, {{because it}} was {{impossible}} for parishioners to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr from the <b>more</b> <b>distant</b> parts of the parish, the church eventually had many chapels of ease, as the population of the parish grew. One example of the latter is All Saints Church, Llangorwen, which was built in the early 1840s. In the course of the nineteenth century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided into some 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century Tycho Brahe {{demonstrated}} that comets must exist outside the Earth's atmosphere {{by measuring the}} parallax of the Great Comet of 1577 from observations collected by geographically separated observers.

5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on <b>more</b> <b>distant</b> surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E
40|$|Construal level theory {{proposes that}} {{increasing}} the reported spatial distance of events produces judgments that reflect abstract, schematic {{representations of the}} events. Across 4 experiments, the authors examined the impact of spatial distance on construal-dependent social judgments. Participants structured behavior into fewer, broader units (Study 1) and increasingly attributed behavior to enduring dispositions rather than situational constraints (Study 2) when the behavior was spatially distant rather than near. Participants reported that typical events were more likely and atypical events less likely when events were <b>more</b> spatially <b>distant</b> (Study 3). They were also less likely to extrapolate from specific cases that deviated from general trends when making predictions about <b>more</b> spatially <b>distant</b> events (Study 4). Implications for social judgment are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Pilgrimages were {{a popular}} {{religious}} practice throughout the Middle Ages in England, with the tradition {{dating back to}} the Roman period.

Under its current definition Crocodylia is restricted to only the most recent ancestor of today's modern-day crocodilians (alligators, crocodiles, and gharials). This distinction is more important for paleontologists studying crocodilian evolution. As such, the alternate spellings Crocodilia and Crocodylia are still used interchangeably in the neontological literature.|$|E

This formation was <b>more</b> <b>distant</b> from the Western Interior Seaway, higher and drier, with a more terrestrial influence.|$|E

5|$|As the Universe expands, <b>more</b> <b>distant</b> objects recede {{from the}} Earth faster, {{in what is}} called the Hubble Flow. The light from very distant galaxies is {{significantly}} affected by the cosmological redshift. While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.|$|E
