40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose is}} the {{improvement}} of the method of choosing the retarding regimes of cut rolling within the particular group in order to increase the quality of interval speed control of cuts at the automated hump. Methodology. Simulation method was used for research the trains’ breaking up process at the hump. Findings. The separation conditions of cuts within the particular group and their relation between the retarding regimes of cut control based on a system approach were studied. Interval between cuts within the particular group at the switches and retarders were considered simultaneously. The features of interval controlling at the classification humps with different mutual alignment of the first switch and <b>master</b> <b>retarder</b> were stressed. Originality. The researches found out that during optimization of the retarding regimes of cuts within the particular group one should provide the best conditions of cuts separation at the switches and retarders. Practical value. The problem of choosing the retarding regimes of cuts within the particular group is optimized formally. This retarding regime allows maximizing the minimum value of interval between cuts within the group...|$|E

In this case, the optimal value of expression (4) provides a braking mode in which the controlled cut has the minimal rolling time from hump crest to the IS of the first separating point. The vertex F of the domain _d (see Fig.  4), in which the exit speeds from the <b>master</b> and group <b>retarder</b> positions are maximal (fast mode of rolling down), corresponds to such mode.|$|R
