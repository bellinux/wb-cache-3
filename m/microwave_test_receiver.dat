40|$|Abstract − The {{problem of}} non {{destructive}} <b>microwave</b> <b>testing</b> of pipes has been addressed {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of the technique based on the measurement of the scattering parameter S 11. An asymmetric bifilar transmission line has been used to acquire data to be used in the defect modeling, being the pipe to be tested one of the two wires in the line, and a normal copper wire the other. The proposed data preprocessing to be used in a defect classification system is the focus of the paper. A linear time invariant convolving model of the defect is presented to take care of the experimental data acquisition setup. The assumption is that proper modeling can enhance in distinguishing different defects in the measurement system. The technique to extract the model from the acquired data is presented, together with a few experimental results conducted on real acquired data.

40|$|<b>Microwave</b> {{near-field}} <b>testing</b> is {{a promising}} nondestructive testing method {{because of its}} unique capability to interrogate metallic surfaces and multi-layer dielectric structures. Due to today's need for lighter, stronger, and more-durable materials, enhanced dielectrics are increasingly being used to replace or coat metals. Consequently, conventional testing methods, with their limited penetration, are no longer adequate, but <b>microwave</b> <b>testing</b> sensors transmit signals that can penetrate into dielectrics and so detect surface and subsurface anomalies. Due to the growing use of microwave near-field sensors for different daily life applications, there is an ongoing need to improve their performance. Recently, artificial engineered electromagnetic materials (metamaterials) have been utilized to demonstrate strong localization and enhancement of electrical fields around sensing elements {{in order to improve}} probes sensitivities. Metamaterials are being used to enhance sensors design at the hardware level for better anomaly and flaw detection. Currently, microwave sensors are being used to capture large and complex information, but doing so requires better integration of signal processing methods. Implementing artificial intelligence algorithms to process information collected by microwave sensors can address the challenge associated with information complexity or obscure pattern changes. To address this gap in microwave near-field evaluation, this study integrates machine learning techniques with <b>microwave</b> near-field <b>testing.</b> Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that denotes a set of methods that can automatically detect patterns in data to build a learning model. The learned model is then used for decision making about unseen data. Employing machine learning techniques for building classification models, this work combines machine learning algorithms with <b>microwave</b> near-field <b>testing.</b> In particular, it aims to build machine learning models that enhance flaw and anomaly detection in <b>microwave</b> near-field <b>testing.</b> The trained machine models can be integrated or embedded in a portable device or rack mounted <b>microwave</b> near-field <b>testing</b> equipment. The value of this approach is confirmed through numerical simulations and laboratory measurements...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion under {{insulation}} (CUI) is {{a common}} cause of pipeline failure in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Its detection with conventional inspection techniques is challenging due to the presence of the insulation layer and a protective metallic cladding that prevent direct access to the pipe surface. Guided <b>microwave</b> <b>testing</b> has been proposed as a cost-effective approach to screen an extended length of a pipeline for the presence of water, which is a necessary precursor for CUI. The pipe and metallic cladding naturally form a large coaxial transmission line in which the insulation acts as a dielectric and supports the propagation of microwave signals. The inspection is performed by launching the signal from an array of antennas permanently installed at one location along the pipeline. Wet insulation is then detected according to the radar principle since water results in the partial reflection of the incident microwave owing to the permittivity contrast between dry and wet insulation. This paper reviews the underpinning principles of longrange guided <b>microwave</b> <b>testing</b> and presents a new study aimed at enhancing the selectivity of the technique by detecting corrosion product inside the insulation which is more reliable indicator of CUI progression...|$|R
