25|$|Traylor {{joined the}} Chicago Bears as an {{unrestricted}} free agent in 2001 {{and went on}} to start 15 of the 16 games in which he appeared. He had 45 tackles, two sacks, an interception, two forced fumbles and four passes defensed. He was part of a defensive unit that ranked second in the NFL, allowing an average of only 82.1 yards rushing per game. Traylor and Ted Washington controlled the middle of the field, allowing young linebacker Brian Urlacher to roam the field and <b>make</b> <b>plays.</b> Traylor's second career interception came in the season finale against the Jacksonville Jaguars, when he picked off a Mark Brunell pass and returned it 67 yards to the Jaguars’ 9 yard line, setting up a Bears touchdown two plays afterward in a 33–13 victory. He started the team's Divisional Playoff game against the Philadelphia Eagles and was credited with four tackles and a pass defended.|$|E
25|$|Law again proved {{his ability}} to <b>make</b> <b>plays</b> that matter in the Aggies' second game against Texas on February 28, 2007. Playing all 50 minutes during the Aggies' double-overtime 98–96 loss, Law scored a season-high 33 points, with 5 assists and five turnovers. His three pointer {{at the end of}} {{regulation}} tied the game, sending the teams into overtime. Another three-pointer with 26 seconds left in the first overtime again tied the game, leading to a second overtime. Fouled {{at the end of the}} second overtime so that he would not be able to rescue the Aggies with another last-second three-pointer, Law deliberately missed his second free throw in the hopes that the Aggies could recover the ball and score again. Law's outstanding season earned him the honors of being on the AP 1st Team All American squad. He also made Dick Vitale's 1st Team All American squad as players such as Arron Afflalo of UCLA, Alando Tucker of Wisconsin, and Nick Fazekas of Nevada did.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{attention}} focused on Auburn's two star running backs, the team also boasted a capable corps of wide receivers as well. Prior to the game, Auburn receiver Ben Obomanu said, [...] "When you have your running game making big plays and the defense has to load the box (defensive line) to <b>make</b> <b>plays</b> and {{try to stop the}} running game, that opens up things in the passing game." [...] Auburn averaged more yards passing (241.4per game) than running (189.4per game).|$|E

500|$|Due to Micelotta's [...] "very mediocre" [...] {{hitting and}} {{being unable to}} help the Phillies as a result, he {{remained}} with Miami for the 1957 season. He, Woody Smith, Bobby Young, and Pancho Herrera {{were considered to be}} one of the best infields in the International League, with one writer saying, [...] "they <b>make</b> <b>plays</b> the Phillies couldn't make." [...] Micelotta finished the year with a [...]216 batting average in 143 games. He again played a full season with Miami in 1958 after spending the offseason playing in the Dominican Winter League.

500|$|In the end, USC routed the Cougars 47–14, with a {{primarily}} aerial attack. [...] Booty reestablished his presence, completing 28 of 35passes for 279yards and fourtouchdowns {{before leaving}} the game early in the fourthquarter. [...] Tight end Fred Davis had a career night with ninereceptions for 124yards and twotouchdowns. Davis' performance marked the most yards receiving ever in a game by a Trojans tight end.

[...] The Trojans defense kept the Cougars in check, putting pressure on quarterback Alex Brink and limiting Washington State to 64yards rushing.|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{opened his}} junior season, {{and his first}} year under coach Pat Chambers, on November 5, 2011 in an {{exhibition}} game against Slippery Rock. He led the team in scoring with 19 points. Frazier also posted 7 assists and 6 rebounds, helping Penn State win the game 64–47. He {{took part in the}} Nittany Lions' first regular season contest on November 12 against Hartford, with 12 points, 6 assists, and 5 steals in spite of being given 28 minutes on the court. When asked on his communication with Frazier, Chambers said, [...] "I'm telling him to <b>make</b> <b>plays...</b> he has to be one of our leading scorers. He's got to look to score." [...] In the following game, Frazier made his second career display with 20 or more points. He also matched his career-high total on assists, with 10. This was his second double-double with Penn State. Frazier also finished with 6 rebounds, 3 steals, and 1 block. Chambers said in a post-game interview, [...] "I'm very greedy. I'm an old point guard, so I want more out of Tim Frazier, if you can imagine... what more means is even more leadership, even better habits. We're always trying to create the best habits we can for the most difficult situation.". Frazier helped power the 62–46 victory over Radford, the team's second consecutive win in the regular season. It was also Penn State's first round game in the Hall of Fame Tip Off tournament. In his next game against LIU-Brooklyn, Frazier scored a career-high 26 points and matched his assists record for the second straight game, with 10. It was his second-straight double-double and the third in his stint with Penn State. Chambers commented after the game, [...] "Tim was terrific. He was a great leader tonight. He did everything you ask your point guard to do tonight." [...] He helped the program reach a 3–0 record {{for the third time in}} 12 seasons. Following up on a loss to Kentucky, Frazier recorded 27 points on November 20, 2011 against South Florida.

Although small in stature, Kharlamov was speedy, {{intelligent}} and skilled and a dominant player, being named the Soviet Championship League most valuable player in 1972 and 1973.

2500|$|Standing five foot, nine {{inches tall}} and {{weighing}} 170 pounds, Loob arrived in Calgary facing skepticism {{that he would be}} able to withstand the rougher North American game and smaller ice surface compared to what he was used to in the Elitserien.

[...] He was a vocal leader, unafraid to speak to his teammates when he felt it necessary. [...] He was a strong skater with [...] "dazzling technique", and former Calgary linemate Joe Nieuwendyk said Loob was a key reason for his own early success in the NHL: [...] "He just had such a great amount of skill. He could do things none of the rest of us could. The luckiest thing that happened to me was getting put on Hakan Loob’s line my first full year in Calgary. He helped me so much, starting my career the right way. A big reason why I scored 50."
