5|$|The {{evolution}} of sirenians {{is characterized by}} the appearance of several traits, which are found in all sirenians (monophyly). The nostrils are large and retracted, the upper-jaw bone contacts the frontal bone, the sagittal crest is missing, the <b>mastoid</b> fills the supratemporal fenestra (an opening {{on the top of the}} skull), a drop-like ectotympanic (a bony ring that holds the ear drum), and pachyosteosclerotic (dense and bulky) bones.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} is {{supplied}} by the <b>mastoid</b> branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery.

5|$|In 1968, Stafford {{stopped by}} Shepard's office {{and told him}} that an {{otologist}} in Los Angeles had developed a cure for Ménière's disease. Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with Dr. William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard's <b>mastoid</b> bone and make a tiny hole in the endolymphatic sac. A small tube was inserted to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted in early 1969 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos. The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{goal was}} to clarify the {{clinical}} sig-nificance of vibration-induced nystagmus (VIN). METHODS: One hundred patients with unilateral vestibulocochlear disorders were enrolled into this study. However, patients with spontaneous nystag-mus were excluded. Vibratory stimuli (approxi-mately 100 Hz) were presented to the <b>mastoids</b> and the forehead. Patients also underwent caloric test-ing and vestibular evoked myogenic potential test-ing. RESULTS: Of the 100 patients, 60 (60 %) showed VIN. The nystagmus was mainly horizontal. VIN was more frequently evoked on the <b>mastoids</b> than the forehead. In the majority of patients, the direction of VIN was toward the healthy side, whereas some patients, especially patients with Meniere’s dis-ease, showed nystagmus toward the affected side. VIN was frequently evoked in patients with severe unilateral vestibular damages (canal paresis> 50 %) (39 of 43, or 90 %).

50|$|Creodonts had long, narrow skulls {{with small}} brains. The skull narrowed {{considerably}} behind the eyes, producing a distinct splanchnocranium and neurocranium {{segments of the}} cranium.

5|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the International Journal of Otolaryngology, Jeremy Hornibrook {{discussed}} the inner ear disorder Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV {{is the most common}} cause of vertigo, a problem attributed to a detached otoconia in one of the semicircular canals. Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Magic Wand to deliver vibrations to the area of the <b>mastoid</b> process.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, {{openings}} in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars.

5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of the palate near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends {{along the length of}} the palate. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not as deeply as in Holochilus and Lundomys. The <b>mastoid</b> skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short, not extending between the first molars. The posterolateral palatal pits (small openings {{at the back of}} the palate, near the third molars) are poorly developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the back margin of the palate, does not usually reach forward between the maxillaries. Its roof either is wholly ossified or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. Unlike in some other oryzomyines, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two foramina (openings) in the skull, are not separated by an alisphenoid strut. The pattern of grooves and foramina in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys. Usually, the <b>mastoid</b> bone contains small openings (fenestrations) in T.talamancae, but not in T.bolivaris. In the mandible (lower jaw), the capsular process (a process at the root of the incisor) is weak to absent and the upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and reach their front margin below the first molar.|$|E

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate bone regeneration in defects created in the <b>mastoids</b> of rats, using hydroxyapatite, to see how much of the cavity we could reduce. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve rats Wistar-Furth were used. A 0. 5 x 0. 5 cm bone defect was created in both temporal bones of the rats, and filled with 15 micrograms of hydroxyapatite. The left side was used as control. The animals were slaughtered 40 days afterwards and histology analyses were carried out. RESULTS: In the hydroxyapatite group, the new bone growth involved an area of 68. 53 % of the total; and in the control group it was only of 15. 97 %. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIOn: It was observed a very good hydroxyapatite integration to the temporal bone in this experimental model. The microscopic results were superior with the use of hydroxyapatite when compared to the control group.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} abnormalities in the craniofacial {{structures and}} in the brain in patients with Laron syndrome. Design: Eleven patients with classical Laron syndrome, nine untreated adults aged 36 – 68 years and two children aged 4 and 9 years (the latter treated by IGF-I), were studied. Methods: Magnetic resonance images of the brain were obtained in all the patients. One patient also underwent computed tomography. The maximal diameter of the maxillary and frontal sinuses was measured and compared with reference values, {{the size of the}} sphenoid sinus was evaluated in relation to the sella, and the <b>mastoids</b> were evaluated qualitatively (small or normal).

The diploe of the calvaria was thin. On computed tomography in one adult patient, the sutures were still open. A minimal or mild degree of diffuse brain parenchymal loss was seen in ten patients.
