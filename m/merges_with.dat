5|$|Geographically, {{this area}} {{lies at the}} northeastern end of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, as it slopes down and <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> the {{alluvial}} plains of the Ganges. In the district there is only hilly area of natural rock formation situated near Dubrajpur town called Mama Bhagne Pahar (Hill). The western portion of the district is historically known as Vajjabhumi or Bajrabhumi. It is an undulating upland that is generally barren. The comparatively more fertile eastern portion, constituting the northeastern Rarh region, <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> the Gangetic plain. Vajjabhumi {{is included in the}} Rarh region, and the rest of Rarh is called Sumha to differentiate it from Vajjabhumi.|$|E

5|$|Highway401 widens to 18lanes {{south of}} Toronto Pearson International Airport. Progressing eastward, eight lanes are carried beneath the large {{spaghetti}} junction at Highway427.

It returns to its eastward route through Toronto, now carrying 12–16lanes of traffic on four carriageways.|$|E
5|$|However if {{the white}} dwarf <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> another white dwarf (a very rare event), it will {{momentarily}} exceed the limit and begin to collapse, again raising its temperature past the nuclear fusion ignition point.

5|$|After {{crossing}} the city line, I-496 turns southward and <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> US127. The two highways run concurrently, and they cross {{a line of}} the Canadian National Railway. The freeway runs along {{the western edge of}} the campus of Michigan State University. South of campus, I-496/US127 crosses back into Lansing and has an interchange with Jolly Road before entering Delhi Township. About two-thirds of a mile (1.1km) south of Jolly Road, I-496 meets I-96 and terminates; US127 continues southward as a freeway toward Jackson.|$|E
5|$|As I-75 {{approaches}} Grand Blanc, {{the landscape}} changes back to suburbs. I-475 (UAW Freeway) splits {{off to the}} north to bypass {{the east side of}} Flint, and I-75 <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> US23. The combined I-75/US23 turns northerly to round {{the west side of the}} city. I-75/US23 meets I-69 near the Bishop International Airport southwest of downtown Flint. The freeway continues northward along the western residential neighborhoods, encountering the northern end of I-475 near Mount Morris. I-75 passes to the west of Clio and the east of Birch Run, the latter home to a large outlet mall. From there, the trunkline travels through farmland in southern Saginaw County.|$|E
5|$|As VT74 {{returns to}} the rural {{countryside}} it bends toward the northeast {{for most of the}} distance to Cornwall. Through this stretch the highway winds through forests and occasional farmland. VT74 straightens at an intersection with Bates Road. A connector road called North Palmer Road <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> VT74 shortly afterward. VT74 winds again for a stretch and straightens a second time near the intersection with Elmendorf Road as it continues toward Cornwall, intersecting with several township highways and approaching increasingly residential areas. At Clark Road in Cornwall, VT74 turns to the northeast once again, passing through more forests before terminating at VT30 in Cornwall.|$|E

5|$|At {{the north}} (Manhattan- and Queens-bound) {{end of the}} upper level, the Culver Line local tracks diverge, {{splitting}} into four tracks. The F train, using the outer pair of tracks, ramps down to the lower level, <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> the innermost, express tracks located on the lower level, and continues north to Jay Street–MetroTech. Meanwhile, the G train, using the inner pair of tracks, stays on the upper level before making a hard right turn east under Schermerhorn Street to Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. The lower level tracks can only be reached by trains running to or from Jay Street–MetroTech since they do not connect to the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the common, the South Circular <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> the A3 London to Portsmouth {{road for}} two miles, {{travelling}} along Wandsworth High Street and passing the old Ram Brewery.

5|$|Burton {{fails to}} {{complete}} the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains {{that he tried to}} stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|In Dix, NY414 makes a large reverse S-curve, {{turning to}} the east and {{northeast}} as it follows the Corning Secondary through another creek valley, this one surrounding Shequaga Creek. The creek eventually heads east toward Montour Falls; however, NY414 and the rail line continue northeast to the outskirts of Watkins Glen, a village located inside of a wide valley holding Seneca Lake. At {{the western edge of the}} gully, the Corning Secondary breaks from NY414 to follow the ridge north through Watkins Glen State Park. The route, meanwhile, descends the side of the valley to enter Watkins Glen, where it <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> NY14 at the foot of the hill.|$|E
5|$|In Tulsa, the Creek Turnpike has an {{interchange}} at Memorial Drive, {{which carries}} US-64 {{south of the}} toll road. At this interchange, Creek Turnpike traffic <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> northbound US-64 onto a free road, forming the Mingo Valley Expressway. US-169 also begins at this interchange, heading north from here toward its other end in Virginia, Minnesota. As the Mingo Valley Expressway (carrying US-64/US-169) turns north, the Creek Turnpike exits to continue southeast. The highway leaves Tulsa, entering Broken Arrow, where it crosses over Haikey Creek. The turnpike passes through the second toll plaza, then turns back east.|$|E

The highway turns towards the {{northwest}} after the SH 358 interchange roughly {{parallel to the}} south of the Nueces River. Just prior to leaving the Corpus Christi city limits, it intersects and has a short concurrency with US 77 (future I-69E). US 77 (future I-69E) <b>merges</b> <b>with</b> I-37 as a freeway from the south; the two continue to the north and split after crossing the Nueces River.
