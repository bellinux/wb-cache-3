40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of a bioactive edible coating combined with a low γ-radiation dose or negative air ionization (NAI) with ozone on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat cauliflowers. Results showed that each treatment alone was effective on Listeria innocua, Escherichia coli and <b>mesophilic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> After 7 d, treatment with γ-radiation reduced L. innocua and E. coli of 1. 8 and 3. 6 log CFU g- 1 respectively while NAI + ozone reduced L. innocua and E. coli of 2. 0 and 2. 8 log CFU g- 1 respectively. <b>Mesophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> were reduced of 1. 8 log CFU g- 1 after γ-radiation and 1. 4 log CFU g- 1 after NAI + ozone. This study demonstrated that the bioactive coating acts in synergy with γ-radiation, inducing no bacterial growth of L. innocua and E. coli, as well as a control of the growth of <b>mesophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> during 7 d.

How does covalent flavinylation occur in prokaryotes, which lack SdhE homologs? In this study, I showed that covalent flavinylation in two hyperthermophilic bacteria/archaea lacking SdhE, Thermus thermophilus and Sulfolobus tokodaii, requires heat and dicarboxylic acid. These thermophilic bacteria/archaea inhabit hot environments and are said to be genetically far removed from <b>mesophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> which possess SdhE. Since <b>mesophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> have been effective at covalent bonding in temperate environments, they may have caused the evolution of SdhE...|$|R

Accordingly, the microbiological safety of a total of 201 kitchen sponges randomly collected from food establishments was evaluated against the total counts of aerobic <b>mesophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> (AMB), Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and yeast and molds.

30|$|<b>Mesophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> are {{dominant}} {{during the}} early stages of composting by degrading the organic matter; thereby raising the temperature of the system. Once the thermophilic stage has reached, spore-forming bacteria are considered to take over and act upon the organic matter, which is clearly observed with the rise in populations of spore-forming bacteria especially in trial 3 {{and at the same time}} decline in <b>mesophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> was observed in all the trials. The results were in accordance with the reports by Ishii et al. (2000), stating the significant role of temperature over the populations of one another. In comparison to all the trials, trial 3 reached a maximum reduction of bacterial count with highest temperature and with higher spore-forming bacterial count during the process. The higher temperature may be observed due to the combinations of waste materials in appropriate amounts in trial 3, which favored the growth of <b>mesophilic</b> and spore-forming <b>bacteria</b> to act effectively during the composting process.|$|R

Fresh pork sausages containing the FD (0. 25 %, 0. 5 % and 0. 75 %) were prepared in a meat pilot plant and were irradiated using a UC- 15 A irradiator equipped with a 60 Cobalt source. The γ-irradiation treatment alone was able to reduce the initial psychrophilic and <b>mesophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> by more than 2 log CFU/g and kept the lactobacillus population under the detection limit (100 CFU/g). Results also showed that the FD alone was able to extend the shelf life of the sausages from 5 days up to 13 days. At day 13, the FD or irradiation alone showed 2 log CFU/g less <b>mesophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> than the control.
