Diet groups were identified as MMH or MHH according to the sequence at which the full-milk replacement (M) or hay (H) diet were fed to the lambs over the three study phases (phases I, II and III) preceding each age period. Prominent differences in the morphology (size and volume) and function (pH, proteolytic activity and microbial population) of the rumino-reticulum were observed in indicator lambs (n= 2) killed at every age period and also between <b>milk-fed</b> and hay-fed <b>lambs.</b> The size of the rumino-reticulum was rudimentary at 3 - 5 weeks of age and remained underdeveloped in lambs at 17 - 19 weeks of age which had received a full-milk replacement diet during phase II. One lamb, slaughtered at 3 weeks of age, showed a large distended rumen with severe sloughing of the surface cells of the stratum corneum. The size of the rumino-reticulum increased in size (2 X) in lambs which were fed hay relative to the <b>milk-fed</b> <b>lambs</b> during phase II and reached adult proportions in all lambs at 31 - 33 weeks of age.

40|$|Abstract: The {{object of}} this study was to compare carcass and meat quality {{characteristics}} of conventionally reared lambs with others reared solely on milk. Eighteen crossbred lambs weaned at 5 weeks of age were randomized within each sex into 2 groups. The first group was fed reconstituted whole milk and the second, commercial lamb pellets and hay. Both diets were offered ad libitum for 9 weeks. Animals were subsequently slaughtered under standard commercial conditions. Samples of shoulder joint were taken for dissection and meat quality assessment was made using the 6 - 12 rib section of the Longissimus doristh muscle. Lambs on the concentrate and hay diet had significantly larger reticulo-rumens, livers and generally were less fat (p < 0. 01) than <b>milk-fed</b> <b>lambs.</b> Dietary treatment had little effect on meat quality. Lambs reared on the milk diet contained higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in subcutaneous fat than lambs fed concentrate and hay.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of protein utilization for growth in preruminant calves is decreasing with increasing body weight. In contrast to calves weighing less than 100 kg of body weight, heavy preruminant calves {{do not respond}} in protein retention to an increased intake of indispensable amino acids in dose-response studies. The marginal {{efficiency of}} protein utilization is low compared with pigs and <b>milk-fed</b> <b>lambs</b> at a similar stage of maturity. A reductionist approach was taken to perceive the potential mechanisms for the low protein utilization in preruminant calves. Neither an imbalance in the dietary protein to energy ratio nor a single limiting indispensable amino acid {{was responsible for the}} low efficiency. Also, amino acids were not specifically used to detoxify ammonia. Alternative hypotheses to explain the low efficiency are discussed and result in (i) a reduced post-absorptive supply of amino acids: e. g. by fermentation of milk in the (premature) rumen or preferential amino acid utilization by specific tissues; or (ii) a reduced post-absorptive amino acid utilization: e. g. by decreased insulin sensitivity, utilization of amino acids for gluconeogenesis or an asynchronous nutrient supply. In conclusion, several mechanisms for the low efficiency of protein utilization in heavy preruminant calves were excluded. Other physiological processes which are potentially involved remain to be studied, because the large potential for improving protein utilization in heavy preruminant calves asks for further exploration of their amino acid metabolis...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{compare the}} {{susceptibility}} to parasitism by Ostertagia circumcincta of lambs fed entirely with bovine milk or weaned on to solid feed at 3 weeks of age. In addition, {{the effect of}} a single daily feed of milk on worm burdens was assessed. Methods: Eight lambs were assigned to each of the 3 diets: milk (M), milk plus solid feed (cereal-based pellets and lucerne chaff) (MS), or solid feed only (S). Those to be fed solid feed were converted from complete milk feeding to the designated diet during their third week of life. From 3 weeks of age, all lambs were infected with 1000 O. circumcincta larvae twice weekly for 6 weeks; 4 lambs from each diet group were given normal sheathed L 3 and another 4 were infected with exsheathed larvae. Faecal egg counts (FEC) and serum gastrin and pepsinogen concentrations were monitored from Day 17 after first infection, and worm burdens and abomasal pH and morphology were determined at necropsy. Results: Total worm burdens and FEC were significantly lower in the M than MS and S groups, whereas {{there was no significant difference}} between those receiving sheathed and exsheathed larvae. The <b>milk-fed</b> <b>lambs</b> had a smaller reticulo-rumen and omasum and a more acidic abomasal pH. Serum gastrin and pepsinogen were increased in all groups, irrespective of diet or type of larvae used for infection. Conclusions: The cause of the lower worm establishment in lambs fed only milk was probably not failure to exsheath in the immature gastro-intestinal tract, as there were similar worm burdens in lambs whether sheathed or exsheathed larvae were administered. The lower pH of the abomasal contents of the preruminant lambs may have been a factor, as the parasites have previously been shown to die more rapidly in vitro at low pH. Alternatively, the milk itself had adverse effects on the parasites, but was ineffective when combined with solid feed. There was no benefit from feeding a milk plus solid diet over a solid diet...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} leucine {{metabolism}} in the hind-limb {{muscles of the}} <b>milk-fed</b> <b>lamb</b> was developed which permitted simultaneous estimation of the rates of protein synthesis (Ks, days- 1), degradation (Kd) and therefore gain (Kg) of muscle in vivo. The conclusions drawn from the model were: the rate of protein synthesis in muscle was related to uptake of leucine; the rate of degradation of protein was related to leucine output, as leucine, or its corresponding oxo acid, 4 -methyl- 2 -oxopentanoic acid, or CO 2. These findings support findings drawn {{from a wide range}} of studies in vitro. There was no correlation between rate of protein synthesis and rate of protein degradation, which suggests that the method can allow independent estimates of each. Estimates of protein synthesis obtained from the model (of leucine metabolism in muscle) were compared with those obtained simultaneously by constant infusion of radioisotope and analysis of incorporation into tissue. There were no significant differences between the mean values obtained for synthesis (Ks), gain (Kg) and degradation (Kd) by either method (Ks 0. 051 +/- 0. 002, 0. 046 +/- 0. 007; Kg 0. 016 +/- 0. 002, 0. 004 +/- 0. 008; Kd 0. 035 +/- 0. 004, 0. 041 +/- 0. 008 day- 1, respectively, for tissue analysis and the model).

40|$|The total sheep {{population}} in Greece currently numbers about 9 million animals producing annu-ally 670 000 tons {{of milk and}} 82 000 tons of meat (Faostat, 2004). The sheep meat accounts for 18 % of the total meat production {{of the country and}} 7. 8 % of that of EU. The sheep meat consumption per capita is the highest in the EU countries (~ 14 kg). All the Greek local sheep are dual-purpose (milk and meat) animals. The <b>milk-fed</b> <b>lamb</b> carcasses (light lambs) are dominant (65 – 70 %) in the total sheep meat production. Every year about 6 mil-lion young lambs are slaughtered, immediately after weaning, at the age of 30 – 60 days. So the carcass weight, like in the other Mediterranean countries of Europe, is much lower (6 – 10 kg) in comparison with that of the countries of Central and Northern Europe. The low slaughter weight is due above all to the traditional preference of consumers for meat of young animals considering it to be of better qual-ity (Bernabeu et al., 2005). This choice also tends to be favoured by the traditional farming systems where the farmers often prefer to get rid of lambs as soon as possible considering lamb production as a by-product of lactation (Arsenos and Zygoyiannis, 2005). On the other hand, there are objective rea-sons for this situation that are related with the high-er proportion of fat in the heavier lamb carcasses which characterizes the unimproved dual-purpose sheep breeds (Tzalis et al., 1994). The fat in these carcasses is more saturated at the same time (Cifuni et al., 2000). The production of heavier carcasses with accept-able quality for consumers could undoubtedly be advantageous for producers by providing higher Effect of age at slaughter on carcass characteristics and carcass composition in lambs of mountain Greek breed...|$|E
30|$|Aspartic proteinases (APs; EC. 3.4. 23.-) {{also known}} as acid proteases are a {{significant}} group of enzymes, produced {{by a variety of}} organisms including plants and animals, mainly used as milk coagulating agents in industrial cheese production (Yegin and Dekker 2013; Hsiao et al. 2014). Rennet, a milk coagulant obtained from the abomasum of <b>milk-fed</b> <b>lambs</b> and calves, is regarded as the industrial gold standard in cheese manufacturing (Kethireddipalli and Hill 2015). Chymosin (EC 3.4. 23.4) is the main milk-clotting component of natural rennet with activity amounting to about 90 % of the total observed potency (Salehi et al. 2017; Kumar et al. 2010). Chymosin specifically cleaves the Phe 105 -Met 106 bond of κ-casein (κ –CN) resulting {{in the formation of the}} (hydrophobic) para-κ-casein and the (hydrophilic) biologically active component glycomacropeptide (Neelima et al. 2013). The glycomacropeptide further diffuses into cheese whey and the destabilized micelles consequently aggregate to form cheese curd via the Ca 2 + induced aggregation (Hang et al. 2016; El-Baky et al. 2011). Due to increased demand for cheese products, animal-derived milk coagulants are not enough to cover the production, and this has prompted research efforts in the search, manufacture of recombinant and microbial rennin. Substitutes with milk coagulating ability must present some of calf rennet specific properties like a high ratio of milk clotting activity and suitable thermal stability. Microbial milk coagulants, {{also known as}} mucor rennins produced by microorganisms like Rhizomucor miehei (Gray et al. 1986; Ottesen and Rickert 1970), Rhizomucor pusillus (Arima et al. 1968; Tonouchi et al. 1986), and Endothia parasitica have found extensive application as milk coagulating enzymes in industrial cheese production (Jacob et al. 2011; Nasr et al. 2016). However, these fungal enzymes have several disadvantages when compared to their animal counterpart rennet, due to the flavour and bitter taste that dominate the cheese products; produced especially after a long period of maturation. For this reason, researchers have focused on finding new enzymes that possess the desired properties and characteristics dearly needed in cheese manufacturing. With this goal in focus, aspartic proteinase was isolated from M. circinelloides and further characterized.|$|R

40|$|The long, cold winters and {{the summer}} {{rainfall}} of the New England region mean that, {{in the absence of}} conservation of surplus summer grass, wool-cutting properties tend to be overstocked in the winter and understocked in the summer.

40|$|Ruminants {{have been}} domesticated and {{exploited}} by man for two major reasons.

A Function of the Rumen The young <b>milk-fed</b> calf or <b>lamb</b> is essentially monogastric with regard to its digestive physiology, but by 3 - 4 months of age, under normal husbandry conditions, i. e. weaned and fed pasture, the preruminant 3 yrimal develops a digestive system which is essentially ruminant in IXha. racter.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that milk-fed {{ruminants}} were less susceptible to gastro-intestinal parasites compared with young animals that were given solid feed in the diet. The present studies were carried out {{to gain a better understanding}} of how milk feeding reduces worm establishment in newborn lambs. Two approaches have been taken: an in vivo study in which lambs were infected from three weeks of age with third-stage larval Ostertagia circumcincta and an in vitro examination of direct effects of bovine milk and some of its crude fractions on the motility of O. circumcincta larvae. The in vivo experiment was designed to compare parasite establishment in lambs either fed entirely on milk from birth, weaned on to solid feed by three weeks of age, or provided with solid feed from two weeks of age and given a milk feed once a day. To examine whether lack of rumen development was a crucial factor, each diet group consisted of lambs given normal ensheathed third-stage larvae and an equal number of lambs given exshcathed larvae. A total of 24 lambs were included in the study, in six groups each of four lambs. All lambs were infected by tube (into the oesophagus) twice a week with either 1000 exsheathed or ensheathed third-stage O. circumcincta larvae. Infection began after the week taken to establish the lambs on their new diet, so that starting on week lour of life, the lambs were trickle infected for six weeks. There were highly significantly lower worm burdens at necropsy in the two <b>milk-fed</b> groups of <b>lambs</b> than in both the other groups, but no difference between the burdens in those completely fed solid food and in lambs receiving a 600 ml milk feed once a day along with solids. Irrespective of the diet, female worms made up half the total number of worms in each lamb, with males and immature stages equally making up the other half. Faecal egg counts in the Milk groups were also very low, three of the eight lambs never providing a faecal sample in which eggs were found. Also consistent with the lower worm burdens were the thinner abomasal mucosa and lower abomasal pH, although these may also have been affected by the diet. Nodules were visible in the abomasa of all lambs in all groups. All groups had increased serum gastrin and pepsinogen levels, with considerable variation between animals within all groups. An important observation was that there was no significant difference between lambs receiving exsheathed or ensheathed larvae for any parameter measured. The immaturity of the reticulo-rumen and omasum does not appear to prevent ensheathed larvae from exsheathing and establishing in the abomasum of lambs with an underdeveloped rumen. The similar worm burdens in the <b>milk-fed</b> <b>lambs</b> given ensheathed and exsheathed larvae therefore does not support the conclusions from an earlier study in calves that lack of rumen function was the reason for lower worm burdens in non-ruminating calves. Instead, it would appear that the milk itself is reducing parasite establishment. In vitro exposure to fresh bovine milk, commercial bovine milk with either 3. 3 % or 0. 2 % fat, the milk powder fed to the lambs, whey protein, casein or ultra low heat skim milk powder all reduced the motility of exsheathed third-stage O. circumcincta larvae. The effect on motility was concentration and time dependent for all milks. The active component appears to be associated with proteins and not with the lipid fraction and may be nonspecific, as both whey and casein were effective. Different components may be responsible for inhibition of larvae by whey and casein proteins. The activity of whey protein increased as the pH increased; the whey was most active at pH 4. 5 and above, when it would be in the anion form. In contrast, there was no difference in activity at pH 5. 5 and 6. 5 for casein. The effect of time of incubation also differed for whey and casein. A possible explanation for the in vitro and in vivo effects of milk are the attachment of the proteins to the larvae. The lack of effect when milk and solid feed are ingested together may result from the protein attaching to the food particles in preference to the larvae or, alternatively, the milk may have left the abomasum before the larvae were administered. This suggests that practical applications for milk proteins as anti-parasite agents may be limited in ruminants consuming solid feed...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{quantify}} {{aspects of}} absorption {{and retention of}} vitamin B 12 from milk in pre-ruminant lambs, and the possible effect of activation of dependent metabolic pathways (propionatesuccinate) on vitamin B 12 concentrations in tissues. METHODS: In Experiment 1, two groups of eight newborn lambs each received either milk substitute alone, or milk substitute with added propionate for 4 weeks. Half of the lambs in each group received vitamin B 12 injections twice weekly. Blood and liver samples were taken on Day – 1 {{and at the end}} of the trial, and blood was also collected twice weekly, for measurement in plasma of vitamin B 12, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and blood-binder transcobalamin II/haptocorrin. The lambs were weighed at 0, 2 and 4 weeks. In Experiment 2, 12 <b>milk-fed</b> newborn <b>lambs</b> (n= 2 or 3 /group) were injected I/M with 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 6 or 3. 2 μg vitamin B 12 and a further 12 were supplemented orally with 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 μg vitamin B 12, daily for 2 weeks. Three lambs remained as untreated controls. Blood and liver samples were taken at the start and end of the trial, and blood was also collected twice weekly, for measurement of vitamin B 12 and MMA concentrations in plasma. The lambs were weighed on Days 0, 7 and 14. In Experiment 3, 14 lambs from Experiment 2 were used to repeat the highest I/M and oral rates of supplementation used in Experiment 2. Blood samples were taken at frequent intervals for 24 hours, and analysed for concentrations of vitamin B 12 in plasma. RESULTS: Propionate supplementation was associated with increased concentrations of vitamin B 12 in plasma in lambs supplemented with vitamin B 12 but not in those not supplemented (p= 0. 047), but had no detectable effect on concentrations of vitamin B 12 in liver (Experiment 1).

40|$|How much meat {{do you eat}} in Italy? Estimated real {{per capita}} {{consumption}} with the innovative method of the prior deduction of losses. Using the same procedures for calculating Food Balance Sheets (FBS), a method of estimating the actual consumption of meat in Italy was developed, which was named the method of prior loss deduction. The method {{is based on the}} prior deduction of all losses (processing losses, scraps and wastes), which occur between the production of carcasses and consumption, from the national availability of carcasses and meat products imported and exported. The estimate envisages two phases: the first consists in the transformation of the availability of carcasses and meat products of the various animal species in consumable meat by means of conversion coefficients; the second provides for the subtraction by the latter of the waste at distribution and of the scraps and wastes at consumption. With regard to the first phase, the conversion coefficients of carcasses of domestic production and of the various categories of meat products imported and exported in consumable meat were determined. By means of these coefficients, it is possible to obtain the fresh meat actually available for consumption, regardless of how (raw, cooked, transformed into salami, present in mixed food preparations, canned food etc.) and where (home, restaurants, fast food, canteens, communities, street foods etc.) it will be consumed. Regarding the second phase, fixed percentages of deduction for retail waste and for consumer scraps and waste have been defined. Compared to the classic method of FBS, which expresses an apparent consumption in equivalent carcass weight, the method of the prior deduction of losses provides the real consumption of fresh meat. 24 The new method exploits all the advantages of FBS for the calculation of apparent meat consumption, but eliminates the great disadvantage of the enormous overestimation of consumption compared to actually ingested meat. The actual consumption is a more suitable index to monitor the nutritional status of the population, to study the relationship between meat consumption and human diseases and for implementing nutrition education programs. The method of prior loss deduction allows obtaining an estimate of the actual per capita consumption of meat similar to that obtained with Individual Dietary Surveys (IDS), but without having to resort to complex organization and the high costs of the latter. The method was used to calculate the actual consumption of meat in Italy in the six-year period 2010 - 2015. The results obtained indicate that a resident in Italy currently consumes on average 104 g per day of meat, equal to 728 g per week and 38 kg per year. The real per capita consumption of so-called red meat amounts to 75 g or 69 g per day depending on whether or not it includes <b>milk-fed</b> calf, <b>lamb</b> and kid. These amounts do not exceed the recommended threshold of the most important international research organizations to prevent the risk of contracting cancer.
