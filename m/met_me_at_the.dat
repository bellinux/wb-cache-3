500|$|Bicycling was {{the latest}} craze in the United States in 1896, and among those who came to salute McKinley was a brigade of bicyclists, who pulled images of McKinley and Hobart behind their vehicles, and {{performed}} tricks as they went to see their presidential candidate. The people of Canton joined in enthusiastically, and restaurants and souvenir venders expanded their operations. [...] A popular source of keepsakes was the wood of McKinley's front porch or fence, whittled as supporters listened, and the blades of his lawn, when not trampled underfoot, made later appearances in scrapbooks. In between delegations, McKinley entertained visitors; future Secretary of State John Hay, a major backer, came to Canton reluctantly, not relishing the crowds, but wrote [...] "he <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> [...] station, gave me meat & took me upstairs and talked for two hours as calmly & serenely {{as if we were}} summer boarders in Bethlehem, at a loss for means to kill time. I was more struck than ever with his mask. It is a genuine Italian ecclesiastical face of the XVth Century." ...|$|E
60|$|Ambrose <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of}} the stairs, and showed me {{the way to the}} supper-room.|$|E
60|$|Euphemia <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door. She had Pomona's {{baby in her}} arms. We walked {{together}} into the parlor.|$|E
6000|$|A mutual {{acquaintance}} whom I subsequently <b>met</b> told <b>me</b> that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} Jungfrau he {{had said}} to him, his eyes fixed the while upon a small snow plateau enclosed by precipices {{a few hundred feet}} below them-- ...|$|R
50|$|While {{wandering}} around the streets of Bergen sampling city sounds, hammering on stones and grit, Strand sampled sounds for the first song of the project, «No need for hibernation». <b>Me</b> <b>At</b> Sea appeared at local clubs from 2004, and the great Bergen electronic music Ekkofestival. The szynthskape meets the acoustic piano in a challenging creative union. Moen <b>Met</b> <b>Me</b> <b>At</b> Sea <b>the</b> summer 2005 in studio with open minds, letting new musical ideas flowing into their cooperative musical minds. Working with some takes they soon discovered a musical mix they both wanted to elaborate on. They worked together from two different starting points, this creating an astonishingly new soundscape.|$|R
6000|$|But when I said so to Jane, she <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> {{once with}} <b>the</b> {{crushing}} reply: [...] "Perhaps it wasn't {{the same person}} that came back for the box." [...] I saw she was right again. I had jumped at a conclusion. In cases like this, one must leave no hypothesis untried, jump at no conclusions of any sort. Clearly, that woman {{ought to have been}} made a detective.|$|R
60|$|By the way, when I {{went back}} to my lodging on that eventful day, the miller's wife <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
60|$|Mess. Sir, {{a gentleman}} <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{corner of the}} next street, and bid me give this into your own hands.|$|E
60|$|Pinkerton <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{appointed}} moment, pinched of lip, {{and more}} than usually erect of bearing, like one conscious of great resolves.|$|E
60|$|Day dawned; and I {{directed}} my steps {{towards the}} town. The gates were open, and I hastened to my father's house. My {{first thought was}} to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> midnight among <b>the</b> precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Saleve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.|$|R
6000|$|But why didn't {{you explain}} it all to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very first?" [...] I exclaimed, all tremulous. [...] "When you <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Quebec, I mean--why didn't you tell me then? Did you and Elsie come there on purpose to meet me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{force me}} into {{telling you the}} truth," [...] was the answer. [...] "You must know how much there is of my father in me before you trust me to be Mr. Armadale's friend. I got my letter yesterday, in the morning. Some inner warning troubled me, and I went down on the sea-shore by myself before I broke the seal. Do you believe the dead {{can come back to}} the world they once lived in? I believe my father came back in that bright morning light, through the glare of that broad {{sunshine}} and the roar of that joyful sea, and watched me while I read. When I got to the words that you have just heard, and when I knew that the very end which he had died dreading was the end that had really come, I felt the horror that had crept over him in his last moments creeping over me. I struggled against myself, as he would have had me struggle. I tried to be all that was most repellent to my own gentler nature; I tried to think pitilessly of putting the mountains and the seas between me and the man who bore my name. Hours passed before I could prevail on myself to go back and run the risk of meeting Allan Armadale in this house. When I did get back, and when he <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> night on <b>the</b> stairs, I thought I was looking him in the face as my father looked his father in the face when the cabin door closed between them. Draw your own conclusions, sir. Say, if you like, that the inheritance of my father's heathen belief in fate is one of the inheritances he has left to me. I won't dispute it; I won't deny that all through yesterday his superstition was my superstition. The night came before I could find my way to calmer and brighter thoughts. But I did find my way. You may set it down in my favor that I lifted myself <b>at</b> last above <b>the</b> influence of this horrible letter. Do you know what helped me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Uma pointed {{me out to}} him as I came up, and he <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of my own stairs like a {{thorough}} gentleman.|$|E
6000|$|... "My cousin {{brought me}} here," [...] she answered. [...] "You know I told you I had a cousin in Europe. He <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> steamer this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|The landlady <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door. ‘Here, madam,’ said she, with a curtsey insolently low, ‘here is my bill. Would it {{inconvenience}} you {{to settle}} it at once?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Susan {{had been}} staying with her uncle <b>at</b> Sutton, and <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Oxford. I am glad {{we were able}} to go. There was nothing that I more wished to have seen.' ...|$|R
60|$|However, his {{warning was}} so short, {{that he could}} not reach to Stony-Stratford time enough to be with <b>me</b> <b>at</b> night, but he <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> a place called Brickhill the next morning, as we were just coming in to tow.|$|R
60|$|My cousin <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> St. Pancras. I saw {{him before}} my own {{carriage}} {{had reached the}} platform, peering into the window of every compartment in his short-sighted way. He recognized <b>me</b> <b>at</b> last with a little wave of the hand.|$|R
60|$|When I {{went the}} next day Miss Sylvia herself <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door. She caught my hand and drew me into the hall. Her eyes were softly radiant.|$|E
60|$|Before {{they could}} answer, Miss Verinder called to me softly. She <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{door of her}} room, with a light shawl, and with the counterpane from her own bed.|$|E
6000|$|The landlady <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door. [...] "Here, madam," [...] said she, with a curtsey insolently low, [...] "here is my bill. Would it {{inconvenience}} you {{to settle}} it at once?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Singer Nitin Mukesh said Suraiya {{had played}} heroine {{opposite}} his father, playback legend Mukesh, in the movie, 'Mashooka' (1953), {{as the lead}} actor.‘‘Papa was very fond of her. She <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> a couple of award functions and was always affectionate.’’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{that you}} say is granted," [...] Seaman agreed. [...] "You <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Cape Town in your new identity, and you {{certainly}} seemed to wear it wonderfully. You have made it uncommonly expensive, {{but we do not}} grudge money." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Pineville, and we {{took the}} trolley car to his home. It is a big, neighbourless cottage on a hill {{surrounded}} by a hundred mountains. We got off at his little private station, where John's family and Amaryllis met and greeted us. Amaryllis looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a trifle anxiously.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Etherington <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{door of his}} appartement, and led me to {{an inner}} room without speaking. Here he stood gazing, for some time, in my face, with {{paternal}} concern.|$|E
60|$|Old Bill <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{station with}} the car. I hadn't come across {{him for some}} months, and I {{was glad to see}} him again. And he {{apparently}} was glad to see me.|$|E
6000|$|... "My man’ll be in soon," [...] he said, {{releasing}} the girl, [...] "and then we’ll see about some tea. He <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station and I sent him straight off {{for things to}} eat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A mild grey {{morning with}} rising vapours. We sate in the orchard. [...] William wrote the poem on the Robin and <b>the</b> Butterfly.... W. <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> [...] Rydal with the {{conclusion}} of the poem to the Robin. I read it to him [...] in bed. We left out some lines." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Reading {{in his own}} chariot, {{and taking}} me into that, left the servant and {{the child in the}} hired coach, and so he brought me to my new lodgings at Hammersmith; with which I had {{abundance}} of reason to be very well pleased, for they were very handsome rooms, and I was very well accommodated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you must}} always manage, {{even if you}} are not sent out, to look out through that doorway where you <b>met</b> <b>me,</b> <b>at</b> eight o'clock in the morning. If we have {{anything}} particular to say to you, Surajah--that is my friend, you know--will be there. Which way do you go out from the harem to fetch the food?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Loudon," [...] said my father, as he <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> depot, with {{a smiling}} countenance, [...] "if {{you were to}} go to Paris, {{how long would it}} take you to become an {{experienced}} sculptor?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{slipped away}} again this {{afternoon}} and went for that boat sail. We had a lovely time but were rather late getting in, and I hurried home with many misgivings. Aunt Martha <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a message}} for you from Godolphin Court," [...] he announced, and saw his brother stiffen and his face change colour. [...] "A boy <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gates and bade {{me tell you that}} Mistress Rosamund desires a word with you forthwith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{singularity}} of the case, when mentioned {{among my}} friends and acquaintances, naturally made it the subject of conversation in London, and in consequence my friend, the late Mr. Rennie, was requested {{by some of the}} commissioners of the navy that they might be permitted to hear the circumstances from myself. Two of them accordingly <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Rennie's house, and to them I detailed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time the particulars, then fresh in my memory, which form the subject of the above statement.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{letter from}} Baker <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> this place, and I {{find that the}} whole of that most disagreeable and {{annoying}} business is arranged. From the promptitude, skill, and energy which are apparent in the whole affair, I suspect I have to thank the very gentleman whom I {{was just going to}} quarrel with. You are a good fellow, Vivian, after all. For want of a brief, I sit down to give you a sketch of my adventures on this my first circuit.|$|R
6000|$|... [Abbotsford, Saturday,] June 17.--Left Edinburgh to-day after Parliament House to come [here]. My {{two girls}} <b>met</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Torsonce, {{which was a}} {{pleasant}} surprise, and we returned in the sociable all together. Found everything right and well <b>at</b> Abbotsford under <b>the</b> new regime. I again took possession of the family bedroom and my widowed couch. This was a sore trial, but it was necessary not to blink such a resolution. Indeed, I {{do not like to}} have it thought that there is any way in which I can be beaten.[289] ...|$|R
