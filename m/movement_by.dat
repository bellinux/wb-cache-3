5|$|A <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> women {{arose from}} Seattle during the Depression. Fueled by Eleanor Roosevelt’s book It’s Up to the Women, women pushed for recognition, {{not just as}} housewives, but as the {{backbone}} to family. Using newspapers and journals Working Woman and The Woman Today, women pushed {{to be seen as}} equal and receive some recognition.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Schindler was {{contacted}} via {{members of the}} Jewish resistance <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> Zionist leaders in Budapest. Schindler travelled there several times to report in person on Nazi mistreatment of the Jews. He brought back funding provided by the Jewish Agency for Israel and {{turned it over to}} the Jewish underground.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to refine patterns of body <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> practicing, or more generally by repetition. A number of brain areas are involved, including the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and especially the cerebellum, which functions as a large memory bank for microadjustments of the parameters of movement.|$|E

The world is ultimately conquered by light. Introduced by archival recordings by Deems Taylor.|$|E
5|$|Tactile sensory {{perception}} in divers may be impaired {{by the environmental}} protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, neutral buoyancy and resistance to <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> the inertial and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in sensory and motor function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The New Thought movement, {{which emerged}} in the 1880s, was {{responsible}} for popularizing belief {{in the power of}} the mind to achieve prosperity. While initially focused on achieving mental and physical health, New Thought teachers such as Charles Fillmore made material success a major emphasis of the <b>movement.</b> <b>By</b> the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture, being common features of both self-help literature and popular psychology.|$|E

5|$|The {{congregation}} {{decided to}} leave the Conservative movement in 1995, and for a year had no affiliation. In late 1996, after considering both Reform and Reconstructionist as alternatives, the congregation affiliated with the Reconstructionist <b>movement.</b> <b>By</b> 1999, membership had grown to around 370 families.|$|E
5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{eventually}} {{broke with}} Most and aligned {{himself with the}} autonomists. The autonomists, an anarchist group associated with Josef Peukert, emphasized individual freedom. They feared the domination of the anarchist <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists were opposed to Most. Soon, Berkman {{was working for the}} autonomists' publications, Der Anarchist and Die Autonomie, but he remained committed to the concept of violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.|$|E

5|$|Bryant, who {{retained}} {{her maiden}} name and her downtown apartment after her marriage to Trullinger, bridled at doing housework and yearned for professional advancement. Drawn toward politics and the women's suffrage <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> her friend Sara Bard Field, she joined the Oregon branch of the College Equal Suffrage League in 1912. She and Field gave pro-suffrage speeches in smaller Oregon cities, and Bryant rode on the suffrage float in Portland's annual Flag Day parade. Led by Abigail Scott Duniway, women achieved suffrage in Oregon later that year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, the {{congregation}} had increased {{in size to}} approximately 300 families, and had outgrown its original facilities. The congregation moved to a more suburban location at Eleventh and Flower in 1949, and formalized {{its relationship with the}} Reform <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> joining the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism). The Central Avenue and Culver Street building was sold to the Southern Baptist Convention, and housed the First Chinese Baptist Church until 1981, and then the Iglesia Bautista Central. By 2001 it was on the market again, and the Jewish community raised $540,000 (today $) to purchase it in 2002. The building is listed on both the city’s historic property register and the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Clowes {{assigned}} the inexperienced 7th Infantry Brigade a defensive role, guarding key points around Milne Bay from seaborne or airborne attack, {{and kept the}} veteran 18th Infantry Brigade in reserve, ready to counterattack. Lacking accurate maps and finding that their signals equipment was unreliable in the conditions, the Australian command and control system consisted largely of cable telephones, or where {{there was not enough}} line available, runners. The soft ground made <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> road and even on foot difficult.|$|E

5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> the {{intruder}} may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Having first {{established}} {{themselves in}} the West Coast third wave ska scene, the Daddies ultimately broke into the musical mainstream with their 1997 swing compilation Zoot Suit Riot. Released {{at the onset of}} the late 1990s swing revival, Zoot Suit Riot sold over two million copies in the United States while its eponymous single became a radio hit, launching the Daddies to the forefront of the neo-swing <b>movement.</b> <b>By</b> the end of the decade, however, the Daddies' mainstream popularity declined with that of the swing revival's, and the resulting commercial failure of their ska-flavored follow-up Soul Caddy led to an abrupt hiatus in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, marine {{biologist}} and ecologist Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring helped {{to mobilize the}} environmental <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> alerting the public to toxic pesticides, such as DDT, bioaccumulating in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and ecosystem health. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge {{their understanding of the}} degradation of the planet's ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 a {{political}} crisis emerged in Poland {{with the emergence}} of the Solidarity mass <b>movement.</b> <b>By</b> the end of October, Solidarity had 3 million members, and by December, had 9 million. In a public opinion poll organised by the Polish government, 89% of the respondents supported Solidarity. With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority did not want to impose martial law, as suggested by Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military action. In a formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilising for an invasion.|$|E
5|$|In August and September 1940 the Congress became {{split between}} Ansar and Khatmiyya supporters. At first the Ansar were dominant, but they lost this {{position}} {{by the end}} of 1942. Many of Abd al-Rahman's supporters saw him as a source of financial backing and admired his advocacy of an independent Sudan, but did not follow him as a religious leader and were not members of the Ansar <b>movement.</b> <b>By</b> the end of 1942 the government had decided the Congress had no political value. The Mahdists had split into rival camps, other factions had emerged, and the attendees {{at the annual meeting of}} the Congress included artisans, merchants and illiterates.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{predecessors}} Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush {{supported the}} organic <b>movement</b> <b>by</b> instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food, and Obama extended their efforts toward healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady, and installing bee hives, on the South Lawn of the White House.
