In July, 2011 Hurt sponsored the <b>Market</b> <b>Transparency</b> and Taxpayer Protection Act which would “protect the taxpayers of the United States by requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to sell or dispose of the assets of such enterprises that are not critical to their missions.” [...] However, because very little political leverage was used to pass this legislation, it most likely will die in committee. Hurt’s position on Government regulation is clear in his statement that “By reducing the unnecessary government regulations that hinder small businesses, keeping taxes low and allowing people to keep more of what they make, and cutting spending to get our fiscal house in order, the private sector will gain the confidence necessary to expand and create the jobs that the people of the 5th District need and deserve.” ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether reducing a <b>market's</b> <b>transparency,</b> by delaying {{the publication of}} prices for block trades, has any impact on liquidity. The analysis uses a sample of 5, 987 blocks from the London Stock Exchange that cover three different publication regimes: immediate (1987 / 88), ninety minutes (1991 / 92), and twenty-four hours (1989 / 90). Delaying publication {{does not affect the}} time taken by prices to reach a new level, which is rapid under all regimes. Spreads differ across years but their size relates more closely to market volatility than to speed of publication. There is, therefore, no gain in liquidity from delayed publication.

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{macroeconomic}} {{and data}} transparency standards lead to lower borrowing costs in sovereign bond markets. We essentially show that emerging market countries which subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) experienced a significant decline in borrowing cost proxied by sovereign yield spreads on secondary markets. However, the adherence of these markets to the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies caused {{a significant increase}} in the yield spreads. There is no impact of the adherence to the Code of Good Practices in Fiscal Transparency on the changes of sovereign spreads. In addition, the results suggest that a debtor country’s internal liquidity factor (measured by the total reserves to total external debt service ratio) and external liquidity conditions (measured by the yield on US longterm bond) are the most important determinants of emerging market spreads.
