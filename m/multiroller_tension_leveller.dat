40|$|Speech {{compression}} is {{a method}} of electromyographically reducing the speech signal, resulting in {{a decrease in the}} time required for presentation of a message by increasing the number of words per minute. Research in the area of speech compression has to this time been focused on determining the listener response by means of comprehension testing. While comprehension testing uncovers the individual 2 ̆ 7 s ability to resolve, organize, and recall a message at accelerated rates, it gives no information about the listener 2 ̆ 7 s psychophysical response to compression. Does the individual find listening to compression to be tension-provoking or stressful? Or can a listener accommodate accelerated speech without stress? The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the individual 2 ̆ 7 s acceptance of compressed speech. 2 ̆ 2 Acceptability 2 ̆ 2 was operationally defined as finding no significant differences between <b>tension</b> <b>levels</b> produced while listening to normal speech rate as compared to tensions produced while listening to compressed speech rates. <b>Tension</b> <b>levels</b> were determined by an electromyograph which measures the amount of tension within a muscle. The specific hypotheses researched were: Hypothesis 1. Sampled muscular <b>tension</b> <b>levels</b> will differ significantly with Order of Presentation. Hypothesis 2. Sampled muscular <b>tension</b> <b>levels</b> will differ significantly with Rate of Presentation. Hypothesis 3. Sampled muscular <b>tension</b> <b>levels</b> will differ significantly between Males and Females. Hypothesis 4.

40|$|AbstractThe role {{of oxygen}} <b>tension</b> <b>level</b> is a {{well-known}} phenomenon that has been studied in oncology and radiotherapy since about 60 years. Oxygen tension may inhibit or stimulate propagation of viruses in vitro {{as well as in}} vivo. In turn modulating oxygen metabolism may constitute a novel approach to treat viral infections as an adjuvant therapy. The major transcription factor which regulates oxygen <b>tension</b> <b>level</b> is hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha (HIF- 1 α). Down-regulating the expression of HIF- 1 α is a possible method in the treatment of chronic viral infection such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, chronic hepatitis B and C viral infections and Kaposi sarcoma in addition to classic chemotherapy. The aim of this review is to supply an updating concerning the influence of oxygen <b>tension</b> <b>level</b> in human viral infections and to evoke possible new therapeutic strategies regarding this environmental condition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Although Friction Stir Welding (FSW) avoids {{many of the}} {{problems}} encountered when fusion welding high strength Al-alloys, it can still result in substantial residual stresses that have a detrimental impact on service life. An FE model has been developed to investigate the effectives of the mechanical tensioning technique for controlling residual stresses in FSWs. The model purely considered the heat input and the mechanical effects of the tool were ignored. Variables, such as <b>tensioning</b> <b>level,</b> heat input, and plate geometry, have been studied. Good general agreement was found between modelling results and residual stress measurements, justifying the assumption that the stress development is dominated by the thermal field. The results showed a progressive decrease in the residual stresses for increasing <b>tensioning</b> <b>levels</b> and, although affected by the heat input, a relatively low sensitivity to the welding variables. At <b>tensioning</b> <b>levels</b> greater than ~ 50 % of the room temperature yield stress, tensile were replaced by compressive residual stresses within the weld...|$|R

Mortality narratives also receive higher meaning making scores than leisure narratives. Achievement (i.e. winning an award) and relationship events are posited to have mixed tension levels; for example, in relationship events, an interpersonal conflict would contain more emotional tension than falling in love. Achievement and relationship narratives also have varying meaning making scores.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Finite element {{modelling}} {{has proved}} to be an effective tool for the investigation of trends effected by changing welding conditions. This is especially important in mechanical tensioning of friction stir welds because of the large number of parameters involved. In this paper, an FE model is used to examine the effectiveness of the mechanical tensioning technique for controlling residual stresses in FSWs by the investigation of trends caused by changes to the welding parameters. Comparisons between different geometries, traverse speeds, and welding off-axis angle all produced consistent results, and showed that the peak stresses are most strongly influenced by both the local tensioning and heat input, and not by the more global welding conditions. The results also showed a progressive decrease in the residual stresses for increasing <b>tensioning</b> <b>levels</b> and, although affected by the heat input, a relatively low sensitivity to the welding variables. At <b>tensioning</b> <b>levels</b> greater than ~ 50 % of the room temperature yield stress, tensile stresses were replaced by compressive residual stresses within the weld...|$|R

This situation {{is the presence of}} campus doors which require forces to operate that exceed the ability of some mobility, activity, or manually impaired users to provide. This study was conducted to explore the conditions found on the California State University, Northridge campus, and examine the force capabilities of the impaired user population that interacts with it on a frequent basis. Linear horizontal push and pull forces, as well as torque forces, required to operate campus doors were surveyed, as were those forces produced by the impaired users. In addition, subjects were timed as they attempted to operate a door mock-up adjustable for the amount of force required to open the door. The values of the door <b>tension</b> <b>levels</b> for the task were determined {{based on the results of}} the surveys of forces, and on the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard for door opening force. The subjects were allowed to self-style how they would execute the tasks. An ability to produce a criterion amount of force was found to be unreliable as the sole indicator of an ability to perform the task. This was explained as being due mainly to the interaction between a person's capabilities and the task requirements. Task difficulty at different door <b>tension</b> <b>levels</b> was measured as reflected in task accomplishment times.

40|$|In {{a ground}} anchor system, cables or tendons {{connected}} to a bearing plate are used for stabilization of slopes. Then, the stability of a slope is dependent on maintaining the <b>tension</b> <b>levels</b> in the cables. So far, no research on a strain-based field sensing system for ground anchors has been reported. Therefore, in this study, a practical monitoring system for long-term sensing of <b>tension</b> <b>levels</b> in tendons for anchor-reinforced slopes is proposed. The system for anchor-reinforced slopes is composed of: (1) load cells based on vibrating wire strain gauges (VWSGs), (2) wireless sensor nodes which receive and process the signals from load cells and then transmit the result to a master node through local area communication, (3) master nodes which transmit the data sent from sensor nodes to the server through mobile communication, and (4) a server located at the base station. The system was applied to field sensing of ground anchors in the 62 m-long and 26 m-high slope {{at the side of}} the highway. Based on the long-term monitoring, the safety of the anchor-reinforced slope can be secured by the timely applications of re-tensioning processes in tendons...|$|R

40|$|Lesion of the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee {{is a problem that}} affects animals as well as humans and may evolve with joint instability that is often symptomatic and incapacitating. The main option for ligament substitution is the autologous tendon graft. The graft undergoes tensioning during ACL reconstructive surgery to reestablish the normal laxity of the ACL- deficient knee. Although graft tensioning plays a fundamental role in postoperative clinical evolution, ideal <b>tensioning</b> <b>levels</b> have not been established in the literature. Therefore, graft elongation that may occur over time {{is still one of the}} main reasons for ligament reconstruction failure. In this study, ten bovine calcaneus tendons underwent two successive assays of physiological tensioning for a maximum deformation of 2. 5 % of the initial tendon length, maintained for 600 s with force (N) values recorded at zero time (initial), 300 s and 600 s. At the end of the first assay, the tendon returned to its initial length and was maintained at rest for 300 s and then the next tensioning assay was initiated, repeating the previous procedure. Statistical analysis revealed that tendon elongation is more pronounced during the initial 300 s, reflecting a more accentuated decline in the tension values of the graft. Therefore, 300 s after tensioning and fixing the graft, the surgeon can assess with more precision if the <b>tensioning</b> <b>level</b> was adequate...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} series of studies testing the role of laughter in spontaneous conversation. Though laughter has typically been considered a response to humorous stimuli, one proposed function of laughter in naturally occurring talk is as a communicative signal indicating and attending to a potential source of social discomfort. We argue that laughter in conversation is a paralinguistic response to the desire for maintenance and management of social relationships during conversation. Laughter sends a message that some potentially alarming event need not be taken seriously, and invites the sharing of relief and mirth with others. Three studies tested this proposal. In the first, laughter was found to affect <b>tension</b> <b>levels</b> in conversation, and affect them differently depending on the initial <b>tension</b> <b>level</b> and who is laughing. In the second, the nature of the language just preceding laughter was demonstrated to be surprising and to co-occur with perception of fault on someone's part. And in the third, laughter was found to virtually escape notice in conversation as compared with two other non-linguistic noises, a sine tone and a cough sound, even when preceding talk was surprising or indicative of fault, and regardless of who was laughing. These findings are discussed as supportive of a model of laughter as a pragmatic device in conversation used to attend to and affect the health of social relationships...|$|R
