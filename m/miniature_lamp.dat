5000|$|The {{light output}} of an {{incandescent}} lamp in a flashlight varies widely {{depending on the}} type of lamp. A miniature keychain lamp produces one or two lumens. A two D-cell flashlight using a common prefocus-style <b>miniature</b> <b>lamp</b> will produce on the order of 15 to 20 lumens of light [...] and a beam of about 200 candlepower. One popular make of rechargeable focusing flashlight uses a halogen lamp and produces 218 lumens. By comparison, a 60-watt household incandescent lamp will produce about 900 lumens. The luminous efficacy or lumens produced per watt of input of flashlight bulbs varies over the approximate range of 8 to 22 lumens/watt, depending on the size of the bulb and the fill gas, with halogen-filled 12 volt lamps having the highest efficacy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Miniature</b> <b>lamps</b> {{may have}} a wedge base made of glass or plastic. The base may be an {{extension}} of the glass envelope of the bulb, with the wire leads of the lamp folded up at the base. Some wedge bases are made of plastic and slipped over the wire leads. A wedge base holds the lamp by spring compression in the socket. The lamp is inserted and removed without twisting. Wedge base lamps are widely used in automotive applications, and many Christmas lights strings use plastic wedge-based bulbs.|$|R

5000|$|Carbon-filament {{bulbs and}} fairly crude dry cells made early {{flashlights}} an expensive novelty with low sales and low manufacturer interest. Development of the tungsten-filament lamp in 1904, with {{three times the}} efficacy of carbon filament types, and improved batteries, made flashlights more useful and popular. The advantage of instant control, {{and the absence of}} flame, meant that hand-held electric lights began to replace combustion-based lamps such as the hurricane lantern. By 1922 several types were available; the tubular hand-held variety, a lantern style that could be set down for extended use, pocket-size lamps for close work, and large reflector searchlight-type lamps for lighting distant objects. In 1922 there were an estimated 10 million flashlight users in the United States, with annual sales of renewal batteries and flashlights at $20 million, comparable to sales of many line-operated electrical appliances. [...] Flashlights became very popular in China; {{by the end of the}} 1930s, 60 companies made flashlights, some selling for as little as one-third the cost of equivalent imported models. <b>Miniature</b> <b>lamps</b> developed for flashlight and automotive uses became an important sector of the incandescent lamp manufacturing business.|$|R

The light source is usually a light-emitting diode (LED), a <b>miniature</b> incandescent <b>lamp,</b> or sometimes a neon lamp, whereas the detector is a semiconductor-based photoresistor made of cadmium selenide (CdSe) or cadmium sulfide (CdS). The source and detector are coupled through a transparent glue or through the air.|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} to realize a luminous flux scale (lumens) using an integrating sphere with a known amount of flux introduced from an external source. The integrating sphere features {{an opening for}} a detector, a test lamp in its center, a baffle between the test lamp and the detector. A second opening is used to introduce flux from an external source, and is appropriately baffled from the test lamp. Flux from the external source is introduced into the sphere through a limiting aperture of known area. The flux entering the sphere is determined from knowledge of the illuminance on the aperture plane and {{the area of the}} aperture. The total flux from the test lamp is deduced by comparison to the flux from the external source. Theoretical analysis is first made by computer simulation based on a ray tracing technique. Several integrating sphere designs are analyzed under various conditions, and {{based on the results of}} the simulation, an integrating sphere 50 cm in diameter is built to conduct experiments. The characteristics of the sphere are measured and compared with the simulation results. The total luminous flux values of several <b>miniature</b> <b>lamps</b> measured with this method are found to agree within 0. 5 % with measurements using goniophotometric technique.

40|$|An Analog Electro-Optical Multiplier, {{a simple}} and compact buiid state device with no moving parts, has been designed, constructed, and tested. Functionally, this device is the direct analog of the {{familiar}} servo-multiplier, being capable of multiplying one analog variable by up to seven other individual analog variables. The servo-driven potentiometer arm {{has been replaced by}} a photoconductive cell, illuminated by a low-power lamp, connected in a bridge circuit with two fixed resistors. The servomechanism driving the potentiometer arm {{has been replaced by a}} solid state operational amplifier driving the lamp in response to the value of the multiplicand. Accuracies of 0. 62 per cent of full scale have been obtained with this multiplier which has a dynamic range of 4 cps. An important advantage of this multiplier is the appreciable reduction in the number of operational amplifiers required compared to analog multipliers currently on the market, both for four quadrant and two quadrant multiplication. Initial experiments were conducted using the Raytheon Raysistor, an electro -optical device consisting of a light source and a CdSe photoconductive cell. The effects of signal heating, hysteresis, and signal voltage across these cells is discussed and compared with the improved characteristics of the CdS photocells which were used in the final design. The problem of uniformly illuminating several of these cells with a single lamp is discussed. In addition, the properties of <b>miniature</b> <b>lamps</b> with regard to light output, power requirements, and speed of response is considered. [URL]...|$|R

This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|R
50|$|Many {{flashlights}} are cylindrical in design, {{with the}} lamp assembly attached to one end. However, early designs {{came in a}} variety of other shapes. Some resembled candlesticks, with a bulb mounted {{at the top of a}} battery tube fixed to a flat base, with a handle. Many resembled lanterns, consisting of a battery box with a handle and the lamp and reflector attached to the front. Electric lanterns are used for lighting the broad area immediately around the lantern, as opposed to forming a narrow beam; they can be set down on a level surface or attached to supports. Some electric lanterns use <b>miniature</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> for higher efficacy than incandescent bulbs.

40|$|Several {{recently}} completed and ongoing programs {{have demonstrated the}} value of stable internal source of illumination for on-orbit responsivity trending and calibration update processes. A prime example was the SPIRIT III sensor on the Midcourse Space Experiment in the mid- 90 s which used grain of wheat bulbs as stimulation sources for the infrared focal plane arrays. As more recent programs have continued to prove, being able to monitor the responses of each pixel in an array over time enables calibration responsivity coefficients and dead pixel mask updates. As the internal sources often use {{very little of the}} optical path, while external sources (e. g. stars and the moon) utilize the full optical path, the combination of responsivity trending data on both can enable the analyst to ascertain which (if any) of the focal plane, internal source, or optical path is changing. Thus, contamination effects can usually be separated from optical degradation, focal plane responsivity from source changes, etc., especially if the sensor is capable of providing some spectral information. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of data supporting the space worthiness and operational capabilities of such sources. The Chicago <b>Miniature</b> <b>Lamps</b> CM- 7220 used for SPIRIT III are a notable exception, as well as a few isolated LEDs used in some existing sensors. Duane Miles, Space Dynamics Laboratory, did a major characterization of stability and lifetime for the CM- 7220 bulbs, but only at one power setting and one temperature. At The Aerospace Corporation, an Independent Research and Development program has been started to identify, test, and publish comprehensive data sets on a range of sources including Nichrome filaments, the CM- 7220 bulbs, and both visible and IR LEDs. This program has the ambitious goals of measuring spectral content as well as uniformity of illumination, repeatability, and lifetime as a function of drive current (or similar power parameter). Effects of temperature, vacuum, vibration, etc., will be documented during the expected three year program completion time. However, preliminary data on two LEDs at ambient conditions will be shown. Experience with existing sensors and sources has shown that a significant non-uniformity (up to ~ 2 X, when dynamic range effects can become important) of the illumination pattern can be readily tolerated, as long as the pattern has been characterized on the ground prior to launch and it is stable over mission life. Modest changes in absolute level can be calibrated out through the use of additional calibration sources, whether they be carried along (such as an on-board black body or Spectralon screen) or are celestial (stars, planets, the Moon), but this may limit the knowledge of total trended responsivity changes. Inputs from the community have been solicited for types of sources and database parameters that would be desirable to help guide the course of the test program.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{and analyses}} the archaeological {{remains of the}} Demeter sanctuary at Mytilene, Lesbos which was excavated from 1983 to 1994. The thesis {{is divided into two}} sections, the main text and a site catalogue. In the main text, chapters one and two provide a discussion of the possible origins of Demeter and a details description of the remains of the sanctuary at Mytilene. Chapters three and four examine topography and artifacts from a broad range of Demeter sanctuaries, while chapter five discusses a selection of sanctuaries of other Greek Goddesses. The conclusions from these three chapters are used to form parameters by which Demeter sanctuaries may be more reliably identified acrhaeologically. Chapter six returns to the specific study of Mytilene, assessing it in relation to other Demeter sanctuaries and examining its local social, political and religious contexts. Finally, the catalogue records Demeter sanctuaries from coastal Asia Minor, the Black Sea, mainland Greece and the islands, North Africa and Sicily, providing the data used for comparanda and analysis. Analysis of Greek Demeter sanctuaries indicates that they are usually small and often not adorned with numerous structures, but they are seldom hypaethral. Location is not a good characteristic for archeaological identification because, throughout the Greek world, sanctuaries can be intraurban, extraurban or set in isolated areas. there may be a slight correlation between the location of the sanctuary and the festival celebrated within, but this conclusion is problematic because of the secrecy of many of Demeter's rites and because sanctuaries may have housed more than one festival. There is also no definite artifact assemblage, but there are some artifacts which have a strong correlation with the worship of Demeter including hydrophoroi, <b>miniature</b> hydriai, <b>lamps,</b> women's objects, feasting wares and faunal remains, notably suids. These artifacts are especially indicative when present in large numbers. The sanctuary at Mytilene was active from the Archaic period to circa the first century A. D. The large numbers of artifacts from the diagnostic categories mentioned above, indicate that the sanctuary was dedicated to Demeter, while its chthonic elements argue that {{it may have been a}} Thesmophorion. Comparanda indicates that although its location on the acropolis is rare, it is not prohibitive to its identification. this sanctuary was evidently important to life in Mytilene town and the sanctuary phases can be conjoined with the local polis history...|$|R
