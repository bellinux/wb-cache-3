50|$|When calf-rennet grew {{scarce in}} the 1960s, {{scientists}} developed a synthesized type of Chymosin by fermenting certain bacteria or fungi (<b>microbial</b> <b>rennet),</b> but this also was not useful {{for all types}} of cheese-making. A solution using recombinant-gene (GMO <b>microbial</b> <b>rennet)</b> technology was developed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1990. This splices the calf-gene for producing chymosin into the genes of certain bacteria, yeasts or fungi, producing pure chymosin.|$|E

40|$|This work deals about {{evaluation}} of qualitative parameters of rennets. During {{the six months}} storing of rennets were determined following qualitative parameters: pH, rennet coagulation time, activity (strange) of rennet and dose of rennet, and finally were used instrumental methods: Near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) for recognizing age of rennets and spectrophotometric methods of determining the color of rennets. The theory found in the references suggests, that the activity of rennet should decrease {{by an average of}} 1 – 2 [*]% per month, but the results are showing, that are changing quality of rennets namely mostly activity (strange) of rennet, which was decreased by 33 % per half year. In analysis of color of rennets weren’t observed major changes by the whole group. Some statistical differences were detected in the partial values L*a*b*, most advantageous were evaluation by rennet total color change during storage, which were higher than noticeable change in four samples. The least color changes (P > 0. 05) were observed in <b>microbial</b> <b>rennets,</b> with no values observed (ΔEab < 2) that can be recognized even by the human eye when subjected to parallel comparison. It was found that the NIR analysis can be used to recognizing of rennets, which are different ages...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of cheese is the special arrangement of its components (proteins, fat, water and salt). The texture is the outward {{manifestation of the}} inner structure. During the cheese making and ripening of Dutch-type cheeses changes in cheese composition occur. Thus, the cheese consistency also changes. Rheological properties of Dutch-type cheese were characterized in connection with its composition and proteolysis level. Effect of rennet type, starter type, and brining conditions on rheological properties were observed in a view of a casein hydrolysis. The proteolysis was evaluated by both determination of a nitrogenous compound fraction and an electrophoretic determination of the casein hydrolysis products. Rheological and fracture properties of cheese were tested by uniaxial compression. The cheese viscoelasticity was measured by a creep and recovery test and by small amplitude oscillatory shear test as well. Rheological properties of cheese were also observed by a stress relaxation test. The textural properties of cheese were evaluated by a texture profile analysis (TPA). Rheological properties of Dutch-type cheese were characterized by means of tests mentioned above. Rheological properties obtained by the uniaxial compression and by the TPA {{were significantly related to}} the cheese composition. <b>Microbial</b> <b>rennets</b> exhibited the most extensive proteolytic activity. Cheese produced with this type of rennet possessed the highest level of a bitter taste and the worst sensory evaluation. The rennet containing chymosin and pepsin in ratio 50 to 50 % exhibited the lowest proteolytic aktivity. Cheese produced with this type of rennet possessed the lowest level of the bitter taste and the best sensory evaluation. For the uniaxial compression and small amplitude oscillatory shear test the effect of the rennet type on the rheological properties were found out. These increased significantly in two weeks of ripening time irrespective of the rennet type. Cheese firmness increased with elevating of the salt concentration of a brining bath, whereas this was decreased by increasing temperature of brining bath. Cheese possessed a higher firmness {{in the center of a}} cheese loaf. The brining conditions influenced the sensory hardness, smearness, cohesiveness, general acceptance of texture, and elasticity. The sensory hardness, smearness were changed by the tested layer of the cheese loaf. Available from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the above}} {{imperfections}} of <b>microbial</b> and animal <b>rennets,</b> many producers sought other replacements of rennet. With genetic engineering it became possible to isolate rennet genes from animals and introduce them into certain bacteria, fungi, or yeasts to make them produce chymosin during fermentation. The genetically modified microorganism is killed after fermentation and chymosin isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the fermentation-produced chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers does not contain a GMO or any GMO DNA. FPC is identical to chymosin made by an animal, but is produced in a more efficient way.

50|$|FPC {{contains}} only chymosin B, achieving {{a high degree}} of purity compared with animal rennet. FPC can deliver several benefits to the cheese producer compared with animal or <b>microbial</b> <b>rennet,</b> such as higher production yield, better curd texture and reduced bitterness.|$|E

40|$|In this study, Örgü cheese {{has been}} {{produced}} by using different coagulating enzymes (calf <b>rennet,</b> <b>microbial</b> enzymes, recombinant chymosin). The effects of different coagulating enzymes {{which are used}} on the characteristic of mineral material and cheese has been observed during 90 days ripening time. Mineral material contents of Örgü cheese have been determined with ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy). Proteolysis levels of cheese have been observed with chemical analysis and help of SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The determined difference between analysis results, titratable acidity, total nitrogen, water soluble nitrogen, ripening index, total solid, fat, fat in total solid, salt, salt in total solid, ash, texture, mineral material (Ca, Fe, Cu, Al, Mg, Mn) of Örgü cheese’s analysis result haven’t been regarded as significant statistically.

50|$|The {{traditional}} view is {{that these}} coagulants result in bitterness and low yield in cheese especially when aged for a long time. Over the years microbial coagulants have improved a lot {{largely due to the}} characterization and purification of secondary enzymes responsible for bitter peptide formation/non-specific proteolytic breakdown in cheese aged for long periods. Consequently, it has become possible to produce several high quality cheeses with <b>microbial</b> <b>rennet.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractRennet is an {{important}} ingredient in Cheddar cheese manufacturing and both the type used and the concentration applied can affect the ripening process. In this work, reduced-fat Cheddar cheese was produced using different concentrations of <b>microbial</b> <b>rennet</b> (Hannilase; 0. 026, 0. 052 and 0. 150  international milk clotting units (IMCU). g− 1 of milk) as well as recombinant camel chymosin (0. 052  IMCU. g− 1 of milk). The composition of the resulting cheeses was not statistically different, but the ratio of pH 4. 6 soluble nitrogen/total nitrogen (pH 4. 6 -SN/TN) increased significantly with increasing Hannilase rennet concentration. This ratio was also significantly lower in the cheese made with recombinant camel chymosin at a similar rennet concentration. Microstructural, biochemical and textural changes in the cheese were also monitored during ripening. The gel made with a high rennet concentration was qualitatively more porous but these changes in porosity were not reflected in the freshly pressed cheese. After 31  weeks of ripening, the cheese made with recombinant camel chymosin had a thicker protein network compared to the cheese made with <b>microbial</b> <b>rennet</b> (Hannilase), possibly due to lower proteolysis. Most of the Hannilase rennet was lost to the whey when the rennet was increased above the concentration of 0. 052  IMCU. g− 1 of milk. A lower concentration of Hannilase rennet may prove beneficial, as the texture was not significantly affected {{at the end of}} the observed ripening period. Recombinant camel chymosin may potentially be used as a substitute for products requiring lower proteolysis during ripening. However, the texture of this cheese was harder than the cheese made with Hannilase rennet {{at the end of the}} ripening period...|$|E

30|$|Many bacteria, {{especially}} {{several species}} belonging to Bacillus, {{are known to}} produce variety of extracellular enzymes, {{and they have a}} wide range of industrial applications (Wim 2006). Bacteria belonging to Bacillus, such as B. licheniformis, B. subtilis and B. subtilis natto, have been suggested as promising <b>microbial</b> <b>rennet</b> producers (Dutt et al. 2009; Shieh et al. 2009; Ding et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2013). In this study, we characterized a strain of B. amyloliquifaciens capable of producing milk-clotting enzyme and proteolytic activity (Guleria et al. 2014). Milk-clotting enzymes are invariably accompanied by proteolytic activity. In a program for the screening of bacteria for MCA, it was of interest to determine their proteolytic activity (exocellular). According to the morphological, biochemical, and 16 S rDNA sequencing, isolate was identified as a strain of B. amyloliquifaciens (Table  1; Fig.  1).|$|E
30|$|However, various animals, plants, and {{microbial}} proteases {{have been}} suggested as milk coagulants (Zhang et al. 2011), but still attention {{has been focused on}} production of milk-clotting enzymes from microbial sources (Silveira et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2013) due to their rapid growth, relative inexpensive growth substrate, and diverse properties. Microbial rennet-like milk-clotting enzymes are aspartic proteases that catalyze milk coagulation. Although, there are some shortcomings when compared with traditional calf rennet, even then <b>microbial</b> <b>rennet</b> has been accepted in markets of several countries. In the US alone, about 60  % of the cheese is manufactured using fungal enzymes (Hashem 2000). Many microorganisms that produce milk-clotting enzymes, i.e., Rhizomucor miehei, Aspergillus oryzae, Enthothia parasitica, and Aspergillus flavo furcatis, are widely used (He et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012; Alecrim et al. 2015). In the case of microbial rennets from Mucor sp., none of the available reports contains any indication that the use of the enzyme in cheese manufacture is unsafe (Tubesha and Delaimy 2003).|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on the {{physicochemical}} and sensory parameters of low-fat white brined cheese-like product obtained from the substitution of milk fat by milk-olive oil emulsion, in comparison with full and low-fat control cheeses.

The obtained cheeses were stored at 4 °C during 24 hours and then analyzed for physicochemical and sensory properties. The replacement of milk fat in white brined cheese resulted in a lower total solids content due to the higher water-binding capacity of fat replacers used. Fat content was significantly higher for low-fat white brined cheese-like product than in low-fat control cheese. This result was attributed to fat retention capacity of the fat replacers used. Lipolysis index was the highest in the case of low-fat white brined cheese-like product due to changes in cheese microstructure after fat replacers incorporation in low-fat products. Milk-olive oil emulsion showed the lowest cheese-making yield compared to its full and low-fat counterparts. The cheese like- product sample received a significantly lower overall impression score by the panelists than full and low-fat cheeses...|$|E

The objective of this work was to investigate whether there was a single Andalusian artisanal goat’ milk cheese or several types, depending on the goat breed and/or the cheese-making process (milk heat treatment, rennet type or ripening time). One hundred and eight artisanal goat cheeses, representative of the whole area of Andalusia and widely distributed, have been physicochemically analyzed (pH, TS, fat/TS, and NaCl). Linear regression models were suitable for studying which factors had an independent influence on the physicochemical parameters of these cheeses, the breed and the ripening time being the most influential factors. A K-means cluster analysis with the principal component analysis (PCA) scores was made in order to find profiles which defined these cheeses. The first group was composed of Malagueña fresh cheeses made with pasteurized milk and <b>microbial</b> <b>rennet</b> and which had a higher pH (6. 2) and lower values of TS (53. 5), fat (26. 1), fat/TS (49. 2), and NaCl (1. 5) than the second cheese group.

40|$|Background. Microbial milk-clotting enzymes {{are valued}} as calf rennet {{substitutes}} in the cheese industry. The worldwide increase of cheese production {{coupled with a}} reduced supply of calf rennet has prompted a search for calf rennet substitutes, including microbial and plant rennets. However, most plant rennets have proved unsuitable because they impart a bitter taste to the cheese. <b>Microbial</b> <b>rennet</b> {{appears to be more}} promising because its production is cheaper, biochemical diversity is greater, and genetic modifi cation is easier. Most cheese manufacturing facilities in Egypt perform land spreading of salt whey. However, this practice increases the chloride levels of soil, and elevates the risk of crop damage. One possible application for salt whey is {{to use it as a}} whole medium for growth and production of milk clotting enzyme from fungi. Material and methods. Mucor pusillus QM 436 was identifi ed to produce the highest milk-clotting activity during screening of 19 fungal strains. Salted whey results from Ras (Cephalotyre) cheese manufacture as a whole medium for growth of Mucor pusillus QM 436 and production of the enzyme. Results. The milk-clotting enzyme from Mucor pusillus QM 436 was purifi ed to 7. 14 -fold with 54. 4 % recovery by precipitation in ammonium sulfate, ethanol and fractionated by gel fi ltration on Sephadex G- 100. The enzyme was active in the pH range 5. 5 - 7. 5 and was inactivated completely by heating 5 min at 70 &deg;C and 30 min at 65 &deg;C. The highest level of enzyme activity was obtained at 60 &deg;C, pH 5. 5. A positive and proportional relationship occurred in the presence of CaCl 2 in milk, with inhibition which occurred in the presence of NaCl. Conclusions. The high level of milk-clotting activity coupled with a low level of thermal stability suggested that the milk-clotting enzyme from Mucor pusillus QM 436 should be considered as a potential substitute for calf rennet...|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{increase in}} cheese production and consumption, {{together with the}} reduced supply and consequent price increase of calf rennet, {{has led to the}} search of new milk coagulant agents. Much research interest has been thus directed towards discovering milk clotting enzymes which would satisfactory replace calf rennet in cheese manufacture. <b>Microbial</b> <b>rennet</b> produced by genetically engineered bacteria {{has proven to be a}} suitable substitute even though the consumer constraints on the use of animal rennet either for religion reasons (Judaism and Islam) or diet habits (vegetarianism) or consumer concerns regarding genetically engineered foods (Germany, Netherlands and France forbid the use of recombinant calf rennet) have led to a growing interest toward vegetable coagulants. Therefore, several plant sources of milk-clotting enzymes have been investigated. Unfortunately, most of the "plant rennets" were found unsuitable because they produced extremely bitter dairy products due to a strong proteolysis. However, an exception to this general rule is represented by the extract of flowers of the Cynara genus. In particular, flowers of Cynara scolymus and Cynara cardunculus contain two different aspartic proteases named cynarase and cardosin, respectively. The latter enzyme was successfully used for cheese manufacture in several areas of Portugal and Spain. Regarding the cynarase, its use is limited since the flowers of globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus) represent an edible part before the blooming. In fact, in Mediterranean countries, the globe artichoke plays an important economic role, so that Italy is the first producer with ~ 475 kt. However, the artichoke processing industry generates large amounts of agricultural solid wastes of which ~ 60 % is represented by the leaves. Therefore, I found of great interest to investigate the presence of aspartic proteases, possessing milk clotting properties, in the Cynara scolymus leaves as well as in the flowers of Carduus defloratus, as unproductive and/or intensely exploited agricultural lands. The obtained results showed the presence of clotting enzyme both in the leaves of Cynara scolymus and in the flowers of Carduus defloratus. In the first case, the extraction of proteins from plant tissue resulted difficult due to the presence of interfering compounds such as cell wall cellulose, lipids and other polysaccharides. To optimize protein extraction an enzymatic pretreatment with a mixture of carbohydrases was successfully carried out. However, the yield was always very low and, therefore, this protocol would be hardly suitable for an industrial application. For these reasons, in the second part of the work, I have studied the possibility to immobilize the enzyme extracted from the flowers of Carduus defloratus by using a commercial rennet from Mucor meihei as model enzyme. The immobilization of the enzyme extracted from both sources was successfully carried out by using an epoxy support and, in particular, the results showed that the Carduus defloratus enzyme exhibited higher stability than the commercial rennet one. All these results suggest the possibility to use an immobilized "vegetable rennet", extracted from the flowers of Carduus defloratus, for the production of novel dairy products...|$|E
