WITHIN the past several years, in consequence of the accelerated development of the microprocessor, interactive modes of operation on smaller and more affordable computers have become more readily available to teachers and researchers.

According to the norm-aects-allocation hypothesis, when studying an item, a person changes the sought-after degree of learning for the item (called the norm of study) {{in an attempt to}} achieve task goals. As the norm of study is increased, more time will be allocated for study. This hypothesis was evaluated by having people pace their study of items for an eventual test of recall. As pre-dicted, study time was greater (a) when points awarded for recalling an item increased, (b) when instructions emphasized <b>mastering</b> each <b>item</b> rather than quickly learning each item, (c) when points deducted for each second of study decreased, and (d) when the likelihood an item would be on the test increased.

A generative pattern not only tells us the rules for implementing a user interface (UI) design is considered as a generic solution to a problem at different levels of abstraction (in the way that a UI could be modeled), but also shows us how to transform these expressions into programmable codes for the diverse computing platforms, while being compliant with the style guide rules that may prevail for these platforms.

If the sources of heterogeneity are observed (e. g., gender), the sample can be split into groups and the data analyzed with methods for multiple groups. If the sources {{of population}} heterogeneity are unobserved, the data can be analyzed with latent class models. Factor mixture models are a combination of latent class and common factor models and can be used to explore unobserved population heterogeneity. Observed sources of heterogeneity can be included as covariates. The different ways to incorporate covariates correspond to different conceptual interpretations. These are discussed in detail. Characteristics of factor mixture modeling are described in comparison to other methods designed for data stemming from heterogeneous populations. A step-by-step analysis of a subset of data from the Longitudinal Survey of American Youth illustrates how factor mixture models can be applied in an exploratory fashion to data collected at a single time point.

30|$|Based on the {{identified}} capability areas and associated items, the maturity model is now constructed by defining maturity levels, assigning capabilities (items) to maturity levels, and thereby implying improvement paths. In contrast to existing CMMs which mostly define maturity levels generically (“measured”, “self-optimizing”) and assign items intuitively to such levels, {{we aim at}} using a quantitative technique to develop an empirically grounded CMM. Following Dekleva and Drehmer (1997 : 96 ff.) which are supported by various real-world examples (e.g. Lahrmann et al. 2011; Mettler 2011 b), the Rasch algorithm {{has proven to be}} a useful analytical method to determine an evolutionary improvement path. The fundamental idea behind Rasch is that each item included in the questionnaire can be associated with a specific “difficulty” (to achieve the respective capability) and thus the items can be ordered according to this difficulty—and their “difficulty sequence” represents an empirically justified evolution. The algorithm is based on the proposition that highly skilled entities have a high probability of having successfully implemented easy items (Bond and Fox 2007 : 37). By counting the answers that indicate the presence of capabilities, the algorithm calculates two scores: one for the difficulty of items and one for the ability of the surveyed entities. Both scores are measured on the same interval scale, which allows for estimating the likeliness, with which a certain entity <b>masters</b> a certain <b>item.</b> For evaluating the quality of the model, two statistics termed ‘Infit’ and ‘Outfit’ are used. Both assess whether data that have been analysed (items and survey participants) fit the expectations specified in the model. Applied in the context of CMM development, the Rasch analysis allows for the inductive allocation of items onto maturity levels based on the measurement of item difficulty as well as the assessment of surveyed entities based on their capability level (Dekleva and Drehmer 1997 : 97).|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} strip packing problem, {{in which a}} set of {{two-dimensional}} rectangular items has to be packed in a rectangular strip of fixed width and infinite height, {{with the aim of}} minimizing the height used. The problem is important because it models a large number of real-world applications, including cutting operations where stocks of materials such as paper or wood come in large rolls and have to be cut with minimum waste, scheduling problems in which tasks require a contiguous subset of identical resources, and container loading problems arising in the transportation of items that cannot be stacked one over the other. The strip packing problem has been attacked in the literature with several heuristic and exact algorithms, nevertheless, benchmark instances of small size remain unsolved to proven optimality since many years. In this paper we propose a new exact method, that solves a large number of the open benchmark instances within a limited computational effort. Our method is based on a Benders’ decomposition, in which in the <b>master</b> we cut <b>items</b> into unit-width slices and pack them contiguously in the strip, and in the slave we attempt to reconstruct the rectangular items by fixing the vertical positions of their unit-width slices. If the slave proves that the reconstruction of the items is not possible, then a cut is added to the master, and the algorithm is re-iterated. We show that both the master and the slave are strongly NP-hard problems, and solve them with tailored pre-processing, lower and upper bounding techniques, and exact algorithms. We also propose several new techniques to improve the standard Benders’ cuts, using the so-called combinatorial Benders’ cuts, and an additional lifting procedure.

The game about energy consumption and conservation at the workplace has been scripted and played using the ARLearn toolkit. The main purpose was to provide the users with useful information on the What, Why, and How as well as to motivate them to get involved and committed. The game was played in weekly rounds structured around certain topics. The first week started with an introduction to the game and the technologies used to play it. The second and third week were then mainly about electricity and respectively gas consumption and conservation at the workplace. Finally the fourth week dealt with individual consumption footprints and alternative conservation strategies. The main items that could be found in the rounds were: information, actions, and challenges. All the items appeared in the ARLearn message list or opened automatically when they became available. From time to time users were asked to answer questions, either as part of an item or in the course of quizzes. Usually when answering questions, read information, perform actions, or <b>master</b> challenges new <b>items</b> appeared. Users did not have to do everything at once.
