50|$|Gotive is a {{brand of}} {{handheld}} computers based in Slovakia. The firm specialises in producing handhelds for the enterprise market featuring options such as barcode, rfid, <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> wifi, and GPRS built in.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> {{were among}} the first {{persistent}} memory options available. The entered programs are stored on magnetic strips. Those were easy to transport, and the reader/writer was compact in size. However, the reader/writer as well as the magnetic strips were quite expensive. The last and most notable devices to use magnetic strips were the HP-41C and TI-59.|$|E
50|$|EMML {{was first}} devised by James Morley-Smith in 2001, when {{working as a}} Software Developer at Symbol Technologies (now a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of Motorola, Inc). As {{part of the first}} version of Symbol’s PocketBrowser, EMML was originally a mechanism for providing access to the barcode scanner built into many of Symbol's enterprise mobility devices. It was extended to include features such as WLAN signal indicators, power statistics and access to the communications port to allow for input from custom devices such as <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> and temperature probes.|$|E
50|$|Optional input/output devices {{included}} a <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and punch, a paper tape reader and punch, and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader.</b> The <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> used a large card (30 cm x 35 cm) {{with the top}} part used as a printer ledger. A 2.5 cm 4-track magnetic strip was {{across the bottom of}} the card.|$|R

50|$|Magnetic {{particle}} brakes {{are unique}} in their design from other electro-mechanical brakes {{because of the}} wide operating torque range available. Like an electro-mechanical brake, torque to voltage is almost linear; however, in a magnetic particle brake, torque can be controlled very accurately (within the operating RPM range of the unit). This makes these units ideally suited for tension control applications, such as wire winding, foil, film, and tape tension control. Because of their fast response, {{they can also be}} used in high cycle applications, such as <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> sorting machines and labeling equipment.|$|E
50|$|An {{everyday}} {{example of}} mechanism/policy separation {{is the use}} of card keys to gain access to locked doors. The mechanisms (<b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> remote controlled locks, connections to a security server) do not impose any limitations on entrance policy (which people should be allowed to enter which doors, at which times). These decisions are made by a centralized security server, which (in turn) probably makes its decisions by consulting a database of room access rules. Specific authorization decisions can be changed by updating a room access database. If the rule schema of that database proved too limiting, the entire security server could be replaced while leaving the fundamental mechanisms (readers, locks, and connections) unchanged.|$|E

It contains an interactive appointment system, full medical records, on line patient demographics, and multiple searching functions. Various strategies such as <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> and a “superbill” data entry procedure both speed data entry and make the system more acceptable for users...|$|E

50|$|A card terminal, {{also called}} EFT-POS terminal, {{consists}} of {{hardware and software}} components. The main hardware components are the security module, the PIN pad, the printer, the display, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> the chip-card reader, the communication module and the power supply.|$|R
40|$|Smartphones {{have become}} {{powerful}} enough to replace general purpose computers as the platform for payment applications. This thesis investigates Android smartphone payment applications and audio-jack <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> (AMSRs). Taint tracking is integrated into the payment application analysis to discover where card data may leak to other applications. The analysis of AMSRs discovers a software logic vulnerability which provides direction to pursue an investigation of public key cryptography under the constraints of Android audio port power. Veri ed by both hand measurements and simulation, the Samsung Galaxy S 2 is found to generate enough power from its audiojack to a microcontroller that can perform the ECIES microbenchmark in 1. 6 s...|$|E
40|$|Ideally, {{a testing}} center and {{associated}} software {{should be an}} effective tool for learning assessment. It {{should serve as a}} link between faculty members who create tests and their students who are assessed by those tests. Testing centers are generally limited in the number of computer systems available as compared to the number of students taking tests. Automated testing {{plays an important role in}} such situations. Automated testing outside the classroom offers students the flexibility of choosing a preferred time for taking tests. A completely automated system also contributes in reducing a portion of the workload by automatically grading some or all of the exams. This report presents a feature called Check-In and Scheduling 2 ̆ 2. This feature uses <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> to provide an interface between a student and the testing system. This report also discusses a card swiper interface which is linked to a new scheduling system. Together, they provide for better utilization of a laboratory 2 ̆ 7 s resources. (51 pages...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{magnetic}} cards adopt plain text to store confidential information, thus being vulnerable to an untrusted {{credit card reader}} or a skimming device. To tackle the problem, researchers have proposed several new techniques such as integrated circuit card (IC card) and mobile wallet applications; however, none of them can support existing <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> thereby facing backwards compatibility issue. In this paper, to combat such credit card information leakages and remain backwards compatible, we propose SafePay, a system that transforms disposable credit card information to electrical current and drives a magnetic card chip to simulate {{the behavior of a}} physical magnetic card. We have implemented a prototype system of SafePay by a mobile phone and a prototype magnetic card chip. In the evaluation, we show that the current cost is about 0. 5 excluding the phone, and the cost can be even lowered if manufactured in large scale. We also evaluated the prototype in experimental environment such as oscilloscope and real-world scenarios such as vending machines. The results show that the physical signal in oscilloscope {{is the same as the}} theoretical value, and meanwhile, we can successfully buy products in all the tested real-world scenarios...|$|E
5000|$|A {{point of}} {{interaction}} (POI) is a (hardware and/or software) component {{in point of}} sale equipment (e.g. a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader)</b> that enables a consumer to use a credit card to make a purchase at a retailer. The point of sale terminal might be attended or unattended.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, {{with the}} {{acquisition}} of a Texas Instruments TI-59 programmable calculator which was capable of holding 5000 program steps and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> for data storage, Slater was able to program the device to calculate basic technical analysis computations. The problem of drawing the charts by hand which was time consuming and prone to error, remained.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic stripe cloning can be {{detected}} by the implementation of <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> heads and firmware that can read a signature of magnetic noise permanently embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature {{can be used in}} conjunction with common two factor authentication schemes utilized in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.|$|R
50|$|To reduce cost, the HP-25 omitted the HP-65's <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> so {{it could}} only be {{programmed}} using the keyboard. After switching off, the program was lost and had to be typed in again. The model HP-25C, introduced in 1976, addressed that shortcoming through the first use of battery-backed CMOS memory in a calculator, termed continuous memory by HP.|$|R
50|$|Because it is a {{structured}} language based on XML, POSXML is {{a language that}} is constantly evolving, new commands and instructions {{can be added to}} your library at any time. Initially, the language had only two dozen basic commands to create a functional application on a POS terminal, using few resources: only the basic display (LCD), keypad, <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and printer.|$|R
5000|$|Card cloning and {{skimming}} can {{be detected}} by the implementation of <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process.

5000|$|The TI-58 (May 1977), {{and later}} TI-58C (1979), are cut down {{versions}} of the TI-59, lacking the <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and having half the memory, but otherwise identical. Although the TI-58C uses a different chip than the TI-58, the technical data remain identical. The [...] "C" [...] in a TI (or Hewlett-Packard) model name indicates that the calculator has a constant memory (or continuous memory, respectively) allowing retention of programs and data when turned off.|$|R
5000|$|The {{functions}} of the calculator could be expanded by adding modules {{at the top of}} the machine. Four slots were available to add more memory, pre-programmed solution packs containing programs covering engineering, surveying, physics, math, finance, games, etc. As such, an HP-41 could in fact be tailored to the personal needs of the user. Hardware extensions included a thermal printer, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> (HP-67 compatible via converter software), and a barcode [...] "wand" [...] (reader).|$|R
5000|$|Smaller {{and less}} {{expensive}} (595 USD [...] MSRP) than the preceding model HP-75, the 71B had a single-line 22-character liquid crystal display, 64K system ROM and 17.5K user memory. It operated on four AAA batteries. Four plug-in ports permitted ROM-based programs or additional user memory to be added. Separate compartments could accommodate an optional <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and an optional HP-IL interface (HP 82401A) {{that could be used}} to connect printers, storage and electronic test equipment.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, a newer {{high-tech}} {{method of}} operating, sometimes called card skimming or card cloning, involves {{the installation of}} a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> over the real ATM's card slot {{and the use of}} a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera or a false PIN keypad to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned into a duplicate card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras, keypads, <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> and <b>card</b> writers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.|$|R
50|$|The <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> was {{a device}} {{able to read}} and write small {{rectangular}} plastic <b>cards</b> with two <b>magnetic</b> strips. The <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> could copy contents of memory onto <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards,</b> and later read back the data into memory.|$|R

5000|$|The TI-59 is {{an early}} {{programmable}} calculator, that was manufactured by Texas Instruments from 1977. It is the successor to the TI SR-52, quadrupling the number of [...] "program steps" [...] of storage, and adding [...] "ROM Program Modules" [...] (an insertable ROM chip, capable of holding 5000 program steps). Just like the SR-52, it has a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> for external storage. One quarter of the memory is stored {{on each side of}} one card. It {{was one of the first}} LED calculators with the capability and flexibility to take on many real-world calculation challenges, and quickly became popular with professionals in many fields.|$|R

25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader.</b> Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|R
50|$|The {{financial}} {{industrial complex}} is migrating {{from the use}} of magnetic stripes on debit and credit cards which technically require a swipe through a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> swipe <b>reader.</b> The number of transactions per minute can be increased, and more transactions can be processed in a shorter time, therefore making for arguably shorter lines at the cashier.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of auditory training programs available for use by children who are deaf or hard of hearing. However, {{there are only a few}} that are appropriate to be used by high school students and even fewer still that relate to the student 2 ̆ 7 s academic courses. An auditory training curriculum for deaf and hard of hearing high school students was developed relating to a New York State regents course in biology using the CardMaster 2020 from Califone. Fifteen key vocabulary words from three biology units were chosen for use in this curriculum. Five of these fifteen words were not practiced by the students but served as a control. The ten vocabulary words that were to be practiced were also placed in ten sentences to be listened to and written down. All vocabulary words and sentences were recorded onto <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> that were listened to using the CardMaster 2020, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader.</b> Participants were able to improve their scores from the pre-test to the posHest after they practiced listening to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R
50|$|Follow-on calculators used varying {{mechanical}} packaging {{but most}} were operationally similar. The HP-25 was a smaller, cheaper model of a programmable scientific calculator without <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> with features much like the HP-65. The HP-41C was a major advance in programmability and capacity, and offered CMOS memory so that programs were not lost when the calculator was switched off. It was the first calculator to offer alphanumeric capabilities for both the display and the keyboard. Four external ports below the display area allowed memory expansion (RAM modules), loading of additional programs (ROM modules) and interfacing {{a wide variety of}} peripherals including HP-IL ("HP Interface Loop"), a scaled-down version of the HPIB/GPIB/IEEE-488 instrument bus. The later HP-28C and HP-28S added much more memory and a substantially different, more powerful programming metaphor.|$|R
