40|$|Nitrite induces the {{oxidation}} of the haemoglobin forming methaemoglobin, {{which is}} nonfunctional. To oppose this formation fishes have an enzyme that reverses the process called <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase.</b> In vitro {{activity of the}} <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> was determined, in the presence and absence of nitrite in two marine fishes (toadfish, Halobatrachus didactylus and gilt head sea breams Sparus aurata). The KM and Vmax were determined through the Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden Plot. The basis for {{this study is that}} the <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> system has very active ferricyanide reductase activity. Halobatrachus didactylus showed a significant decrease in its values of <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> activity with the increase in nitrite concentration (38. 9; l 6. 3; 14. 5 : l 4. 0 and 12. 3 mmol NAD+/min/gHB respectively to 0; 1; 3; 6 and 9 mM N 02). In Sparus aurata, the nitrite didn't induced significant variations in the <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> activity (27. 8; 27. 1; 25. 3; 22. 3 and 18. 7 mmol NAD+/min/gHB respectively to 0; 1; 3; 6 and 9 mM N 02). This results probably indicate fish to have other paths opposing to the formation of methaemoglobin, rather than the enzymatic system of the <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase.</b> At the moment the meaning of this of this different behaviour is not known...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium and two {{vanadate}} solutions as ‘metavanadate’ (containing ortho and metavanadate species) and ‘decavanadate’ (containing decameric species) (5 mM) were injected intraperitoneously in Halobatrachus didactylus (Lusitanian toadﬁsh), {{in order}} to evaluate the effects of cadmium and oligomeric vanadate species on <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> activity from ﬁsh red blood cells. Following short-term exposure (1 and 7 days), different changes were observed on enzyme activity. After 7 days of exposure, ‘metavanadate’ increased <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> activity by 67 % (P, 0. 05), whereas, minor effects were observed on enzymatic activity upon cadmium and ‘decavanadate’ administration. However, in vitro studies indicate that decameric vanadate, in concentrations as low as 50 mM, besides strongly inhibiting <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> activity, promotes haemoglobin oxidation to methaemoglobin. Although decameric vanadate species showed to be unstable in the different media used in this work, the rate of decameric vanadate deoligomerization is in general slow enough, {{making it possible to}} study its effects. It is concluded that the increase in H. didactylus <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> activity is more pronounced upon exposition to ‘metavanadate’ than to cadmium and decameric species. Moreover, only decameric vanadate species promoted haemoglobin oxidation, suggesting that vanadate speciation is important to evaluate in vivo and in vitro effects on <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{erythrocytes}} intracellular {{oxidative stress}} oxidizes the haemoglobin forming methaemoglobin, which is nonfunctional. To oppose this formation fishes have an enzyme that reverses the process called <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase.</b> In vitro {{activity of the}} <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> was determined in two marine fishes with different habitats and behaviours (Halobatrachus didactylus and Sparus aurata). The KM and Vmax, were determined through the Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden Plot. The basis for {{this study is that}} the <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> system has very active ferricyanide reductase activity, using NADH as the electrons donor. Halobatrachus didactylus showed higher values of <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> activity (38. 9 mmol NAD+/min/gHb) than Sparus aurata (27. 8 mmol NAD+/min/gHb). The reductase of Halobatrachus didactylus had, for both substrates, higher values of KM (potassium ferricyanide: 0. 133 mM, NADH: 0. 067 mM) and lower values of Vmax (potassium ferricyanide: 0. 097 min- 1; NADH: 0. 025 min- 1), than Sparus aurata (potassium ferricyanide: KM= 0. 092 mM, Vmax= 0. 176 min- 1, NADH: KM= 0. 032 mM, Vmax= 0. 062 min- 1). The results indicated that Halobatrachus didactylus’s <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> had high antioxidant efficiency, although that one of the Sparus aurata had more sensitivity to the presence of low concentrations of methaemoglobin. The meaning of this different behaviour, at the moment can not be envisaged...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Zidovudine (AZT) is a {{nucleoside}} analog, {{a reverse}} transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and {{a type of}} antiretroviral drug used {{for the treatment of}} HIV/AIDS. The administration of zidovudine to the wistar albino rats showed an increase in erythrocyte fragility as can be seen from figure 1. There were significant (p 0. 05) decrease in serum ALP activity, significant (p< 0. 05) decrease in Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + ratio and NADH <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> activity. Findings from this study have revealed that zidovudine is hepatotoxic, increases the concentraton of ferric iron in the body thus imparing oxygen transport and also affects the erythrocyte membrane proteins adversely...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of the erythrocyte (RBC) antioxidant metabolites and enzymes in nine marsupial and two monotreme species was carried out. Reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations were comparable with those reported for other marsupial and eutherian species. An important finding was that the erythrocytes of the southern hairy nosed wombat regenerated GSH faster than the erythrocytes from its close relative, the common wombat. The activities of glutathione-S-transferase, NADH <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase,</b> superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), showed similar levels and extents of variation as those observed in other marsupial and eutherian species. Catalase activities in the marsupials were lower than those measured in the two monotreme species and much lower than those reported in eutherian species. A negative correlation, significant at P < 0. 05, was observed between GSH-PX and catalase activities in the RBC of the marsupials. Since both these enzymes "detoxify" H 202, {{there appears to be}} a reciprocal relationship between the activities of these enzymes in marsupial RB...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{inherited}} disorders-the so-called inborn errors of metabolism-in which the characteristic metabolic and clinical abnormalities {{can be attributed to}} specific genetically determined deficiencies of particular enzymes, have now been identified: and new examples are currently appearing in the literature at a remarkable rate. Furthermore studies in vitro of the enzyme defect, as it occurs in erythrocytes, leucocytes, biopsy material from other tissues, or in fibroblasts grown in tissue culture, is already a critical diagnostic procedure for certain conditions. We may expect that this kind of in-vestigation is likely to become of increasing impor-tance in the future. A point of some interest which is beginning to emerge from such studies is the remarkable degree of genetic heterogeneity which may be uncovered when sensitive analytical procedures are applied to appropriate material from patients who have a deficiency of the same specific enzyme, but come from different families or different populations and are therefore not closely related genetically. For example, even in a condition as rare as methaemo-globinaemia due to a deficiency of <b>methaemoglobin</b> <b>reductase</b> several different sorts of enzyme defect, each apparently determined by a different abnor-mality of the gene, have now been identified in patients from different families (Kaplan and Beutler...|$|E
