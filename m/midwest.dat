5|$|During the {{conflict}} over the Toledo Strip, the Erie Canal was built, linking New York City and the Eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes at Buffalo. The canal, finished in 1825, immediately became a major route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the <b>Midwest)</b> could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the <b>Midwest</b> increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into boomtowns.|$|E
5|$|E85 flex-fuel {{vehicles}} {{are becoming increasingly}} common in the <b>Midwest,</b> where corn is a major crop and is the primary feedstock for ethanol fuel production. Regional retail E85 prices vary widely across the US, with more favorable prices in the <b>Midwest</b> region, where most corn is grown and ethanol produced. Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break-even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream {{was at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the <b>Midwest</b> United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the <b>Midwest</b> of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E

A moderately strong polar jet moved east-northeastward over the southern Rocky Mountains to the southern Great Plains.

It also established relationships with Pentecostal missions in the <b>Midwest.</b> The Midwestern Pentecostal movement centered around the Stone Church, pastored by William Piper, and the North Avenue Mission, pastored by William Howard Durham, both in Chicago, Illinois. Durham was the lead promoter of the Finished Work doctrine which, in time, the AFM would adopt and in doing so discard the Wesleyan view of sanctification as a second work of grace.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Midwest</b> {{remained}} {{the heartland of}} the Swedish-American community, but its position weakened in the 20th century: in 1910, 54% of the Swedish immigrants and their children lived in the <b>Midwest,</b> 15% in industrial areas in the East, and 10% on the West Coast. Chicago was effectively the Swedish-American capital, accommodating about 10% of all Swedish Americans—more than 100,000 people—making it the second-largest Swedish {{city in the world}} (only Stockholm had more Swedish inhabitants).|$|E

5|$|The mid-term {{elections}} in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor {{with the administration}} over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans {{in the rural areas}} of New England and the upper <b>Midwest,</b> but it lost votes in the cities and the lower <b>Midwest.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1920s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) {{reached its}} peak {{membership}} in the South and <b>Midwest</b> after a revival beginning around 1915. Its growth was {{due in part to}} tensions from rapid industrialization and social change in many growing cities; in the <b>Midwest</b> and West, its growth was related to the competition of waves of new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The KKK was strong in the Florida cities of Jacksonville and Tampa; Miami's chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the Miami Country Club. The Klan also flourished in smaller towns of the South where racial violence had a long tradition dating back to the Reconstruction era.
