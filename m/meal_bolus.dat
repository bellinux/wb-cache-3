50|$|Patients with insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} typically require some base level of insulin (basal insulin), {{as well as}} short-acting insulin to cover <b>meals</b> (<b>bolus</b> insulin). Maintaining the basal rate and the bolus rate is a continuous balancing act that people with {{insulin-dependent diabetes}} must manage each day. This is normally achieved through regular blood tests, although continuous blood sugar testing equipment (Continuous Glucose Monitors or CGMs) are now becoming available which could help to refine this balancing act once widespread usage becomes common.|$|R
50|$|Most adult diabetics (over {{the age of}} 21) {{will have}} a fairly {{constant}} ratio of bolus:basal of 60%:40%, where 60% of all insulin intake in a single 24-hour period will be attributed to <b>meals</b> (<b>bolus)</b> and 40% should then {{be attributed to the}} basal rate. This ratio will fluctuate from person to person depending on their size, activity level, and caloric intake as well but is a good baseline for determining the correct basal rate for an adult diabetic. Thus, the basal rate could theoretically be set based on an averaged bolus insulin intake of several days. Averaging the total bolus, and then dividing this number by 36 would then give the required hourly basal rate intake for any individual with a 60:40 ratio established.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{an additional}} rapid-acting insulin bolus on postprandial lipaemia, inflammation, and pro-coagulation following high-carbohydrate high-fat feeding {{in people with}} type 1 diabetes. Methods: Ten males with type 1 diabetes (HbA 1 c 52. 5 ± 5. 9 mmol/mol [7. 0 ± 0. 5 %]) underwent three conditions: 1) a low-fat <b>meal</b> with normal <b>bolus</b> insulin (LF), 2), a high-fat <b>meal</b> with normal <b>bolus</b> insulin (HF), 3) a high-fat <b>meal</b> with normal <b>bolus</b> insulin with an additional 30 % insulin bolus administered 3 -hrs post-meal (HFA). Meals had identical carbohydrate and protein content and bolus insulin dose determined by carbohydrate-counting. Blood was sampled periodically for 6 -hr post-meal and analysed for TG, NEFA, APOB 48, glucagon, TNF-α, fibrinogen, HTF activity, and PAI- 1. Continuous glucose monitoring captured interstitial glucose responses. Results: TG concentrations following LF remained similar to baseline, whereas TG levels following HF were significantly greater throughout the 6 -hour observation period. The additional insulin bolus (HFA) normalised TG similarly to LF 3 - 6 -hrs following the meal. HF was associated with late postprandial elevations in TNF-α, whereas LF and HFA was not. Fibrinogen, PAI- 1, and TFP levels were similar between conditions.

This study manipulated dietary protein distribution to assess the effect on gains in lean mass during a rugby preseason. Twenty-four developing elite rugby athletes (age 20. 1 ± 1. 4 years, mass 101. 6 ± 12. 0 kg; M ± SD) were instructed to consume high biological value (HBV) protein at their main meals and immediately after resistance exercise while limiting protein intake between meals. To manipulate protein intake frequency, the athletes consumed 3 HBV liquid protein supplements (22 g protein) either with main <b>meals</b> (<b>bolus</b> condition) or between meals (frequent condition) for 6 weeks in a 2 × 2 crossover design.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} model-based {{approach}} to synthesizing insulin infusion pump usage parameters against varying meal scenarios and physiological conditions. Insulin infusion pumps {{are commonly used}} by type- 1 diabetic patients to control their blood glucose levels. The amounts of insulin to be infused are calculated based on parameters such as insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios and correction factors {{that need to be}} calibrated carefully for each patient. Frequent and careful calibration of these parameters is essential for avoiding complications such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. In this paper, we propose to synthesize optimal parameters for <b>meal</b> <b>bolus</b> calculation starting from models of the patient’s insulin-glucose regulatory system and the infusion pump. Various off-the-shelf global optimization techniques are used to search for parameter values that minimize a penalty function defined over the predicted glucose sensor readings. The penalty function “rewards ” glucose levels that lie within the prescribed ranges and “penalizes ” the occurrence of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. We evaluate our approach using a model of the insulin-glucose regulatory system proposed by Dalla Man et al. Using this model, we compare various strategies for optimizing pump usage parameters for a virtual population of in-silico patients. I...|$|E

Methods: A total of 19 young people (mean age 12. 9 ± 6. 7 years) participated in a randomized, repeated-measures trial comparing postprandial glycaemic control across six study conditions after a high-fat and high-protein <b>meal.</b> A standard <b>bolus</b> and five different combination boluses were delivered over 2 h in the following splits: 70 / 30 = 70 % standard / 30 % extended bolus; 60 / 40 = 60 % standard/ 40 % extended bolus; 50 / 50 = 50 % standard/ 50 % extended bolus; 40 / 60 = 40 % standard/ 60 % extended bolus; and 30 / 70 = 30 % standard/ 70 % extended bolus.

40|$|Background: This study {{evaluated}} <b>meal</b> <b>bolus</b> insulin delivery {{strategies and}} associated postprandial glucose control while using an artificial pancreas (AP) system. Subjects and Methods: This {{study was a}} multicenter trial in 53 patients, 12 - 65 years of age, with type 1 diabetes for at least 1 year and use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for at least 6 months. Four different insulin bolus strategies were assessed: standard bolus delivered with meal (n= 51), standard bolus delivered 15 min prior to meal (n= 40), over-bolus of 30 % delivered with meal (n= 40), and bolus purposely omitted (n= 46). Meal carbohydrate (CHO) intake was 1 g of CHO/kg of body weight up {{to a maximum of}} 100 g for the first three strategies or up to a maximum of 50 g for strategy 4. Results: Only three of 177 meals (two with over-bolus and one with standard bolus 15 min prior to meal) had postprandial blood glucose values of 180 mg/dL) was prolonged for all four bolus strategies but was shorter for the over-bolus (41 % of the 4 -h period) than the two standard bolus strategies (73 % for each). Mean postprandial blood glucose level was 15. 9 mg/dL higher for the standard bolus with meal compared with the prebolus (baseline-adjusted, P= 0. 07 for treatment effect over the 4 -h period).

Methods   Thirty-six T 1 D patients on CSII treatment (19 males; mean age 13. 9 ± 3. 5 years; range 4. 9 – 17. 8 years), were prospectively enrolled into this two-period crossover study. Eighteen patients were randomized to begin phase A using the Bolus Wizard, followed by phase B, using their current conventional insulin dosing method to determine pre-meal boluses. The remaining subjects were randomized to begin with phase B followed by phase A. Each study period lasted 2 weeks. A questionnaire assessing treatment satisfaction with the Bolus Wizard was compiled. Results   There was {{a significant reduction in}} blood glucose levels before and 2 h after meals and in the number of correction boluses during phase A with respect to phase B of the study.

40|$|The main {{function}} of the esophagus is to transport food from the mouth into stomach. Anatomical structures, innervations and blood supplies are {{needed in order to}} transport the food into stomach. Mastication stimulates the parasympathetic nerves that regulate salivary, gastric and pancreatic secretion. Saliva secretion stimulates swallowing and increases primary esophageal peristalsis, helps in clearing the esophagus from refluxed material. Swallowing induces peristaltic of esophagus that propulses a solid bolus down the esophagus into the stomach. Innervations are important for esophagus to do its function. One of the most important is coordination between the various reflexes. Delayed clearance of acid from the esophageal and decreased pressure of the lower sphincter esophagus (LES) are the major mechanisms involved in the development of esophagitis. The resistance of the mucosa to the noxious effect of the refluxed material (acid, pepsin, chymotrypsin and trypsin, bile, etc.) is different from person to person. The LES pressure is a defense mechanisms to prevent gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). The LES pressure decreases postprandially. The frequency of postprandinal GER is related to the <b>meal</b> size. Gastric <b>bolus</b> feeding is related to greater intragastric pressure causes more of transient LES relaxations. Osmolality and volume of the feeding slow gastric emptying and incrase postprandial GER. The occurrence of GERD is associated with whether or not the preventive factors are functioning.

40|$|Background: The {{consumption}} of products rich in cereal fiber {{and with a}} low glycemic index is implicated in a lower risk of metabolic diseases. Previously, we showed that the {{consumption of}} fiber-rich pasta compared with bread resulted in a lower rate of appearance of exogenous glucose and a lower glucose clearance rate quantified with a dual-isotope technique, which was in accordance with a lower insulin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide response. Objective: To gain more insight into the acute metabolic consequences of the consumption of products resulting in differential glucose kinetics, postprandial metabolic profiles were determined. Methods: In a crossover study, 9 healthy men (mean +/- SEM age: 21 +/- 0. 5 y; mean SEM body mass index (kg/m(2)) : 22 +/- 0. 5] consumed wheat bread (132 g) and fresh pasta (119 g uncooked) enriched with wheat bran (10 %) meals. A total of 134 different metabolites in postprandial plasma samples (at - 5, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min) were quantified by using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry based metabolomics approach (secondary outcomes). Two-factor ANOVA and advanced multivariate statistical analysis (partial least squares) were applied to detect differences between both food products. Results: Forty-two different postprandial metabolite profiles were identified, primarily representing pathways related to protein and energy metabolism, which were on average 8 % and 7 % lower after the men consumed pasta rather than bread, whereas concentrations of arabinose and xylose were 58 % and 53 % higher, respectively. Arabinose and xylose are derived from arabinoxylans, which are important components of wheat bran. The higher bioavailability of arabinose and xylose after pasta intake coincided with a lower rate of appearance of glucose and amino acids. We speculate that this higher bioavailability is due to higher degradation of arabinoxylans by small intestinal microbiota, facilitated by the higher viscosity of arabinoxylans after pasta intake than after bread intake. Conclusion: This study suggests that wheat bran, depending on the method of processing, can increase the viscosity of the <b>meal</b> <b>bolus</b> in the small intestine and interfere with macronutrient absorption in healthy men, thereby influencing postprandial glucose and insulin responses.

Frank Diabetes Research Institute of Mills-Peninsula Health Services, San Mateo, California and Clinical Professor of Medicine, UCSF {{presented}} {{a lecture on}} April 7, 2011 from 11 : 00 am - 12 : 00 pm in the IBB building, room 1107. Runtime: 55 : 49 minutes. An artificial pancreas is an engineered device for treating diabetes, {{which is one of}} the greatest epidemic diseases in the US and worldwide. In the US 105 million people have diabetes or prediabetes. An artificial pancreas is a device containing only synthetic materials which substitutes for an endocrine pancreas by sensing the BG level, determining the amount of insulin needed, and then delivering an appropriate amount of insulin. An artificial pancreas uses closed loop control by measuring glucose continuously and then continuously adjusting an infused dose of insulin. The three main components of an artificial pancreas are: 1) a continuous glucose sensor; 2) an insulin infusion pump; and 3) a controller using software to determine the insulin dose. Wireless radios link the components. Better sensors, better insulin delivery, and better control algorithms are all needed to create a viable system. Improvements in all three components are currently being developed. Control algorithms typically use either a Proportionate/Integral/Derivative method or a Model Predictive Control method. Each type of control formula has advantages and disadvantages. A controversy in control of a closed loop system involve how sensitively to program the controller to deliver a <b>meal</b> <b>bolus</b> of insulin in case of a rise in blood glucose, which could represent either a meal requiring insulin right away or a random fluctuation requiring no additional insulin. A second controversy involves how to protect a patient from hypoglycemia, because insulin lowers elevated glucose levels, but no part of a classical artificial pancreas system can raise depressed glucose levels. Glucagon is being tested as a rescue treatment for hypoglycemia in closed loop control systems. Current closed loop systems have already been demonstrated to be effective in specified closely monitored inpatient environments. Emerging and future closed loop glycemia maintenance systems will incorporate many inputs besides glucose levels. These inputs will be necessary to use much more complex models of glycemia which can be nuanced by such factors as day-to-day insulin sensitivity, meals, exercise, stress, and individual differences in the time course of insulin action. In the future, an artificial pancreas system will provide telemedicine care in case of hypoglycemic emergencies and will likely offer an option for a remote healthcare provider to assume control of the insulin programming to override sensor-determined control. Recent reports and meetings by FDA, Diabetes Technology Society, NIH, and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation are intended to overcome barriers to designing robust clinical trials of artificial pancreas systems. The first artificial pancreas product is approved in Europe and is at an early stage of undergoing testing in the United States. This product contains a low glucose suspend feature in the event of a hypoglycemic episode, which fails to result in acknowledgement of the glucose level or adjustment of the insulin dose. At this point in order to see a commercial closed loop product be approved for marketing and reimbursement, we will need to collect additional data about the safety, efficacy, and economic impact of these systems. A well designed artificial pancreas system will revolutionize diabetes care...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by insufficient capacity to regulate the blood glucose level. In insulin-dependent diabetes, multiple daily injections of insulin have to be administered. In-between scheduled visits to the care provider, the patient has to manage the glucose control independently. Insulin dosing is a non-trivial task and many patients find it difficult. This {{is reflected in the}} health statistics, that indicate that a majority of patients with diabetes have poor metabolic control with associate risks of several short and long term complications. In this thesis, building blocks of a defence-in-depth approach to glucose self-management in insulin-dependent diabetes are investigated. Defence-in-depth is a concept where technical and administrative systems work in cohort to divert potentially dangerous conditions and events. In the context of insulin-dependent diabetes this amounts to avoiding low (hypoglycemia) and high (hyperglycemia) glucose values. Data from the European DIADvisor project and from a local trial conducted with patients from Skåne University Hospital were used in the thesis. A basis for improved glucose control is understanding and knowledge of the glucose-lowering effect of insulin, the insulin action, and the corresponding glucose-elevating effect produced by meal intake. Individualized models of these impacts, and methods to improve the predictive capacity of these models, were developed. Interesting properties, such as, time-variability and nonlinear effects, were found. The models allow for the glucose level to be predicted and different <b>meal</b> and <b>bolus</b> scenarios to be simulated. Using the models, the possibility to foresee and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia was validated with good performance in a retrospective analysis on the collected data. Recent advances in sensor technology have allowed for commercial systems where the glucose level is measured with a high sampling rate in the interstitial fluid. However, a known deficiency with this approach is the measurement lag introduced by equilibrium dynamics between the blood and interstitial compartments. A Kalman filter based approach to resolving this issue was developed and successfully validated in a case study. Diabetes glucose dynamics is known to comprise both short and more long term time-variability. Merging different diversified models may prove to be a successful approach, as a means to improve performance and robustness under such conditions. A novel merging algorithm based in a Bayesian setting was developed. The suggested method admits for soft switching and interpolation between the different models based on an evaluation of the different predictors' recent performance, using a sliding data window, and by looking for data features identified to be correlated to switching. Different aspects of the merging approach were investigated, using a simulated dataset, and the concept was thereafter successfully validated, showing improved robustness to the prediction performance in comparison to relying on the individual prediction models. Meal impact models were estimated for 56 different meal types, and a clustering analysis showed that a majority of these models could be represented by three base models. Cross-validation confirmed good predictive capacity. The insulin action and meal impact models were further used to assess whether clinical recommendations on postprandial glucose levels, issued by international patient and professional organizations, are realistic and achievable. An important finding was that the postprandial excursion of meals with rapid postprandial response may be impossible to restrain within the recommended boundaries for even moderate meal sizes. This difficulty is exaggerated for persons with slower than normal insulin action. The above methods and models could contribute to improving already available technology in diabetes self-management such as, e. g., bolus dose guides in insulin pumps, warning systems in continuous glucose monitoring systems or in interpretation and implementation of postprandial recommendations. %A Bayesian method to allow several specialized prediction models to work in cohort was also developed. Validation on both simulated and real-world data confirmed that the prediction robustness increased. Finally, %Among these, the insulin model reconfirmed a previous result that the insulin action is heterogeneous across the glucose range, with elevated magnitude at low glucose values and reduced at high glucose values...|$|R
