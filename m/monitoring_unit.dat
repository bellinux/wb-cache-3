As a step in that direction, a Water Sector Audit Unit (WSAU) was established in the PMU in May 2008.

Open fields, {{as well as the}} enhanced dynamic wedge ones, were used to collect data for 6 MV and 15 MV photon beams obtained from the VARIAN linear accelerator. Beam stability was checked and confirmed for different dose rates, energies, and application of enhanced dynamic wedge by calculating the charge per <b>monitor</b> <b>unit.</b> <b>Monitor</b> <b>unit</b> error was calculated by the two-exposure method for open and enhanced dynamic wedge beams of 6 MV and 15 MV photons.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} optimal configuration of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> in a hierarchical distributed monitoring system. A hierarchical distributed monitoring system consists of a hierarchy of <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> which are grouped and distributed onto the physical network. The architecture lends itself to parallel processing, reducing the complexity of distributed monitoring caused by factors such as collection and processing of the large quantities of monitoring data. Furthermore, the topology-specific partitioning of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> allow complex, topology-specific events to be monitored and evaluated in a natural and efficient way. The optimal configuration problem is concerned with finding an optimal hierarchical partition of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> such that the total processing cost is the minimum. It is a NP-complete problem. In this paper, we study the heuristics for obtaining near-optimal grouping of <b>monitoring</b> <b>units.</b> Simulation of heuristic algorithms for mesh and hypercube networks are presented. The results suggest further system topology specific heuristics.

2500|$|The {{signalling}} {{technology used}} {{on all three}} SkyTrain lines to run trains automatically was originally developed by Alcatel, and loaded from a 3.5" [...] diskette. There are four systems called the VCC (Vehicle Control Computer) with three divided over the mainline {{and one for the}} storage yard. VCC1 controls trains from Waterfront to Royal Oak; VCC2 controls trains from Royal Oak to King George (it now also controls a portion of the Millennium line); and VCC3 controls trains in the yard. Each VCC is a cluster of three IBM rack-mount computers with Intel-IA32 processors and proprietary hardware, configured in a fault tolerant setup. For every command that is sent to a VCC, {{at least two of the}} computers must agree with the action, otherwise an error is generated and the command is ignored. The VCCs communicates with the train's VOBC (Vehicle On Board Computer), whose data is transmitted through leaky coax cable laid along the tracks. There are up to two VOBCs per married-pair trains, i.e., 4-car train would have two VOBCs. If the VCCs fail or communication between the VCC and the VOBC is lost, the train will 'time-out' and (EB) emergency-brake through a Quester Tangent BAM (Brake Assurance Monitor) that controls propulsion and braking systems. The VCCs have a command-line-console, but normally the trains are controlled through a system known as the SMC, which also provides scheduling. All commands from the SMC are verified to be safe by the VCC before execution. However if the SMC fails, the system can still be operated through the VCC. This is known as 'degraded mode'. The SkyTrain HMU (Health <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Unit)</b> developed by Quester Tangent [...] provides monitoring and diagnostic functionality for vehicle maintenance by connecting to CAN vehicle network and providing a maintenance display in the Hoslter Panel.|$|E

Very rarely, SUDEP occurs in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units,</b> providing highly informative data for its still elusive pathophysiology. The MORTEMUS study expanded these data through comprehensive evaluation of cardiorespiratory arrests encountered in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> worldwide. Methods: Between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 29, 2009, we did a systematic retrospective survey of epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> located in Europe, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand, to retrieve data for all cardiorespiratory arrests recorded in these units and estimate their incidence. Epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> from other regions were invited to report similar cases to further explore the mechanisms. An expert panel reviewed data, including video electroencephalogram (VEEG) and electrocardiogram material at the time of cardiorespiratory arrests whenever available. Findings: 147 (92 %) of 160 units responded to the survey. 29 cardiorespiratory arrests, including 16 SUDEP (14 at night), nine near SUDEP, and four deaths from other causes, were reported. Cardiorespiratory data, available for ten cases of SUDEP, showed a consistent and previously unrecognised pattern whereby rapid breathing (18 - 50 breaths per min) developed after secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizure, followed within 3 min by transient or terminal cardiorespiratory dysfunction. Where transient, this dysfunction later recurred with terminal apnoea occurring within 11 min of the end of the seizure, followed by cardiac arrest. SUDEP incidence in adult epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> was 5. 1 (95 % CI 2. 6 - 9. 2) per 1000 patient-years, with a risk of 1. 2 (0. 6 - 2. 1) per 10 000 VEEG monitorings, probably aggravated by suboptimum supervision and possibly by antiepileptic drug withdrawal. Interpretation: SUDEP in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> primarily follows an early postictal, centrally mediated, severe alteration of respiratory and cardiac function induced by generalised tonic-clonic seizure, leading to immediate death or a short period of partly restored cardiorespiratory function followed by terminal apnoea then cardiac arrest.
