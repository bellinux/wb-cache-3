40|$|This book {{is written}} for {{practitioners}} and stakeholders in the fertiliser industry and for policy makers whose decisions may {{impact on the}} use of micronutrients in agriculture, horticulture and forestry. The aim of the book is to explain the growing importance of micronutrients in balanced fertilisation, to consider the <b>micronutrient</b> <b>fertiliser</b> types that are currently available and how to best use them, to assess the current market and prospects for micronutrient fertilisers, and to discuss the policy, regulatory and quality control framework needed to maximize the benefits from using micronutrient fertilisers...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{amendment}} with biochar {{is currently}} proposed as a management strategy to improve soil quality and enhance plant productivity. Relatively {{little is known}} about how biochar affects plant competition, although {{it has been suggested that}} it can increase the competitive ability of legumes. This study tested the impact of a biochar on the competitive ability of legumes through alterations to soil pH and/or nutrient availability. Biochar was produced from aboveground plant biomass from a species-rich semi-natural grassland pyrolysed at 400 °C. In a greenhouse experiment, a legume (red clover, Trifolium pratense L.); a grass (red fescue, Festuca rubra L.); and a forb (plantain, Plantago lanceolata L.) were grown in (1) monocultures, (2) in a mixed culture of red fescue and red clover, and (3) in a mixture of all three species. Soil treatments included fertilisation with nitrogen (N), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), or <b>micronutrient</b> <b>fertiliser</b> in the presence or absence of biochar; a pH-adjusted control soil; and a control (i. e. with no amendment). The competitive ability of red clover was quantified as the proportion of aboveground biomass of this species within the mixtures. Both biochar amendment and K fertilisation significantly (P < 0. 001) increased red clover biomass, and increased the competitive ability of red clover when grown with red fescue and plantain. Application of N fertiliser, irrespective of biochar amendment, resulted in significantly (P < 0. 001) greater red fescue and plantain biomass and eliminated the competitive advantage of red clover. The biochar-mediated pH increase did not affect red clover biomass or its competitive ability. We conclude that biochar has a beneficial effect on red clover under N limiting conditions due to an increase in K availability. Our results suggest a potential role for biochar to maintain the proportion of forage legumes in agricultural pastures or semi-natural grasslands...|$|E
40|$|Globally, {{more than}} 800 million people are undernourished while > 2 billion people have one or more chronic {{micronutrient}} deficiencies (MNDs). More than 6 % of global mortality and morbidity burdens are associated with undernourishment and MNDs. Here we show that, in 2011, 3. 5 and 1. 1 billion people were at risk of calcium (Ca) and zinc (Zn) deficiency respectively due to inadequate dietary supply. The global mean dietary supply of Ca and Zn in 2011 was 684 [*]±[*] 211 and 16 [*]±[*] 3 mg capita− 1 d− 1 (±SD) respectively. Between 1992 and 2011, global risk of deficiency of Ca and Zn decreased from 76 to 51 %, and 22 to 16 %, respectively. Approximately 90 % of those at risk of Ca and Zn deficiency in 2011 were in Africa and Asia. To our knowledge, these are the first global estimates of dietary Ca deficiency risks based on food supply. We conclude that continuing to reduce Ca and Zn deficiency risks through dietary diversification and food and agricultural interventions including fortification, crop breeding and use of <b>micronutrient</b> <b>fertilisers</b> will remain a significant challenge...|$|R
40|$|Although organic <b>fertilisers</b> always contain <b>micronutrients,</b> {{we have to}} pay {{attention}} to the question of whether continuous fertilisation will lead to lower contents in plants or lower availability in the long run. We investigated topsoil samples from long-term trials with farmyard manure and mineral fertili-sation and with different organic and conventional farming systems. Input of <b>micronutrients</b> via or-ganic <b>fertilisers</b> was obviously more significant in the case of poor sandy soil than in that of loamy soil with high total contents and higher mineralising potential...|$|R
40|$|The quantity, {{quality and}} variety of food {{ingested}} by humans largely determines the intake of the essential mineral micronutrients required for normal human physiological functioning, growth and development. Inadequate dietary intake, low bioavailability, and failure {{of the human body}} to utilize ingested essential minerals lead to mineral micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs), an invisible form of undernutrition also known as hidden hunger. With the aim of aiding future human nutrition policy planning, the extent of dietary MNDs of calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), iodine (I), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) were estimated by integrating food supply and composition, estimated average requirement and demographic data. National level dietary Ca, Mg and Zn deficiency risks between 1992 and 2011 were estimated for the populations of 145 countries. Globally, in 2011, 3. 5 and 1. 1 billion people were at risk of Ca and Zn deficiency, respectively, due to inadequate dietary supply; 14 million people were at risk of Mg deficiency during the same period. Ninety percent of those at risk of Ca and Zn deficiency in 2011 lived in Africa and Asia. Considering the limited policy-making relevance of the low resolution national estimates of mineral MNDs, sub-national level assessments of the prevalence of dietary mineral MNDs were made for Malawi in 2011 using a 7 -day household dietary recall survey data (n = 12117). It was estimated that > 50 % of households in Malawi were at risk of energy, Ca, Se, or Zn deficiencies due to inadequate dietary supplies, but supplies of Fe, Cu and Mg were adequate for > 80 % of households. Interventions to address dietary mineral deficiencies, such as dietary diversification using underutilized multipurpose and hardy tree/shrub species (e. g. Moringa spp.), were considered. Greater than 78 % of Moringa growing households in southern Ethiopia and Kenya use M. oleifera (MO) and M. stenopetala (MS) trees as a source of food. Increasing the dietary consumption of MO and MS leaves, as a fresh vegetable or in powdered form, can reduce the prevalence of mineral micronutrient deficiencies, most notably Se deficiency. Daily consumption of 100 g Kenyan MO or MS fresh leaves could provide 100 % and 144 %, respectively, of the Se recommended daily allowance for a healthy adult man. Research and development to promote the use of these species in the fight against hidden hunger, are necessary. Continuing to reduce mineral MND risks through dietary diversification, and food and agricultural interventions, including fortification, crop breeding and use of <b>micronutrient</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> will remain a significant challenge during the global Sustainable Development era...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of micronutrients in sustainable crop production is usually {{linked to the}} focus on high yields and increased cropping intensity on existing arable lands for feeding the ever-increasing world population. However, micronutrient exports from cropping systems have often been neglected, while fertiliser strategies for high yields are largely based on NPK, particularly in developing countries. Land degradation such as organic matter loss and soil acidification has added another layer of complexity of managing micronutrients in cropping systems. Micronutrient fertilizer strategies must embrace changes in farming systems and land uses, including the shifts to no-till and water-saving rice production. In addition to effects of soil organic matter and soil acidification, micronutrient availability in the rooting zone {{is likely to be}} further influenced by erratic rainfall patterns and drought associated with climate change in the future. Solutions to these challenges will lie with well-designed agronomic measures such as regular replenishment of <b>micronutrients</b> through <b>fertiliser</b> inputs and crop residue management. Breeding traits of micronutrient efficiencies (including uptake and utilisation) into high yielding varieties of existing crops {{may be one of the}} long-term options for not only minimising crop failures, but enhancing crop quality such as micronutrient density in grain/seeds which are staple foods of populations who mainly consume plant-based food...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{mining and}} {{quarrying}} profoundly affect landscapes and vegetation, so restoration of abandoned quarries attempts to create species-rich ecosystems for erosion control and fauna habitat. This study examined the success after 12 years of imported topsoil, sewage sludge, <b>micronutrients,</b> and <b>fertiliser</b> tablets applied at planting (all with and without broadcast fertiliser) on the survival, growth and health of six-month old seedlings of Eucalyptus gomphocephala, Acacia saligna, Banksia prionotes, B. attenuata, E. decipiens, Templetonia retusa and Dodonaea aptera in an abandoned limestone quarry in a mediterranean type climate in south-west Western Australia. Natural recruitment of seedlings of these species was also noted. After 12 years, overall survival was 17. 4 %, ranging from 42 % in E. gomphocephala to 1 % in T. retusa. Treatment combinations did not influence survival of any species, nor did growth (measured as height and DBHOB) vary in response to treatment. Treatment did not influence the health of any species significantly, with the exceptions of E. decipiens (healthiest in the All treatment) and B. attenuata (significantly lower levels of health when exposed to broadcast fertiliser). A. saligna, D. aptera and other local species from surrounding woodlands had naturally recruited seedlings. To date, {{although there is no}} evidence that any of the treatments tested is a panacea for success in re-establishing the study species in the medium-term, the study shows that vegetation native to the area can be re-established in abandoned limestone quarries at this site...|$|R
40|$|The grain yield {{benefits}} of applying <b>micronutrient</b> fluid <b>fertilisers</b> over conventional granular products in calcareous sandy loam soils have been agronomically demonstrated. An {{understanding of the}} fundamental mechanisms and reactions occurring following application of these products to soils is critical to improve fertiliser management. We therefore examined the diffusion, solubility, and potential availability of manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) from both granular and fluid forms of Mn and Zn fertiliser in an alkaline calcareous and alkaline non-calcareous soil using laboratory incubation experiments in conjunction with an isotopic dilution technique with ⁵⁴Mn and ⁶⁵Zn. Enhanced mobility, solubility, and/or potential availability of Mn and Zn from fluid fertilisers were observed in comparison to Mn or Zn from granular fertilisers in both soils after 5 weeks of incubation. Differential behaviour of fluid and granular fertilisers for Mn and Zn appeared to be independent of their effects on soil pH. Most (~ 90 %) of the Mn in granular fertiliser dissolved and diffused out of the granule but was retained within 4 mm of the point of granular placement, whereas most (~ 85 %) of the Zn in the granular Zn fertiliser source remained in the granule. Our {{data suggest that the}} superior agronomic effectiveness of fluid Mn and Zn fertilisers observed in calcareous soils under field conditions may have resulted from the enhanced diffusion (Mn) and/or solubility/availability (Mn, Zn) of these micronutrients in soil when applied in fluid form.

40|$|Abbreviations {{and notes}} for this article: N = nitrogen; P = phosphorus; K = potassium; C = carbon; CEC = cation {{exchange}} capacity. West Bengal India’s resounding success from its past green revolution has {{been followed by}} stagnating or declining agricultural productivity, even with increased total fertiliser use in the country over the years. This declining factor productivity {{is largely due to}} imbalanced fertiliser use (Kumar et. al. 2007). Fertiliser application is highly skewed in favour of N, with relatively small use of K and P application, and rare use of secondary and <b>micronutrients.</b> Current generalised <b>fertiliser</b> recommendations are also sub-optimal and need upward refinement. In rice-based crop-ping systems, a negative K balance of 31 kg K 2 O/ha/year was estimated, and this imbalance is projected to increase further (Trivedi, 2001). Phosphorus removal under this intensive crop rotation amounts to 150 kg P 2 O 5 /ha/year, which is often higher than the annual nutrient replenishment (Tandon and Sekhon, 1998). Keeping in view the need for more balanced and intensive agriculture in India, P and K application needs to be increased (Sanyal and Chatterjee, 2007). The present study was conducted to optimise P and K management strate-gies to achieve maximum yields in an important rice-based cropping sequence. Two years of field experiments were conducted on a jute (var. JRO- 524) -kharif rice (var. IET- 4786) -boro rice (var...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of application of small amounts of nitrogen to the soil together with foliar application of micronutrients on the content of copper, manganese and zinc in the grain of spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta L.). The study was based on a two-factor field experiment conducted in 2009 – 2011 on very good rye complex soil. Nitrogen was applied in the form of ammonium nitrate (34 % N), and manganese and copper were applied to the leaves in the form of the fertilisers Adob Mn (1. 5 l∙ha− 1) and Adob Cu (1. 0 l∙ha− 1), respectively. The results indicated that the nitrogen fertilisation, the foliar application of micronutrients and the interaction of these factors significantly determined the contents of copper, manganese and zinc in the grain. The highest content of Cu and Mn in the material was obtained following the application of 50 kg N·ha− 1, and an increase in nitrogen application (to 50 kg·ha− 1) caused a decrease in the content of zinc in the grain. Foliar application of Cu, Mn and both elements together resulted in significant changes in the concentrations of Cu, Mn and Zn in the plant material as compared to treatment without the application of <b>micronutrients.</b> The mineral <b>fertilisers</b> at the rates applied had a beneficial effect on the chemical composition of the grain, and thus on its quality, and this was achieved with substantially lower consumption of agrochemicals than that in the case of agrotechnical procedures for traditional cereals. It can, therefore, be concluded that this practice is environment friendly and can significantly reduce the negative impact of agricultural activity...|$|R
