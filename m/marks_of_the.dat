5|$|In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, K5054, {{was fitted}} with ejector type exhausts. Later <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spitfire used a {{variation}} of this exhaust system fitted with forward-facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing-mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high altitudes, replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the engine coolant radiator. The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower. Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor the house is split into east and west bedchambers, linked across the central hall by a gallery. The east bedchamber is {{at the front of}} the house, and {{projects}} out into the street—this was a feature used to add space to houses, and is also seen in properties in Shrewsbury, Tewkesbury and York. Some of the makers' <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original builders can still be seen on the timbers in the room. The west bedchamber more closely resembles its 19th-century appearance rather than the medieval, as the Victorian-era ceiling has been left in place. The roof of the house is an identical replacement for the medieval original, tiled with Cornish slate.|$|E

5|$|Undismayed by {{the loss}} of his papers, Bottomley {{embarked}} on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the Hansard reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, floated on the London Stock Exchange with a capital of £500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the Lord Mayor-elect of London, Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry <b>Marks)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London Evening News, and Sir Roper Lethbridge, the Conservative MP for Kensington North. This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses—he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions. He also persuaded the board to give him £75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired. These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of £40,877, and declared a dividend of eight per cent.|$|E

25|$|The Goblin was {{the primary}} engine of the de Havilland Vampire, and {{was to have been}} the engine for the F-80 Shooting Star (as the Allis-Chalmers J36) before that design {{switched}} engines due to production delays at Allis-Chalmers. The Goblin also powered the Saab 21R, Fiat G.80 and de Havilland Swallow. The Goblin was later scaled up as the larger de Havilland Ghost, with the model numbers continuing from the last <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goblin.|$|E
25|$|Certain <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vampire {{were also}} {{operated}} as flying test-beds for the Rolls-Royce Nene engine, {{leading to the}} FB30 and 31 variants that were built in, and operated by, Australia. Due to the low positioning of the engine, a Vampire could not remain on idle for long as {{the heat from the}} jet exhaust would melt the tarmac behind the aircraft. If the engine did stall in flight, there was no onboard means to re-light the engine, meaning that a forced landing would be necessitated.|$|E

25|$|Under {{exceptionally}} good viewing {{conditions with}} no light pollution, the Triangulum Galaxy {{can be seen}} with the naked eye. It {{is one of the}} most distant permanent objects that can be viewed without the aid of a telescope. Being a diffuse object, its visibility is strongly affected by small amounts of light pollution. It ranges from easily visible by direct vision in dark skies to a difficult averted vision object in rural or suburban skies. For this reason, Triangulum is one of the critical sky <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bortle Dark-Sky Scale.|$|E
25|$|In early 1813, <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stigmata were {{reported}} on Emmerich's body. The parish priest called in two doctors to examine her.

With the news causing considerable talk in the town, the ecclesiastical authorities conducted a lengthy investigation. Many doctors wished to examine the case, and although {{efforts were made to}} discourage the curious, there were visitors whose rank or status gained them entry. During this time, the poet and romanticist Clemens Brentano first visited.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the visible church, Reformed theologians have spoken of certain <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church. For some, the only mark is the pure preaching of the gospel of Christ. Others, including John Calvin, also including the right administration of the sacraments. Others, such as those following the Scots Confession, include a third mark of rightly administered church discipline, or exercise of censure against unrepentant sinners. These marks allowed the Reformed to identify the church based on its conformity to the Bible rather than the Magisterium or church tradition.|$|E

25|$|At menopause, breast atrophy occurs. The breasts can {{decrease}} in size when {{the levels of}} circulating estrogen decline. The adipose tissue and milk glands also begin to wither. The breasts can also become enlarged from adverse side effects of combined oral contraceptive pills. The size of the breasts can also increase and {{decrease in}} response to weight fluctuations. Physical changes to the breasts are often are recorded in the stretch <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and volume of a woman's breasts {{throughout the course of}} her life.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Whitley {{featured}} bomb bay doors, fitted on {{both the}} fuselage and wing bays, that were held shut by bungee cords; during bombing operations, these were opened {{by the weight of}} the bombs as they fell on them and closed again by the bungee cord. The short and unpredictable delay for the doors to open led to highly inaccurate bombing. The Mk.III introduced hydraulically actuated doors which greatly improved bombing accuracy. To aim bombs, the bomb aimer opened a hatch in the nose of the aircraft, which extended the bomb sight out of the fuselage but the Mk IV replaced this hatch with a slightly extended transparent plexiglas panel, improving crew comfort.|$|E
25|$|The Casemate d'Esch is a pre-World War II {{fortified}} position {{near the}} German frontier in extreme northeastern France.

As a unit of the Fortified Sector of Haguenau, the casemate was part of French defenses during the Battle of France, but saw no combat in 1940. The area was the scene of intense fighting between German and American forces in 1945. The casemate with the <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1945 combat has been preserved and is part of a museum associated with the nearby Ouvrage Schoenenbourg.
