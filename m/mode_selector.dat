25|$|A double-crescent trigger {{provides}} select fire capability {{without the}} need for a fire <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> switch. Pressing the upper segment of the trigger produced semi-automatic fire, while holding the lower segment of the trigger produced fully automatic fire. Though considered innovative at the time, the feature was eliminated on most firearms due to its complexity. Examples include MG 34, Kg m/40 light machine gun, M1946 Sieg automatic rifle, and Star Model Z-70.|$|E
500|$|When the INS {{navigation}} {{systems were}} properly programmed with the filed flight plan waypoints, the pilot {{could turn the}} autopilot <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> switch to the INS position and the plane would then automatically track the programmed INS course line, provided the plane was headed in the proper direction and within [...] of that course line. If, however, the plane was more than [...] from the flight-planned course line when the pilot turned the autopilot <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> from HEADING to INS, the plane would continue to track the heading selected in HEADING mode {{as long as the}} actual position of the plane was more than [...] from the programmed INS course line. The autopilot computer software commanded the INS mode to remain in the [...] "armed" [...] condition until the plane had moved to a position less than [...] from the desired course line. Once that happened, the INS mode would change from [...] "armed" [...] to [...] "capture" [...] and the plane would track the flight-planned course from then on.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{modernization}} accessories {{have been}} manufactured for the vz. 58 platform from different companies.Accessories include [...] "tactical" [...] bolt release, extended and/or ambidextrous magazine release paddles, ambidextrous fire <b>mode</b> <b>selectors,</b> custom handguard rails, {{several types of}} sight mounting options and various muzzle brakes and compensators. Both civilian and military users use these upgrades, and they also see frequent use with private military companies in the Middle East.|$|R
5000|$|The KRISS Vector submachine gun is only {{available}} for military {{and law enforcement}} use. It is chambered in either 9×19mm Parabellum or [...]45 ACP.

50|$|The {{design of}} the weapon is {{compatible}} with telescopic, red-dot and mechanical sights and has a folding, adjustable butt stock. The barrel is cold-forged barrel, and the weapon is capable of semi-automatic, three round burst and full auto fire. It has a cyclic rate of fire of 750 rounds per minute. Most of the rifle's receiver is constructed of a polymer reinforced with carbon-fiber with an underlying titanium frame and comes in black, dark-green and desert-tan colors {{as well as the}} SEDENA digital camouflage patterns used by the Mexican army. The charging handle can be installed {{on either side of the}} rifle with gas piston located above the barrel, which operates under a multi-lugged rotary bolt system. Safety/fire <b>mode</b> <b>selectors</b> are located above the pistol grip on both sides of the FX-05. It can accept NATO-standard as well as specific transparent magazines.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS) assisted electrically tunable terahertz quantum cascade lasers (THz QCLs) {{are designed}} and demonstrated. Two MEMS tuner devices are proposed to achieve electrically tunable THz QCLs. One is the electrostatic comb drive actuated tuner {{design and the}} other one is a two-stage flexure design that is actuated by an external piezo nano-positioning actuator. The MEMS tuner devices are all fabricated using standard foundry process SOIMUMPs from MEMSCAP Inc. with some additional in-house post-processings. First order distributed-feedback (DFB) THz wire QCLs with robust <b>mode</b> <b>selectors</b> are designed and fabricated at the MIT Microsystems Technology Laboratories (MTL) using processes developed at our group. By integrating the MEMS tuner chips with the THz QCL chips, broadband electrically tunable THz QCLs are successfully demonstrated.

40|$|A new {{material}} for optics {{is being developed}} that promises {{to be far more}} robust than alternative materials. It is a photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass in which Bragg gratings (holograms) can be written in the interior (not the surface) of the glass. The gratings are permanent as they are not removed by illuminating them with light at other wavelengths or by heating unless the temperature exceeds 400 C. This technology {{can be used to make}} diffractive elements such as spatial filters, attenuators, switches, modulators, beam splitters, beam samplers, beam deflectors, selectors of particular wavelengths (notch filters, add/drop elements), spectral shape formers (gain equalizers), spectral sensors, angular sensors, Bragg spectrometers, and transverse and longitudinal <b>mode</b> <b>selectors</b> in a laser resonator. The PTR Bragg grating has been exposed to a 100 W, 1096 nm beam focused to 100 kW/cm 2 spot for 10 minutes without exhibiting any temperature rise. The pulsed laser damage threshold has been measured to be within 30 % of that of the best silica glass used in high power 1064 nm systems. The useful spectral range of this glass is from 350 nm to 2. 8 microns...|$|R
25|$|The {{fire control}} selector, with its lever {{located on the}} left side of the {{receiver}} wall, enables fully automatic fire (lever in the “C”-marked position), semi-automatic fire (“P”) and 3-round burst fire <b>mode</b> (“S”).

50|$|The {{interior}} remained {{similar to}} the outgoing models, but with upgraded materials and a revised prominent center stack, which introduces {{the latest version of}} the 8-inch MyFord Touch touchscreen infotainment and telematics system. Push-to-start engine ignition with intelligent access was added and the four-wheel drive <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> (for models with 4x4) was revised and repositioned. The TowCommand paddle controls was repositioned over the four-wheel drive <b>mode</b> <b>selector,</b> to make way for revised audio and climate controls on the center stack.|$|E
50|$|Produced in two versions, Mk.1 and Mk.1*. The Mk.1* was a {{simplified}} {{version of the}} original Mk.1, which omitted the fire <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> (full automatic only) and used simplified sights.|$|E
5000|$|The OTs-33 has a {{double-action}} {{trigger mechanism}} and is hammer fired, with an exposed hammer. The safety/fire selection catch is provided {{on each side}} of the pistol at the rear of the slide and has three positions: [...] "safe" [...] (top setting with a single white dot), semi-automatic fire (intermediate position marked with a single red dot) and fully automatic fire (lower setting with three red dots). When switched to [...] "safe" [...] <b>mode,</b> the <b>selector</b> mechanism safely depresses the hammer before returning to the safe position. An ambidextrous lever, which also serves in disassembly/stripping of the weapon, is provided inside of the trigger guard and just in front of the trigger. The Pernach also features a loaded chamber indicator.|$|R
50|$|The Korg PS-3010 Polyphonic Keyboard is a {{specialised}} keyboard {{with its}} 48 keys (not 49) and proprietary 60-pin connector that {{connects to the}} Korg PS-3300 via a special cable, the Korg PS-3001. The keyboard has a trigger <b>mode</b> dial <b>selector</b> switch with 5 different trigger modes {{as well as a}} momentary switch for retriggering of envelopes during sustained notes, plus three on/off sliding switches. There is also an X-Y joystick with calibration sliders and separate CV outputs for X and Y direction movements, these can be connected to any of the many CV inputs of the three synthesizer units of the Korg PS-3300 for some advanced modulation control. In fact, if both CV outputs are patched to two of the individual Channel Amplitude CV inputs, it offers an early version of vector synthesis with different sounds fading in and out by moving the joystick.|$|R
5000|$|Another is the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) {{developed}} during the first World War. The BAR and its subsequent designs incorporated a variety of selective-fire functions. The first design (M1918) is a selective-fire, air-cooled automatic rifle that used a trigger mechanism with a fire selector lever that enabled operating in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing <b>modes.</b> The <b>selector</b> lever {{is located on the}} left side of the receiver and is simultaneously the manual safety (selector lever in the [...] "S" [...] position - weapon is [...] "safe", [...] "F" [...] - [...] "Fire", [...] "A" [...] - [...] "Automatic" [...] fire). The next version (M1918A1) had a unique rate-of-fire reducer mechanism purchased from FN Herstal with two rates of automatic fire. This reducer mechanism was later changed to one designed by the Springfield Armory. The final version (M1918A2) provided two selectable rates of fully automatic fire only.|$|R

5000|$|The M1918 is a {{selective}} fire, air-cooled automatic rifle using a gas-operated long-stroke piston rod actuated by propellant gases bled through a vent in the barrel. The bolt is locked by a rising bolt lock. The gun fires {{from an open}} bolt. The spring-powered cartridge casing extractor is contained in the bolt and a fixed ejector is installed in the trigger group. The BAR is striker fired (the bolt carrier serves as the striker) and uses a trigger mechanism with a fire selector lever that enables operating in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing <b>modes.</b> The <b>selector</b> lever {{is located on the}} left side of the receiver and is simultaneously the manual safety (selector lever in the [...] "S" [...] position - weapon is [...] "safe", [...] "F" [...] - [...] "Fire", [...] "A" [...] - [...] "Automatic" [...] fire). The [...] "safe" [...] setting blocks the trigger.|$|R
5000|$|The 3L, {{along with}} the GTI and FSI, had a {{completely}} different steel body to other Lupos, using thinner but stronger steel sheet. The car had an automated electro hydraulic manual transmission with a Tiptronic <b>mode</b> on the <b>selector</b> and an automated electro hydraulic clutch. The car also had an ECO mode. When engaged it limited the power to 41 bhp (31 kW; 42 PS) (excluding kick down) and programmed the transmission to change up at the most economical point. ECO mode also activated the start/stop function, a feature that was new to European cars at the time.|$|R
5000|$|The weapon's spring {{extractor}} {{is installed}} inside the bolt head and enclosed {{in one of}} the locking lugs while the ejector is a fixed protrusion of the internal bolt carrier guide rail. The firearm uses a hammer-type firing mechanism and a trigger group that enables semi-automatic and fully automatic firing <b>modes.</b> The fire <b>selector</b> switch, which is also the manual safety toggle, can occupy one of three positions: the top [...] "safe" [...] setting (the trigger and bolt carrier are both disabled mechanically), the middle setting (marked with three dot symbols) produces continuous fire and the bottom setting (single dot) activates a disconnector for single fire mode.|$|R
50|$|A Model 7 {{version was}} made in 1952, the {{difference}} being that {{it was able to}} fire from a closed bolt and having a fire <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> on. Only a few of these were made in the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|A fire <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> {{is fully}} ambidextrous, {{as well as}} other {{controls}} of this weapon. It has a simplified trigger system with three positions for [...] "safe", [...] "semi-auto" [...] and [...] "full-auto". The [...] "2-round burst" [...] firing mode of the CZ 805 BREN was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|The TKB-408 can {{be fired}} semi- or full-automatic. The firing <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> {{is located on}} the left side of the {{receiver}} above the pistol grip. The design incorporates no provisions for firing from the left shoulder. It is chambered in the 7.62×39mm round and has an overall length of 790 mm.|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} optical functional element, {{based on}} a polymer, with waveguide(s) (2) in a waveguide substrate (1), has waveguides that are not buried. The surface of the substrate with the unburied waveguides is coated with a layer (3) of polymer material that is not optically isolated from the waveguide. This layer has variable optical properties and the waveguide has a higher refractive index than the substrate and coating. USE - The waveguide is used as Mach-Zehnder interferometer, linear waveguide, optical coupler or directional coupler, diffusing waveguide or monomodal waveguide (all claimed). The element is useful as waveguide, modulator, switch or <b>mode</b> or wavelength <b>selector</b> and is used in information, communications and sensor technology and integrated optics. ADVANTAGE - The coating causes little optical loss in the waveguide and ensures good coupling with fibre optics, good switching properties and {{a wide range of}} application. Production is easy and reliable...|$|R
50|$|The MP5SD is {{produced}} exclusively by H&K in several versions: the MP5SD1 and MP5SD4 (both have a receiver end cap {{instead of a}} buttstock), MP5SD2 and MP5SD5 (equipped with a fixed synthetic buttstock) and the MP5SD3 and MP5SD6 (fitted with a collapsible metal stock). The MP5SD1, MP5SD2 and MP5SD3 use a standard 'SEF' trigger group (from the MP5A2 and MP5A3), while the MP5SD4, MP5SD5, and MP5SD6 use the 'Navy' trigger group—a trigger module with a mechanically limited 3-round burst <b>mode</b> and ambidextrous <b>selector</b> controls (from the MP5A4 and MP5A5). A suppressed version was produced for the U.S. Navy - designated the MP5SD-N, which is {{a version of the}} MP5SD3 with a retractable metal stock, front sight post with tritium-illuminated dot and a stainless steel suppressor. This model has a modified cocking handle support to account for the slightly larger outside diameter of the suppressor. The design of the suppressor allows the weapon to be fired with water inside, should water enter the device during operation in or near water.|$|R
50|$|Firearms {{with the}} ability to allow the user to select various fire modes may have {{separate}} switches for safety and for mode selection (e.g. Thompson submachine gun) or may have the safety integrated with the <b>mode</b> <b>selector</b> as a fire selector with positions from safe to semi-automatic to full-automatic fire (e.g. M16).|$|E
