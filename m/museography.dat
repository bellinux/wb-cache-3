Almost in parallel, he coordinated the historical and museological executive project of the History Museum of Catalonia, which is implemented in a record time of 18 months {{and that was one}} of the first models in Europe in the field of didactic and interactive museology on history. The relationship of consultancy with the Museum ended in 1997 because of the regressive policy, in terms of interactive <b>museography,</b> imposed by the direction of the Museum.

Definitely it was the most successful exhibition in the context of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of 1714.|$|E
