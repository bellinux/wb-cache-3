50|$|Cartograms may be {{classified}} {{also by the}} properties of shape and topology preservation. Classical area cartograms (shown on this page) are typically distorting the shape of spatial units to some degree, but they are strict at preserving correct neighborhood relationships between them. Scaled-down cartograms (from the NY Times example) are strictly shape-preserving. Another branch of cartograms introduced by Dorling, replaces actual shapes with circles scaled according to the <b>mapped</b> <b>feature.</b> Circles are distributed to resemble the original topology. Demers cartogram is a variation of Dorling cartogram, but it uses rectangles instead of circles, and attempts to retain visual cues {{at the expense of}} minimum distance. Schematic maps based on quad trees can be seen as non shape-preserving cartograms with some degree of neighborhood preservation.|$|E

The locality {{is defined by the}} neighborhood information of the data set and is preserved in the <b>mapped</b> <b>feature</b> space. By using the standard benchmark datasets, it was shown that the proposed algorithm gave higher recognition rates than the linear SVM in binary classification problems. The recognition rates for multi-class classification problem were also better than the general multi-nominal logistic regression. 1...|$|E

40|$|Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machinelearning algorithm, which {{learns to}} perform the {{classification}} task through a supervised learning procedure, based on pre-classified data examples. SVM uses kernel mapping to map the non-linear data in input space to a high-dimensional feature space where the data is linearly separable. A hybrid wavelet kernel construction for support vector machine is introduced in this paper. Construction of an admissible support vector (SV) kernel using multidimensional sinc wavelet is presented. The hybrid kernels are proved to be Mercer kernel. The hybrid kernels thus constructed are used for the automated detection of temporal bone abnormalities. From High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images features are extracted and fed to the learning machine for classification. Hybrid kernels provide better classification of the signal points in the <b>mapped</b> <b>feature</b> space. The experimental results indicate promising generalization performance with the hybrid kernels. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} of defects in materials constitutes a major {{area of research}} emphasis. Characterization schemes often involve mapping of the signal onto an appropriate feature domain. Defects are usually classified by segmenting the feature space and identifying the segment in which the feature vector is located. As an example Udpa and Lord [1] map differential eddy current impedance plane signals on to the feature space using the Fourier Descriptor approach. Doctor and Harrington [2] use the Fisher Linear Discriminant method to identify elements of the feature vector that demonstrate a statistical correlation {{with the nature of}} the defect. Mucciardi [3] uses the Adaptive Learning Network to build the feature vector. In all these cases defect classification is typically accomplished by categorizing the <b>mapped</b> <b>feature</b> vectors using Pattern Recognition methods employing either distance or likelihood functions [4]...|$|E
40|$|In signal {{analysis}} and synthesis, linear approximation theory considers a linear decomposition {{of any given}} signal {{in a set of}} atoms, collected into a so-called dictionary. Relevant sparse representations are obtained by relaxing the orthogonality condition of the atoms, yielding overcomplete dictionaries with an extended number of atoms. More generally than the linear decomposition, overcomplete kernel dictionaries provide an elegant nonlinear extension by defining the atoms through a mapping kernel function (e. g., the gaussian kernel). Models based on such kernel dictionaries are used in neural networks, gaussian processes and online learning with kernels. The quality of an overcomplete dictionary is evaluated with a diversity measure the distance, the approximation, the coherence and the Babel measures. In this paper, we develop a framework to examine overcomplete kernel dictionaries with the entropy from information theory. Indeed, a higher value of the entropy is associated to a further uniform spread of the atoms over the space. For each of the aforementioned diversity measures, we derive lower bounds on the entropy. Several definitions of the entropy are examined, with an extensive analysis in both the input space and the <b>mapped</b> <b>feature</b> space. Comment: 10 page...|$|E

30|$|An {{assessment}} of the relative contribution of sediment delivered to stream channels {{is based on the}} connectivity of each <b>mapped</b> <b>feature</b> to a watercourse. An erosion feature with a debris tail that reached a watercourse was recorded as ‘connected’ and likely contributed to stream sediment load. A subsequent Coromandel-based study determined that for landslides (debris avalanche and soil slips) initiated during storms in 1991 and 1992, and assessed as being ‘connected’ to a stream channel, approximately half the material generated at the time of failure was delivered to the stream and half was retained on slope (Marden et al. 2006). Based on this approach, a sediment delivery ratio (SDR) of 0.5 for storm initiated debris avalanche and soil slips was adopted and applied also to landing failures on similarly steep slopes. It was assumed that all the material derived from failures located on riparian stream banks entered the channel so this was assigned a SDR of 1.0. Using these criteria, the relative proportion of sediment mass delivered to streams as sediment load was assessed. Source area (ha), sediment mass (t), sediment generation rates (t ha− 1 of scar area), and the mass (t) delivered to stream channels, are presented in Table  4.|$|E
40|$|Metric {{learning}} has proved very successful. However, human annotations are necessary. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method, dubbed Metric Imitation (MI), where metrics over cheap features (target features, TFs) are learned by imitating the standard metrics over more sophisticated, off-the-shelf features (source features, SFs) by transferring view-independent property manifold struc-tures. In particular, MI consists of: 1) quantifying the prop-erties of source metrics as manifold geometry, 2) transfer-ring the manifold from source domain to target domain, and 3) learning a mapping of TFs {{so that the}} manifold is approx-imated as well {{as possible in the}} <b>mapped</b> <b>feature</b> domain. MI is useful in at least two scenarios where: 1) TFs are more efficient computationally and in terms of memory than SFs; and 2) SFs contain privileged information, but are not available during testing. For the former, MI is evaluated on image clustering, category-based image retrieval, and instance-based object retrieval, with three SFs and three TFs. For the latter, MI is tested on the task of example-based image super-resolution, where high-resolution patches are taken as SFs and low-resolution patches as TFs. Exper-iments show that MI is able to provide good metrics while avoiding expensive data labeling efforts and that it achieves state-of-the-art performance for image super-resolution. In addition, manifold transfer is an interesting direction of transfer learning. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a voice {{conversion}} {{approach that}} combines two distinct ideas is pro-posed {{to improve the}} converted-voice quality. The first idea is to map spectral features, e. g. discrete cepstrum coefficients (DCC), with segmental Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). That is, a single GMM {{of a large number}} of mixture components is replaced here with several voice-content specific GMMs each consisting of much fewer mixture components. In addition, the second idea is to find a frame, of spectral features near to the <b>mapped</b> <b>feature</b> vector, from the target-speaker frame pool corresponding to the seg-ment class as the input frame belongs to. Both ideas are intended to alleviate the problem encountered by a traditional GMM based conversion method, i. e. converted spectral en-velopes are usually over smoothed. To apply the first idea to implement an on-line voice conversion system, we have proposed an automatic GMM selection algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP). Furthermore, as pointed out by previous researchers, map-ping with a single selected Gaussian probability density function (PDF) instead of a combination of several Gaussian PDFs is helpful to obtain better converted-voice quality. Therefore, we have also proposed a Gaussian PDF selection algorithm and integrated it into our system. As to the implementation of the second idea, an algorithm based on DP is adopted which will consider both frame matching and connecting distances. For evalu-ating the performance of the two ideas studied here, three voice conversion systems are constructed, and used to conduct listening tests. The results of the tests show that the system with the two ideas combined can indeed obtain much improved voice quality be-sides improvement in timbre similarity...|$|E
