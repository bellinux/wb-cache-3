But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian <b>myself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E

500|$|After her {{departure}} from the adult film industry and transition to mainstream films, Lords got signed for a development deal with Capitol Records, but was later dropped due to disagreements {{between her and the}} label.

Previously, Madonna {{had worked with}} relatively unknown producers like William Orbit, Mirwais Ahmadzaï and Stuart Price. However, for Hard Candy Madonna decided to collaborate with producers and artists who were already well-known. Talking to MTV, Madonna explained her decision to collaborate with well-known producers: [...] "Because they're good, and I like their shit.

500|$|Cobain {{originally}} {{wanted to}} name the album I Hate <b>Myself</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> Want to Die, a phrase that had originated in his journals in mid-1992. [...] At the time, the singer used the phrase as a response whenever someone {{asked him how he}} was doing. [...] Cobain intended the album title as a joke; he stated he was [...] "tired of taking this band so seriously and everyone else taking it so seriously". [...] Novoselic convinced Cobain to change the title due to fear that it could potentially result in a lawsuit. [...] The band then considered using Verse Chorus Verse—a title taken from its song [...] "Verse Chorus Verse", and an earlier working title of [...] "Sappy"—before eventually settling on In Utero. [...] The final title was taken from a poem written by Courtney Love.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Eighteen" [...] comes {{between two}} {{straight-ahead}} rockers: [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] and album opener [...] "Caught in a Dream". [...] Both follow simple hard-rock , trading heavy riffing with guitar fills and solos. [...] The album title derives from lyrics in [...] "Long Way to Go". [...] "Caught in a Dream" [...] was the album's second single and features irreverent, tongue-in-cheek lyrics such as [...] "I need everything the world owes me/ I {{tell that to}} <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> agree". [...] The first side closes with [...] "Black Juju" [...] by bassist Dunaway, a lengthy track in the vein of The Doors, and Pink Floyd's [...] "Interstellar Overdrive"—both bands Alice Cooper earlier had opened for—with an organ part derived from Pink Floyd's [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". [...] The band named the song after a stray dog in Pontiac.|$|E
500|$|Bevin financed {{his primary}} {{campaign}} with over $2.5 {{million of his}} own money, representing 95% of the money he spent, and the National Journal opined that attracting donors from supporters of Comer, Heiner, Scott, and McConnell would be critical to his success in the general election. Almost immediately after his primary win, Bevin was asked about his support for McConnell, telling reporters, [...] "I literally know of no other elected official in this state who went to more events between May and November in support of candidates and support of Mitch McConnell and other down ticket races than I did. I knocked on doors, I made phone calls, I wrote checks <b>myself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> physically attended fundraiser after fundraiser." [...] Federal Election Commission records showed no evidence of contributions by Bevin to McConnell's campaign, and a McConnell advisor cited by Bevin to corroborate his support refused to do so when contacted by Insider Louisville.|$|E

If punk was about {{getting rid of}} hippies, then I'm getting rid of grunge". Noel Gallagher of Oasis, while a fan of Nirvana, wrote music that refuted the pessimistic nature of grunge. Gallagher noted in 2006 that the 1994 Oasis single [...] "Live Forever" [...] "was written {{in the middle of}} grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate <b>Myself</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> Want to Die,' and I was like...'Well, I'm not fucking having that.'

500|$|Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957 {{when they}} were fellow {{students}} at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but {{when she said that}} she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters said: [...] "Beyoncé sounds assured" [...] in {{her singing}} {{of the song}} and [...] "...lacking any of the 'shrill overboard' that {{describes}} some of the 'melisma fits'...that marked earlier vocal efforts." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media noted the song as the [...] "most notable 80s throwback" [...] of the album, as its [...] "augmented chords" [...] call to mind Patti Austin and James Ingram's 1983 single [...] "Baby Come to Me" [...] and Michael Jackson's 1983 single [...] "Human Nature", or a decelerated version of [...] "Baby Be Mine", from Jackson's 1982 album, Thriller. Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly said: Me, <b>Myself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> rides Storch's signature gangsta guitar, mellowed for Beyoncé's lovesick lament... While reviewing Beyoncé second studio album, B'Day in 2006, Andy Kellman of Allmusic remarked {{that there are no}} songs with the [...] "...smooth elegance of 'Me, Myself and I'". Spence D., writing for IGN Music considered [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] as a typical sounding R ballad with a familiar theme, and in which Beyoncé sings with passion.|$|E

500|$|Nitin Ganatra {{who plays}} Masood Ahmed {{explains}} to Digital Spy Masood's reactions when he discovers that Yusef has taken Kamil away. [...] "Masood goes crazy over this!"

Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E
500|$|Reportedly, two {{separate}} albums of new music were recorded by Shields {{in his home}} studio, but were abandoned. According to sources, one was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields later confirmed {{that at least one}} full album of new material was abandoned. He said, [...] "We did an album's worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, but it was worth dumping. It was dead. It hadn't got that spirit, that life in it." [...] He later explained, [...] "I just stopped making records <b>myself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> suppose that must just seem weird to people. 'Why'd you do that?' The answer is, it wasn't as good [...] And I always promised myself I'd never do that, put out a worse record." [...] Shields later said to Magnet magazine, [...] "We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless we die or something", and attributed the band's sparse output to a lack of inspiration. A third My Bloody Valentine album, MBV, was finally released in 2013, 22 years after Loveless.|$|E
500|$|There are {{contradictory}} claims {{as to who}} was {{the leader}} of the coup and had managed its execution, coming from Simović, Mirković, and Major Živan Knežević. Mirković claimed sole credit immediately after the coup and stated on its tenth anniversary that: [...] "Only after I had informed General [...] about my idea and he had accepted it did I make the decision to undertake the planned revolt. I made the decision <b>myself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> also carried out the whole organization. I made the decision as to when the revolt would take place." [...] It is likely that he had been a planning a coup since 1937 when an Italo-Yugoslav pact was signed. King Peter later credited simply the [...] "younger and middle ranks [...] of the Yugoslav army" [...] for the coup in a speech on 17 December 1941. Simović's response was published posthumously, he claimed that he [...] "stood {{in the center of the}} whole undertaking" [...] and [...] "personally engaged his assistant Brigadier General Bora Mirković for the action". Tomasevich considers Mirković's account to be the more credible of the two, and points out it is corroborated from several sources, both Allied and Axis. The matter would play a role in the factionalism that would divide the soon-to-be Yugoslav government-in-exile during the war.|$|E
