Crawford and Steele met {{at a party in}} 1950 when Steele was an {{executive}} at PepsiCo. They renewed their acquaintance at a New Year's Eve party in 1954. Steele by that time had become President of Pepsi Cola. Alfred Steele would later be named Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Pepsi Cola. She traveled extensively on behalf of Pepsi following the marriage. She estimated that she traveled over 100,000 <b>miles</b> <b>for</b> the company.|$|E

Ridden by Daryll Holland, he took the lead a furlong out and was eased in the closing stages to win by a short head.

5|$|Miles {{demolished}} {{the original}} building around 1812 and in 1814 rebuilt the seat {{a quarter of}} a mile further north-east, to designs by Thomas Hopper, that were based on plans which Hopper had previously drawn for Pytminster House, Wiltshire. Philip Miles died in 1845, leaving Leigh Court to his eldest son, William <b>Miles,</b> <b>for</b> whom the Miles Baronetcy of Leigh Court, Somerset was created in 1859. In 1884 the second Baronet, Sir Sir Philip Miles, entertained the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII.|$|E

5000|$|There is a flat [...] "flag drop" [...] rate, {{which is}} $2.60 for Metro, $2.50 for Yellow. Once in the car, {{there are two}} rates: milage and time.

One can estimate their trip to cost $2.25 per <b>mile</b> <b>for</b> Metro Taxi, $1.80 per <b>mile</b> <b>for</b> Freedom Cab, and $2.25 per <b>mile</b> <b>for</b> Yellow Cab, and approximately $0.25 per red light on that trip, plus the drop rate.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million <b>miles</b> <b>for</b> professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the fatal injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high fatal injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Miles' father also reappears, and {{relates to}} his son that as a young man, he and Aaron {{went to work for}} a {{criminal}} named Turk after Jefferson was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a spy in order to infiltrate the organization of the then-up-and-coming international criminal Wilson Fisk. Jefferson did this for a time, but after the Kingpin was arrested and convicted for his crimes, and Jefferson offered a chance to be a full-fledged S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, he refused, not wanting any part of his brother's world. He met Rio a week later {{and fell in love with}} her. Jefferson fled after learning that Miles was Spider-Man because it brought back unresolved issues from that earlier time in his life, and tells Miles that he does not blame <b>Miles</b> <b>for</b> his mother's death, and regrets abandoning him.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} Empress Matilda, on {{her return to}} England in 1139. According to Professor Edmund King, Miles' decision to support Matilda was guided by expediancy rather than principle, {{and the necessity of}} joining forces with Matilda's illegitimate half-brother, the powerful Robert, Earl of Gloucester, who was the overlord of some of Miles' fiefs. Stephen stripped Miles of the title 'Constable of England' in punishment for having deserted him. On 25 July 1141, in gratitude for his support and military assistance and, according to historian R.H.C. Davis, possibly to compensate <b>Miles</b> <b>for</b> having appeared to have lost the constableship, Matilda invested him as 1st Earl of Hereford. He also received St. Briavels Castle and the Forest of Dean. At the time Matilda was the de facto ruler of England, Stephen having been imprisoned at Bristol following his capture the previous February after the Battle of Lincoln. Sibyl was styled Countess of Hereford, until Miles' unexpected death over two years later. In 1141, Miles received the honour of Abergavenny from Brien FitzCount, the (likely illegitimate) son of Duke Alan IV of Brittany. This was in appreciation of the skilled military tactics Miles had deployed which had spared Brien's castle of Wallingford during King Stephen's besiegement in 1139/1140. Matilda gave her permission for the transfer.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{was then}} given command of his prize, the Duquesne, on 2 March 1804, and sailed her from Jamaica to Chatham with only 160 men. Also {{embarked}} on the Duquesne were an almost {{equal number of}} French prisoners, {{which had to be}} closely watched during the passage, in case they made an attempt to take the ship. Duquesne arrived in England without incident, and Walker paid her off for repairs. He then received command of the 36-gun HMS Thalia on 1 March 1805 and escorted convoys to the East Indies and Quebec. The voyage to the East Indies was made with two ships laden with treasure was made safely and quickly, with Walker arriving back at Spithead ten months to the day of his departure. The voyage to Quebec was made in company with two frigates, which delivered the convoy, but were delayed in port by gales until 1 December 1806. After setting sail Thalia became caught in a gale off the Newfoundland Banks and ran for 1250 <b>miles</b> <b>for</b> five days under bare poles. After returning to Spithead Walker was assigned to the Guernsey station under Sir Edmund Nagle, where he was given command of a squadron of three frigates and a brig to watch the enemy at St Malo.|$|E
