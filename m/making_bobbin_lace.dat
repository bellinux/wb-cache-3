50|$|The <b>making</b> of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{was easier}} to learn than the {{elaborate}} cutwork of the 16th century, and the tools and materials for <b>making</b> linen <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> were inexpensive. There was a ready market for <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> of all qualities, and women throughout Europe soon took up the craft which earned a better income than spinning, sewing, weaving or other home-based textile arts. Bobbin lace-making was established in charity schools, almshouses, and convents.|$|R
50|$|The copper {{deposits}} {{in the vicinity}} of the village were exploited as early as 2000-1700 BC. The stone tools used by prehistoric miners have been found both in Staré Hory and the nearby village of Špania Dolina. However, the name of the village was mentioned for the first time in 1536. In the 16th century, a smelting plant was built there. After the mining industry declined, the main economic activity shifted from the production of copper and charcoal to <b>making</b> <b>bobbin</b> <b>laces.</b> Merchants from Staré Hory were selling <b>bobbin</b> <b>laces</b> all over Austria-Hungary.|$|R
50|$|The Lacemaker is a {{painting}} by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (1632-1675), completed around 1669-1670 and held in the Louvre, Paris. The work shows a young woman dressed in a yellow shawl, holding {{up a pair of}} bobbins in her left hand as she carefully places a pin in the pillow on which she is <b>making</b> her <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> At 24.5 cm x 21 cm (9.6 in x 8.3 in), the work is the smallest of Vermeer's paintings, but in many ways one of his most abstract and unusual. The canvas used was cut from the same bolt as that used for A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, and both paintings seem to have had identical dimensions originally.|$|R
50|$|Prehistoric mining tools {{excavated}} in {{the territory}} of Špania Dolina have been dated from as early as 2000-1700 BC. Copper from Špania Dolina has also been identified in bronze artifacts from the Balkans and the Middle East. It indicates that the local mines {{were part of an}} extensive network of trade routes during the Bronze Age. However, the first written reference to the village itself only appeared in 1254. Abundant deposits of copper and silver were exploited first by miners from Banská Bystrica and after 1494 by one of the first multinational corporations, founded by the affluent Fugger and Thurzo families. The rich region attracted many foreign visitors. The House of Fugger funded a laboratory of the famous alchemist Paracelsus there. The prominent French thinker Montesquieu visited and described the copper mines in Špania Dolina upon the encouragement of Isaac Newton. The ancient tradition of <b>making</b> <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> led to the establishment of a bobbin lace craft school in 1883. The copper mines were closed down in 1888 and the economy of the village is now based primarily on tourism.|$|E
40|$|The oldest {{record on}} {{preschool}} {{education on the}} territory of Slovenia dates back to 11 th century. According to Valvasor, a wealthy townsman and a merchant, Pavel Berlach founded an orphanage, where pupils and orphans were brought up. Through the years there was a growing tendency for organized care. In the 13 th century the bishops of Škofja Loka systematically colonized Selška dolina valley with blacksmith population. The life of a blacksmith was extremely hard, for they were forging {{for as many as}} fourteen hours a day. Many blacksmith' families lived together in one house – hygiene was poor. Children were born at home in kamra (kamra) or hiša (both terms "kamra" and "hiša" refer to a room in a farmhouse where the whole family gathers; however, "kamra" usually denotes a room smaller than "hiša".) being helped by elderly women. From the birth on babies were swaddled in bandage-like straps and they were taken to work in woven baskets or cradles. Childhood mortality was high due to poor diet, poor hygiene and various contagious diseases. Children played in nature or with toys made of natural materials. Families were based on patriarchy; families also exerted intimidation and punishment. At the end of 19 th century there came a time of crisis for Železniki and blacksmithing fell into decline. One of the major sources of income became the art of <b>making</b> <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> During the Second World War the Germans reorganized parochial house in Železniki into a kindergarten, which then served as a place for the process of Feminisation. From 1949 to 1952 a Kindergarten of dr. Valerija Strnad started to operate under the scope of Zadruga Niko cooperation; the kindergarten was named after the then doctor in Železniki. Renewed economic growth contributed to the opening of new kindergartens: Vrtec Železniki kindergarten was the first to be opened, being followed by its branch unit in the village Selca and in 1995 Antonov vrtec kindergarten opened its doors. ...|$|E

40|$|The metal laces {{made using}} the <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{techniques}} on Estonian national costumes have received unreasonably modest attention. Unlike {{other types of}} lace that have been studied in the 20 th and 21 st centuries, there is no information {{regarding the use of}} metal laces in Estonia. In order to better understand the background of national costumes decorated with metal laces, one needs to be familiar with the political, economic and educational life of the time. The research questions set in this article concern the spread of metal lace used on Estonian national costumes, the technology used and the contemporary materials for <b>making</b> metal <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> I discuss the spread of laces and the purpose of use thereof; also, I provide an overview of the technological aspects that the makers of national costumes can rely on to create authentic national costumes. The items decorated with metal <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> preserved in the Estonian National Museum date back to a period from 1714 (Kadrina pot-shaped cap ERM 16362) to around 1900. Hence our ancestors held the beauty of metal lace in high esteem and used it to decorate their clothing for almost 200 years. During this period, present-day Estonia was divided in two – Estonia and Livonia – and the country had been under Russian rule since 1710. Metal <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is widespread primarily in northern and western Estonia and on the islands. The use of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> decreased after 1860 when crochet lace pushed it into the background, as the former required more time and more resources. This article examines the period from the early 18 th century to the late 19 th century. Based on the collections of the Estonian National Museum, I created a database of 223 items decorated with metal <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> Metal <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> was used to decorate midriff blouses, head covers and aprons – in short, the technique was used to decorate items which {{play a central role in}} clothing. Items of clothing decorated with metal <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> were considered fancy. The use of linen lace in Estonia has been documented, but there is no data on the making of metal lace locally. In the course of my research, I was not able to find any reference to metal <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> being made locally. The few explanations that can be found in the object legends in the museum refer to metal lace as a purchased good. The need of the peasantry for beautiful items should be highly appreciated and the desire to decorate one’s clothes with remarkable details even more so – using expensive purchased goods like gold or silver lace. Trade connections between Tallinn and Russia were tight; therefore, we can claim for certain that goods produced in Russia, including metal lace, could have found their way into sales outlets in Tallinn. We find a series of references to gold and silver laces in the trilogy of source publications of the property lists of German merchants in Tallinn in the 18 th century. Unfortunately, most of the laces do not include references to their origins, and the information given is limited to the amount and material. Thanks to trade connections with foreign countries, even the peasantry had the possibility to purchase lace. In addition to town stores, they were also able to buy lace at fairs or from peddlers. As metal laces with slight variations in patterns were produced from the 17 th- 19 th centuries in several European lace centres, it is difficult to name the specific place from which the laces found in Estonia might originate. It is probable that the metal laces found here were imported from Europe. Many of the laces are similar. Wide laces consist of a wavy band whose waves are separated with a fan motif. Many of the laces have small teeth joined by a net. The edges of the lace can be wavy or straight, but with one exception they are all attached to textile, and not used as lace between the textile or on the end of the textile. In the article, I give an overview of different materials that have been used to make historic metal lace and which are accessible to contemporary masters. The availability of suitable material enabled me to make new metal lace based on the examples. However, I do not dare to claim that the material used was authentic. In the future, the chemical composition and the origins of metal laces used on national costumes deserve further research...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPeniche's <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{has been}} a victim of the lack of demand for the product and the {{decrease}} of artisans who wish to manufacture it. The <b>Bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is primarily generated on a small scale and most of the times for personal consumption. Apart from a few occasional orders these are the reasons that still maintain the artisanal production of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> Identifying the problem of discontinuity of traditions and the lack of framing of these with contemporaneity arises combined with the remoteness of younger generations.
