50|$|S. molesta queens {{are bigger}} than the workers, being four to five {{millimeters}} long. Mating takes place from July to late fall. Both the queens and S. molesta drones have wings, and mating takes place while flying. Queens sometimes fly with a worker or two clinging to their bodies, presumably to help out right away when the queen finds a suitable place for a colony. Queens can lay anywhere from 27 and 387 eggs per day. The average number of eggs laid per day is 105.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} spatial {{practices}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> [...] how <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> manage {{their use of technology}} and place. Data from interviews with highly <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> and 'hot-deskers' are used to explore the reciprocal relationship between practice and place: how places change work, but also how work changes places. <b>Mobile</b> <b>workers</b> often need to configure their activities to take account of the different places in which they find themselves. This can involve considerable 'juggling' of their plans, humble office equipment, and their coworkers. In turn <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> change places, as they appropriate different sites for their work. Specifically, technology allows for the limited reappropriation of travel and leisure sites as places for work (such as trains and caf�s). Time is also an important practical concern for <b>mobile</b> <b>workers.</b> Although <b>mobile</b> work may be seen as relatively flexible, fixed temporal structures allow <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> to 'accomplish synchronicity' with others. Although this paper focuses on the specific practices of <b>mobile</b> <b>workers,</b> it also explores how 'grand social theory' can help us understand the practical details of mobile work, yet how practice cannot be simply reduced to theory. ...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Wearable {{computing}} {{along with}} advanced mobile communication {{has the potential}} to revolutionise the working environment and working processes of the <b>mobile</b> <b>worker</b> of the AEC industry. While wearable computing allows the <b>mobile</b> <b>worker</b> to execute his/her work and tasks more efficiently and safer with the support of information provided by novel user interfaces, like augmented reality glasses and voice recognition, advanced mobile communication can transfer the information required in a certain context (location, time, task etc.) to and from the <b>mobile</b> <b>worker.</b> Wearable computing allows the <b>mobile</b> <b>worker</b> e. g. to access data bases like material lists and CAD drawings, to hold video conferences with remote or on-site experts without being distracted by additional hardware he has to handle, i. e. his hands and arms are free to concentrate completely on his work. For transferring data and voice calls numerous different networking technology and communication networks are available, like GPRS, UMTS and WLAN. However, communication costs, bandwidth and coverage limitations might prohibit its use on construction environments. Ad-hoc networking offers means of spontaneous communications between different devices without using an infrastructure and provides a promising communication solution for the AEC industry. This article focuses on the applicability of mobile ad-hoc networking in the AEC industry by providing a detailed scenario of how mobile ad-hoc networking can be used in the AEC industry, giving an overview of the existing mobile ad-hoc networks and addressing some issues of implementation and deployment of the networking protocol called Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector routing (AODV) ...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The AEC & FM-sector 1 {{is aware}} of the {{potentials}} arising from the usage of mobile technology in construction for streamlining their business processes. Discussions are no longer on whether or not to use mobile computer-supported solutions but, rather, on how they should be implanted and used. The following publication describes an integrated, holistic framework for context-sensitive, mobile applications based on the concept of Virtual Organisations, the pattern-based software development paradigm, and multi-dimensional data management developed at the Dresden University of Technology. By applying this approach in early field tests mobile technology became an integrated, complementing part of information systems and newly developed, flexible, adaptable business scenarios instead of remaining just another fashionable toy used as an “add-on” reflecting already existing business practices. The innovations presented in this paper rely on the Concept of the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Worker</b> (CoMoWo) as well as of Mobile, Ambient Intelligent, Networked Environment (MAIN-E). CoMoWo combines pattern definitions and a hierarchically structured layer concept to describe the relationships and interdependencies among the individual patterns. CoMoWo will {{contribute to the development of}} innovative methods and adaptive project management models. MAIN-E consists of a set of technology components supporting CoMoWo, such as a multi-dimensional information framework, intelligent agents, and location-based services. This will lead to a supportive IT-infrastructure mobile and fixed to provide information on demand and in the right context to the <b>mobile</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|E

The most demanding part of the computation is performed by agents running on Internet servers while cell phone computations are concerned only with the interface between end-users and server-based agents. Although we have focused only on Cell Phones, the same technology can be used with Pocket PCs, PDAs and other mobile devices. ...|$|E

We find that the nature of the tax setting outcomes depend crucially on the proximity between cities. For “distant” cities with the same size populations, the pressure on tax rates of a more mobile workforce depends on the whether <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> are net beneficiaries or net contributors. If <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> are either high or low income earners, cities lower tax rates. If <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> are middle income earners, cities raise tax rates.

Current commercial, mobile solutions highlight their main features in terms of data collection, data delivery, and data synchronization between a mobile device and back-end systems. 2 There isn’t much mention of effective cooperation among <b>mobile</b> <b>workers,</b> so presumably this isn’t regarded as a must-have feature. This omission might seem odd considering the rapid advances in computer-supported cooperative work in mobile computing during the last decade (see the related sidebar).

The role of humble office equipment, and co-workers, is explored and in particular how work is reconfigured so as to fit the characteristics of different places. This relationship is reciprocal, in that <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> change places, re-appropriating them for mobile work. New technology is specifically important here in that it allows the limited re-appropriation of travel and leisure spaces such as trains and cafes for work.

40|$|In recent years, the {{diffusion}} of mobile applications (mobile apps) has risen significantly. Nowadays, mobile business apps are strongly emerging in business, enhancing productivity and employees’ satisfaction, whilst the usage of customized individual enterprise apps is still an exception. Standardized business apps enable basic functionalities, for example, mobile data storage and exchange (e. g., Dropbox), communication (e. g., Skype), and other routine processes, which support <b>mobile</b> <b>workers.</b> In addition, <b>mobile</b> apps can, for example, increase the flexibility of <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> by easing the access to firm’s information from outside the enterprise and by enabling ubiquitous collaboration. Hence, mobile apps can generate competitive advantages and can increase work efficiency on a broad scale. But <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> form no coherent group.

The context for this research is organizations of distributed and mobile workers and specifically those where knowledge is considered to be the most valuable asset. The term <b>mobile</b> <b>worker</b> is used to describe a person who is in some way physically mobile in their work. Workers in these organizations are naturally less likely to engage in unplanned meetings with colleagues than workers who are co-located.
