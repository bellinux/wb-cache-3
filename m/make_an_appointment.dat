5|$|The {{governor}} {{also can}} influence the state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment,</b> who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting {{the makeup of the}} judiciary.|$|E

25|$|If a {{judicial}} position becomes vacant and the Governor declines to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment,</b> {{it must be}} filled at the next General Election. If it's {{not too late to}} file for a Primary Election, candidates will appear on that ballot {{in the first round of}} a runoff election. If there is no Primary before the next General Election, all candidates appear on the General Election ballot, and a plurality vote may determine the winner.|$|E

25|$|The {{governor}} then selects one of {{the three}} from the Commission's list to become a justice. If the Governor fails to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> within 60 days the choice is then made by the Chief Justice of the Kansas Supreme Court. After the first year in office, the justice undergoes a retention vote in the next general election. If the justice receives approval from a majority of electors then he or she remain in office for a 6-year term. After the conclusion of each term the justice must face another retention vote. Retirement is mandatory at age 75 or upon completion of the justice's current term.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, at 8.30, Adams {{called the}} coroner to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> {{for a private}} post-mortem. The coroner asked when the patient had died and Adams said she had not yet. Harris visited again that day and Adams still {{made no mention of}} {{potential}} barbiturate poisoning. When Harris had left, Adams gave a single injection of 10cc of the Megimide. Hullett developed broncho-pneumonia and on the 23rd at 6.00 a.m. Adams gave Hullett oxygen. She died at 7.23 a.m. on 23 July. The results of a urine sample taken on 21 July were received after Hullett's death, on the 24th. It showed she had 115grains of sodium barbitone in her body – twice the fatal dose.|$|E

25|$|In {{some parts}} of China, dances are held for {{young men and women}} to find partners. For example, young women are {{encouraged}} to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd, and the young man who catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance. In Daguang, in northeast Guizhou Province, young {{men and women of the}} Dong people would <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers would go off to a quiet place to open their hearts to each other.|$|E
25|$|Goodall {{had always}} been passionate about animals and Africa, which {{brought her to the}} farm of a friend in the Kenya {{highlands}} in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids, was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining his wife Mary Leakey's approval, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where he laid out his plans.|$|E
25|$|Consular {{processing}} – This is {{the process}} if the immigrant is outside the United States, or is ineligible for AOS. It still requires the immigrant visa petition to be first completed and approved. The applicant may <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> at the U.S. embassy or consulate in his/her home country, where a consular officer adjudicates the case. If the case is approved, an immigrant visa is issued by the U.S. embassy or consulate. The visa entitles the holder {{to travel to the}} United States as an immigrant. At the port of entry, the immigrant visa holder immediately becomes a permanent resident, and is processed for a permanent resident card and receives an I-551 stamp in his/her passport. The permanent resident card is mailed to his/her U.S. address within several weeks.|$|E

25|$|The {{powers of}} the Senate {{concerning}} nominations are, however, subject to some constraints. For instance, the Constitution provides that the president may <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> during a congressional recess without the Senate's advice and consent. The recess appointment remains valid only temporarily; the office becomes vacant again {{at the end of}} the next congressional session. Nevertheless, presidents have frequently used recess appointments to circumvent the possibility that the Senate may reject the nominee. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court held in Myers v. United States, although the Senate's advice and consent is required for the appointment of certain executive branch officials, it is not necessary for their removal. Recess appointments have faced a significant amount of resistance and in 1960, the U.S. Senate passed a legally non-binding resolution against recess appointments.|$|E
25|$|Despite the variability, all {{but four}} presidents {{have been able}} to appoint at least one justice. William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office, though his {{successor}} (John Tyler) made an appointment during that presidential term. Likewise, Zachary Taylor died 16 months after taking office, but his successor (Millard Fillmore) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Andrew Johnson, who became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction {{in the size of the}} Court. Jimmy Carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice. Somewhat similarly, presidents James Monroe, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and George W. Bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice, but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office. No president who has served more than one full term has gone without at least one opportunity to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment.</b>|$|E

[...] His family said that he was sent home with {{instructions}} that he was to be seen within [...] "one week" [...] by a primary care doctor or urologist, and a note on his patient chart said the situation was urgent. After being sent home, his family said that they were told that there was a seven-month waiting list and that there were other critical patients. Thomas Breen died on November 30, 2013. His death certificate shows that he died from bladder cancer. His family said that the VA called on December 6, 2013, to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> after Breen had died.|$|E

50|$|Should {{there be}} a Senate recess of {{sufficient}} length, the president has constitutional authority to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> recess <b>appointment</b> of <b>a</b> new Supreme Court justice. Any justice so appointed would be eligible {{to remain on the}} Court until either the end of the subsequent Congress's first session, or until the Senate consents to a permanent replacement.

500|$|Leslie sees Jeanine Restrepo (Loretta Fox), an {{influential}} zoning board member {{who could help}} Leslie with her plans to turn the Sullivan Street pit into a park. Leslie is too nervous to approach her, so she practices with Mark (Paul Schneider), who teasingly pinches her nose because he says as Jeanine, [...] "I can do whatever I want"; Ann pinches Mark's nose and Leslie pinches Ann's, and Mark summarizes, [...] "It's fun {{to pretend to be}} zoning board members." [...] Marlene suggests Leslie try sucking up to Jeanine in her speech, but it comes across awkwardly when Leslie claims to [...] "love" [...] Jeanine. When Leslie tries to approach her later, Jeanine suggests Leslie <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> with her secretary. Marlene says this means Jeanine is blowing them off, and tells Leslie to blackmail Jeanine with the knowledge that her husband has a DUI offense in Illinois. Leslie shares the advice with Ann, who says she believes it is unethical and wrong; offended, Leslie accuses Ann of pampering Andy. ("He's got three crutches, {{and one of them is}} you. And the other two are crutches.") Ann storms off.|$|E
500|$|Only sixteen Republicans {{remained}} in the Senate, most progressives, when Congress met in January 1937, but Borah retained much influence as he was liked and respected by Democrats. Many of Roosevelt's New Deal policies, such as the NRA, were struck down by the Supreme Court during Roosevelt's first term, {{but he had no}} opportunities to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> to the court in his first four years. In 1937, he proposed what {{came to be known as}} the court-packing scheme, that for every justice over the age of seventy, an additional one could be appointed. This would give Roosevelt six picks, but would require Congress to pass legislation, to which Borah was immediately opposed, believing it would be the death of the Supreme Court as an independent institution. Although he refused to take the lead in the bipartisan opposition, Borah wrote a section of the committee report dealing with the history and independence of the court. When the matter came to the Senate floor, Borah was asked to make the opening speech, but again deferred to the Democratic majority, and Roosevelt's plan was defeated. [...] The court crisis had also been defused by the retirement of the Senior Associate Justice, Willis Van Devanter, a Taft appointee. [...] When Borah was asked if he had played a role in Van Devanter's retirement, he responded, [...] "Well, guess for yourself. We live in the same apartment house." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 24, 2009, Garrido {{visited the}} San Francisco {{office of the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and left a four-page essay {{containing}} his ideas about religion and sexuality, suggesting that he had discovered a solution to problem behaviors like his past crimes. The essay described how he had cured his criminal sexual behaviors and how that information {{could be used to}} assist in curing other sexual predators by: [...] "controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts." [...] On the same day, he went to a University of California, Berkeley police office with Dugard's two daughters, seeking permission to hold a special event on campus as a part of his [...] "God's Desire" [...] program. He spoke with U.C. Berkeley special events manager Lisa Campbell. She perceived his behavior as [...] "erratic" [...] and that the girls were [...] "sullen and submissive." [...] She asked him to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> for the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. Officer Ally Jacobs discovered, through a background check, that Garrido was a registered sex offender on federal parole for kidnapping and rape. When he and the girls returned for their appointment at 2:00p.m. the following day, August 25, Jacobs made a point of sitting in during the meeting. The girls appeared to Jacobs to be pale, as if having not been exposed to sunlight, and their behavior unusual. Since Garrido's several parole violations were a basis for an arrest, Jacobs phoned the parole office to relay her concerns, leaving a report of the meeting on voicemail.|$|E
