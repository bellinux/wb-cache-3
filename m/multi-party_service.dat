40|$|Online service marketplaces {{will soon}} {{be part of the}} economy to scale the {{provision}} of specialized <b>multi-party</b> <b>services</b> through automation and standardization. Current research, such as the *-USDL service description language family, is already defining the basic building blocks to model the next generation of business services. Nonetheless, the developments be-ing made do not target to interconnect services via service relationships. Without the concept of relationship, marketplaces will be seen as mere functional silos containing service descrip-tions. Yet, in real economies, all services are related and connected. Therefore, to address this gap we introduce the concept of open semantic service network (OSSN), concerned with the establishment of rich relationships between services. These networks will provide valuable knowledge on the global service economy, which can be exploited for many socio-economic and scientific purposes such as service network analysis, management, and control. ...|$|R

In this paper, we present a novel peer-to-peer (P 2 P) stream processing system called peerTalk to provide resource-efficient and failure-resilient MVoIP services. Different from previous work, our solution is fully distributed and self-organizing without requiring specialized servers or IP multicast support.

The decoupled model allows us to optimize and adapt the P 2 P stream mixing and distribution processes separately. Specifically, we can adaptively spread stream mixing workload among resource-constrained peer hosts according to current speaking activities.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Multi-party</b> voice-over-IP (MVoIP) <b>services</b> allow a {{group of}} people to freely {{communicate}} with each other via Internet, which have many important applications such as on-line gaming and tele-conferencing. In this paper, we present a peer-to-peer MVoIP system called peerTalk. Compared to traditional approaches such as server-based mixing, peerTalk achieves better scalability and failure resilience by dynamically distributing stream processing workload among different peers. Particularly, peerTalk decouples the MVoIP service delivery into two phases: mixing phase and distribution phase. The decoupled model allows us to explore the asymmetric property of MVoIP services (e. g., distinct speaking/listening activities, unequal inbound/out-bound bandwidths) so that the system can better adapt to distinct stream mixing and distribution requirements. To overcome arbitrary peer departures/failures, peerTalk provides light-weight backup schemes to achieve fast failure recovery. We have implemented a prototype of the peerTalk system and evaluated its performance using both large-scale simulation testbed and real Internet environment. Our initial implementation demonstrates the feasibility of our approach and shows promising results: peerTalk can outperform existing approaches such as P 2 P overlay multicast and coupled distributed processing for providing MVoIP services...|$|R

40|$|Context. Introduction of {{efficient}} {{multimedia technologies}} {{combined with the}} spreading of high-speed internet connection {{all over the world}} has led to the continuous increase in demand of multimedia services, particularly video and audio. One of the major demands are flexible, interoperable and cost-effective lightweight remote collaboration systems in companies. Web Real Time Communication (WebRTC) is an emerging peer to peer technology that is promising to be the solution to many digital real-time communication challenges. With its fantastic one-to-one communication capabilities, WebRTC supports fast and smooth audio calls, video calls, conferencing, data (media file, document and screen) sharing, gaming and all sorts of messages exchange, all being done straight out of the browser. However, as shown by investigations and interviews supported by Ericsson AB and Semcon AB as party of the MERCO (Mediated Effective Remote Collaboration) international project, many corporate use cases of remote collaboration involve applications beyond the conventional one to one communication. Present videoconferencing systems (telepresence) limits the collaboration flexibility due to their lack of the ability to adapt to system resource usage, hence tend to be too heavy for less powerful devices (laptops, tablets, phones). Moreover, their installation and maintenance costs are too expensive for small companies.   Therefore, new flexible, lightweight and less expensive solutions for remote collaboration need to be developed. Objectives. The main objective of this thesis is to identify technical solutions to address the challenges of resource usage flexibility in WebRTC multi-party remote collaboration systems. Despite concurrent developments of both commercial and free solutions that provide <b>multi-party</b> videoconferencing <b>services</b> using WebRTC, present solutions such as the conventional Multipoint Control Unit (MCU), Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) and Fully Meshed architectures suffers from issues of excessive resource usage and cannot deliver the acceptable quality of experience in different use cases, particularly the mobile environment. The aim of this thesis is to investigate lightweight technical solutions {{that can be used to}} improve the system resource usage in WebRTC multiparty conferencing systems. Through understanding the architectural designs, benchmarking the performance of various technologies used in WebRTC and selecting the most suitable techniques a prototype is developed as a proof of concept. Methods. The first part of the thesis is dedicated to comprehensive study of fundamentals, background information and related works on WebRTC. This gives knowledge of technologies, techniques and performance evaluation metrics which help in making appropriate technical decisions during the experimental development of WebRTC solutions. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to experimental investigation in which two WebRTC signaling technologies (XSockets and NodeJs) are evaluated based on call setup time in WebRTC group call. Two lightweight technical solutions for improving resource usage flexibility (Switching video quality based on speech and using emotions and gestures instead of video) are evaluated based on system resources (CPU, memory, disk and network) and user experience. Results. Based on call setup time of WebRTC multi-party calls, the experimental results indicates that XSockets is a better signaling technology than NodeJs. The two proposed lightweight solutions have shown a remarkable improvement based on systems resource usage. A 15 % reduction of CPU usage is observed when using speech controlled video quality switching and further 10 % reduction is observed when video is replaced by emotions and gestures. Conclusions. Despite the minimal resource usage achieved by using emotions technique, this solution has usability issues as it cannot detect emotions in poor lighting environment. Consequently, the solution of switching video quality based on speech is chosen for further implementation. Though, this technique can be further improved through using machine learning techniques, the current implementation can significantly reduce the amount CPU, memory, disk and network usage to allow up to 6 participants to join a single conference call while maintain acceptable quality of experience...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the problem space {{of developing a}} high quality, yet scalable <b>multi-party</b> voice communication <b>service</b> to the ever more popular Distributed Virtual Environments (DVE) exemplified by the Multiplayer Online Games (MOG). The social interactive experience of DVE users can be greatly enhanced if the users feel immersed in a realistic environment via high fidelity visual scenes, auditory scenes and haptics. While recognising the primary {{role played by the}} visual scenes and the consequent rapid progresses made in the field of computer graphics, in this thesis, we investigate the network delivery of live DVE user voices which will be an important supplement to the primary visual scenes in creating the sense of immersion for the DVE users. The Immersive Voice over IP (VoIP) service is characterised by the creation of an auditory scene for each user which is the personalised mix of all the voices within that user’s hearing range. Each constituent voice stream in an auditory scene is localised (directional placement) and distance-attenuated in accordance with the visual positions of corresponding users in the virtual world. We believe the auditory scenes created for Immersive VoIP will be much more conducive to the creation of users’ sense of immersion than the currently prevalent text-chat and mono VoIP applications. During our literature review, we first identified three key challenges faced by the Immersive VoIP service provider, i. e., the need to reduce respectively, the voice processing cost, the voice exchange bandwidth cost and the voice transmission latency. In view of the limited resources onboard the DVE clients (especially the wireless clients), the concept of server-rendered Immersive VoIP service is proposed which employs dedicated servers to complete the computationally expensive voice rendering tasks on behalf of the clients. Nevertheless, in exchange for the minimisation of client-side resource loads, a server processing scalability problem is created where each of the Auditory Scene Creation (ASC) servers could bear a prohibitively large processing load when supporting a large and dense user population. In the course of conducting subjective listening tests, we soon realised that the further away a listener is from the voice source, the greater is the voice localisation error which can be tolerated by the listener. This important result verifies the conjecture of distance-governed variable ii Abstract iii acceptable_localisation_error which allows the same localised voice to be shared between nearby listening users. This conjecture allows for siginifcant reductons in voice processing cost through the computational reuse of voice localisation results. In addition to considering the static Auditory Scene Creations, a mechanism known as the Transitional Deviation Reduction Algorithm has also been devised to address the issue that the Immersive VoIP users can be annoyed by more than 5 degrees of angular shifts between the voices localised at successive time instants with respect to the same speaking avatar. To ensure low voice latency for the latency-critical Immersive VoIP service, we propose a two_overlay_hops distributed server architecture. In this architecture, the voice transmission path between any pair of communicating avatars is always two overlay hops, i. e., from the speaking client to the assigned ASC server (1 st hop) then from the ASC server to the listening client (2 nd hop). As shown by our simulations results, this two_overlay_hops distributed server architecture is capable of significantly improving the voice transmission latency from the central server architecture and the prior distributed server solution devised in (Nguyen, 2006), especially for the challenging, yet realistic DVE scenario where there is a low level of correlations between the distribution of avatars in the DVE virtual world and the distribution of physical clients in the underlying geographically dispersed network. The objective of our server selection/assignment Linear Programming (LP) formulations is to obtain a balance between improving the voice transmission latency and mitigating the associated increases in the client-side voice upload bandwidth cost and the server-side voice processing cost. In particular, the Bandwidth Constrained Formulation reduces the client-side voice upload cost while still achieving a satisfactory level of latency performance by establishing a few ASC server sites which are very Latency Efficient, i. e., capable of meeting the acceptable_latency_constraints {{of a large number of}} communicating avatar pairs. However, the LP-based server assignment formulations were proven to be NP-hard and computationally expensive if executed in their original centralised format. Consequently, an alternative scheme was devised to divide the virtual world into equal size (measured in the number of avatar pairs enclosed) partitions so as to parallelise and distribute the execution of the server assignment formulations between different partitions. We examined the impact of avatar mobility in the virtual world on the performance of our distributed server assignment solutions, in particular the solution’s ability to balance Abstract iv between improving the voice latency and reducing the associated rises in client-side upload bandwidth cost. In our simulations, we found that the ASC servers need to be re-assigned at a regular frequency. Despite the significant scalability improvements made by our virtual world partitioning scheme, the optimised server assignment formulations, especially the complex, yet practical Bandwidth Constrained Formulation is still not scalable enough to meet the execution frequencies required for coping with avatar mobility. To this end, we have derived the Bandwidth Reduced Heuristic which offers much faster execution time than the optimal server assignment mechanism, at the expense of small performance loss in terms of both latency and client-side upload bandwidth cost. By combining our virtual world partitioning scheme with the Bandwidth Reduced Heuristic, we have produced a distributed server assignment solution which will enable the Immersive VoIP service to cope with frequent virtual world mobility for a wide range of DVE scenarios in terms of varying user population sizes and/or distribution densities. The only exception is a very sparse DVE which could require the ASC servers to be reassigned once per 60 - 70 seconds. Such a fast frequency is unrealistic considering the combined delays of server reassignment and handover. Consequently, a really sparse DVE with low intensity communication flows is probably best served by a simple Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) architecture with minimum management overhead rather than the client-server architectures...|$|R
