Most neuromuscular blockers function by blocking transmission at the end plate of the neuromuscular junction. Normally, a nerve impulse arrives at the motor nerve terminal, initiating an influx of calcium ions, which causes the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then diffuses across the synaptic cleft. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hydrolysed</b> by acetylcholine esterase (AchE) or bind to the nicotinic receptors located on the motor end plate. The binding of two acetylcholine molecules results in a conformational change in the receptor that opens the sodium-potassium channel of the nicotinic receptor. This allows [...] and [...] ions to enter the cell and [...] ions to leave the cell, causing a depolarization of the end plate, resulting in muscle contraction. Following depolarization, the acetylcholine molecules are then removed from the end plate region and enzymatically hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase.|$|E
50|$|To {{modify the}} {{performance}} of lecithin to make it suitable for the product {{to which it is}} added, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hydrolysed</b> enzymatically. In hydrolysed lecithins, a portion of the phospholipids have one fatty acid removed by phospholipase. Such phospholipids are called lysophospholipids. The most commonly used phospholipase is phospholipase A2, which removes the fatty acid at the C2 position of glycerol. Lecithins may also be modified by a process called fractionation. During this process, lecithin is mixed with an alcohol, usually ethanol. Some phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, have good solubility in ethanol, whereas most other phospholipids do not dissolve well in ethanol. The ethanol is separated from the lecithin sludge, after which the ethanol is removed by evaporation to obtain a phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin fraction.|$|E

40|$|A RELIABLE {{screening}} test for malignant disease {{has long been}} sought but of the many tests devised, using {{a wide variety of}} techniques, none is sufficiently reliable for routine use. In attempts to produce such a {{screening test}} the trypsin inhibitor activity of serum has often been used and many methods have been introduced to measure this inhibitor activity (Peacock and Sherry, 1952; Homer, Katchman and Zipf, 1963). Most of the methods have used one or other of a variety of substrates which have been capable of hydrolysis by a wide range of proteolytic enzymes rather than by trypsin specifically. Nardi (1958) described a technique for the estimation of serum trypsin using the substrate benzoyl-l-arginine amide hydrochloride (BAA). His findings could not be confirmed (Kemp, 1959, unpublished; Babson, Williams and Phillips, 1962) but {{in the course of the}} work a method of estimating the trypsin inhibitor activity of serum has been devised using BAA as a substrate. Although at first it was thought that BAA <b>was</b> specifically <b>hydrolysed</b> by trypsin, Nardi (1959, personal communication) later recognised that it <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>hydrolysed</b> by the plant enzyme papain and by plasmin (fibrinolysin), the effect of the latter in his determination being considered negligible. Plasmin <b>may</b> <b>be</b> produced by the trypsin activation of plasminogen and the specificity of any test for serum trypsin or serum trypsin inhibitor activity using BAA <b>may</b> therefore <b>be</b> reduced. The evidence concerning activation of plasminogen by trypsin is conflicting but if trypsin is present in excess any plasmin formed is rapidly destroyed (Astrup, 1956). It seems unlikely therefore that plasmin plays a significant role in the present method which, with its more specific substrate, has been used to re-evaluate serum trypsin inhibitor activity as a screening test for the detection of malignant disease...|$|R

40|$|Methyl formate (MF) is a {{volatile}} solvent with several industrial applications. The acute airway effects of MF were evaluated in a mouse bioassay, allowing {{the assessment of}} sensory irritation of the upper airways, airflow limitation of the conducting airways and deep lung (pulmonary) irritation. MF was studied at vapour concentrations of 202 – 1, 168  ppm. Sensory irritation was the only effect observed, which developed slowly over the 30 -min exposure period. The potency at steady state was at least 10 -fold higher than expected from a hypothetically similar, but non-reactive compound. Methyl formate <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hydrolysed</b> in vivo to formic acid, a potent sensory irritant, and methanol, a low-potent sensory irritant. Hydrolysis may be catalysed by carboxyesterases, and therefore, {{the role of the}} esterases was studied using the esterase inhibitor tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP). TOCP pre-treatment reduced the irritation response of MF, suggesting that carboxyesterase-mediated hydrolysis plays a role in the irritative effect. However, even after administration of TOCP, MF was considerably more irritating than expected from a quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model. The slope of the concentration–effect relationship for formic acid was lower than that for the MF in the low-dose range, suggesting that different receptor activation mechanisms may occur, which may include an effect of MF itself, in addition to an effect of formic acid and potentially an effect from formaldehyde...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY- The {{digestive}} secretions of both {{old world}} and new world camels are considered The salivary glands closely {{resemble those of}} cattle and sheep both morphologically andphysiologically. Evidently, as in the Ruminantia, they provide {{almost all of the}} fluid and alkali needed to maintain favourable conditions for microbial digestion in the forestomach. The glandular epithelium of the camees forestomach {{does not seem to have}} an important role in this respect except in that its free permeability to volatile fatty acids allows exchange of fatty acids for bicarbonate, as occurs also across the squamous keratinised epithelium of the Ruminantia. Little is known of t?te secretions and digestive processes of the hindstomach and iktestines. A large part (up to about 90 %) of the urea formed in the camees body <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hydrolysed</b> in the gut. This provides and endogenous source of nitrogen for microbial protein synthesis. The forestomach contains about a quarter of the water in the whole body It serves as a substantial and dynamic reservoir, releasing water during dehydration and accommodating it when a thirsty animal takes a huge drink to allow gradual rehydration of the tissues.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Phosphorus (P) {{mineralisation}} from {{crop residues}} is usually predicted from total P or carbon: phosphorus (C: P) ratios. However, these measures have limited accuracy {{as they do}} {{not take into account}} the presence of different P species that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> mineralised at different rates. In this study P speciation was determined using solution 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to understand the potential fate of residue P in soils. METHODS: Mature above-ground biomass of eight different crops sampled from the field was portioned into stem, chaff and seed. RESULTS: The main forms of P detected in stem and chaff were orthophosphate (25 – 75 %), phospholipids (10 – 40 %) and RNA (5 – 30 %). Phytate was the dominant P species in seeds, and constituted up to 45 % of total P in chaff but was only detected in minor amounts (< 1 %) in stem residue. The majority (65 – 95 %) of P in stems was water-extractable, and most of this was detected as orthophosphate. However, this includes organic P that <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>hydrolysed</b> during the water extraction. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the majority of residue P in aboveground plant residues has the potential to be delivered to soil in a form readily available to plants and soil microorganisms.

40|$|Certain mycotoxins may {{be present}} in plant {{materials}} as their glucosides. The question is whether these glucosides <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hydrolysed</b> into their parent compounds in the gastro-intestinal tract (GI-tract), thus increasing the exposure. Therefore, the potential hydrolysis of deoxynivalenol- 3 -ß-glucoside (DON- 3 G) to deoxynivalenol (DON) was assessed in two in vitro models representing the human upper GI-tract (mouth, stomach and small intestine). In a fed digestion model, {{there was no evidence}} of release of DON from DON- 3 G, spiked at a level of 2, 778 µg DON- 3 G/kg food. This shows that the conditions in the GI-tract do not result in hydrolysis of this glucoside into the original mycotoxin. The absorption and transformation of DON- 3 G in the small intestine was assessed in an in vitro model with human Caco- 2 cells in a Transwell system. No evidence was found for the transformation of DON- 3 G to DON by the Caco- 2 cells in both the apical or basolateral side in 24 hours (cells were exposed to 2. 4 nmol DON- 3 G/ml medium). However, when DON itself was added to the apical side an amount of 23 % of the spiked DON was detected in the basolateral side after 24 hours (cells were exposed to 2. 3 nmol/ml medium). In conclusion, no evidence was found in the in vitro experiments for significant elevated exposure of humans to DON, since DON- 3 G was not hydrolysed to DON in the digestion model representing the upper part of the GI-tract and DON- 3 G was not hydrolysed to DON by the intestinal epithelial Caco- 2 cells. It was shown that bioavailability of DON- 3 G in humans may be low as compared to DON since Caco- 2 cells did not absorb DON- 3 G, in contrast to DON...|$|E
40|$|From both {{economic}} and environmental perspectives it is desirable to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. One route to increase the fuel efficiency for vehicles is operation in oxygen excess. However, a major problem with this technique is the lean environment, which obstructs catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NO x) to harmless nitrogen. This thesis focuses on key parameters affecting catalytic reduction of NO x under lean conditions. In specific surface acidity and nanoparticle synthesis have been investigated. The activity for lean NO x reduction by propene and propane, the selectivity for N 2 formation, and the surface acidity were investigated with flow reactor experiments and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy over model catalysts, with and without platinum. The NO x reduction activity is markedly dependent {{on the type of}} reducing agent. Propene and propane were used in the reaction over platinum supported catalysts and {{it was found that the}} samples that showed activity for NO x reduction with propane all contained Brønsted acid sites. Further, the N 2 selectivity was enhanced (using propane) with increasing Brønsted-site density over these catalysts. For the platinum-free samples a clear correlation between the amount of Brønsted acid sites and the activity for NO x reduction, with propane, was observed. It is likely that the propane is activated over the Brønsted acid sites forming some kind of carbenium ions, which probably react with adsorbed NO + species to form isocyanates that, in turn, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hydrolysed</b> to amine species. The NO x reduction by isopropylamine was followed in-situ by FTIR and the results indicate a rapid reaction, over Brønsted acid sites, compared to the corresponding reaction with propane. It is thus conceivable that amine species are possible reaction intermediates in the HC-SCR reaction under the present conditions. However, the hydrocarbon activation and the formation of NO + species seem to be a prerequisite for the reaction to occur. Platinum nanoparticles were prepared in microemulsions and the resulting particles were used in model catalyst synthesis. The effect of surfactant type on the kinetics of platinum nanoparticle formation in water-in-oil microemulsions was studied with UV-visible spectroscopy. The rate of particle formation was found to be strongly dependent on the type of surfactant used in the microemulsion formulation. The difference in reactivity may be due to either droplet fusion and/or to the chemical microenvironment in the fused microemulsion droplets. Platinum nanoparticles were deposited on alumina support using two different methods. Both methods gave considerable particle agglomeration. However, the rate of addition of solvent, the choice of surfactant, and the pH value are of importance and a weak interaction between the platinum particles and the support seems favourable...|$|E

40|$|Phosphorus (P) within stubble can be {{released}} directly to soil as soluble P or assimilated by microorganisms and subsequently released {{back into the}} soil through mineralisation. The chemical composition of P in crop stubble may {{play an important role}} in the rate of stubble P release. Crop stubble sampled after grain maturity in 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12 contained 1 - 5 kg P/ha. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to determine the different forms of P present in the stubble. On average 50 % of the total stubble P was orthophosphate which is water soluble and readily available to plants and microorganisms. The remaining P forms were identified as phospholipids, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and pyrophosphate. The majority (65 - 90 %) of P in the major stubble component (stems) was water-soluble, and most of this was detected as orthophosphate. However, this includes organic P forms that <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>hydrolysed</b> during the water extraction. Results from a field leaching experiment show between 0 and 7. 5 % of stubble P was released from 52 mm (collected after 11 mm and 41. 4 mm) of summer rainfall. That indicated crop stubbles in the field release some P into soil solution which could be readily accessed by plant roots. However, the slower release of stubble P in the field compared to the laboratory suggests that residues potentially play a more important role as a long term P supply to subsequent crops. Subsequent experimentation will measure the contribution of surface applied and incorporated stubble P to crop plant P nutrition using 33 P isotopic techniques.
