Therefore, he believed that the Federal Reserve should not take on the responsibility for attempting to accomplish by itself, under its existing powers, a reduction in the rate of inflation to, say, 2 percent... he did not believe that the Federal Reserve should be expected to cope with inflation single-handedly. The only effective answer, in his opinion, lay in some form of incomes policy.|$|E
50|$|The {{democratically elected}} {{government}} that assumed office in April 1992 launched an ambitious economic reform program to halt economic deterioration {{and put the}} country on the path toward a market economy. Key elements included price and exchange system liberalization, fiscal consolidation, <b>monetary</b> <b>restraint,</b> and a firm income policy. These were complemented by a comprehensive package of structural reforms including privatization, enterprise, and financial sector reform, and creation of the legal framework for a market economy and private sector activity. Most agriculture, state housing, and small industry were privatized. This trend continued with the privatization of transport, services, and small and medium-sized enterprises. In 1995, the government began privatizing large state enterprises. After reaching a low point in the early 1990s, the economy slowly expanded again, reaching its 1989 level {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E

Andrew Roth's Parliamentary Profiles (1987-1991) describes him as [...] "Widely respected, well-connected, principled Rightwing, monetarist City gent; a hard-headed long term thinker; a devout believer in sanctity of tight money" [...] and as saying [...] "I was not only one of the first in this house to be a monetarist...I confidently expect to be about the last." [...] Ahead of the high inflation of the mid-1970s, he attacked (with some prescience) the Bank of England in 1970 for insufficient <b>monetary</b> <b>restraint</b> and (while Chairman of the Finance Committee) both publicly opposed Chancellor Anthony Barber's over-expansion of monetary supply in April 1971 and attacked the Heath Government's [...] "absurd" [...] proposals for a statutory prices and incomes policy.|$|E
5000|$|Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress {{gave the}} Federal Reserve {{statutory}} {{authority to pay}} interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks' reserves, the Federal Reserve {{will be able to}} put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally....As an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so.When these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying <b>monetary</b> <b>restraint,</b> the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.In sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so.|$|E

40|$|The {{difficulties}} of settling {{on a national}} policy for coping with inflation are compounded by a prolonged Battle of the Books among economists. Those who {{think of themselves as}} fiscalists (or Keynesians or New Economists) often underestimate the importance of changes in the rate of money-supply growth. And those who think of themselves as monetarists often overestimate the possibilities of using changes in the rate of moneysupply growth as an instrument for controlling inflation. Actually, monetary tightness pushes interest rates and unemployment up before it has any discernible effect on inflation. In this dialogue, economist Allan H.

40|$|In {{recent years}} major {{structural}} {{changes have been}} taking place within the UK economy. One of the major factors responsible {{for this is the}} oil developments in the North Sea, which have seen since 1980 the achievement of self sufficiency in oil for the UK. At the same time as this Development has been taking place, there has been a major change in economic policy towards the control of inflation through <b>monetary</b> and fiscal <b>restraint</b> as outlined in the Medium Term Financial Strategy. Economic policy was now to be framed within a medium term context, rather than in the context of short term stabilisation. Demand management policies were to be downgraded, and more emphasis was to be placed upon improving the supply side of the economy. This thesis is directed towards analysing the above developments but in particular the effects of an oil discovery, oil price increases and tight money upon the structure of the economy as well as the dynamic processes of adjustment involved. The evolution and final outcome of the adjustment process obviously also depends crucially upon the policies adopted by the Government, in terms of its attitude towards such developments. Hence our analysis would be incomplete without a discussion of present Governmental attitudes as well as its appropriateness. This ultimately involves deciding whether market forces should determine the reallocation of resources, or whether greater involvement by the Government is required...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{assessment}} of the medium-term financial strategies operating in and available to OECD economies. Three issues are discussed: first, the rationale for the increasing adoption of medium-term budgetary and monetary objectives; second, the appropriate criteria for the determination of medium-term policy norms, and the institutional means through which these are implemented; and third, the problems of ensuring consistency between short-term policies and medium-term goals. Underlying these issues is the theme of monetary and fiscal policy co-ordination and the medium-term effectiveness of demand management.

40|$|The Maastricht Treaty on Europe Union {{features}} an Excessive Deficit Procedure limiting {{the freedom to}} borrow of governments participating in the European monetary union. One justification is to prevent states from over- borrowing and demanding a bailout which could divert the European Central Bank from its pursuit of price stability. We challenge this rationale. Using data for {{a cross section of}} federal states, we find no association between <b>monetary</b> union and <b>restraints</b> on borrowing by subcentral governments. There is,however, an association between fiscal restraints and the share of the tax base under the control of sub-national authorities. Restraints are prevalent where subcentral governments finance a relatively small share of spending with their own taxes. Lacking control of the tax base, such governments cannot be expected to resort to increased taxation to deal with debt crises. Prohibiting borrowing by subcentral governments will not eliminate the demand for tax smoothing and public investment. Governments whose ability to provide such services is limited may therefore pressure the central government to borrow for them. We report evidence that the financial position of central governments is more fragile where subcentral jurisdictions are prevented from borrowing. The implications for the EU are direct. That EU member states control their own taxes should strengthen the hand of authorities seeking to resist pressure for a bailout. But in the longer run, borrowing restraints may weaken the financial position of Brussels, transferring bailout risk from the member states to the EU itself. ...|$|R
40|$|The Federal {{government}} attained {{the goal}} of budget consolidation in 1997. The net deficit declined to 2. 6 percent of GDP. The other territorial authorities have also exceeded their goals. Thus, the general government deficit totaled only 2. 5 percent of GDP, and Austria has easily met the budget deficit criterion {{for participation in the}} European Economic and <b>Monetary</b> Union. Fiscal <b>restraint,</b> however, does not only serve to meet the "Maastricht criteria", but also to gain maneuvering room for fiscal policy in the medium term. More than half of the reduction in the deficit during the years 1996 - 97 was achieved by savings on the expenditure side. Tax measures also contributed to the reduction in the deficit. The 1999 draft budget is set to stabilize the deficit ratio. The favorable development must not be jeopardized, however, by additional claims on the Federal budget, a caveat that is also necessary in view of the EU Stability Pact. The outlay structure has undergone significant shifts. This {{can be traced to the}} establishment of new public sector entities (railroads, Post Office, Federal real estate agency) as well as new modes of financing public investment (leasing). The result is a shift in infrastructure investment from the public to the private sector. An important task of the Federal government remains the financing of pensions. About 20 percent of total expenditures are allocated to this item. In addition to funding the pensions to Federal civil servants (including those in the railroad system and the postal service), the Federal government contributes large amounts to the pension insurance scheme. Despite various reform measures, the Federal contributions are set to rise to ATS 59. 6 billion in 1999, from ATS 57. 5 billion in 1997. An important component of Federal social expenditures is assistance to families. Family allowances are scheduled to be raised in 1999 (in addition, income tax deductions for children will be increased). These measures will require additional funds of ATS 3 billion. Reductions in tax revenues also amount to ATS 3 billion; in sum, additional funds allocated to family assistance will total ATS 6 billion in 1999. More funds are budgeted for active labor market policies, especially within the framework of the National Action Plan. In 1999, ATS 3 billion are allocated to these programs. Within the support programs for the manufacturing and small business sectors, the emphasis is shifting from the traditional measures (such as subsidized loans) to measures fostering technological innovation. Moreover, regional programs, some of which are co-financed by the EU, are also gaining in importance. The most important source of revenue of the Federal budget are taxes, which cover about two thirds of expenditures. As a result of various measures, tax revenues rose substantially in 1996 - 97. In 1997, the tax ratio reached a record high. It is expected to decline slightly in 1998 - 99, as a result of the termination of one-off effects and new provisions regarding the taxation of families with dependents. Revenues from the value-added tax and other excise taxes are expected to rise slowly, with a rate of growth below that of GDP. In 1997, receipts from privatization totaled ATS 17. 2 billion, constituting an important source of revenue. For 1999, privatization receipts are budgeted considerably lower, at ATS 3 billion. The 1997 budget deficit was financed entirely in the form of schilling debts. As a result, the share of debt denominated in foreign currencies in the total Federal debt fell from 21. 2 percent in 1996 to 20. 7 percent in 1997.
