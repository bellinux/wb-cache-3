These include USA Football Month, held throughout August to encourage and promote youth football; A Crucial Catch, the league's Breast Cancer Awareness Month program; Salute to Service, held throughout November to support <b>military</b> <b>families</b> and personnel; and PLAY 60, which encourages young NFL fans to be active for at least 60 minutes each day.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Ngô family {{claimed that}} the army had carried out the raids, {{something}} their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. As most of the students were from middle-class public service and <b>military</b> <b>families,</b> the arrests caused further upset among the Ngô family's power base.|$|E

5|$|The limited {{evidence}} on auxiliary centuriones and decuriones {{is that such}} officers could be directly commissioned as well as promoted from the ranks. Many appear {{to have come from}} provincial aristocracies. Those rising from the ranks could be promotions from the legions {{as well as from the}} regiment's own ranks. In the Julio-Claudian period auxiliary centuriones and decuriones were a roughly equal split between citizens and peregrini, though later citizens became predominant due to the spread of citizenship among <b>military</b> <b>families.</b> Because centuriones and decuriones often rose from the ranks, they have often been compared to warrant officers such as sergeants-major in modern armies. However, centurions' social role was much wider than a modern warrant-officer. In addition to their military duties, centurions performed a wide range of administrative tasks, which was necessary in the absence of an adequate bureaucracy to support provincial governors. They were also relatively wealthy, due to their high salaries (see table above). However, most of the surviving evidence concerns legionary centurions and it is uncertain whether their auxiliary counterparts shared their high status and non-military role.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his seventh}} {{season with the}} Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with the Giants in December 2006. At the time, {{it was the largest}} {{contract}} ever given to a pitcher. He posted double-digit wins in his first three seasons, and in 2010 he helped San Francisco win their first championship since 1954. However, he struggled the last month of the season and he was left off the postseason roster. After sitting out much of the 2011 season with a foot and ankle injury, he came back in 2012 and flourished, finishing with a 15–8 record, his best season in a Giants uniform. The same October, Zito helped lead the Giants to their second World Series title in San Francisco history by going 2–0 with a 1.69 ERA in three postseason starts. In his first career World Series start, he outdueled Tigers' ace Justin Verlander in Game 1, setting the stage for San Francisco's sweep to their seventh World Series title in franchise history. Zito struggled in 2013 but received a standing ovation from the fans in his final appearance as a Giant. Following the year, he became a free agent. Zito, a philanthropist, founded Strikeouts For Troops, a national non-profit that provides comforts of home and lifts the spirits and morale of injured troops as well as offering support to <b>military</b> <b>families.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{studies that}} {{conclude}} abuse {{is a bigger}} problem in <b>military</b> <b>families</b> than civilian families attribute this to the long hours, frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress. They point out that <b>military</b> <b>families</b> may be more reluctant to report issues of abuse {{because of the potential}} impact on the service member's career. Other studies, however, argue that <b>military</b> <b>families</b> have a smaller problem than civilian families because military culture offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. <b>Military</b> <b>families</b> have health care, housing, and family support programs often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members {{are more likely to be}} ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} analyzes USNA and fleet {{performance of}} midshipmen {{who come from}} career <b>military</b> <b>family</b> backgrounds. It is hypothesized that a <b>military</b> <b>family</b> background provides children with values that help them succeed at the Academy and in the Fleet. This thesis uses USNA classes of 1988 - 1992 to judge performance at the Academy and USNA classes of 1980 - 1985 to measure fleet performance. Performance was {{measured in terms of}} graduation rates, attrition rates and final aggregate multiples. In judging officer performance, retention rates to the LCDR boards and career promotion rates to LCDR and CDR were examined. Results suggest that a <b>military</b> <b>family</b> background may be significant in determining success at the Academy and in the Fleet. However, more research is necessary to adequately isolate the effect of a <b>military</b> <b>family</b> background. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
