40|$|Background. Stocks of many {{marine fishes}} are in decline {{and a number}} of studies suggest that for some species the impact of {{recreational}} angling may be important. To date, only recreational (leisure) fishing surveys have been conducted in Portugal, with no studies on beach angling competitions, dynamically increasing in number over the past 10 to 20 years. In view of the above, we decided to evaluate the impact of such events on the Algarve coast (southern Portugal) in terms of the abundance, diversity, and respective weight of fish species caught and outline some conservation measures and recommendations for the management of the targeted species. Materials and methods. Participants of 22 angling competitions taking place between February and June 2007 were surveyed. In each competition a random sample of anglers was interviewed, and the specimens caught by each participant were identified, weighed, and measured. Results. Thirteen taxa belonging to eight families were identified, and the most common were: garfish, Belone belone (Linnaeus, 1761); mullets, Mugilidae (not identified); and mackerels, Scomber spp. A total of 563 specimens were sampled, totalling 75. 4 kg of weight, with the average catch per angler weighing 0. 5 +/- 0. 05 SE (n = 153) kg. Differences were also observed between the length at first maturity (L(50)) of the specimens caught and their respective Minimum Landing Size (MLS) and Allowed Minimum Size (AMS), most particularly {{in the case of the}} European seabass, Dicentrarchus labrax (L.), with almost all individuals caught measuring below the species-specific L 50. Analysis of time series of competition results (1996 - 2009) showed no evidence of a decrease in catches or in mean weight. Conclusion. Based on the results we propose that the AMS for beach angling competitions should be increased to the MLS in order to prevent the capture of juvenile fishes, especially the sea bass. Future studies should address the size selectivity of the hooks used in beach competitions, with a view to the implementation of a <b>minimum</b> <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> for competitions...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in Napoleon gulf, Lake Victoria Uganda from July – December 2009. It {{was conducted in}} four landing sites; Bukaya (0. 41103 N, 33. 19133 E), Bugungu (0. 40216 N, 33. 2028 E), Busana (0. 39062 N, 33. 25228 E) and Kikondo (0. 3995 N, 33. 21848 E) all from Buikwe district (Formerly part of Mukono district). The main aim {{was to determine the}} effect of both hook size and bait type on the catch rate (mean weight) and size composition of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) (LINNE) fishery in the Napoleon Gulf, Lake Victoria. The main hook sizes investigated during the experiment were 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 that were dominantly used in harvesting Nile perch in Napoleon Gulf, Lake Victoria. In this study length, weight and bait type data were collected on site from each boat at that particular fishing spot; since most fishermen in the Napoleon Gulf could sell their fish immediately the catch is caught there and then. The results indicated a total of 873 Nile perch fish samples collected during the study. Statistical tests, descriptive statistics, regression and correlation were all carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) in addition to Microsoft excel. The bait types in the Gulf ranged from 5 - 10 cm Total length (TL) haplochromine, 24. 5 - 27 cm TL Mormyrus kannume and 9 - 24 cm TL Clarias species. The bait types had a significant effect on the catch rate and also on the size composition the fish harvested measured as Total length (ANCOVA F= 8. 231; P 0. 05). Hook sizes used by the fishers had a significant effect on the both the size (TL) composition (ANCOVA F= 3. 847; P< 0. 05) and the mean weight (ANCOVA F= 4. 599; P< 0. 005) of the Nile perch captured. Investigations indicated hook sizes seven (7) and eight (8) were the ones that harvested the Nile perch above the slot size of 50 cm total length. In general hook sizes indicated to be the main drive in the harvesting of the Nile perch though bait type also contributed toward that. Generally there is need for management to put a law in place on the <b>minimum</b> <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> to be used on the harvesting of the Nile perch and also monitored by the Fisheries Management as a regulatory measure. In addition to that aquaculture should be encouraged to farm the fish for bait at a higher scale in the region in order to avoid depleting the wild stocks already in danger of extinction. Through this kind of venture, both biodiversity conservation and environmental sustainability will be observed in the Lake Victoria basin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Hook size is an {{important}} consideration {{in the use of}} circle hooks as a conservation tool for minimizing the injury and mortality of marine fishes, but {{little is known about the}} role of <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> in the performance of hooks in recreational freshwater fisheries. In this study, we angled 100 bluegills Lepomis macrochirus on each of five different-sized circle hooks (1 / 0, 2, 6, 10, and 14). The largest <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> (1 / 0) had low hooking and capture efficiency but selected larger individuals. The smallest <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> also had low hooking efficiency and resulted in the selection of smaller individuals. Intermediate <b>hook</b> <b>sizes</b> captured fish of intermediate <b>size.</b> Jaw <b>hooking</b> rates generally increased with decreasing <b>hook</b> <b>size,</b> whereas roof <b>hooking</b> rates decreased. Gullet hooking was restricted to the three smallest <b>hook</b> <b>sizes.</b> Relative <b>hooking</b> depth and incidences of bleeding were uniformly low for all <b>hook</b> <b>sizes.</b> Similarly, the fish were generally easy to remove from the hook irrespective of <b>hook</b> <b>size.</b> Our mortality projections revealed no trends associated with <b>hook</b> <b>size,</b> our overall mortality rate being less than 1 %. This study suggests that circle hooks function most effectively when the entire hook can fit in the mouth of the fish and when the shank-to-point distance is large enough to permit jaw <b>hooking.</b> <b>Size</b> selectivity for larger individuals can be achieved by using larger <b>hook</b> <b>sizes.</b> However, large circle hooks will also catch smaller fis...|$|R

40|$|The {{unfavourable}} {{effect of}} hooking or softening, respectively, on fracture strength of joints made using friction stir lap welding (FSLW) is known but the combined {{effect on the}} magnitude of strength reduction is not clear. In this study, FSLW experiments using AA 6060 -T 5 and AZ 31 B-H 24 alloys were conducted. For both alloys, rotation speed has a dominant effect on increasing the <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> due to increasing the stir flow volume thus lifting more the original lapping surfaces. In AA 6060 welds, FS softening has limited the strength, when <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> approaches zero. Meanwhile hook starts to reduce the strength significantly, when its size reaches a critical value. The maximum strength of AA 6060 FSL welds reaches ~ 70 % of the base metal UTS when <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> approaches zero. This is in contract to ~ 30 % for AZ 31 B FSL welds.

Rotation speed {{has been found}} to affect significantly the flow related <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> formation. Furthermore, fracture strength decreased almost linearly with <b>hook</b> <b>size.</b> A small amount of softening was detected in fracture location that was outside the nugget zone and thus this softening may only adversely affect the fracture strength slightly. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the uneven stress distribution in a lap geometry which together with the relative brittleness of the stir material must be the cause to have significantly reduced the fracture strength...|$|R
40|$|Three long-line {{methods have}} been studied in the Algarve: 1) small-hook long-line for inshore (less than 30 m) ‘white’ sea breams (Sparidae); 2) small-hook long-line for deeper water (40 - 60 m) ‘red’ sea breams; and 3) deep water (500 - 700 m) semi-pelagic long-line for hake Merluccius merluccius (Linnaeus, 1758). Selectivity {{studies were carried out}} with three <b>hook</b> <b>sizes</b> in the first two cases: Mustad round-bent Quality 2369 hooks, numbers 15, 13, and 11, baited with a standardsized razor-shell Ensis siliqua (Linnaeus, 1758). Four <b>hook</b> <b>sizes</b> (numbers 10, 9, 7, and 5) of Stell round-bent, eyed hooks were used in the semi-pelagic long-line {{selectivity}} study, baited with a half of a standard-sized sardine. Some factors affecting catch composition and catch rates of the small hook long-lines were also evaluated: bait, gangion length, setting time, fishing ground, and depth. Species diversity was relatively high, with 40, 36 and 27 species, respectively, in the three studies. However, the catches were dominated by a limited number of species. Catch rates (number of fish per 100 hooks) were variable (20 %), with a general decrease in catch rate with increasing <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> in all the studies. In general, the catch size distributions for the different <b>hook</b> <b>sizes</b> for each species were highly overlapping, with little or no evidence of differences in <b>size</b> selectivity. <b>Hooks</b> caught a wide size-range for each species, with few or no illegal-sized fish, in most cases.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> (small vs. large) and type (conventional vs. barbless) on hooking injury, catch per unit effort (cpue), and fish size in a mixed-species {{recreational}} fishery in the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean) are evaluated. <b>Hook</b> <b>size</b> {{was the most}} important predictor of deep-hooking, which is reduced by the use of large <b>hooks.</b> The <b>size</b> of fish captured was another predictor of deep-hooking incidence, because large fish tended to be caught in deep-hooking locations. Deep-hooking was highly correlated with the presence of bleeding, and unhooking time was reduced by the use of large hooks and barbless hooks, although differences were small. To determine the effects of different hook treatments on cpue and species composition, a mixed-effect linear model was used as a univariate procedure, and redundancy analysis was used as a multivariate analysis. Results showed a drastic decrease in cpue with barbless hooks. In contrast, large hooks reduced the incidence of hooking injuries, with a small reduction in catch rate. Moreover, large hooks were associated with a larger mean size of fish caught than small hooks. Hence, control of <b>hook</b> <b>size,</b> along with other traditional management measures that involve the release of fish, is presented as a management option for sustainable development of recreational fisheries in the western Mediterranean Sea. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

40|$|Short-term {{mortality}} and size selectivity resulting from different <b>hook</b> types and <b>sizes</b> were studied. Special {{emphasis was on}} derbio, Trachynotus ovatus, as it is commonly caught as an undersized species in recreational fisheries of the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean). Results showed that mortality was generally low (0 - 17. 9 %). The anatomical hook location (AHL) (the anatomical region where the hook penetrated) was the main significant predictor of mortality, as more than 85 % of fish caught in deep locations of the body, such as the oesophagus, stomach or gills, died over a 2 h-holding period. <b>Hook</b> <b>size</b> was also {{a significant predictor of}} mortality because the mortality rates caused by the smallest <b>hooks</b> (<b>sizes</b> 14 and 12) were higher than those of the largest <b>hooks</b> (<b>sizes</b> 10, 8 and 6). For circle hooks, {{mortality and}} deep-hooking incidences were not observed, confirming the conservation properties of this hook type. To estimate size selectivity parameters, applied logistic models normally used in commercial fisheries were fitted to estimate descriptors of slope of selectivity curves and L 50 (length at 50 % selection). Results showed that larger hooks were more size-selective than smaller hooks, but also fewer fish were caught. However, the yield (g h- 1) between <b>hook</b> <b>sizes</b> did not change dramatically (large hooks 1345. 0 ± 179. 8 g h- 1; small hooks 1467. 8 ± 66. 5 g h- 1), since large hooks tended to catch much larger fish than the smaller hooks. As a strategy to conserve resources the use of larger hooks in recreational fisheries is therefore recommended since they result in minimal mortality to released fish and reduce incidental catch of undersized fishes. © 2008 The Authors.

40|$|A 2 -year {{study of}} the European hake (Merluccius merluccius) semi-pelagic ("pedra-bola) {{longline}} fishery {{was carried out in}} the Algarve (southern Portugal). This fishery takes place on the continental slope at 200 - 700 m depths. using monofilament longlines that are lifted off the bottom at regular intervals by glass balls. Hook selectivity trials were carried out with four <b>hook</b> <b>sizes</b> (SIAPAL brand numbers 10, 9, 7 and 5) from March to August 1997 and May to August 1998. At least 32 species of fish and invertebrates were caught, with hake dominating the catch (41 and 45 % of the catch in numbers), followed by Galeus melastomus (23 and 19 %), Micromesistius poutassou (10 and 7 %), Benthodesmus elongatus (8 and 5 %), Etmopterus pusillus (6 and 9 %) and Scyliorhinus canicula (5 and 4 %). Apart from the hake, and some species of commercial value such as G. melastomus (only the large individuals), Ray's bream (Brama brama, 1. 4 and 4 %), silver scabbard fish (Lepidopus caudatus. 1 and 2. 5 %), swordfish (Xiphins gladius, < 1 %), wreckfish (Polyprion americanus, < 1 %). conger eel (Conger conger. < 1 %), and bluemouth rockfish (Helicolenus dactylopterus, < 1 %) - most of the other species are discarded, used as bait in traps or consumed by the fishermen.

Hook numbers 13 and 11 are 49 and 109 % larger respectively than number 15 hooks {{in terms of}} overall size (maximum width x maximum length). A total of 39 900 hooks were fished in 45 sets and 35 species of fish and cephalopods were caught.

Six species of sea breams, along with the greater weever fish (Trachinus draco) accounted for 81 % of the total catch by weight, with the common or white sea bream (Diplodus sargus) bring the most important (29 %). Catch <b>size</b> distributions by <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> were, in general, highly overlapped for all species and <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> had little apparent effect on minimum size at capture.

Up to 4500 sheep brains were examined for the presence of C. cerebralis. Biometric characters based on the larval rostellar <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> were measured for each individual isolate. Representative mitochondrial CO 1 and 12 S rRNA gene sequences for each of the isolates were obtained from NCBI GenBank. Morphometric and genetic data were analyzed using cluster analysis, Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and random effects model. One hundred and fourteen sheep (2. 5 %) were found infected with the coenuri. The minimum and maximum number of scoleces per cyst was 40 and 550 respectively. Each scolex contained 22 - 27 hooks arranged in two rows of large and small hooks. The average total length of the large and small hooks was 158. 9 and 112. 1 μm, respectively. Using ICC, statistically significant clusters of different <b>hook</b> <b>sizes</b> were identified within the isolates. The length of the large and small hooks was significantly associated with the variability in mitochondrial 12 S rRNA gene.

25|$|Fly tying {{requires}} some basic equipment, a fly pattern to follow or replicate, {{and the appropriate}} materials for the particular fly pattern selected. Fly tying equipment enables the fly tyer to efficiently and effectively assemble and secure the materials on the hook. Fly tying materials were originally limited to various furs, feathers, threads and hooks. Today, many more natural and synthetic materials are used to tie flies. Fly patterns are the instructions or recipe required to create the fly. They specify <b>hook</b> <b>sizes</b> and types, the materials and colors to be used, {{as well as the}} sequence to be followed and the assembly methods. There are thousands of possible fly patterns available to the tyer.|$|R
40|$|Fishing trials with {{monofilament}} gill {{nets and}} longlines using small hooks {{were carried out}} in Algarve waters (southern Portugal) over a one-year period. Four <b>hook</b> <b>sizes</b> of "Mustad" brand, round bent, flatted sea hooks (Quality 2316 DT, numbers 15, 13, 12 and 11) and four mesh sizes of 25, 30, 35 and 40 mm (bar length) monofilament gill nets were used. Commercially valuable sea breams dominated the longline catches while small pelagics were relatively {{more important in the}} gill nets. Significant differences in the catch size frequency distributions of the two gears were found for all the most important species caught by both gears (Boops boops, Diplodus bellottii, Diplodus vulgaris, Pagellus acarne, Pagellus erythrinus, Spondyiosoma cantharus, Scomber japonicus and Scorpaena notata), with longlines catching larger fish and a wider size range than nets. Whereas longline catch size frequency distributions for most species for the different <b>hook</b> <b>sizes</b> were generally highly overlapped, suggesting little or no differences in size selectivity, gill net catch size frequency distributions clearly showed size selection. A variety of models were fitted to the gill net and hook data using the SELECT method, while the parameters of the logistic model were estimated by maximum likelihood for the longline data. The bi-normal model gave the best fits for most of the species caught with gill nets, while the logistic model adequately described hook selectivity. The results of this study show that the two static gears compete for many of the same species and have different impacts in terms of catch composition and size selectivity. This information will I;e useful for the improved management of these small-scale fisheries in which many different gears compete for scarce resources...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{relevance}} of recreational fisheries {{has increased the}} need for acceptable, workable and sustainable policies. Identifying the regulatory preferences and perceptions of anglers can assist in determining fishers' behaviors and improving the management of coastal fisheries. In this case study of Mallorca Island, Spain, we investigated anglers' perceptions using data obtained from questionnaires. The anglers' responses were somewhat contradictory. They reported pleasure as a main motivation, although fish consumption was also deemed very important. Anglers reported {{a positive attitude toward}} licensing, managers, and management rules. They appreciated fishing access restrictions (e. g., closed seasons and marine protected areas MPAs), but they did not consider these restrictions to be effective. The management option that was least favored but considered to be the most effective was that of catch-and-release, which sets minimum size restrictions and requires the release of 20 % of captures. A <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> restriction was considered an effective and positive measure, although most anglers admitted {{that they did not know}} the <b>hook</b> <b>size</b> they used. If one control measure was to be eliminated, the anglers' preferences were split between removing bag limits and ending the catch and release policy for some sizes and species. Anglers' understanding of management measures was limited and based primarily on person-to-person communication. Communication with managers was functionally unidirectional and primarily consisted of an instruction booklet issued with each fishing license. The use of electronic communication tools (i. e., web pages) was very low. The quality of communication between fisheries agencies and the fishing public may challenge management credibility and affect compliance with regulations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{quantified}} {{the ecosystem}} effects of small-scale gears operating in southern European waters (Portugal, Spain, Greece), {{based on a}} widely accepted ecosystem measure and indicator, the trophic level (TL). We used data from experimental fishing trials during 1997 to 2000. We studied {{a wide range of}} gear types and sizes: (1) gill nets of 8 mesh sizes, ranging from 44 to 80 mm; (2) trammel nets of 9 inner panel mesh sizes, ranging from 40 to 140 mm; and (3) longlines of 8 <b>hook</b> <b>sizes,</b> ranging from Nos. 15 (small) to 5 (large). We used the number of species caught per TL class for constructing trophic signatures (i. e. cumulative TL distributions), and estimated the TL at 25, 50 and 75...|$|R
