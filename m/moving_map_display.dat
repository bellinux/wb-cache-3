5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>display,</b> laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E
25|$|The Trident's {{advanced}} avionics {{displayed the}} aircraft's momentary position {{relative to the}} ground on a <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>display</b> on the centre instrument panel. This electro-mechanical device also recorded the aircraft's track using a stylus plotting on a motor-driven paper map. Positional information was given by a Doppler navigation system which read groundspeed and drift data which, alongside heading data, drove the stylus.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide range}} of {{avionics}} have been integrated upon the AW119, which are typically housed within the rotorcraft's nose. Initial production models featured conventional flight instruments; the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit is integrated on the newer AW119Kx variant, which is claimed to improve situational awareness, reduce pilot workload, and increase safety. Primary flight and other key information is displayed to the pilots upon two large 10.4 inch multi-function displays in the cockpit; an independently powered stand-by display is also present in case of system failure. Other avionics used include a 3-axis aircraft flight control system (AFCS), Synthetic Vision System (SVS), Highway In The Sky (HITS) depiction, <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>display,</b> radio altimeter, VOR/ILS/GPS/WAAS navigation, Aural Warning Generator, and embedded Helicopter Terrain Avoidance Warning System (HTAWS).|$|E
50|$|Navigation is the {{determination}} of position and direction on or above {{the surface of the}} Earth. Avionics can use satellite-based systems (such as GPS and WAAS), ground-based systems (such as VOR or LORAN), or any combination thereof. Navigation systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displays.</b> Older avionics required a pilot or navigator to plot the intersection of signals on a paper map to determine an aircraft's location; modern systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displays.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Eventide {{moved its}} offices from Manhattan to New Jersey, its President earned a private {{airplane}} pilot's license. Surprised that <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displays</b> {{were not available}} for small airplanes, he had Eventide develop Argus, the first <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> system, {{and one of the}} first multi-function displays designed for general aviation use.|$|R
50|$|The EC135 {{is powered}} by two Turbomeca Arrius 2BPLUS engines, has a range of 432 {{nautical}} miles and an endurance of roughly 4 and a half hours. The helicopter is fitted with two Garmin GPS systems, <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displays,</b> two iPad minis, a power line detection system, night vision goggles and a Trakka Systems A800 high intensity searchlight.|$|R
25|$|According to AgustaWestland, the AW109 Power {{features}} various advanced avionics systems, {{these include}} a three-axis autopilot, an auto-coupled Instrument Landing System, integrated GPS, a <b>Moving</b> <b>Map</b> <b>Display,</b> weather radar, and a Traffic Alerting System. These systems {{are designed to}} reduce pilot workload (the AW109 can be flown under single or dual-pilot instrument flight rules (IFR)) and enable the use of night vision goggles (NVG) to conduct day-or-night operations. The AW109 has a forced trim system which can be readily and selectively activated by the controlling pilot using triggers located on the cyclic and collective which hold the control inputs at the last set position if activated. All critical systems are deliberately redundant for fail-safe operations; the hydraulic system, hydraulic actuators, and electrical system are all dual-redundant, while the power inverters are triple-redundant. The AW109 also has reduced maintenance requirements due to an emphasis on reliability across the range of components used.|$|E
500|$|A {{programme}} {{to upgrade}} 46 Chinook Mk2/2A and Mk3 helicopters was initiated in December 2008. Called Project Julius, it includes new digital flight deck avionics {{based on the}} Thales TopDeck avionics suite, comprising new multifunction displays, a digital <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>display</b> and an electronic flight bag, installation of a nose-mounted FLIR detector, and upgrading the engines to the more powerful T55-714 standard. Upgraded Mk2/2A and Mk3 aircraft will be redesignated Mk4 from Mk2/2a, and Mk5 from Mk3. Deliveries are expected to commence in 2011. [...] The first conversion, a Chinook HC Mk4, first flew on 9 December 2010. Initial operating capability status was reached in June 2012 with seven aircraft delivered.|$|E
500|$|The Kestrel and the Harrier {{were similar}} in appearance, though {{approximately}} 90 per cent of the Kestrel's airframe was redesigned for the Harrier. The Harrier was powered by the more powerful Pegasus 6 engine; new air intakes with auxiliary blow-in doors were added to produce the required airflow at low speed. Its wing was modified to increase area and the landing gear was strengthened. Several hardpoints were installed, two under each wing and one underneath the fuselage; two [...] ADEN cannon gun pods could also be fitted to {{the underside of the}} fuselage. The Harrier was outfitted with updated avionics to replace the basic systems used in the Kestrel; a navigational-attack system incorporating an inertial navigation system, originally for the P.1154, was installed and information was presented to the pilot by a head-up display and a <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E
40|$|General {{aviation}} {{accounted for}} 74 percent of runway incursions but only 57 {{percent of the}} operations during the four-year period from fiscal year (FY) 2001 through FY 2004. Elements of the NASA Runway Incursion Prevention System were adapted and tested for general aviation aircraft. Sixteen General Aviation pilots, of varying levels of certification and amount of experience, participated in a piloted simulation study to evaluate the system for prevention of general aviation runway incursions compared to existing <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displays.</b> Pilots flew numerous complex, high workload approaches under varying weather and visibility conditions. A rare-event runway incursion scenario was presented, unbeknownst to the pilots, which represented a typical runway incursion situation. The results validated the efficacy and safety need for a runway incursion prevention system for general aviation aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Cycling with {{a classic}} paper map was {{compared}} with navigating with a <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displayed</b> on a smartphone, and with auditory, and visual turn-by-turn route guidance. Spatial skills {{were found to}} be related to navigation performance, however only when navigating from a paper or electronic map, not with turn-by-turn (instruction based) navigation. While navigating, 25 % of the time cyclists fixated at the devices that present visual information. Navigating from a paper map required most mental effort and both young and older cyclists preferred electronic over paper map navigation. In particular a turn-by-turn dedicated guidance device was favoured. Visual maps are in particular useful for cyclists with higher spatial skills. Turn-by-turn information is used by all cyclists, and it is useful to make these directions available in all devices...|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} invented in the US, but {{development}} {{was carried out by}} Decca in the UK. It was first deployed by the Royal Navy during World War II when the Allied forces needed a system which could be used to achieve accurate landings and was not known to the Germans and thus free of jamming. After the war it was extensively developed around the UK and later used in many areas around the world. Decca's primary use was for ship navigation in coastal waters, offering much better accuracy than the competing LORAN system. Fishing vessels were major post-war users, but it was also used on aircraft, including a very early (1949) application of <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displays.</b> The system was deployed extensively in the North Sea and was used by helicopters operating to oil platforms.|$|R
2500|$|The S-67 {{was fitted}} with a <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>display,</b> a hands-on-collective radio tune control, and night vision systems. [...] Its {{armament}} included a Tactical Armament Turret (TAT-140) with a [...] cannon, and could carry 16 TOW missiles, [...] rockets, or AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The Blackhawk was powered by two General Electric T58-GE-5 [...] engines.|$|E
2500|$|Both the {{avionics}} {{and principal}} flight controls of the DA42 {{have been designed}} to be user-friendly and to reduce pilot workload. A Garmin G1000 glass cockpit serves as the centrepiece of the aircraft's integrated digital avionics, using a pair of large flat-panel monitors in place of conventional instrumentation and gauges; immediately above these monitors is a horizontal row of standby instruments present as a fail-safe. The monitors display various information on the aircraft, along with navigational data and flight information; both screens can show identical basic information or be configured to flight data on the left monitor and navigation on the right. According to Flight International, the displays are easy to read while features such as the <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>display</b> were considered to be [...] "useful". The DA42 is also outfitted with a sophisticated three-axis Garmin-built GFC 700 autopilot and GWX 70 weather radar.|$|E

50|$|The 586th FLTS {{operates}} three AT-38B aircraft. These {{aircraft are}} modified for test, test support, target, and photo/safety chase. Capabilities of the squadron's AT-38B's include: chaff, flares, Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation and precision data recording and telemetry, electronic counter- measures (ECM), towed target, threat and cruise missile simulation, Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pods, and multiple format photographic coverage (including helmet-mounted video cameras. They {{are equipped with}} an internal Fighter Instrumentation and Navigation System (FINS) which relies on inertial navigation and global positioning inputs to develop a reference for time-space-position information. Each aircraft has a 200-ft AGL capability utilizing radar altimeters and <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displays.</b> For specialized tests, customer provided test equipment may be rack mounted and installed {{in place of the}} rear ejection seat or externally in a pod.|$|R

5000|$|The Mirage 2000N {{is based}} on the Mirage 2000B two-seat trainer, but {{features}} considerable changes. The airframe was strengthened for low-level flight and fitted with an Antilope 5 radar, which is used for terrain following, navigation and ground mapping, and which can follow terrain at 1112 km/h. Other avionic features are twin INS units and <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displays</b> for both the pilot and weapon systems officer. The Mirage 2000N can carry one ASMP medium-range nuclear missile, and can also carry two MATRA Magic AAMs for self-defence. Other protection features include the Sabre jamming system and the Spirale chaff system. Because the extra seat decreases range, a pair of drop tanks are carried. Since the Mirage 2000N's standard weapon was the ASMP, which was carried on the centerline pylon, this meant that it could not carry a centerline tank, but a distinctive big 2,000 liter (530 US gallon) underwing drop tank with a bulbous nose was developed to more than compensate ...|$|R

40|$|Many key {{capabilities}} are being identified to enable Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), including {{the concept of}} Equivalent Visual Operations (EVO). replicating the capacity and safety of today. s visual flight rules (VFR) in all-weather conditions. NASA is striving to develop the technologies and knowledge to enable EVO and to extend EVO towards a Better-Than-Visual operational concept. This operational concept envisions an. equivalent visual. paradigm where an electronic means provides sufficient visual references of the external world and other required flight references on flight deck displays that enable Visual Flight Rules (VFR) -like operational tempos while maintaining and improving safety of VFR while using VFR-like procedures in all-weather conditions. The Langley Research Center (LaRC) has recently completed preliminary research on flight deck technologies for low visibility surface operations. The work assessed the potential of enhanced vision and airport <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displays</b> to achieve equivalent levels of safety and performance to existing low visibility operational requirements.

40|$|The {{integration}} of electronic airport <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>displays</b> into modern cockpits {{is a valuable}} contribution to the situational and positional awareness of pilots during taxi maneuvers. Labels are a key for {{the perception of the}} presented map. Comparing labeled map elements with airport signage enables the crew to constantly cross check their position. This reduces the risk of inadvertently entering a wrong taxiway or runway and the risk of related mishaps. The goal of this work is the development of an automatic map labeling system for airport <b>moving</b> <b>maps.</b> The development of the system is based on a thorough analysis of structure and contents of the most comprehensive aerodrome mapping database world-wide. The design focuses on a high quality and good legibility of the computed labeling solutions. Key aspects are the display of the right information at the right point in time, an unambiguous association of labels to their related map elements, and fully deconflicted labels. The completeness and correctness of data must be guaranteed in all processing steps in order to fulfill the strict requirements for aviation use. The target format as well as required source data and display parameters are defined by analyses of existing paper charts. An expert system is used to accomplish the necessary data conversion. A hierarchical data structure is generated with levels-of-detail fitting to different map scales. Position candidates for different label types are defined based on the hierarchical data structures. The final label placement utilizes existing algorithms. The results of the presented system are demonstrated in two applications. On the one hand, labeling solutions for a real-time display of dynamic, electronic airport <b>moving</b> <b>maps</b> are generated. On the other side, labeling solutions for high-precision, printed paper charts are computed...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of an {{experiment}} evaluating the separate and combined effects of a 3 -D perspective <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> and newly developed Head-Up Display symbology on taxi performance in low visibility.

Relative to a baseline condition, in which in-the-cockpit navigation support was confined to Jeppesen paper map, the 3 -D <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> yielded a nonsignificant increase in taxi speed. The combination of electronic <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> and Head-Up <b>Display</b> yielded a considerably larger and statistically significant increase in taxi speed.

40|$|Thirty pilots flew a {{simulated}} VFR {{cross country flight}} into deteriorating weather with one of three levels of display support: a control display with standard instruments, a synthetic vision system (SVS) display depicting terrain and a highway in the sky (HITS), and a configuration in which the same SVS HITS display was augmented by an electronic <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> depicting weather. Results revealed that nearly all pilots {{in the control condition}} avoided penetrating the IMC clouds. Significantly, 60 % of pilots across both SVS conditions penetrated the clouds and continued to their destination in zero visibility conditions.

50|$|A <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>display</b> {{is a type}} of {{navigation}} system output that, instead of numerically displaying the current geographical coordinates determined by the navigation unit or an heading and distance indication of a certain waypoint, displays the unit's current location {{at the center of a}} map. As the unit moves around and new coordinates are therefore determined, the map moves to keep its position at the center of the display. Mechanical moving map displays using paper charts were first introduced in the 1950s, and became common in some roles during the 1960s. Mechanically moved paper maps were replaced by digital maps during the 1970s and 80s, with resolution and detail improving along with computer imagery and the computer memory systems that held the data. A common example of a <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> <b>display</b> today is the map display in a smart phone, which uses GPS to determine its current position and then recalls the map data from the device's memory or from the Internet in real time.|$|E

RNAV type systems have also been made to use two VORs or two DMEs to define a waypoint; these are typically referred to by other names such as [...] "distance computing equipment" [...] for the dual-VOR type or [...] "DME-DME" [...] for the type using more than one DME signal.|$|R
50|$|The DASS {{includes}} electronic {{support measures}} (ESM) and equipped with radar-warning-receivers (RWR). The RWR is designed to detect threat radars using super heterodyne, digital receiver antennas which are located into the wing tip pods giving full 360° coverage with an accuracy better than 1° in azimuth. These passive antennas can identify radio frequencies of 100 MHz up to 10 GHz, which is sufficient to detect nearly types of radar systems and even to detect other RF sources such as radios or datalink systems. The data is compared with the database of radar signatures stored in the Electronic Support Measures suite (ESM). Using this information the ESM allows {{the identification of the}} radar and thus the platform its deployed and presents it on a <b>moving</b> <b>map</b> or multifunction <b>display</b> producing a 360° threat picture around the aircraft including identifying targets and even their zones of lethality. This allows the pilot to fly around these zones to avoid detection or being engaged. Thus the system not only warns a pilot but it helps him to look out for potential targets.|$|R
40|$|Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is {{a unique}} {{facility}} covering over 43 square miles. The Emergency Management and Response Office (EM&R) is required to respond, provide Incident Command (IC), and coordination for all Laboratory emergencies. This requires IC`s and support staff {{to respond to the}} actual scene of the incident. Since the IC is under numerous constraints and stress, the office wanted the capability of locating the EM&R vehicles on an electronic map. An automated vehicle location (AVL) system was required for the additional safety of the emergency response personal. The requirements for the AVL system include total automatic tracking and low cost. After careful consideration, it was determined that the most efficient and cost effective system would be based on packet radio technology as the transmission media. The location is determined by the Department of Defense Global Positioning System (GPS). The system that was designed and constructed required four components to be interfaced and communicate with each other. The first component was a GPS receiver which actually provides the location information, equipped with a digital interface to communicate location information remotely. The second component is a modem that interfaces the GPS digital interface information to a radio. The third component is the radio itself which allows for the actual information transfer from the remote GPS receiver and modem. The fourth component is the software package that provides <b>moving</b> <b>maps</b> and <b>displays</b> the vehicle location on that map. The equipment was all commercial off-the-shelf that only required proper integration and packaging for the AVL application.
