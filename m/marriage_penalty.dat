40|$|<b>Marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> are a {{controversial}} feature of many government policies. Empirical {{evidence of their}} behavioral effects is quite mixed. This is surprising because economic theory predicts {{that they should have}} an impact on the headship decision. We investigate the removal of <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> from the surviving spouse pensions of the Canadian public pension system in the 1980 s. These reforms provide a simple and transparent source of identification. Our results indicate that <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> can have large and persistent effects on marriage decisions. We also present evidence suggesting that it is individuals with characteristics correlated with greater wealth who respond to the penalties. ...|$|R

40|$|Low-income {{families}} with children receive large tax benefits from the Earned Income Tax Credit, while high income taxpayers receive large tax benefits from dependent exemptions (whose value is greater to those in higher tax brackets). In contrast, middle-income parents receive substantially smaller tax benefits associated with children. This U-shaped pattern of benefits by income, which we call the middle-class parent penalty,' not only raises issues of fairness; it also generates marginal tax rates and <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> for moderate income families that are as high or higher than those facing more well-to-do taxpayers. This paper documents how the tax benefits of children vary with income, and illustrates their impact on marginal tax rates and <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties.</b> It then examines five options for reducing or eliminating the middle-class parent penalty and the high marginal tax rates and <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> it produces. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{offers a}} brief {{examination of the}} key policy issues surrounding the EITC and <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties.</b> The EITC is designed to support low income working families with children. It provides a subsidy (up to $ 3, 816 in 1999) for families with children and low earnings. Current {{research shows that the}} EITC has been successful in raising the income of such families, increasing rewards/incentives to work among many low skill workers, and in stimulating greater work effort by single parents. 2 A less well understood feature of the EITC is its impacts on marriage incentives. The EITC can generate sizable marriage bonuses for some couples and <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> for others precisely because it is targeted on low-income families with children. Those with no children or no earnings qualify for little or nothing. And because benefits are phased out as family income rises, those with children and high earnings also get little or nothing. Thus it creates marriage rewards for couples where a non-working mother is considering marriage to a working man without children. "Her " children and "his " earnings allow them to qualify for the EITC when neither would qualify otherwise. Conversely, when a single parent is already working and qualifying for the full EITC, marriage to another worker will usually result in an EITC penalty...|$|R
40|$|How did family {{characteristics}} affect {{women and}} men differently in self-employment participation in urban China? Analyses of national data show dual <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> for women. Marketization made married women more vulnerable to lay-offs from state-sector jobs; their likelihood of being pushed into unskilled self-employment surpassed {{that of any other}} groups. The revitalized patriarchal family tradition favored men in family businesses and resulted in their higher rates of entering entrepreneurial self-employment. Married women who had the education to pursue entrepreneurial self-employment were constrained by family responsibilities to state-sector jobs for access to family services, and had much lower rates in entering self-employment...|$|R
25|$|Cases {{became so}} {{complicated}} that a special assize, the Assize of Utrum {{was established in}} the middle of the 12th century. Jurisdiction would normally lie in the Ecclesiastic Courts. The Assize of Utrum, especially as defined in the Constitutions of Clarendon, 1164, gave the Crown a chance to clarify difficult questions of ownership and duty in a non-religious, secular court. Often, ownership was of less importance than in determining who had rights to grain, knight service, <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> and the like. These duties were defined in the manner in which the land had been granted, and by whom in the feudal chain. Frequently land would be donated to a church organization and re-let to the grantor to avoid feudal services to the great lord.|$|R

The combined plateau and phase-out range for married filing jointly is still not double that for single filers, and thus there still is a <b>marriage</b> <b>penalty,</b> just less than there used to be.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effects of}} the <b>{{marriage}}</b> <b>penalty</b> on the marriage income collectively are also particularly acute for these marriages, although for couples for whom the standard deduction, the 15% bracket, and the Earned Income Tax Credit apply, there are some <b>marriage</b> <b>penalty</b> relief measures that were extended in 2012. [...] The EITC still discourages two-earners and marriage, however. Two-earner families with incomes above $130,000 also save taxes by not being married.|$|E

This result reflects an increase in net government revenues (increased income taxes due to <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> more than offsetting decreased tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes). Marriage recognition would increase the government expenses for Social Security and Federal Employee Health Benefits but that increase would be more than made up for by decreased expenses for Medicaid, Medicare, and Supplemental Security Income.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the consequences of}} happiness research for taxation. It focuses on the finding that happiness depends on status as well as income, examining how adding status concerns to standard optimal tax models changes the results.

The paper also looks at Robert Frank's arguments for a progressive consumption tax based on the findings of the happiness research. It finds that these claims are not supported by the current models or empirical data. Finally, the paper considers a number of other potential implications of happiness research for taxation, including <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> or bonuses, special tax rates for the disabled, and age-dependent taxation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a computer simulation of the expected present value of benefits, taxes, and transfers, rates of return, and marginal linkage of benefits and taxes for persons of different income levels and family status. A number of important issues associated with the "deal" and incentives projected to be offered by the current social security system for different family situations are treated: married versus single persons, number of earners in the family and the division of earnings between them, and the special situation of widows and divorcees. The results show tremendous variation for different family situations and often dwarf amounts at stake for most families in the recent debates over income tax reform. We pay particular attention to items such as <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> and subsidies, incentives to postpone divorce and low marginal linkage of expected benefits to incremental taxes paid by women, whether as second earners in a family, divorcees or widows. ...|$|R

40|$|Although both <b>marriage</b> <b>{{penalties}}</b> and <b>marriage</b> bonuses {{exist at}} all income levels under the federal income tax, the system is tilted toward penalties for lower-income couples, toward bonuses for middle-income couples, and back toward penalties for upper income couples. This Article begins by explaining how the tax rules produce these differing treatments of marriage {{at different points in}} the income distribution. It then argues that the increase in recent decades in the social acceptability and prevalence of cohabitation makes tax marriage effects a more serious concern [...] in terms of both behavioral, effects and fairness-than in earlier decades. After demonstrating that Congress has never offered any justification for the differing tax treatments of marriage at different income levels, and that no plausible defense exists for the current distribution of penalties and bonuses, the Article offers several policy recommendations. The most basic and most important recommendation is simply that, whatever Congress does in this area, it should make conscious decisions about the appropriate distributions of penalties and bonuses at various income levels, instead of following its current practice of stumbling into a set of poorly understood and almost-impossible-to-defend effects...|$|R
