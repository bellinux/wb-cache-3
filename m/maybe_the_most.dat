2500|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{important}} injective module is the {{abelian group}} Q/Z.

So in particular, every abelian group is a subgroup of an injective one. It is quite significant that this is also true over any ring: every module is a submodule of an injective one, or [...] "the category of left R-modules has enough injectives."

2500|$|Curiosity {{about the}} victims {{led to the}} re-release of Tate's films, {{achieving}} greater popularity than they had in their initial runs. Some newspapers began to speculate on the motives for the murders. Some of the published photographs of Tate were allegedly taken at a Satanic ritual, but were later proven to have been production photographs from Eye of the Devil. Friends spoke out against the portrayal of Tate by some elements of the media. Mia Farrow said she was as [...] "sweet and pure a human being as I have ever known", while Patty Duke remembered her as [...] "a gentle, gentle creature. I was crazy about her, and I don't know anyone who wasn't." [...] Polanski berated a crowd of journalists at a press conference, saying that many times they had written that Tate [...] "was beautiful. <b>Maybe</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> beautiful woman in the world.

Furthermore, he stated the movie had [...] "lots of fun" [...] and praised the suspension bridge scene in particular, saying it [...] "is <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> astonishing scene of the whole film. It's a combination of desperation, suspense and great special effects as Roy Scheider and his partners try to maneuver a giant truck filled with nitrogliceryne {{through the heart of}} this jungle across a suspension bridge." [...] Moreover, he emphasized that Sorcerer was [...] "on a level way above most action pictures," [...] and called it [...] "a labor of love for director William Friedkin," [...] and even went as {{far as to say that}} [...] "the jungle scenes, the rain and flood, the fire catastrophe are among the most exciting scenes I've ever seen." [...] As far as the themes are concerned, his impression of Friedkin's intentions was that [...] "he wanted to show human behavior at its extremes; men in torment to complete a life-or-death mission against all odds and discovering their own limits at the same time." [...] Ebert considered Sorcerer one of the top 10 films of 1977.|$|E
2500|$|When Humboldt {{first began}} his studies of organisms and the {{environment}} he claimed {{that he wanted to}} [...] "reorganize the general connections that link organic beings and to study the great harmonies of Nature". He is often considered one of the world's first genuine ecologists. Humboldt succeeded in developing a comprehensive science that joined the separate branches of natural philosophy under a model of natural order founded on the concept of dynamic equilibrium. Humboldt's work reached far beyond his personal expeditions and discoveries. Figures from all across the globe participated on his work. Some such participants included French naval officers, East India Company physicians, Russian provincial administrators, Spanish military commanders, and German diplomats. Furthermore, as was aforementioned, Charles Darwin carried a copy of Humboldt's Personal Narrative aboard H.M.S. Beagle. Humboldt's projects, particularly those related to natural philosophy, {{played a significant role in}} the influx of European money and travelers to Spanish America in increasing numbers in the early 19th century. Sir Edward Sabine, a British scientist, worked on terrestrial magnetism in a manner that was certainly Humboldtian. Also, British scientist George Gabriel Stokes depended heavily on abstract mathematical measurement to deal with error in a precision instrument; certainly Humboldtian science. <b>Maybe</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prominent figure whose work can be considered representative of Humboldtian science, is geologist Charles Lyell. Despite a lack of emphasis on precise measurement in geology at the time, Lyell insisted on precision in a Humboldtian manner.|$|E

2500|$|The {{episode was}} {{unanimously}} acclaimed by critics, who largely praised the episode's complexity and writing. Ken Keeler won a 2011 Writer's Guild Award for writing [...] "The Prisoner of Benda." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review, rating it an A-. [...] Handlen compared the episode favorably {{to the season}} 4 episode [...] "The Farnsworth Parabox", writing, [...] "Really, this is pure silly from beginning to end, using the show's internal logic to arrive in unpredictable places, and bringing to life a piece of fan fiction I doubt anyone has ever {{had the courage to}} write. It reminded me more than a little of 'The Farnsworth Parabox': a premise that uses the whole cast to just the right amount." [...] Merrill Barr of Film School Rejects also gave the episode a positive review, praising the character development of Scruffy the Janitor in particular. With respect to the logic puzzle nature of the plot, Barr stated, [...] "I have never understood less {{of what was going on}} in a single episode of Futurama. And I couldn't have loved it more." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode 9.1/10. [...] He praised the intricate plot and writing, also comparing it to [...] "The Farnsworth Parabox" [...] and [...] "Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles", writing, [...] "...this sort of intertwined, Altman-esque plot offers up a level of complexity rarely offered by sitcoms, or any episodic television. 'The Prisoner of Benda' was a perfect example of how Futurama takes an extremely simple concept and executes it in a daring and unique way. It's not as showy as 'A Clockwork Origin' or 'The Late Philip J. Fry' from an animation standpoint, but with writing this tight we could be watching stick figures at 8 frames a second and it would still be worth seeing." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 9.5/10, stating [...] "'The Prisoner of Benda' was an absolutely stellar episode. The high-concept idea of switching minds/bodies was taking [...] to extremes and delivered fantastic lines and great laughs throughout." [...] In response to this episode UGO Entertainment critic Alex Zalben concluded that [...] "this season of Futurama, despite a miss or two, has hit what might possibly be a series high for the past few episodes, and I can't wait to watch the rest. Kudos to Comedy Central for bringing back what is now officially the best animated show on TV." [...] Alasdair Wilkins of io9 also praised the episode's mathematical complexity, saying [...] "This episode is <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> epically overstuffed Futurama episode ever, with only the intersecting ensemble piece [...] "Three Hundred Big Boys" [...] even coming close. 'The Prisoner of Benda' easily could have stretched out to a 70-minute DVD movie, but I'm just as happy to see it as 22 minutes of finely concentrated crazy."
