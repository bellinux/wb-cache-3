5|$|In Europe, cubeb {{was one of}} the {{valuable}} spices during the Middle Ages. It was ground as a seasoning for meat or used in sauces. A medieval recipe includes cubeb in making sauce sarcenes, which consists of almond milk and several spices. As an aromatic confectionery, cubeb was often candied and eaten whole. Ocet Kubebowy, a vinegar infused with cubeb, cumin and garlic, was used for meat <b>marinades</b> in Poland during the 14th century. Cubeb can still be used to enhance the flavor of savory soups.|$|E

25|$|Cochineal {{is one of}} the few {{water-soluble}} colourants {{to resist}} degradation with time. It {{is one of the}} most light- and heat-stable and oxidation-resistant of all the natural organic colourants and is even more stable than many synthetic food colours. The water-soluble form is used in alcoholic drinks with calcium carmine; the insoluble form is used in a wide variety of products. Together with ammonium carmine, they can be found in meat, sausages, processed poultry products (meat products cannot be coloured in the United States unless they are labeled as such), surimi, <b>marinades,</b> alcoholic drinks, bakery products and toppings, cookies, desserts, icings, pie fillings, jams, preserves, gelatin desserts, juice beverages, varieties of cheddar cheese and other dairy products, sauces, and sweets.|$|E
25|$|The retail {{environment}} {{not only}} affects quality perceptions, {{but can also}} impact on the way that customers navigate {{their way through the}} retail space during the retail service encounter. Layout, directional signage, the placement of furniture, shelves and display space along with the store's ambient conditions all affect patron's passage through the retail service system. Layout refers to how equipment, shelves and other furnishings are placed and the relationship between them. In a retail setting, accessibility is an important aspect of layout. For example, the grid layout used by supermarkets with long aisles and gondolas at the end displaying premium merchandise or promotional items, minimises the time customers spend in the environment and makes productive use of available space. The gondola, so favoured by supermarkets, {{is an example of a}} retail design feature known as a merchandise outpost and which refers to special displays, typically at or near the end of an aisle, whose purpose is to stimulate impulse purchasing or to complement other products in the vicinity. For example, the meat cabinet at the supermarket might use a merchandise outpost to suggest a range of <b>marinades</b> or spice rubs to complement particular cuts of meat. As a generalisation, merchandise outposts are updated regularly so that they maintain a sense of novelty.|$|E

500|$|Although L. indigo is a {{well-known}} edible species, opinions vary on its desirability. For example, American mycologist David Arora considers it a [...] "superior edible", while a field guide on Kansas fungi rates it as [...] "mediocre in quality". It may have a slightly bitter, or peppery taste, and has a coarse, grainy texture. The firm flesh is best prepared by cutting the mushroom in thin slices. The blue color disappears with cooking, and the mushroom becomes grayish. Because of the granular texture of the flesh, it does not lend itself well to drying. Specimens producing copious quantities of milk {{may be used to}} add color to <b>marinades.</b>|$|E
500|$|The first {{characteristic}} was {{a rejection}} of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and pâtés was greatly reduced {{in an attempt to}} preserve the natural flavors. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong <b>marinades</b> for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as espagnole and béchamel thickened with flour based [...] "roux", in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Seventh, they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of haute cuisine dishes. Eighth, new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. Ninth, the chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. Tenth and finally, the chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of Listeria in <b>marinade</b> used to inject fresh whole muscle poultry products poses {{a potential threat}} to processors. In an attempt to offer {{a solution to this}} problem, two representative samples (20 gallons each) of fresh poultry <b>marinade</b> solution were collected on two separate days from a USDA-inspected poultry processing facility and were shipped overnight to MCA Services (Rogers, AR) under refrigerated conditions. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the <b>marinade</b> solutions were inoculated with overnight cultures of Listeria innocua to a level (colony forming units) of 5. 0 logs per mL (Trial 1) or 6. 6 logs per mL (Trial 2) of <b>marinade</b> solution. The inoculated <b>marinade</b> was then passed through a Fresh Light ® 210 ultraviolet light system (Safe Foods Corporation, N. Little Rock, AR) for 20 minutes (flow rate = 8 gallons per minute and solution turnover time = 2. 5 minutes). Samples of the <b>marinade</b> were collected at 0, 2. 5, 5, 7. 5, 10, 12. 5, 15 and 17. 5 minutes which corresponded to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 passes through the ultraviolet light system. Aerobic Plate Count Petrifilm™ 3 was utilized to determine log reductions in Listeria innocua due to the ultraviolet light treatment. In both trials, after only 2. 5 minutes of ultraviolet light exposure (1 pass through the ultraviolet light system), a > 2. 2 log reduction was achieved in the level of the inoculated culture in the <b>marinade</b> solution. At 10 minutes of exposure (4 passes), a 4 log or greater reduction was achieved in both trials. After 15 minutes (5 passes), Listeria innocua could not be recovered from the <b>marinade</b> solution in either of the two trials (the lower detection level for the organism was 1 log colony forming unit per mL). Thus, in 15 minutes of ultraviolet light system exposure, the total level of Listeria innocua in the poultry <b>marinade</b> was reduced in linear fashion from 5 logs per mL (Trial 1) or 6 logs per mL (Trial 2) to less than 1 log per mL (no detectable organisms). This represents a > 99. 99 % to a > 99. 999 % reduction in the original starting level of inoculum in the poultry <b>marinade</b> solutions. In conclusion, the commercially available Fresh Light ® 210 ultraviolet light system (FDA regulated under 21 CFR 179. 39) offers an extremely effective means for controlling and eliminating the incidence and levels of Listeria innocua in poultry <b>marinade</b> solutions at a very low cost to the processor...|$|R
