40|$|Awareness is a {{preventive}} action {{to instill in}} individuals certain concepts to improve their health. It is an essential element {{in the prevention of}} sexually transmitted infection (STI) /HIV and early pregnancies among adolescents. In 2012, the prevalence of HIVin Cameroon was estimated at 4. 3 %. The young population appear to be the most affected (3. 2 %); very close to that of the Dschang Health District (Cameroon; 3. 1 %) in the 15 - 19 years age group. Theaimof this study was to evaluate the contribution of the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Caravan</b> project on the preventive aspect of STI/HIV/AIDS among youths of Dschang in 10 secondary schools within three years. 2029 students joined the project’s activities and 58. 55 % of them belonged to the age group of 16 - 21 years. Most students attended private schools. Nearly 3 / 4 of students (1515 / 2029) had an acceptable level of knowledge regarding STI/HIV/AIDS, which increased in number each year (from 641 to 716 students between 2012 and 2014). The Level of knowledge was significantly determinedby the study cycle (P= 0. 0004), the type of school (P= 0. 0027) and the year ofimplementation of activities (P= 0. 0026). The caravan project has greatly contributed to improving young peoples’ awareness on STI/HIV/AIDS in Dschang Municipality...|$|E

50|$|The {{program was}} {{launched}} at the plenary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party of 3-5 March 1949, where a resolution regarding socialist transformation of agriculture was adopted {{along the lines}} of the Soviet kolkhoz. The collectivization strategy covered two directions: model collective structures were set up, such as Gospodării Agricole Colective (GAC; Collective Agricultural Institutions) and Gospodării Agricole de Stat (GAS; State Agricultural Institutions), aimed at attracting peasants; and the full propaganda system (newspapers, radio, <b>mobile</b> <b>caravans,</b> brochures, direct action by agitators) was put in motion in order to convince peasants to form collective farming units. A problem that the Party encountered with written propaganda was the high rate of illiteracy amongst the Romanian peasantry. In order to combat this, the Party engaged in a campaign to increase literacy amongst the peasants.|$|R

50|$|The National Caravan Council {{estimates}} that the caravan industry which includes motorhomes, touring caravans (caravans designed to be hitched to a car and towed to a site) and static <b>caravans</b> and <b>mobile</b> homes (<b>caravans</b> designed to be transported to a permanent site, where they are anchored to the ground) is now worth over £1bn (€1.5bn/US$1.7bn) to the British economy alone with the manufacture of caravans worth in excess of £650m (€975bn/US$1.1bn). The growth in popularity of caravanning has been enhanced by improvements in caravan quality and caravan site facilities making caravan holidays possible {{at any time of}} the year not just summer months.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{book review}} of Parkland– when caravan is home. Newton {{provides}} an enticing glimpse into a rarely explored world. Sociologically informed and using an interpretive and interactionist approach, Newton (2014) strives to understand how individuals living in caravan parks invest sense and purpose into their lives. Caravan park living is an increasingly {{important part of the}} Australian permanent housing rental market and includes traditional <b>caravans,</b> <b>mobile</b> homes, manufactured and relocatable homes which may be leased from the park owner/operator or supplied by the resident. Newton’s research debunks the myth that residents are a significantly disadvantaged group living on the fringes of homelessness and experiencing multiple social, emotional and economic problems. Her interviews indicate a hierarchy of tenants within the parks. Central to {{this is the type of}} rental agreement entered into with park management - rental of the land only or building and land, and size of the mobile home...|$|R
40|$|Summary  The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in indigenous South American Indians. A total of 140 consecutive indigenous Indians (69 Quechua and 71 Colorado) attending a <b>mobile</b> dental health <b>caravan</b> in the Santo Domingo region of Ecuador were examined objectively and subjectively for signs and symptoms of TMD using a method similar to that used in previous studies. There was a prevalence of up to 41 % of at least one symptom. The Quechua Indians reported a significantly higher prevalence of difficulty in opening of the mouth and pain in front of the ears than the Colorado Indians. There was a prevalence of up to 63 % of at least one sign. The objective findings in the Colorado Indians were similar to those found to be present in a Scandinavian population and an Arab population in previous studies using similar methods. Signs and symptoms of TMD are common in Latin American Indians. Differences occur between different populations in the same geographical area...|$|R
40|$|Background. Blood {{donation}} {{is remarkably}} safe medical procedure. However, attitudes, beliefs, {{and level of}} knowledge may affect it. Objectives. To measure the level of knowledge regarding blood donation, find out positive and negative attitudes, identify the obstacles, and suggest some motivational factors. Methodology. A cross-sectional study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC). Participants were selected by convenient nonrandom sampling technique. A self-created questionnaire was used for data collection. Results. The study included 349 individuals. About 45. 8 % of the participants claimed {{that they have a}} history of blood donation. Reported causes for not donating blood were blood donation not crossing their mind (52. 4 %), no time for donation (45 %), and difficulty in accessing blood donation center (41. 3 %). Reported motivating factors for donating blood were one day off (81. 4 %), <b>mobile</b> blood donation <b>caravans</b> in public areas (79. 1 %), token gifts (31. 5 %), and finally paying money (18. 9 %). Conclusion. People in the age group 31 – 50 years, males, higher education and military were more likely to donate blood as well as People who showed higher knowledge level and positive attitude towards blood donation. More educational programs to increase the awareness in specific targeted populations and also to focus on some motivational factors are recommended...|$|R
5000|$|As {{far as the}} {{distribution}} of films is concerned, after the nationalization of movie theatres (only 35 mm ones, as 16 mm theatres did not exist), {{it was concluded that}} many had to be shut down because of their decaying state or because of their physically obsolete equipment. A crisis followed, there being a shortage of theatre administrators and projectionists that forced films in some counties to be shown only outdoors. This situation caused the Committee for Cinematography to be formed on 7 June 1950 alongside the Council of Ministers, and inside this institution the Film Distribution Network Directorate was established. Later, this office ran the County-level Cinematographic State Enterprises when they were established. The importance of these led to the allocation of funds necessary for the film distribution network to be developed. Implicitly, movie theatres and the establishment of 16 mm cinemas in rural areas were also a goal - together, these objectives were known as cineficare ("filmification", analogous to electrification). In the 1950s 1000 16 mm projectors and 100 film <b>caravans</b> (<b>mobile</b> theatres) were imported from the Soviet Union in order to promote the introduction of film into the rural environment. Reorganizations also took place in the next few years. Thus, in July 1952, Direcția Difuzării Filmelor (D.D.F.) (The Film Screening Directorate) was founded. In 1956 this was merged with the Film Distribution Network Directorate to form Direcția Rețelei Cinematografice și a Difuzării Filmelor (D.R.C.D.F) (The Film Distribution and Screening Directorate), under the guidance of the Ministry of Culture. The purpose of this institution was to promote a single policy regarding Romania's movie theatres, [...] "the control and guidance of political-ideological work with the cinema, the showing of films based on the political-technical demands of the various stages of the construction of socialism", as well as to craft the economical-financial plan to be fulfilled.|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a qualitative data collection. The overall objective {{of the project was}} to explore how people perceive their ability to develop and sustain their choice of lifestyle in non-permanent accommodation. The 2001 Census highlighted a range of accommodation that can be defined as non permanent, including <b>caravans,</b> <b>mobile</b> homes and boats. This project focused upon the role that park homes and residential boats played in housing markets from residents' perspectives, and explored meanings of home for people who live in accommodation that can be defined as mobile in some way. To a certain degree the term 'mobile home' is a misleading one in relation to park homes. They are mobile {{to the extent that they}} are factory-made units that are transported to the parks where they are to be sited. Further, legally, park homes are required to remain potentially mobile, and although park homes are mounted on a chassis with wheels, a brick skirt around the base of the park home usually hides this aspect of their appearance. In contrast, boats have the potential for genuine mobility. There is a huge variety of boats that are occupied permanently as homes, and most can move under their own power. The research used semi-structured qualitative interviews to examine a range of issues with residents and key stakeholders. These interviews investigated perceptions of the constraints and opportunities for people who live in park homes and residential boats, presented within the wider policy and institutional context. Further, the motivations of respondents for choosing these types of accommodation were examined, and how far choice or constraint in the housing market had played a part in their decision making. The interviews also explored the subsequent experiences of respondents, including their future aspirations as well as their perceptions of the image of their homes amongst the general public and also statutory agencies. Further information about the project may be found on the ESRC Award web pages. Main Topics : The qualitative views and experiences of people living in park homes and residential boats, including: reasons and motivations for choosing their homes; views and experiences of their current home and locality; future aspirations...|$|R
40|$|Mark Gregory {{discusses}} in The Conversation {{the importance}} of wi-fi on international and domestic aircrafts during travel.. The trial of in-flight Wi-Fi on six Qantas Airbus A 380 s flying between Melbourne, Los Angeles and London has ended, following an announcement by the carrier last week. So why does this matter? And could the National Broadband Network (NBN) come to the rescue, at least in Australia? Well, hypothetically, but before we get there … If you’ve been through an Australian airport recently you {{would have seen the}} large number of Qantas billboards publicising the Wi-Fi service, a service that was offered free to first- and business-class passengers who have a Wi-Fi-enabled device. Premium economy passengers could also access the Wi-Fi service but needed to purchase data packs during the flight. Qantas launched the Wi-Fi trial in March utilising a system provided by OnAir, an IT services company, and the Inmarsat “SwiftBroadband” service. This service connects the aircraft to a satellite which relays data to and from the internet via a ground station. So, what went wrong? Cost One important factor was the high cost of the Wi-Fi service. The cost for data varied between 12. 90 and 39. 90 for data packs of up to 35 MB. According to Vodafone the 39. 90, 35 MB data pack used on a smartphone would let you watch a 15 -minute YouTube video, send or receive roughly 1, 000 emails (without attachments), or browse 150 webpages. A 35 Optus mobile phone plan provides 200 MB of included data, 200 included mobile calls and unlimited national SMS. By contrast, an in-home ADSL 2 + service offered by TPG or iiNet provides about 100 GB for 39. 95. That’s roughly 3, 000 times the amount of data, for the same price as Qantas 2 ̆ 7 Wi-Fi offering. Time of flight A Qantas spokesperson was last week quoted as saying: most of our A 380 services operate at night and so another dampener on demand was the fact people preferred to sleep than surf the web. Qantas long-haul flights that operate at night are geared towards customers being encouraged to sleep for {{a large portion of the}} flight. The editor of Australian Business Traveller, David Flynn last week reviewed Qantas’s Wi-Fi and reported that customers used the data allowance very quickly. Flynn queried the value of the Wi-Fi service when he said: They’ve just introduced refinements such as doonas into international business class. What the free Wi-Fi trial shows is that business travellers would prefer a better sleep than being connected in-flight. Competitors Two airlines that offer Wi-Fi services on long-haul flights to and from Australia are Singapore Airlines and Emirates. The Emirates Wi-Fi service on its Airbus A 380 s is provided with a charge of US 15 (A 14. 10) for 25 MB or US 25 (A 23. 90) for 100 MB using a notebook or US 7. 50 (A 7. 20) for 5 MB for mobile phones. Singapore Airlines’s Wi-Fi service is available on selected flights with pricing ranging from US 25 (A 23. 90) for 30 MB and US 10 (A 9. 50) for 10 MB. Emirates’ research is reported to have found three-quarters of all in-flight net use is during the “awake” hours of the flight. So what about airline Wi-Fi services within Australia? Providing Wi-Fi services on planes operating domestic routes is just as problematic as for the long-haul international routes. The availability of satellites that can be used for domestic airline Wi-Fi services is limited and the cost would be similar to that for international flights. If we can assume – the arguments about whether people would rather be sleeping notwithstanding – Wi-Fi access on domestic routes will increasingly seen as desirable, there is a solution standing right in front of us. NBN satellite-connected Wi-Fi services NBN Co is launching two satellites in 2015 to support remote customer connections to the National Broadband Network (NBN). A criticism I made of the NBN in an earlier article on The Conversation is the decision not to cater for moving vehicles such as planes, trains and buses – all part of important national transport systems. The NBN satellites could be used to provide low-cost reliable Wi-Fi services to domestic planes and interstate trains and buses. When the NBN legislation was drawn up in 2011 there seemed to have been a decision made to limit the NBN and ensure mobile operators were the only providers available for broadband connections to cars, trucks, <b>caravans,</b> <b>mobile</b> homes, planes, trains and buses. In my opinion, the government and the opposition need to revisit this decision and agree to change the legislation so that the NBN satellites can be used to provide Wi-Fi services on domestic planes and interstate trains and buses. There is a strong economic justification for doing this as it will ensure the satellites are an economic success and it will provide a social dividend to the travelling public who will have domestic access to Wi-Fi on interstate or long-distance domestic routes. But if we want this to happen we need to act fast. Why? Satellites provide coverage to large areas by using many antennae that focus on slightly overlapping regions of varying size. Each region is allocated data capacity and the total capacity of the satellite is equivalent to the sum of the capacity allocated to the regions. When the satellite design is completed and the satellite launched the antenna region coverage and capacity cannot be varied. For this reason, it’s time to act now.
