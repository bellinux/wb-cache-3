50|$|Anti-dumping {{investigations}} are to end immediately {{in cases where}} the authorities determine that the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> is, de minimis, or insignificantly small (defined as less than 2% of the export price of the product). Other conditions are also set. For example, the investigations also have to end if the volume of dumped imports is negligible (i.e., if the volume from one country is less than 3% of total imports of that product—although investigations can proceed if several countries, each supplying less than 3% of the imports, together account for 7% or more of total imports).|$|E
50|$|The current set of {{anti-dumping}} laws in India {{is defined}} by Section 9A and 9B of Customs and Tariffs Act, 1975 (Amended 1995) and The Anti-dumping rules such as (Identification, Assessment and Collection of Anti-dumping Duty on Dumped Articles and for Determination of Injury) Rules of 1995, Section 9A of customs and tariffs Act 1975 states that “If any article is exported from any country or territory to India at less than its normal value, then, upon the importation of such article into India, the central government may by notification in the official gazette, impose an anti-dumping duty not exceeding the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> in relation to such article.” As of November 28, 2016, 353 anti-dumping cases has been initiated by Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) out of which in one hundred and thirty cases, anti-dumping measures are in force. On January, 2017, the Indian government imposed anti-dumping duty on colour coated steel products imported from the European Union and China for 6 months.|$|E
40|$|This work {{contains}} two separate essays. The first essay, 2 ̆ 2 International Patent Length Setting with Shelving Behavior 2 ̆ 2 looks at government choices in patent lengths when invention of a basic technology is distinguished from invention of applications of that technology. The choice of patent length {{in each country}} is shown to depend on relative ability at 2 ̆ 2 applied 2 ̆ 2 vs. 2 ̆ 2 basic 2 ̆ 2 R 2 ̆ 6 D. A country which is relatively superior at 2 ̆ 2 applied 2 ̆ 2 R 2 ̆ 6 D will choose a shorter patent length than a country which is relatively superior at 2 ̆ 2 basic 2 ̆ 2 R 2 ̆ 6 D. If one country can impose its own choice of patent length on another country, it will choose a length that closely resembles its own. When both countries choose to have a finite length patent, but are different in their relative abilities in K 2 ̆ 6 D, a single global patent length will lie between those of the two countries. ^ The second essay, 2 ̆ 2 Equilibrium Dumping with Endogenous Anti-dumping Penalties, 2 ̆ 2 looks at anti-dumping law and its effects. In this paper, price discrimination {{is the basis for}} a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping.</b> We use a Cournot duopoly model where profits are dependent on past and future <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping.</b> The model is used to investigate the observed phenomenon of a continuation of intercountry price differences in the face of uncertain anti-dumping penalties. A foreign firm is subject to an anti-dumping fine, where the probability of incurring the fine {{and the size of the}} fine are determined by the previous period 2 ̆ 7 s <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping.</b> In a non-cooperative infinitely repeated game the Markov Perfect Equilibrium can lead to a continuing <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping.</b> Anti-dumping laws that force price equalization, under these conditions are shown to be equivalent to an exclusion of the foreign firm from the market. ...|$|E

40|$|The United States International Trade Commission [USITC or Commission] is an independent, nonpartisan, {{quasi-judicial}} {{federal agency}} established by Congress {{with a wide}} range of trade-related mandates. One of its most important roles is to make certain determinations and findings with respect to unfair trade practices. The Commission's most active responsibility its to make determinations as to whether United States [US] industries are materially injured by reason of imports that benefit from pricing at less than fair value [LTFV] (antidumping [AD] investigations) or from subsidization (countervailing duty [CVD] investigations). Under US AD and CVD investigation procedures, the Commission only makes the determination of injury whereas the US Department of Commerce [Commerce] is charged with determining whether the dumping or subsidization exists and, if so, the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> or amount of the subsidy. Other important functions for the Commission have included making recommendations to the President regarding relief for industries seriously injured by increasing imports; and advising the President whether agricultural imports interfere with price-support programs of the US Department of Agriculture [USDA] (Section 22 investigations). This paper describes the role of the Commission in making determination...|$|E
40|$|On December 10, 2001 the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC) imposed steep {{antidumping}} duties against honey {{imports from}} Argentina and China ranging from 32. 6 percent to 183. 8 percent, and a countervailing duty against Argentina of 5. 9 percent. A previous antidumping investigation in 1995 {{ended with a}} suspension"agreement"that curtailed U. S. imports from China by around 30 percent. Millions of beekeepers around the world, most of them poor, make a living from honey production, and a free and competitive world market would help raise their standards of living. Nevertheless, the sequential pattern of increasing and widening protectionism followed by the United States, the world's top importer, to include successful exporters under the effects of its contingent protection measures sends a clear message that other countries should think twice before investing in expanding honey exports to the United States. In addition to looking into the trade effects of these contingent protection measures, the author concludes that under the regulatory arrangements of the DOC, Argentina's beekeepers {{never had a chance}} of defending themselves. For example, responding to the DOC's lengthy and sophisticated questionnaires that sought to determine cost of production went beyond the capacities of poor beekeepers. In the absence of information, the DOC resorted to evidence presented by the petitioners which was riddled with errors. The available evidence suggests that had beekeepers been capable of responding to the questionnaires, the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> would had been lower, if at all existent. This and other evidence discussed by the author suggest the urgent need to introduce reforms into the World Trade Organization antidumping and subsidy agreements. At the minimum what is required is a consensus that all respondents be given the same opportunity by the international trade rules. The author argues that at present {{this is not the case}} and offers suggestions for reforms.

60|$|We wandered to and fro. We searched among that {{drift of}} lumber- wood and iron, nails and rails, and {{sleepers}} and {{the wheels of}} tracks. We gazed up the cleft into the bosom of the mountain. We sat by the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dump</b> and saw, far below us, the green treetops standing still in the clear air.

60|$|There was no stove, of course, and no hearth in our lodging, so we betook {{ourselves}} to the blacksmith's forge across the platform. If the platform {{be taken as a}} stage, and the out-curving <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dump</b> to represent the line of the foot-lights, then our house would be the first wing on the actor's left, and this blacksmith's forge, although no match for it in size, the foremost on the right. It was a low, brown cottage, planted close against the hill, and overhung by the foliage and peeling boughs of a madrona thicket. Within it was full of dead leaves and mountain dust, and rubbish from the mine. But we soon had a good fire brightly blazing, and sat close about it on impromptu seats. Chuchu, the slave of sofa- cushions, whimpered for a softer bed; but the rest of us were greatly revived and comforted by that good creature-fire, which gives us warmth and light and companionable sounds, and colours up the emptiest building with better than frescoes. For a while it was even pleasant in the forge, with the blaze in the midst, and a look over our shoulders on the woods and mountains where the day was dying like a dolphin.|$|R
60|$|But {{the extreme}} {{roughness}} of the walking confined us in common practice to the platform, and indeed to {{those parts of}} it that were most easily accessible {{along the line of}} rails. The rails came straight forward from the shaft, here and there overgrown with little green bushes, but still entire, and still carrying a truck, which it was Lloyd's delight to trundle to and fro by the hour with various ladings. About midway down the platform, the railroad trended to the right, leaving our house and coasting along the far side within a few yards of the madronas and the forge, and not far off the latter, ended in a sort of platform on the edge <b>of</b> the <b>dump.</b> There, in old days, the trucks were tipped, and their load sent thundering down the chute. There, besides, was the only spot where we could approach the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dump.</b> Anywhere else, you took your life in your right hand when you came within a yard and a half to peer over. For at any moment the dump might begin to slide and carry you down and bury you below its ruins. Indeed, the neighbourhood of an old mine is a place beset with dangers. For as still as Silverado was, at any moment the report of rotten wood might tell us that the platform had fallen into the shaft; the dump might begin to pour into the road below; or a wedge slip in the great upright seam, and hundreds of tons of mountain bury the scene of our encampment.|$|R
