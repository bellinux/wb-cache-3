40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{widespread}} growth of shopping and buying on mobile devices, termed <b>mCommerce.</b> With this comes a {{need to understand how}} to best design experiences for mobile shopping. To help address this, we conducted a diary and interview study with <b>mCommerce</b> shoppers who have already adopted the technology and shop on their mobile devices regularly. Our study explores typical <b>mCommerce</b> routines and behaviours along with issues of soft trust, given its long-term concern for eCommerce. Our results describe spontaneous purchasing and routine shopping behaviours where people gravitate to their mobile device even if a computer is nearby. We found that participants faced few trust issues because they had limited access to unknown companies. In addition, app marketplaces and recommendations from friends offered a form of brand protection. These findings suggest that companies can decrease trust issues by tying <b>mCommerce</b> designs to friend networks and known marketplaces. The caveat for shoppers, however, is that they can be easily lured into a potentially false sense of trust. Author Keywords Mobile; commerce; trust; shoppin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{focus of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} solutions that shall enhance the security of remote client authentication for <b>mCommerce</b> applications on phones such as Smartphones or Tablet-PCs. This thesis details three innovative authentication schemes developed {{during the course of}} this study. These schemes are based on the use of localisation and obfuscation techniques in combination with multi-factor authentication to enforce the knowledge of "who, when, where and how" necessary for any remote client authentication attempt. Thus, assuring the <b>mCommerce</b> service provider about the genuine client as well as ensuring correct capturing and processing of the client's authentication data on the remote phone. The author of this thesis believes that these schemes, when developed on commercial <b>mCommerce</b> applications, shall enhance the service provider's trust into the received client data and therefore shall encourage more service providers to offer their <b>mCommerce</b> services via phone applications to their clients. The first proposed scheme, called MORE-BAILS, combines multiple authentication factors into a One-Time Multi-Factor Biometric Representation (OTMFBR) of a client, so to achieve robust, secure, and privacy-preserving client authentication. Tests and trials of this scheme proved that it is viable for use in the authentication process of any type of <b>mCommerce</b> phone applications. The second and third schemes, called oBiometrics and LocAuth respectively, use a new obfuscated-interpretation approach to protect the mComrnerce application against misuse by attackers as well as to ensure the real-time and one-time properties of the client's authentication attempt. The novelty of combining biornetric-based keys with obfuscated-interpretation tightly binds the correct <b>mCommerce</b> application execution to the genuine client. Furthermore, integration of the client's current location and real-time in the LocAuth challenge / response scheme eliminates the risk that an attacker can illegitimately re-use previously gathered genuine client authentication data in a replay attack. f Based on appropriate criteria, the MORE-BAILS, oBiometrics and LocAuth levels of security, user-friendliness and algorithms' ease-of-implementation are proven m experiments and trials on state-of-the-art Android-based Smartphones.

40|$|Secure {{wireless}} connectivity between mobile {{devices and}} financial/commercial establishments is mature, {{and so is}} the security of remote authentication for <b>mCommerce.</b> However, the current techniques are open for hacking, false misrepresentation, replay and other attacks. This is {{because of the lack of}} real-time and current-precise-location in the authentication process. This paper proposes a new technique that includes freshly-generated real-time personal biometric data of the client and present-position of the mobile device used by the client to perform the <b>mCommerce</b> so to form a real-time biometric representation to authenticate any remote transaction. A fresh GPS fix generates the "time and location" to stamp the biometric data freshly captured to produce a single, real-time biometric representation on the mobile device. A trusted Certification Authority (CA) acts as an independent authenticator of such client's claimed real time location and his/her provided fresh biometric data. Thus eliminates the necessity of user enrolment with many <b>mCommerce</b> services and application providers. This CA can also "independently from the client" and "at that instant of time" collect the client's mobile device "time and location" from the cellular network operator so to compare with the received information, together with the client's stored biometric information. Finally, to preserve the client's location privacy and to eliminate the possibility of cross-application client tracking, this paper proposes shielding the real location of the mobile device used prior to submission to the CA or authenticators...|$|E

The results indicate a rather low willingness to use mobile services in general, but an exceptionally high willingness to use certain applications.

40|$|This {{research}} project investigates the requirements or factors that will influence <b>mcommerce</b> adoption in low-income markets. The framework incorporated awareness, availability, convenience, affordability and acceptability as variables for m-commerce adoption in low-income markets. Mobile commerce {{is the next}} step in the evolution of networked computing and is the utilisation of mobile communication for financial gain. In South Africa, the fast rate of mobile technology adoption has created an access footprint for <b>mcommerce</b> across the country. Businesses are adopting m-commerce into their business strategies to tap into these new markets. Recently the potential commercial benefit in low-income markets is being explored by business. In South Africa the low-income market has been characterised by the foundation tier of the economic pyramid. Although this market is seen as extremely price sensitive and has little to no disposable income, the collective potential of it is considerable. The research found that certain aspects of the framework were applicable. Awareness, knowledge and acceptability were seen to have the highest association with m-commerce adoption in the low-income market. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|A general {{belief is}} that Mobile Money (mMoney) has the {{catalytic}} effect of spurring <b>mCommerce</b> growth and driving financial inclusion in developing nations like Nigeria. In Nigeria, mMoney service is certainly a new financial service innovation in the country, {{and as a result}} critical issues surrounding its early critical mass adoption, including its perceived usefulness, remain largely opaque. In this paper, our aim was to explore factors influencing perceived usefulness of mMoney by using the extended technology acceptance model (TAM) as the theoretical underpinning of our work. This work is based on a usable sample of 127 respondents from two major cities in Nigeria. Overall, the study’s results indicate that perceived regulator assurance, service affordability, convenience, proximity to the nearest bank branch, and worry over ease of use are significant predictors of mMoney perceived usefulness. The work helps shed new insights about the significant factors that are closely related to the consumer’s perception of the relevance of mMoney services (to his/her financial needs).
