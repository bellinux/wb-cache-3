2500|$|MRI {{scanners}} {{have become}} significant sources of revenue for healthcare providers in the US. This {{is because of}} favorable reimbursement rates from insurers and federal government programs. Insurance reimbursement is provided in two components, an equipment charge for the actual performance and operation of the MRI scan and a professional charge for the radiologist's review of the images and/or data. [...] In the US Northeast, an equipment charge might be $3,500/€2.600 and a professional charge might be $350/€260, although the actual fees received by the equipment owner and interpreting physician are often significantly less and depend on the rates negotiated with insurance companies or determined by the Medicare fee schedule. For example, an orthopedic surgery group in Illinois billed a charge of $1,116/€825 for a knee MRI in 2007, but the Medicare reimbursement in 2007 was only $470.91/€350.

40|$|Background: Cerebral MRI {{performed}} on preterm infants at term-equivalent 30 weeks' gestational age (GA) is increasingly performed {{as part of}} standard clinical care. Objective: We evaluated safety of these earlyMRI procedures. Materials and methods We retrospectively collected data on patient safety of preterm infants who underwent early MRI scans. Data were collected at fixed times {{before and after the}} <b>MRI</b> scan. <b>MRI</b> <b>procedures</b> were carried out according to a comprehensive guideline. Results: A total of 52 infants underwent an MRI scan at 30 weeks' GA. Although no serious adverse events occurred and vital parameters remained stable during the procedure, minor adverse events were encountered in 26 infants (50 %). The MRI was terminated in three infants (5. 8 %) because of respiratory instability. Increased respiratory support within 24 h after the MRI was necessary for 12 infants (23. 1 %) and was significantly associated with GA, birth weight and the mode of respiratory support. Hypothermia (core temperature < 36 °C) occurred in nine infants (17. 3 %). Temperature dropped significantly after the MRI scan. Conclusion: Minor adverse events after <b>MRI</b> <b>procedures</b> at 30 weeks GA were common and should not be underestimated. A dedicated and comprehensive guideline for <b>MRI</b> <b>procedures</b> in preterm infants is essential...|$|R

50|$|When a night terror happens, it {{is typical}} {{for a person}} to wake up {{screaming}} and kicking {{and to be able to}} recognize what he or she is saying. The person may even run out of the house (more common among adults) which can then lead to violent actions. It has been found that some adults who have been on a long-term intrathecal clonidine therapy show side effects of night terrors, such as feelings of terror early in the sleep cycle. This is due to the possible alteration of cervical/brain clonidine concentration. In adults, night terrors can be symptomatic of neurological disease and can be further investigated through an <b>MRI</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The present {{case series}} with two {{patients}} explored whether virtual reality (VR) distraction could reduce claustrophobia symptoms during a mock {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) brain scan. Two patients who met DSM-IV criteria for specific phobia, situational type (i.e., claustrophobia) reported high levels of anxiety during a mock 10-min <b>MRI</b> <b>procedure</b> with no VR, and asked to terminate the scan early. The patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either VR or music distraction for their second scan attempt. When immersed in an illusory three-dimensional (3D) virtual world named SnowWorld, patient 1 was able to complete a 10-min mock scan with low anxiety and reported an increase in self-efficacy afterwards. Patient 2 received [...] "music only" [...] distraction during her second scan but was still not able to complete a 10-min scan and asked to terminate her second scan early. These results suggest that immersive VR may prove effective at temporarily reducing claustrophobia symptoms during MRI scans and music may prove less effective.|$|E

50|$|Researchers have {{utilized}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) scans to study patients via scanning their brains while the patients are being presented with the auditory stimulus of musical sounds. Patients were given other psychological and emotional perception-oriented tests that {{were related to the}} notion of money during the <b>MRI</b> <b>procedure</b> to effectively control the experiment for music or to isolate the effect or effects of the independent variable of music (i.e., in other words, to make sure they only showed no emotion while listening to music). The studies revealed that, relative to the average person, individuals whom are shown to exhibit this condition tend to have a significantly lesser degree of a connection in their brain between their auditory processing and reward center. MRI scans also showed that people with this condition have relatively little connection between the nucleus accumbens and auditory processing compared to the average person.

5000|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging or functional MRI (fMRI) is the specific <b>MRI</b> <b>procedure</b> associated with measuring brain activity. It does so by detecting changes in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to the energy utilization by the brain using a specific blood-oxygen-level-dependant contrast. Recently fMRI {{has come to the}} forefront of dream research because it does not require the use of dyes or isotopes and allows for brain blood flow and related activity to be monitored during sleep. Specifically analysis of dreaming patients have revealed increased blood flow/oxygen utilization by network consisting of the pontine tegmentum, thalamus, amygdala, basal ganglia, anterior cingulate and occipital cortex. [...] Specifically in CWS activation of the occipital cortex is of great interest and it can monitored through fMRI and combined with patient dream reporting to isolate dream formation. Additionally during sleep fMRI studies have revealed a significant decrease in the activity of the prefrontal cortex which likely accounts for the decrease in time perception, insight, and remembrance of dreams. [...] This can be analyzed in patients to help better differentiate between global dream loss and a lack of visual remembrance. The specific mechanism for deactivation of the prefrontal cortex is unclear due to the complexity of the acetylcholine activation pathway and its expanse into variety of other cortical areas.|$|E

50|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} over {{the interaction between}} magnetic resonance imaging (<b>MRI)</b> <b>procedures</b> and tattoo pigments, some of which contain trace metals. The magnetic fields produced by MRI machines interact with these metals, including nonferrous metal particles, and while rare, are capable of causing first-degree or second-degree burns or distortions in the image. The type and density of the ink as well as shape of the tattoo may increase the risk, particularly if the shape approximates an RF pick-up loop. The television show MythBusters tested the hypothesis, and found a slight interaction between commonly used tattoo inks and MRI. The interaction was stronger with inks containing high levels of iron oxide.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A new {{adjustable}} valve, the Codman Certas TM valve {{for treatment}} of hydrocephalus was introduced into clinical practice in January 2011. It has 8 different settings with an opening pressure varying from 36 to over 400 [*]mm H 2 O at a flow rate of 20 [*]mL/h. The 8 th setting {{is designed to provide}} a "virtual off" function. The objective of this report is to describe the initial clinical experience with the Certas TM valve and evaluate clinical usage with the main focus on the portable adjustment device - Therapeutic Management System (TMS), the “virtual off” setting and compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Findings Forty-two patients with hydrocephalus from different etiologies were treated with the Certas TM adjustable shunt system. Data regarding implantation procedures, the use of the TMS system, x-ray imaging, and <b>MRI</b> <b>procedures</b> were recorded prospectively. All patients had clinical follow-up at four weeks after implantation and every three months until a stable clinical condition was obtained. The mean time for follow-up was 8. 6 [*]months (1 – 16. 6). Seventy-one adjustments were performed with the TMS, 12 were problematic. Twenty-nine <b>MRI</b> <b>procedures</b> were performed and did not cause accidental resetting. Five patients were treated with the "virtual off" function for a period. Conclusions We found the Certas TM valve valuable in the treatment of hydrocephalus, usability of the TMS was high because it is small and portable, but in some cases we experienced adjustment problems with the first procedures performed by a surgeon, indicating that there is a learning curve. The "virtual off" function provided a possibility of treating over-drainage without the need for shunt ligation or other invasive procedures. </p...|$|R
30|$|A {{retrospective}} review identified 14 {{children under}} 3  years old that had required an MRI for a lower limb disorder, using TSCI.

30|$|There is {{practically}} no {{limitation of the}} TSCI. The younger the child, the more efficient plaster cast immobilization is. Older patients may cry or move the trunk, but most children sleep during the <b>MRI</b> <b>procedure.</b> In this series, only the affected limb was put in a cast, {{but it is still}} possible, although time consuming, to cast both sides if the child is moving too much. In two cases, where the cast was too soft, artifact movements were observed but did not impair the <b>MRI</b> <b>procedure.</b> Therefore, the cast should be fitted with a team used to the technique of spica cast immobilization. The only limitation is the topography of the disorder. The whole lower limb and the pelvis may be explored with this procedure but above the sacroiliac joints the risk of movement artifacts is too great.|$|E

40|$|AbstractInsula {{function}} {{has been}} associated with emotional regulation, adjusting to changing outcomes under risk, reward and loss anticipation, discounting of future rewards, and self-rated impulsivity. The role of the insula in these processes may be fundamentally related to prospective thinking, a trait that increases with age. There is evidence that insular cortical thickness shows age related decreases that parallel age related increases in future orientation and planning. We tested the hypothesis that nonplanning decreases with age and that insula thickness is related to both age and nonplanning impulsivity. Fifty-nine male and female participants, ranging in age from 10 to 22 years old, underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (<b>MRI)</b> <b>procedures</b> and were assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS).

This paper empirically examines {{the relationship between}} HMO market share and the diffusion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment. Across markets, increases in HMO market share are associated with slower diffusion of MRI into hospitals between 1983 and 1993, and with substantially lower overall MRI availability in and outside of hospitals in the mid and later 1990 s. High managed care areas also had markedly lower rates of <b>MRI</b> <b>procedure</b> use.

30|$|MRI {{has become}} the imaging {{reference}} for lower limb bone and cartilage disorders [1 – 3]. Applying <b>MRI</b> <b>procedures</b> to small children is hampered by the combination of patient noncooperation, rapid or irregular respiratory rate, and small-scale anatomy, meaning that very small movements can create motion artifacts that render images non-diagnostic. The conventional approach in very young children is to use general anaesthesia (GA). As with all GAs, this comes with inherent risks [4]. Whilst serious adverse effects of GA are rare, less serious adverse effects occur in approximately 0.4 – 1.5  % of cases [4]. Non-pharmacological strategies to reduce anxiety in children in preparation for MRI have also been described. These can broadly be categorized as play-based therapy [5], desensitization and cognitive behavior therapy [6 – 8]. The use of a mock MRI service is also effective in reducing GA rates [9]. But most of these procedures have been described in children older than 3  years as they require patient cooperation.|$|R
