5000|$|Tropaeolum tuberosum (<b>mashua,</b> {{see below}} for other names) is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} plant in the family Tropaeolaceae, grown in the Andes, particularly in Peru and Bolivia, {{and to a lesser}} extent in Ecuador as well as in Boyacá Department, Colombia, for its edible tubers, which are eaten cooked or roasted as a vegetable. It is a minor food source, especially to native Amerindian populations. <b>Mashua</b> is a herbaceous perennial climber growing to 2 - 4 m in height. It is related to garden nasturtiums, and is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental for its brightly coloured tubular flowers.|$|E

50|$|Yacón {{plants can}} grow to over 2 m in height and produce small, {{inconspicuous}} yellow flowers {{at the end}} of the growing season. Unlike many other root vegetables domesticated by the indigenous peoples of the Andes (ulluco, oca, and <b>mashua),</b> yacón is not photoperiod sensitive, and can produce a commercial yield in the subtropics, as well.|$|E
50|$|The major {{appeal of}} the ulluku is its crisp texture which remains even when cooked. Because of its high water content, the ulluku is not {{suitable}} for frying or baking {{but it can be}} cooked in many other ways like the potato. In the pickled form, it is added to hot sauces. Together with the <b>mashua</b> it is used the Colombian cuisine dish cocido boyacense.|$|E
50|$|The {{cultural}} practice {{is similar to}} potatoes. Planting is done in rows or hills 80-100 cm apart, with plants spaced 40-60 cm apart in the rows. Monoculture predominates, but interplanting with several other tuber species, including <b>mashua</b> and olluco, in one field is common in Andean production. Often this intercoppng consists of several different varieties of each species. Such mixed fields may later be sorted into tuber types during harvest or before cooking.|$|E
50|$|In {{its native}} range, <b>mashua</b> is mainly {{cultivated}} for its edible tubers, {{but it has}} ornamental value in the temperate zone because of its trailing habit and showy, bi-coloured tubular flowers, which appear in summer and autumn. The sepals are orange-red while the petals are bright yellow. In areas prone to frost, it requires some protection in winter. The cultivar T. tuberosum var. lineamaculatum 'Ken Aslet' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E

50|$|The plant grows vigorously even in {{marginal}} {{soils and}} it competes well with weeds. It is well-adapted to high-altitude subsistence agriculture, and gives high yields; 30 tonnes per hectare are yielded at {{a height of}} 3000 metres, but up to 70 tons per hectare have been produced under research conditions. Its extraordinary resistance to insect, nematode and bacterial pests is attributed {{to high levels of}} isothiocyanates. Although <b>mashua</b> is fully domesticated, it can persist in wild vegetation because of its aggressive growth and robustness.

40|$|Optimal {{conditions}} for the extraction of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, flavanols and ORAC antioxidant activity for two <b>mashua</b> genotypes were determined using the conventional liquid-solid method. Phenolic contents and antioxidant activity were affected {{by the type of}} solvent, pH level, solvent-water ratio and extraction time. In general, no significant differences in total phenolic recovery and ORAC values were observed when 90 % methanol or methanol/acetone/water (45 / 45 / 10), both with 0. 1 % HCl, were used. By contrast, the 90 % methanol solution with 0. 1 % HCl extracted the highest level of anthocyanins, whereas the solvent mixture extracted the highest level of flavanols. The purified extracts from the <b>mashua</b> genotypes presented total phenolics and ORAC contents within the ranges 14. 4 - 18. 7 mg gallic acid equivalents/g <b>mashua</b> dry matter (DM) and 221 - 359 mu mol of trolox equivalents/g <b>mashua</b> DNI, respectively. The HPLC-DAD phenolic profiles obtained for the purified phenolic extracts for both <b>mashua</b> genotypes showed differences in proportions (% total area at 280 and 520 nm) depending on the solvents selected in this study. The high content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity found in the purified extracts for both <b>mashua</b> genotypes indicated that <b>mashua</b> extracts might be considered as a potential source of nutraceuticals in the future.

40|$|<b>Mashua</b> (Tropaeolum tuberosum Ruiz and Pavon), an Andean tuber {{with high}} {{antioxidant}} activity, has sparked interest {{because of its}} traditional medicinal use. In this study, we evaluated the anthocyanin composition for three purple <b>mashua</b> genotypes and their contribution to the overall antioxidant activity of the tuber. <b>Mashua</b> anthocyanins, total phenolics, and 2, 2 '-azinobis(3 ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS) antioxidant activity ranged from 45. 5 to 131. 9 mg of cyanidin 3 -glucoside equivalents/ 100 g fresh weight (FW), 174. 9 to 275. 5 mg of gallic acid equivalents/ 100 g of FW, and 16. 2 to 45. 7 mu mol of Trolox equivalents/ g of FW, respectively. The high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI/MS-MS) profiles revealed the presence of 11 different anthocyanins. The two major pigments (56. 4 - 73. 0 % total area range at 520 nm) were identified as delphinidin 3 -glucoside- 5 -acetylrhamnoside and delphinidin 3 -sophoroside- 5 -acetylrhamnoside. Other pigments were delphinidin 3 -glucoside- 5 -rhamnoside, delphinidin 3 -sophoroside- 5 -rhamnoside, delphinidin 3 -glucoside, cyanidin 3 -sophoroside, and cyanidin 3 -sophoroside- 5 -rhamnoside. Cyanidin 3 -glucoside and cyanidin 3 -rutinoside were only found in two genotypes, while pelargonidin 3 -sophoroside and pelargonidin 3 -sophoroside- 5 -rhamnoside were only found in the third one. Anthocyanins from <b>mashua</b> were the major contributors to the total ABTS values for {{only one of the}} three genotypes, suggesting that other phenolics present are playing {{a major role in the}} antioxidant power of <b>mashua</b> tubers. Results from this study provide important information for the Nutraceutical and Functional Food Market for the use of <b>mashua</b> anthocyanins not only as a source of natural colorants but also as a source of phytonutrients...|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{targets for}} the {{majority}} of dietary phytochemicals remain unknown, presenting a challenge for the understanding of how these dietary components provide health benefits. Recently a new methodology, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), was developed for this purpose. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of <b>mashua</b> (Tropaeolum tuberosum) tuber and acerola leaf (Malpighia emarginata) extracts and to identify the protein targets of its phytochemicals by using DARTS methodology. The first aim was to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of <b>mashua</b> extracts and to identify the cellular targets of its phytochemicals. <b>Mashua</b> 203040 and 203081 extracts exerted anti-inflammatory properties in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Through DARTS methodology we identified pyruvate kinase M (PKM) as a potential target of the phytochemicals present in both extracts. Additionally, <b>mashua</b> extracts reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and consequently affected the expression of ROS dependent LPS-induced pro-inflammatory genes. LC-MS profiling revealed that both <b>mashua</b> extracts contained mainly phenolics and isothiocyantes. In this study, we demonstrated that phytochemicals from <b>mashua</b> reduce LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264. 7 macrophages by targeting PKM and reducing ROS. The second aim was to identify the bioactive compounds acting as COX- 2 inhibitors in acerola leaf by using bioassay-guided fractionation and DARTS methodology. The leaf extract (F 4) was fractionated into three fractions (F 1, F 2, and F 3) and results indicated that F 4, F 2, and F 3 inhibited COX- 2 activity. F 2 showed the highest COX- 2 inhibitory effect among the fractions, and also showed binding to COX- 2 by DARTS. Thus, its subfractions (F 2 A, F 2 B, and F 2 C) were further tested for their ability to bind and inhibit COX- 2 activity. All subfractions inhibited COX- 2 activity but only F 2 A and F 2 C showed binding by DARTS. F 2 C was further fractionated and only fraction F 2 C 4, containing terpenes, inhibited COX- 2 activity. In this study, we identify the group of compounds from acerola leaf, which are responsible for the inhibition of COX- 2 activity. In conclusion we were able to characterize many of the phytochemicals present in <b>mashua</b> tuber and acerola leaf and to identify the putative targets responsible for their anti-inflammatory effect in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Andean {{tuber crop}} species oca (Oxalis tuberosa Molina), ulluco (Ullucus tuberosus Caldas), and <b>mashua</b> (Tropaeolum tuberosum Ruiz & Pav.) play major roles in Andean communities. These species show high {{variability}} but are threatened with genetic erosion. To study {{the management of}} genetic resources of neglected vegetatively propagated crop species, we studied genetic diversity and structure of these species in an in situ diversity microcenter (Huanuco, Peru). A sample of 15 varieties of oca, 15 of ulluco, and 26 of <b>mashua</b> was analyzed with the inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) molecular markers. Mean genetic distances and global genetic diversities were high for the three species, with higher values for <b>mashua</b> than for oca and ulluco. Assignment technique divided both oca and ulluco samples into two genetic clusters; the <b>mashua</b> sample probably belongs to a single genetic cluster. Inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) technique showed intravarietal genetic variability for most varieties, suggesting an underestimation of the in situ genetic variability. These results are discussed considering how variation in breeding systems and farmers' practice influenced patterns of genetic diversity. Our findings confirm the hypothesis of {{a considerable amount of}} variability found in neglected Andean tubers and are essential to deserve adequate conservation strategies and to maintain genetic resources of neglected Andean tuber crop species under a threat of genetic erosion.

40|$|In Kenya, {{like other}} {{tropical}} countries, coastal artisanal fishery is multispecies, multigear and multifleet in nature with many management challenges. The Malindi-Ungwana Bay in particular, supports both the artisanal fishery and the semi-industrial {{bottom trawl shrimp}} fishery presenting a management challenge. Recent stock assessment surveys have identified catch composition of the semi-industrial bottom trawl fishery in the bay but artisanal catches remain barely described. This study describes, the artisanal fish catch composition (total number of species caught, sizes and trophic levels), and catch per-unit-effort (CPUE) {{for each of the}} most popular propulsion-gear categories used in the bay. We make a case that the use of specific propulsion-gear categories can be dynamically managed to encourage the recovery of selected fish groups and thus support fisheries management. A total of 4 269 finfish belonging to 177 species and 66 families were sampled by the 5 most popular propulsion-gear categories between 2009 and 2011. The total number of species caught was highest for canoe-gillnet, <b>mashua</b> -gillnet and foot-seine net, and lowest for foot-handline and <b>mashua</b> -handline. Significant differences in catch composition existed between the different propulsion-gear categories. The CPUE was not significantly different between propulsion-gear, although this was on the average highest for canoe-gillnet and mashua-gillnet, and lowest for the foot-handline. The highest trophic level of 4. 0 was recorded for <b>mashua</b> -gillnet and the lowest 3. 4 and 3. 2 for canoe-gillnet and foot-seine net respectively. The use of specific combinations of propulsion-gear categories, give an alternative approach in management recommendation of the coastal artisanal fisheries in the tropics, from the traditional gear-based management initiative. This study, singled out the <b>mashua</b> -gillnet, canoe-gillnet and foot-seine net as suitable units for monitoring the artisanal fisheries in Malindi Ungwana Bay since <b>mashua</b> -gillnet lands the highest mean trophic level and largest sized individuals, and canoe-gillnet and foot-seine net land the highest number of species caught and smallest sized individuals...|$|E
40|$|Qualitative high {{performance}} liquid chromatography with {{diode array detection}} (HPLC-DAD) was performed to characterize nonanthocyanin phenolic compounds in three different coloured <b>mashua</b> genotypes. The ORAC antioxidant activity contribution in the tubers related {{to the type of}} phenolic compounds present was also evaluated. Phenolic compounds were analysed by separating them into four main fractions: fraction I obtained by means of a liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate and fractions II, III and IV obtained by elution on a Sephadex LH- 20 column. Fraction I revealed the presence of gallic acid, gallocatechin, procyanidin 132 and epigallocatechin. Other phenolic compounds such as hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, rutin and/or myricetin derivatives were also present in fraction I. Fraction II was mainly composed of epicatechin, hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives. Fraction III presented mainly anthocyaDins for the purple coloured <b>mashua</b> tubers and rutin, hydroxycinnamic acid and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives for the yellow coloured genotype. Fraction IV was composed of proanthocyanidins. Alkaline and acid hydrolysis of the different fractions revealed the presence of gallocatechin, epicatechin, p-coumaric acid, o-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, protocatechuic acid, rutin and quercetin as the main phenolic moieties present. The proanthocyanidin fractions were the major contributors to the ORAC antioxidant activity of the <b>mashua</b> tubers for two of the three genotypes (34. 7 - 39. 2 %). The results obtained in the present study confirm that <b>mashua</b> tubers constitute a promising source of antioxidant phenolics and could potentially be considered as a functional food with beneficial health effects.

40|$|Purified <b>mashua</b> {{extracts}} (PME) {{from four}} different coloured <b>mashua</b> genotypes were assayed for oxidative damage prevention. Three in vitro assays for oxidative damage to biological structures rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as LDL and erythrocytes, were tested: AAPH-induced TBARS assay and CU 2 +-induced conjugated dienes assay for LDL oxidation and AAPH-induced oxidative hemolysis of erythrocytes. Additionally, ORAC antioxidant capacity, total phenolics (TP), total flavanoids (TFA) and total anthocyanins (TA) were evaluated. In {{the presence of}} 5 mu M of gallic acid equivalents (GAE), inhibitions of LDL oxidation for the PME ranged from 29. 1 % to 34. 8 % and from 51. 8 % to 58. 1 % when the TBARS and conjugated dienes assays were performed, respectively. PME inhibited the hemolysis of erythrocytes within the range 20. 8 - 25. 1 %. Thus, <b>mashua</b> phenolic extracts are capable of scavenging peroxyl radicals, as well as chelating redox metal ions in vitro. ORAC and LDL protection (TBARS and conjugated dienes assays) showed good correlations with the TP and TFA, suggesting that these compounds have a good ability to protect LDL molecules under the employed conditions. In contrast, inhibition of hemolysis did not show any correlation with the evaluated phenolic assays (TP, TA, TFA) or {{with any of the}} evaluated oxidative LDL assays, suggesting a specific action of some non-evaluated compounds present in the PME. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the <b>mashua</b> polyphenol extracts displayed good antioxidant properties against oxidative damage in biological structures rich in PUFA.

The tubers were obtained from a local grocery. The morphology of the starch granules (size and shape) was studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which revealed ellipsoid, oval, conical, pear-shaped and prismatic forms: ellipsoids and oval granules with lengths up to 54. 30 µm in oca; with lengths up to 32. 09 µm for olluco starch granules; and with predominantly truncated spherical or oval forms and smaller dimensions (up to 16. 29 um) for <b>mashua</b> starch granules. Amylose contents were similar among the samples: 27. 60 % (oca), 26. 49 % (olluco) and 27. 44 % (<b>mashua).</b> Olluco starch had less swelling power, forming opaque, less firm gels. All three starch gels showed the same stability on refrigeration and presented high syneresis under freezing temperatures, with a variation of 40. 28 to 74. 42 % for olluco starch. The starches cooked easily, with high peak viscosity.

40|$|<b>Mashua</b> (Tropaeolum tuberosum) is a vegetatively {{propagated}} {{tuber crop}} cultivated in the Andes. This study aims to determine mashua's genetic diversity and structure, which {{have never been}} investigated until now. Sixty-eight accessions collected in nine departments of Peru were analyzed with 17 intersimple sequence repeat primers. Three multivariate analysis methods (multiple correspondence analysis, clustering analysis, and assignment method) were used to investigate the genetic structure of the species. A total of 193 reliable markers were generated, of which 169 (88 %) were polymorphic. Except for four accessions, {{the results of the}} three methods were in perfect agreement. They established the existence of three groups of accessions corresponding to the northern, central, and southeastern regions of Peru and showed a genetic structure clearly influenced by geographical provenance. The average genetic distance over all the accessions (Jaccard's coefficient) showed a moderate level of diversity (0. 35 +/- 0. 05).

We also observed crops and interviewed key informants in Peru and Ecuador, and in the PNW concerning cultivation, loss of genetic variation and preservation efforts, and usage and perceptions. In the PNW, we also investigated commercial potential and general public knowledge and interest. Our findings suggest that these plant species will grow and produce tubers in the PNW and can also produce viable seed, which is extremely important for breeding varieties better adapted to the PNW and other similar growing regions.

Both the antioxidant capacity (ORAC and ABTS assays) {{and the content}} of the bioactive compounds tested varied markedly between cultivars. Purple varieties reached the highest antioxidant capacity during tuber development (271 - 446 mu mol Trolox equiv g(- 1) DM, ORAC assay). The kinetics of accumulation or disappearance of the bioactive compounds tested during maturation was dependent both on the cultivar and on the compound considered. For anthocyanins, there was a marked increase during maturation in all the purple cultivars. During the sunning post-harvest storage, the changes in antioxidant capacity (ABTS assay) and content of the bioactive compounds tested also varied between cultivars. A marked decrease in anthocyanins was observed for the anthocyanin-containing cultivars.

40|$|Eight viruses infect ulluco (Ullucus tuberosus Caldus), an Andean tuber crop. Three of them, potato leafroll virus (PLRV), Andean potato latent virus, {{and potato}} virus T, also infect potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Arracacha virus A and papaya mosaic virus, ulluco isolate (PapMV-U) infect other crops. PLRV, {{one of the}} most {{damaging}} potato viruses, was detected in healthy potato plants growing in the field next to PLRV-infected ulluco plants, indicating that viruses can be disseminated among different Andean tuber crops under natural conditions. The viruses with the highest incidence were PapMV-U and three others, ullucus virus C, ullucus mild mottle virus, and ullucus mosaic virus. In two field experiments in Junín, Peru, ulluco plants of accession MH- 290 infected with ullucus virus C or ullucus mosaic virus, and ulluco plants of native variety Jaspeado infected with PLRV or PapMV-U yielded about 30 % less than the healthy control plants. Also, during field exposures, only a low percentage of healthy plants were reinfected with viruses. These results indicate that the production and use of virus-free ulluco seed tubers is justified in this environment and, therefore, the use of better seed by farmers has been promoted, particularly in the La Libertad community in Junín, Huancayo Department. Ulluco follows potato as the second most cultivated tuber in the Andean region, and as a popular food for more than 1000 years (Hodge, 1951). It is planted as a monocrop or in association with other Andean tubers such as potato, oca (Oxalis tuberosa), and <b>mashua</b> (Tropaeolum tuberosum) (Tapia, 1992). Both potato and ulluco are economically important for farmers. The main ulluco-producing area in Peru is Junín Department (3500 to 3800 m), located in the central Peruvian highlands (OIA, 2001).
