This is caused by the possibility of combining micro optical elements with micromachining technology that makes it feasible to develop new systems with high volumes and low prices. In this article, we report on the realization of a NIR (near infrared) spectrometer in the range of 900 ñ 2000 nm using MOEMS technology. It is based on a scanning <b>mirror</b> <b>chip,</b> which mirror plate is structured with a diffractive aluminium layer on top. This offers the possibility to fabricate a spectrometer, which needs only one single InGaAs detector photo diode. In contrast to common CCD arrays, the obtained resolution is only limited by the performance of the spectrometer (entrance slit, exit slit, focus length, diffractive element). The scanning grating chip operates at a frequency of 500 Hz, at an optical scan range of ± 4. The whole spectrometer has a size of 90 x 60 x 50 mm.

In this mixer, the LO injection circuitry is integrated on the mixer substrate using a directional coupler, combining microstrip lines with slot-line branches in the ground plane. The isolated port of the LO coupler is terminated by wideband floating elliptical termination. The mixer employs two SIS junctions with junction area of 3 μm 2 each, in the twin junction configuration, followed by a quarter wave transformer to match the RF probe. 2 SB mixer uses two identical but <b>mirrored</b> <b>chips,</b> whereas each DSB mixer has the same end-piece configuration.

40|$|Optical {{spectroscopy}} is {{a common}} tool for many applications. Micro systems most often use fixed gratings and array detectors. In the infrared wavelength range above the limit for Si-detectors (1100 nm) and Ge-detectors (1700 nm) respectively, this is either very expensive or almost impossible. Micro opto electro mechanical systems (MOEMS) offer very promising options. A movable grating can be realized by a silicon chip, using the technology of a well established scanner <b>mirror</b> <b>chips</b> {{in combination with the}} realization of a reflective grating either through etching of the aluminium mirror layer or even a more sophisticated technology. The patented resonant drive realizes a mechanical angle of ± 7 ° with CMOS compatible voltages of approximately 20 V. This technology leads to the realization of a set up close to a classical Czerny-Turner spectrometer using a single detector only. The device offers the capability to be scaled down {{to the size of a}} cigarette box. The spectrometer presented here was adjusted to 900 [...] . 2500 nm range.

40|$|Alignment {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} issues in optoelectronics packaging. A slight offset in any direction will affect the performance of the photonic devices. Nowadays passive alignment of optical fibers is attracting more attention due to its low manufacturing cost and short processing time when compared with active alignment. The position of the optical fiber in passive alignment is defined by the geometry of a V-groove. The epoxy is usually dispensed in a glob-top manner. However, the optical fiber may be lifted up due to the buoyancy effect. An additional cover plate is usually required to press the fiber against the wall of the V-groove. Although the fibers can be well aligned by the aforementioned method, the applied stress may deform the fibers or damage the cover plate, leading to subsequent reliability issues. In this study, a new method of dispensing epoxy with self-alignment capability is introduced. An innovative design of V-grooves on a silicon optical bench (SiOB) is developed. A "reservoir" is placed right next to the V-groove. The purpose of this reservoir is to let the epoxy flow into the gap between the optical fiber and the bottom of the V-groove. The excess epoxy may be drained away via the "canal". The reservoir/canal feature is patterned and etched together with the V-grooves so that there is no additional cost and time for fabricating the SiOB. It is observed that, if an appropriate amount of epoxy is flowing in the gap between the optical fiber and the V-groove, the optical fiber will not be lifted up by the buoyancy of the epoxy. On the contrary, the surface tension of running epoxy can pull down the fiber for passive alignment. With this new method, the optical fiber with greater than 60 μm of initial misalignment can be aligned with the centre of the V-groove within 0. 5 μm of accuracy. During the course of the present research, the wet etching techniques on silicon are also studied. The effects of various etching parameters are investigated and some critical issues are identified. Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSEL) are wildly used as light sources in various optoelectronic applications. As VCSELs are surface emitting devices, they are relatively difficult to be packaged with a silicon optical bench (SiOB). In this study, a new package structure with a chip-on-chip 3 D optical interconnect feature is developed. The package consists of a SiOB and a flip <b>chip</b> <b>mirror</b> carrier. The light beam is deflected by two pairs of mirrors on both the SiOB and the flip <b>chip</b> <b>mirror</b> carrier. The optical path is coupled from one optical fiber to another through an "overpass" type of 3 D interconnect. The flip <b>chip</b> <b>mirror</b> carrier is self-aligned during the reflow of flip chip solder joints. Furthermore, the newly developed V-groove passive alignment feature is also integrated with the SiOB. A prototype with the aforementioned configuration is fabricated in this study for illustration purpose. In practice, the flip <b>chip</b> <b>mirror</b> carrier may be replaced by other devices such as VCSELs and photo detectors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Grating {{projection}} {{methods have}} been often used for non-contacting shape and deformation measurement. An image of equal-height or equal-displacement contour images of an object can be obtained in real-time using moire topography. We have developed the phase-shifting scanning moire method for real-time shape and deformation measurement with high resolution. But {{there is a problem}} that the measuring error becomes larger when the object is moving speedily because several images are captured while shifting the grating phase. In this paper, we propose a phase-shifting scanning moire method using a DMD (Digital Micro-mirror Device), which can obtain an image showing equal-height or equal-displacement contour within a frame time. A DMD has about a million <b>mirrors</b> in a <b>chip</b> and the direction of a ray reflected at each mirror of the DMD can be selected quickly. By using the DMD, we developed a DMD reflection-type CCD camera called as 'DMD camera'. The camera works as a camera whose each pixel has a shutter.

40|$|Micromirror arrays are {{promising}} components for generating reflective slit masks in future multiobject spectrographs. The micromirrors, 100 μm times 200 μm in size, are etched in bulk single crystal silicon, whereas a hidden suspension is realized by surface micromachining. The micromirrors are actuated electrostatically by electrodes {{located on a}} second chip. The use of silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers for both <b>mirror</b> and electrode <b>chip</b> ensures thermal compatibility for cryogenic operation. A system of multiple landing beams has been developed, which latches the mirror at a well-defined tilt angle when actuated. Arrays of 5 times 5 micromirrors have been realized. The tilt angle obtained is 20 deg at a pull-in voltage of 90 V. Measurements with an optical profiler showed that the tilt angle of the actuated and locked mirror is stable with a precision of 1 arcmin over a range of 15 V. This locking system makes the tilt angle independent from process variations across the wafer and, thus, provides uniform tilt angle over the whole array. The surface quality of the mirrors in actuated state is better than 10 -nm peak to valley and the local roughness is about 1 -nm root mean square...|$|R

40|$|Through the {{application}} of adaptive correction, both the permanent and changing aberrations of the eye that affect vision acuity are compensated for {{in order to provide}} diffraction-limited imaging. This thesis investigates the aspects of establishing an adaptive optics system for the correction of ocular wavefront errors using a twistednematic liquid-crystal on silicon (TN-LCoS) chip as the wavefront corrector in conjunction with a Hartmann-Shack device as the wavefront sensor. TN-LCoS chips are originally designed to be used as mass-manufactured, high resolution image generating elements in video projectors. With higher density of correcting elements than the conventional form of ocular wavefront correctors (different forms of deformable <b>mirrors),</b> LCoS <b>chips</b> are emerging as potential solutions for realising cost-effective AO systems. Through {{the application}} of phase-wrapping, the resolution and stroke of the LCoS chip are fully exploited to operate the AO system as a reliable aberrometer and wavefront corrector. One of the set-backs when using these LCoS chips is that they can generate a high proportion of unwanted beams, i. e., beams other than the first diffraction order. In particular, chips with TN alignment of the LC molecules will show a strong zeroth-order contribution. That affects both the chips’ true wavefront generation capabilities as well as the fidelity of the Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor, creating an unpredictable correction scheme that does not achieve diffraction-limited performance. In this thesis the ability of the TN-LCoS chip to act as a light modulator has been thoroughly investigated. Based on this, modifications to the experimental adaptive optics set-up and the closed-loop control algorithm have been implemented to accommodate for the chip’s limitations. Experiments that were carried out include the generation of Zernike wavefronts, measurements of Zernike coefficients of elements with known and unknown optical properties, as well as open- and closed-loop corrections of static and dynamic aberrations. Parameters such as experimental and simulated point spread functions (PSFs), and residual wavefront RMS values in both the pupil and retinal planes were correlated. The closed-loop wavefront corrections with volunteers’ eyes have shown narrowed point spread functions (PSFs) and higher Strehl ratios (SRs). The system established has full functionality for ocular wavefront correction, permitting future extension of usage in retinal imaging systems or for psychological experiments...|$|R

Two requirements become a necessity: multiplexing and high spatial resolution capabilities. Thanks to its multiplexing capabilities, Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) is becoming the central method to study large numbers of objects by recording simultaneously hundreds of spectra and utilizing a target selection mechanism in the field of view. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) where identified by the major global astronomical and space societies as high-potential candidates for the use as reconfigurable target selection masks in future MOS: they are lightweight, remote-configurable, versatile and have the potential to be operated in cryogenic environment. Within the scope of this thesis the corner stones for a new class of MEMS mirror arrays (MMA) for the use in future MOS has been laid. The main requirements are: large tilt-angles of ≥ 20 ◦, feed-forward tilt-angle uniformity, large micromirrors of 100 × 200 μm 2 with a surface quality better than λ/ 20 and operation in cryogenic environment. The device concept, conceived to tackle these challenges, include a twochip architecture required to accommodate the large tilt-angle and mirror size. The micromirrors are made from 10 μm-thick bulk single crystalline silicon to provide maximum flatness. The micromirrors are suspended with polysilicon cantilever beams located on the mirror backside. A system of landing and stopper beams has been implemented, which, together with intermediate supporting beams for uniform spacing between mirror and electrode, aimed to provide feed-forward tilt-angle uniformity over large arrays. The individual chips were fabricated utilizing a combination of bulk- and surface micromachining. An assembly scheme for <b>mirror</b> and electrode <b>chip,</b> allowing passive alignment with an accuracy of ± 5 μm, has been developed and demonstrated. The mirrors of fabricated 5 × 5 arrays showed to have an excellent surface quality, with a peak-to-valley deformation of 35 nm for gold-coated mirrors at room temperature and 50 nm for gold-coated mirrors at cryogenic temperatures (100 K). Electromechanical characterization showed micromirrors yielding a tilt-angle of 20 ◦ at an actuation voltage below 90 V. The tiltangle in ON-state was stable within 3 arcmin over a voltage range of more than 10 V, demonstrating the stopper and landing beam concept. Successful operation of the micromirror array in vacuo and cryogenic environment at temperatures below 100 K has been showed and a preliminary demonstration of the object selection capabilities of the fabricated micromirrors has been carried out...|$|R
