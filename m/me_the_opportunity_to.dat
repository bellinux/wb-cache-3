Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan.

2500|$|Debney called Iron Man 2 [...] "odd in {{that there}} were {{not a lot of}} places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a {{full-blown}} superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively." [...] For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with [...] "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen [...] "was less thematic. It was sort of a groove {{with a little bit of}} French horn. Maybe that was the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero." [...] He continued, [...] "There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where [...] "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character." [...] Debney felt that this process led to the score being [...] "watered down and mashed up a little bit" [...] from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal [...] "joy". He said that Favreau [...] "gave me a great opportunity to get into [...] scene and learn 's circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film".
