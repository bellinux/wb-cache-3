50|$|Spores of M. cicadina {{are capable}} of germinating and infecting cicadas at as little as one year; but may remain dormant for either 13 or 17 years before {{becoming}} active. Cicadas first become infected by fungal spores as the nymphs prepare to leave the soil and become adults. Early stages of the infection are completely concealed inside the abdomen of the cicada. At or near {{the death of the}} host, the rear segments of the abdomen fall off, revealing a white, chalky mass of the fungus, which actively produces and forcibly discharges spores. These spores are infective to other periodical cicadas, and create a secondary cycle of disease. At the end of this secondary cycle, the fungus produces a different kind of spores, which have thick, ornamented walls and are not directly infective to adult cicadas; these spores lie dormant in soil. The fungus renders both males and females sterile, though they may remain alive and <b>mobile</b> while <b>discharging</b> spores. Affected males are not able to mate, while affected females can mate but cannot oviposit.|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Patients with stroke {{have up to}} a 4 -fold {{increased}} risk of hip fracture because of their high incidence of falls and loss of bone mass in the paretic side, ie, hemiosteoporosis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence of previous stroke among patients with femoral neck fracture. Methods—The study included all 568 patients, aged $ 65 years, who underwent surgery for femoral neck fracture in 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993, and 1997 at the orthopedic clinic of Umeå University Hospital, Umeå, Sweden. Results—The prevalence of previous strokes ranged from 16. 4 % to 38. 5 % (P, 0. 001); this finding is only partly explained by the increased incidence of stroke in the corresponding population, and there was no significant increase in the overall incidence of femoral neck fracture. Fractures occurred 5. 466. 4 years after stroke (median 2. 9 years, range 0 to 33 years). In stroke patients with unilateral stroke and persisting paresis at the time of fracture, 62. 5 % had their fracture on the paretic side (P 50. 034). Survival was significantly reduced in patients with previous stroke (P, 0. 001). In patients previously independently mobile, 69. 2 % with no previous stroke and 38. 1 % with previous stroke were still <b>mobile</b> at <b>discharge</b> from the orthopedic unit (P, 0. 001). Conclusions—Attention must be focused on stroke as a major and increasing risk factor for femoral neck fracture and also on the poor postfracture outcome and reduced survival of these patients. Prevention of poststroke fractures is necessary and is aimed at reducing the risk of poststroke fall and preventing the development of hemiosteoporosis. (Stroke...|$|R
40|$|Walking {{speed was}} {{measured}} on admission and then weekly during treatment of 125 subjects {{admitted to a}} geriatric rehabilitation ward. Walking speed was strongly related {{to the ability to}} stand up from a chair without help. Placement decisions at discharge were made without knowledge of gait speed data so that they {{could be used as a}} standard against which to compare walking speed as a valid and practical measure of mobility. It was found that a discharge walking speed of 0. 15 m/s best separated immobile subjects who required long-term hospital care from those sufficiently <b>mobile</b> to be <b>discharged</b> home alone or to a rest home (54 % versus 0 % below cut-off, respectively). Relative walking speed (speed/ height) was no better at predicting placement or mortality than walking speed. Uncorrected walking speed therefore remains the preferred clinical measure of velocity. A serial record showing improve-ment in walking speed proved useful in predicting eventual independent mobility of poorly mobile subjects. Thus walking speed is an objective yet inexpensive method of monitoring gait rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Decreased {{functional}} {{ability is}} common in older adults after hospitalisation. Lower levels of functional ability {{increase the risk of}} hospital readmission and nursing care facility admission. Discharge planning across the hospital and community interface is suggested to increase functional ability and decrease hospital length of stay and hospital readmission. However evidence is limited and the benefits of occupational therapists providing this service has not been investigated. This randomised trial will investigate the clinical effectiveness of a discharge planning program in reducing functional difficulties of older adults post-discharge. This trial will also examine the cost of the intervention and cost effectiveness when compared to in-hospital discharge planning. Methods/design 400 participants admitted to participating hospitals will be recruited. Participants will be 70 [*]years of age and over, have no significant cognitive impairment and be independently <b>mobile</b> at <b>discharge.</b> This study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Ryde Rehabilitation Human Research Ethics Committee, Western Sydney Local Health District (Westmead Campus) Human Research Ethics Committee, Alfred Health Human Research ethics committee for the randomised trial and NSW Population and Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee for data linkage. Participants will provide informed written consent. Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive discharge planning therapies primarily within their home environment while the control group will receive an in-hospital consultation, both provided by trained occupational therapists. Primary outcome measures will be the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale (NEADL) and the Late Life Disability Index (LLDI) which will measure functional independence, and participation and limitation in daily life activities.

50|$|Killing {{one after}} another, Nikhil {{seems to be}} the prime suspect, that's why Vikram plans to kill him in his taxi and flee, however Nikhil fights back and dares Vikram by risking his life. After a series of murders of {{witnesses}} against Jabbar in the same night, the CBI officer and local Police Officer (Sanjay Batra) are closely on trail of Nikhil, who they assume to be the The Killer. Nikhil destroys the laptop of Vikram which contained the information of the witnesses in his hit-list. Vikram forces Nikhil to pose as Vikram and seek the particulars of the remaining two witnesses in the hit-list from Jabbar by meeting him personally in his mansion. Nikhil does so and procures the same and hands it over to Vikram, who had been waiting for him outside in the taxi. Nikhil decides to risk his life to save the witnesses and races his taxi to the horror of Vikram. The taxi hits a kiosk and crashes. Vikram runs off for his next prey followed by Nikhil in chase. He fails to save the witness, who is shot by Vikram. Nikhil sees his girl-friend Rhea's name and photo in the mobile which fell off the fleeing Vikram. Determining to save Rhea from Vikram at any cost, Nikhil tries to contact her to warn her and flee, but her <b>mobile</b> gets <b>discharged.</b> He runs to warn her in the casino where she is dancing. The police and Vikram reach the place and just as Vikram shoots at Rhea, Nikhil leaps and pushes her away. In the melee following the gun-shots, when the police confront Nikhil as the suspect Killer, he informs them that it is Vikram who is the actual Killer. He manages to escape from the place with Vikram in chase after them. Finally, when Vikram confronts them and tries to shoot Rhea, Nikhil dares him to shoot him. The police shoot Vikram just as he is about to press the trigger of his gun. Thus Nikhil saves Rhea and they are happily united.|$|R
40|$|A seawall was {{constructed}} in 1897 along the steep coast of Streckelsberg, Usedom Island to stop the cliff retreat. It was destroyed several times by storm induced sea floods, reconstructed and gradually extended to a length of 450 m. After the severe storm event of 1 / 2. 3. 1949, no more repair work was implemented. The ruins were no longer capable of preventing further erosion of the Streckelsberg cliff. A new protective structure became a necessity against ongoing erosion, and to check the lowering of the abrasion platform. The construction of three breakwaters began in 1995. A severe storm occurred on 3 / 4. 11. 1995 before their completion. Coastal bottom sediment mapping using a sidescan-sonar carried out two days later showed that a channel system down {{to a depth of}} 1. 5 m was cut into the sand layer covering the sea floor {{on both sides of the}} Koserow Bank. The bottom of these channels was paved with gravel and boulders. This layer was encountered in the whole surveyed area below a <b>mobile</b> sand layer. <b>Discharged</b> bodies of fine sand half a meter high and erosional cavities several m 2 in diameter around boulders led to the conclusion that an intensive sediment movement down to a depth of 11 m had taken place during the storm. A storm related direction of sediment discharge could not be identified. The existing section of the breakwaters withstood the severe storm...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{catchments}} with impervious bedrock, the nitrate {{concentrations in}} streamwater often show marked seasonal and small inter-annual variations. The inter-annual trends are usually attributed {{to changes in}} nitrogen inputs, due to changes in land use or in nitrogen deposition whereas seasonal patterns are {{explained in terms of}} availability of soil nitrate for leaching and of seasonality of nitrogen biotransformations. The companion paper showed that inter-annual variations of nitrogen in streamwater are not directly related to the variations of land use. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe nitrate concentration variations in a set of very small adjacent catchments, and to discuss the origin of the inter-annual and seasonal trends. Data from four catchments at the Kerbernez site (South Western Brittany, France) were used in this study. Nitrate concentrations in streamwater were monitored for eight years (1992 to 1999) at the outlet of the catchments. They exhibit contrasting inter-annual and seasonal patterns. An extensive survey of agricultural practices during this period allowed assessment of the amount of nitrogen available for leaching. The discharges measured since 1997 show similar specific fluxes but very different seasonal dynamics between the catchments. A simple, lumped linear store model is proposed as an initial explanation of the differences in discharge and nitrate concentration patterns between the catchments. The base flow at the outlet of each catchment is considered as a mixture of water from two linear reservoirs with different time constants. Each reservoir comprises two water stores, one <b>mobile</b> contributing to <b>discharge,</b> the other, immobile, where nitrate moves only by diffusion. The storm flow, which accounts for less than 10 % of the annual flux, is not considered here. Six parameters were adjusted for each catchment to fit the observed data: the proportion of deep losses of water, the proportion of the two reservoirs and the size and initial concentration of the two immobile stores. The model simulates the discharge and nitrate concentration dynamics well. It suggests that the groundwater store plays a very important role in the control of nitrate concentration in streamwater, and that the pattern of the seasonal variation of nitrate concentration may result from the long term evolution of nitrogen losses by leaching.
