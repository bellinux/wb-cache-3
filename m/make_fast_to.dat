6000|$|An Ox, {{unable to}} extricate {{himself from the}} mire into which he sank, was advised {{to make use of}} a Political Pull. When the Political Pull had arrived, the Ox said: [...] "My good friend, please <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> me, and let nature take her course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. Look out! There's a bag. Put as much gold {{in it as}} you {{can lift}} comfortably, and then <b>make</b> it <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the rope." ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{originally}} developed to give PL/SQL developers {{an alternative to}} the utPLSQL framework. The goal was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it <b>faster</b> <b>to</b> write Unit testing easier and less verbose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here {{comes the}} whip," [...] he cried, {{catching}} {{hold of the}} block when it reached him. [...] "Hold me up, lad, while I <b>make</b> it <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> them loops." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Throw each of {{your two}} men on to a junk," [...] whispered Le Grant {{to me from the}} salmon boat. [...] "And you <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> a third yourself. We'll do the same, and there's no reason in the world why we shouldn't capture six junks at the least." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Keep {{her away}} two points," [...] said Captain Guy {{to the man}} at the wheel; [...] "we'll <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> yonder berg, Mr Bolton; if this gale carries us into the pack, we shall be swept far out of our course, if, indeed, we escape being nipped and sent to the bottom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We put {{the chain}} on, fast and strong sir," [...] {{they said to}} the Captain; [...] "and six feet under water. But the only place we could find <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> was {{the bottom of the}} rudder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tut, tut! there's {{a fire in}} the stove. None of your rover tricks, Ned Galloway, {{unless they}} are called for, or I'll let you know which of us two is captain and which is quartermaster. <b>Make</b> him <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the table.|$|R
6000|$|... 5. When the hawser is got on board, {{the crew}} should at once <b>make</b> it <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> {{the same part}} of the ship as the tailed block is made <b>fast</b> <b>to,</b> only about 18 inches higher, taking care {{that there are no}} turns of the whip line round the hawser.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stoved in, eh?" [...] {{shouted the}} voice from above. [...] "Well, ye needn't sink. I'll haul yer bowline taut, and I'll heave ye another to <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> yer stern. That'll keep yer little craft afloat until ye can unlade her; and the quicker ye get yer traps up here the better, if ye don't want 'em soaked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'But I tell you, Sam,' said Abner, {{a little}} querulously, 'I didn't {{come here to}} marry one of them women. I didn't start on this trip to <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the fust female person I might fall in with. I {{set out on a}} week's cruise, and I want {{to see a lot of}} them afore I make a ch'ice.' ...|$|E
60|$|Orders now came fast from Repeller No. 1, {{which had}} moved nearer {{to the scene}} of conflict. It was to be {{supposed}} that the disabled ship was properly furnished with bulk-heads, so that the water would penetrate no farther than the stern compartment, and that, therefore, she was in no danger of sinking. Crab A was ordered to <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the bow of the Scarabaeus, and tow her toward two men-of-war who were rapidly approaching from the harbour.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right. Now <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> the shore-end <b>to</b> a bush, and we'll {{commence}} telegraphing. The first must be {{a message}} from the Queen to the King of Denmark--Or is it the President?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} structure and electronic properties of volatile memory <b>makes</b> it <b>faster</b> compared <b>to</b> electro-mechanical storage {{devices such as}} hard drives, which makes it an ideal candidate as the computer's main form of memory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before we do {{anything}} more," [...] Frank said, [...] "I will swim {{with a light}} line to that tree, and then haul the tow-rope after me, and <b>make</b> it <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> it; {{it is possible that}} when we cut away some of the other boughs the whole affair may turn over and sink, but if the tow-rope is fast {{we may be able to}} drag it alongside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I do, Señor Don Almirante, set me to {{greasing}} masts, {{and take}} me from the helm, forever, as one unfit to watch the whirlings of the north star. Sail with the caravels, into the hall of the Great Khan, and <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> his throne, {{and you will find}} Sancho at his post, whether it be at the helm or at the lead. He was born in a ship-yard, and hath a natural desire to know what a ship can do." ...|$|E
60|$|The great battle-ship, totally {{bereft of}} the power of moving herself, was now rolling in the trough of the sea, and a signal came from the {{repeller}} for Crab K to <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> her and put her head to the wind. This was quickly done, the crab attaching itself to the stern-post of the Adamant by a pair of towing nippers. These were projected from the stern of the crab, and were so constructed that the larger vessel did not communicate all its motion to the smaller one, and could not run down upon it.|$|E
60|$|With {{her head}} to the wind the pirate vessel Revenge bore down slowly upon the King and Queen, now lying to and {{awaiting}} her. The stiff breeze was growing stiffer and the sea was rising. The experienced eye of Paul Bittern, the sailing-master of the pirate, now told him that it would be dangerous to approach the brig near enough to <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> her, even for the minute which Captain Bonnet craved--the minute which would have been long enough for a couple of sturdy fellows to toss on board the prize that exasperating human indictment, Ben Greenway.|$|E
50|$|You {{command a}} small task force whose {{objective}} is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a <b>fast</b> transit <b>to</b> the U.S. east coast. Soviet subs, cruisers, and bombers stand in your way. The submarine threat is particularly strong in this scenario.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sent them}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a chain <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the rocks. We'll shackle {{up the first}} logs we run down and make a lumber pond. A few may shoot across the top, but we'll see {{what must be done}} as we get on." ...|$|R
50|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> put {{his company}} back on track, Dominique (Roy Dupuis) {{encouraged}} by {{his business partner}} Pierre Sanchez (Patrick Huard) finds {{a job as an}} antique dealer for Victor (Normand Lévesque). But soon he realizes that the only way he will keep his job is by pretending he is gay, slowly breaking his marriage with his wife Maude (Charlotte Laurier) and stirring weird emotions from his mother Elisabeth (France Castel).|$|R
60|$|I did {{not part}} from the raft without melancholy regrets. The {{materials}} of which it was composed were all that now remained of the Dawn. Then the few hours of jeopardy and loneliness I had passed on it, {{were not to be}} forgotten. They still recur vividly to my thoughts with deep, and, I trust, profitable, reflections. The first hour after we cast off, we stood to the southward. The wind continuing to increase in violence, and the sea to get up, until it blew too fresh for the boat to make any headway, or even to hold her own against it, Marble thought he might do better on the other tack,--having some reason to suppose there was a current setting to the southward and eastward,--and we wore round. After standing to the northward for a sufficient length of time, we again fell in with the spars; a proof that we were doing nothing towards working our way to windward. I determined, at once, to <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> them, and use them as a sort of floating anchor, so long as the foul wind lasted. We had some difficulty in effecting this object; but we finally succeeded in getting near enough, under the lee of the top, to <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> one of its eye-bolts--using a bit of small hawser, that was in the boat, for that purpose. The boat was then dropped a sufficient distance to leeward of the spars, where it rode head to sea, like a duck. This was a fortunate expedient; as it came on to blow hard, and we had something very like a little gale of wind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, {{you know}} what I mean, Madam Budd; and {{so long as the}} parties {{understand}} each other, a word dropped, or a word put into a charter-party, makes it neither stronger nor weaker. There's a time, howsomever, in every man's life, when he begins to think of settling down, and of considerin' himself as a sort of mooring-chain, for children and the likes of them to <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to.</b> Such is my natur', I will own; and ever since I've got to be intimate in your family, Madam Budd, that sentiment has grown stronger and stronger in me, till it has got to be uppermost in all my idees. Bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh, as a body might say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{looked at}} me and my companions in surprise, and then glancing along the deck, said, 'What has {{happened}} to this vessel? Who is in command?' I informed him, that, strictly speaking, no one was in command, but that I represented the captain, officers, and crew of this steamer, the General Brooks, from San Francisco to Calcutta, and I then proceeded to tell him the whole story of our misfortunes; and concluded by telling the officer, that if we had not moved since his vessel had come in sight, it was probably because the Water-devil had let go of us, and was preparing to <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the other ship; and therefore it would be advisable for us all to get on board his vessel, and steam away as quickly as possible.|$|E
50|$|Smart Cache {{shares the}} actual cache memory between the cores of a {{multi-core}} processor. In comparison to a dedicated per-core cache, the overall cache miss rate decreases when not all cores need equal {{parts of the}} cache space. Consequently, a single core can use the full level 2 or level 3 cache, if the other cores are inactive. Furthermore, the shared cache <b>makes</b> it <b>faster</b> <b>to</b> share memory among different execution cores.|$|R
60|$|Malcolm, even in {{this time}} of danger, could not but admire the calmness and coolness of his young colonel. He at once set men to work with ropes to drag towards the vessel the {{floating}} pieces of wreck which were tossing about in the boiling surf. The masts and yards were hauled alongside, and the colonel instructed the men <b>to</b> <b>make</b> themselves <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> these in case the vessel should go to pieces.|$|R
50|$|Numbers {{are often}} rounded to avoid {{reporting}} insignificant figures. For example, {{it would create}} false precision to express a measurement as 12.34500 kg (which has seven significant figures) if the scales only measured to the nearest gram and gave a reading of 12.345 kg (which has five significant figures). Numbers can also be rounded merely for simplicity rather than to indicate a given precision of measurement, for example, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them <b>faster</b> <b>to</b> pronounce in news broadcasts.|$|R
60|$|I {{now stood}} up, {{and began to}} look for a proper picket to <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to,</b> when, in gazing about, I caught sight of the mast-heads of the {{shipping}} at the yard, and of the ensign under which I had so long served! These came over me, as a light-house comes over a mariner in distress at sea, and I thought there must be friends for me in that quarter. The sight gave me courage and strength, and I determined no old shipmate should hear of a blue-jacket's hanging himself on a picket, in a fit of the horrors. Casting off the bowlines, I replaced the handkerchief on my neck, and made the best of my way towards those blessed mast-heads, which, under God's mercy, were the means of preventing me from committing suicide.|$|E
6000|$|Very {{early the}} next morning Mr. Hodgson came aft where Captain Burke was {{standing}} with the sailing-master. [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "I am a clergyman and a man of peace, but I declare, sir, that I do not think any one, no matter what his profession, should feel himself called upon to submit to the outrageous conduct of the Captain of that vessel! Is there no way in which we could approach her and <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> her, and then boldly press our way on board in spite of objection or resistance, and by force, if it should be necessary, bring away Mr. Shirley, whose misfortune has made us all feel as if he were not only our friend, but our brother. Then, sir, I should let that vessel go on to destruction, if she chooses to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|The tender was now {{bearing down}} on one of the {{numerous}} buoys which mark off the channels around the Goodwin sands, and it required careful steering in order to avoid missing it on the one hand, or running into it on the other. A number of men stood on the bow of the vessel, with ropes and boat-hooks, in readiness to catch and <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> it. These men, with the exception of two or three who formed the permanent crew of the tender, were either going off to [...] "relieve" [...] their comrades and take their turn on board the floating lights, or {{were on their way to}} land, having been [...] "relieved"--such as George Welton the mate, Dick Moy, and Jerry MacGowl. Among them were several masters and mates belonging to the light-vessels of that district--sedate, grave, cheerful, and trustworthy men, all of them--who had spent the greater part of their lives in the service, and were by that time middle-aged or elderly, but still, with few exceptions, as strong and hardy as young men.|$|E

60|$|It {{happened}} thus. The Smeaton {{had been}} sent from Arbroath with a cargo of stones one morning, and reached the rock about half-past six o'clock a.m. The mate {{and one of the}} men, James Scott, a youth of eighteen years of age, got into the sloop's boat <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>fast</b> the hawser <b>to</b> the floating buoy of her moorings.|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} no time to give way. I had (by God's single mercy) got myself alive out of that fortress; and now I had {{to try to get the}} others, my comrades. There was about a fathom of rope to spare; I got it by the end, and searched the whole ground {{thoroughly}} for anything <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it <b>fast</b> <b>to.</b> In vain: the ground was broken and stony, but there grew not there so much as a bush of furze.|$|R
