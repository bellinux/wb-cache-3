40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{presented}} in this paper to quantitatively define the heat removal of the main fractionator in delayed coking units {{on the basis of a}} fractionating precision diagram (Houghland diagram) and column grand composite curve (CGCC). By referring to the CGCC method, several envelopes are illustrated at draw trays including the top pumparound draw, diesel draw, intermediate pumparound draw and gas oil draw, the energy and material balances are then calculated. Assuming practical near-minimum thermodynamic condition (PNMTC), the <b>minimum</b> liquid <b>reflux</b> flow is zero in the envelope for pumparound trays without product draw and the <b>minimum</b> liquid <b>reflux</b> flow is defined by Houghland diagram for pumparound trays with product draw. The PNMTC-CGCC is constructed by calculating the enthalpy-flow deficit to quantitatively define the heat removal constraints in each envelope. Meanwhile, the corresponding practical heat removal curve is constructed. A case study shows that the high temperature heat removal ratio within the main fractionator increased by 8 %. The proposed method offers heat removal inequality constraints for the model to optimize the heat integration between the main fractionator and the heat exchanger network. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In {{this series of}} 771 consecutive patients referred for 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring, a probability calculation {{was used to evaluate}} the relation between symptoms and reflux episodes.

In 96 patients (12. 5 % of total patients) with normal oesophageal exposure to acid, there was a statistically significant association between symptoms and reflux episodes. The symptom cluster of such patients was similar to that usually seen in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, but symptoms like belching, bloating, and nausea were common thus overlapping with the symptom pattern of functional dyspepsia. In these patients both the duration and the <b>minimum</b> pH of <b>reflux</b> episodes (either symptom related or asymptomatic) were significantly shorter and higher, respectively, when compared with those of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to optimize the thermal performance of a fractionation unit within a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. Typical fractionation units in an LNG facility consisting of three distillation columns, namely de-ethanizer, de-propanizer and de-butanizer were used in this study. A hierarchical approach is developed to optimizing the system. In this approach, increasing levels of model complexity are used and various thermal targets are set and implemented. The column targeting tool available within the simulation package of Aspen Plus software was used to optimize a fractionation unit in an LNG facility. First, integrated thermal analysis was used in identifying design targets for improvements in energy consumption and efficiency. The column targeting tool is used in the design of distillation columns by setting targets to reduce utility cost, improve energy efficiency, reduce capital investment and facilitate column debottlenecking. Starting from a short-cut distillation design calculation using the DSTWU method which is based on the well-known Fenske-Underwood-Gilliland correlations, the <b>minimum</b> and actual <b>reflux</b> ratios, <b>minimum</b> and actual number of stages, optimum feed location and condenser and reboiler duties were estimated. These estimates were used as starting points in the rigorous fractionation column design method RADFRAC available in Aspen Plus. The column Grand Composite Curve (CGCC) for each column was generated to give an insight of the actual operation and guide the optimization process. Starting with appropriate feed placement, the CGCC will show the scope for reflux ratio modification by increasing the number of stages.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{approach}} {{for developing a}} systematic design procedure for heterogeneous azeotropic distillation sequences is presented. A simple technique for calculating liquid-liquid-vapor equilibrium is developed. The technique is capable of distinguishing between metastable and absolutely stable liquid phases and therefore gives reliable predictions {{about the number of}} coexisting equilibrium liquid phases. The procedure has been used to calculate residue curve maps and to design heterogeneous azeotropic distillation columns. A residue curve map analysis for heterogeneous mixtures is developed to aid in the sequencing of heterogeneous distillation columns. In the analysis, distillation boundaries and the projected liquid boiling envelope are superimposed to divide the triangular composition diagram into distinct distillation regions. Classes of residue curve maps which give rise to feasible column sequences are identified. Several kinds of sequences are presented and it is shown that the conventional sequence frequently requires much larger reflux ratios than other alternatives. ^ A simple technique is developed for discovering the underlying geometric conditions which govern the calculation of <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratios in heterogeneous azeotropic distillation columns. A set of finite difference mass balance equations which describe the steady-state composition profile are derived and used to demonstrate the design technique. A differential approximation to these equations are developed for calculating <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratios and for studying the effect of design variables of these complex columns. The results show that a small change in the operating conditions can cause a significant shift in the column composition profile while maintaining the product compositions essentially constant. The design procedure, therefore, provides rather unique information about the operability of these columns and the study suggests that the composition profile sensitivity {{must be taken into account}} in control system design. ^ Finally, a procedure for calculating <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratios for heterogeneous distillation columns is presented.

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} for a {{continuous}} <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> distillation column is developed for the case of constant relative volatility (CRV) and constant molar overflow (CMO). This model predicts the dynamic behavior of <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> distillation columns and provides a clear description of both the steady state and the dynamic conditions necessary for maintaining high purity operation. Boundaries at which the steady state composition profile in a binary <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> column is indeterminate are identified and analytical expressions predicting the location of these boundaries are established. Two new model based control strategies are presented which provide excellent disturbance rejection for large variations in feed composition. ^ The optimum operating policy for a thermally coupled ternary Petlyuk column is derived. A control strategy for the Petlyuk column is proposed. This policy is based upon {{an extension of the}} proposed control strategy for single feed columns. It implicitly varies the internal flow ratios within each countercurrent section of the complex column. This leads to a full, multivariable feedback control structure which suppresses the dynamic interaction plaguing the operation of thermally coupled distillation networks. ^ A continuum model for multicomponent distillation in the <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> limit (Wachter, Ko and Andres, 1988) is used to explore the rich variety of composition profiles found in complex columns. These profiles are divided into two classes: favorable and unfavorable. Favorable profiles, found in both single feed and multiple feed columns, are characterized by low energy usage and relatively simple column dynamics. Unfavorable profiles, found only in multiple feed columns, are characterized by relatively high energy usage and complex column dynamics. A design procedure is presented in which unfavorable profiles are eliminated by changing feed locations or combining feed streams. ^ The effect of mass transfer resistance on the pinch compositions in both countercurrent exchangers and single feed distillation columns is explored. A staged model for the dynamic behavior of these devices is presented and the form of the mass transfer rate expressions is critically examined for self consistency. This examination leads to a new set of restrictions on multicomponent film models for interphase mass transport.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the batch and {{continuous}} extractive distillation of minimum- and maximum-boiling azeotropic mixtures with a heavy entrainer. These systems exhibit class 1. 0 - 1 a and 1. 0 - 2 ternary diagrams, each with two subcases depending on {{the location of the}} univolatility line. The feasible product and feasible ranges of the operating parameters reflux ratio (R) and entrainer/feed flow rate ratio for continuous (FE/F) and batch (FE/V) operation were assessed. Class 1. 0 - 1 a processes allow the recovery of only one product because of the location of the univolatility line above a minimum value of the entrainer/feed flow rate ratio for both batch and continuous processes. A <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratio R also exists. For an identical target purity, the minimum feed ratio is higher for the continuous process than for the batch process, for the continuous process where stricter feasible conditions arise because the composition profile of the stripping section must intersect that of the extractive section. Class 1. 0 - 2 mixtures allow either A or B to be obtained as a product, depending on the feed location. Then, the univolatility line location sets limiting values for either the maximum or minimum of the feed ratio FE/F. Again, the feasible range of operating parameters for the continuous process is smaller than that for the batch process.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for computing the <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> for multi-component conventional columns {{as well as}} complex configurations has been developed. The technique is a short cut, geometrical, non-iterative method. It predicts how the <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> solution and hence the profile orientation {{is related to the}} feed-component distribution for all possible operating conditions and any number of components. The technique makes use of Column Profile Maps and the eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix of the separation vector evaluated at the feed condition. An integral part of the method is the development of the feasible regions in composition space that restrict our choice of the product specification. The Column Profile Map-Eigenvector technique has shown to produce results exactly equivalent to those as predicted by the Underwood method. To demonstrate the Column Profile Map-Eigenvector technique to complex configurations the method is employed in the detailed design of the Petlyuk Column. Although the overall column <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> calculation is not shown, the application of the Column Profile Map-Eigenvector technique is utilised to determine the complete feasible operating region. The feasible column parameter region derived from the CPM-E technique is shown to encompass five flow patterns for the Petlyuk column derived from the Column Profile Map techniques. In order to exhibit the value of the Column Profile Map techniques developed by Tapp et al. (2004) to higher order systems, the design methods are applied to the fully thermally coupled Kaibel column under sharp split conditions. From the results of the topological analysis, it is shown that, for set product specifications, when dealing with ideal systems (constant relative volatilities), there is only one set of feasible operating parameters. The line of solutions for feasible profile intersection is then sectioned and the CPM-E technique is applied to the quaternary configuration that produces all feasible operating parameters. The Column Profile Map technique has also been applied to the design of a variety of quaternary feeds for sets of columns consisting of a main column with various combinations of side rectifiers and strippers. The graphical nature of the technique allows one to easily assess feasible designs for systems with less than five components, but is shown to algebraically extend to higher order systems.

40|$|In {{distillation}} columns with condenser temperatures significantly below room temperature, {{such as in}} demethanizer towers, {{it is essential to}} minimize the expensive energy requirements of the refrigeration cycle that produces the tower reflux.

The fraction of the precooled feed has an optimum value that must be determined by means of a sensitivity analysis. By repeating the simulation of the tower and its auxiliaries, it is possible to find the optimal configuration, i. e., the configuration that minimizes the energy requirements at the condenser, by varying the feed-splitting ratio and by adjusting the tower geometry (i. e., identity of the feed trays) for each trial.

The <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> provides the minimum energy requirements, and the infinite reflux provides the feasibility conditions. The difficulty of separation can be {{expressed in terms of}} number of transfer units (NTU). The applicability of the method is not mathematically limited by the number of components in the mixture.

The separation of the mixtures, performed by distillation columns, is feasible if a minimum NTU can be calculated between the distillate and bottom compositions. Once verified the feasibility of the separation, the maximum thermal efficiency depends only on boiling point of bottom and distillate streams.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{continuous}} extractive distillation of minimum and maximum boiling azeotropic mixtures A-B {{with a heavy}} or a light entrainer E, intending to assess its feasibility based on thermodynamic insights. The ternary mixtures belong to the common 1. 0 - 1 a and 1. 0 - 2 class ternary diagrams, each with two sub-cases depending on the univolatility line location. The column has three sections, rectifying, extractive and stripping. Differential equations are derived for each section composition, depending on operating parameters: distillate product purity and recovery, reflux ratio R and entrainer – feed flow rate ratio FE/F for the heavy case; bottom product purity and recovery, reboil ratio and entrainer – feed flow rate ratio for the light entrainer case. For the case with a heavy entrainer fed as a boiling liquid above the main feed, the feasible product and operating parameters R and FE/F ranges are assessed under infinite reflux ratio conditions by using the general feasibility criterion enounced by Rodriguez-Donis et al. (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res, 2009, 48 (7), 3544 – 3559). For the 1. 0 - 1 a class, there exists a minimum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio to recover the product, and also a <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratio. The minimum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio is higher for the continuous process than for the batch because of the additional requirement in continuous mode that the stripping profile intersects with the extractive profile. For the 1. 0 - 2 class both A and B can be distillated. For one of them there exists a maximum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio. The continuous process also has a minimum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio limit for a given feasible reflux ratio. For the case with a light entrainer fed as saturated vapor below the main feed, the feasible product and operating parameters S and FE/F ranges are assessed under infinite reflux ratio conditions by using the general feasibility criterion enounced by Rodriguez-Donis et al. (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res, 2012, 51, 4643 – 4660), Compared to the heavy entrainer case, the main product {{is removed from the}} column bottom. Similar results are obtained for the 1. 0 - 1 a and 1. 0 - 2 class mixtures whether the entrainer is light or heavy. With a light entrainer, the batch insight about the process feasibility holds for the stripping and extractive sections. Now, an additional constraint in continuous mode comes from the necessary intersection between the rectifying and the extractive sections.

As energy prices continue to rise, energy conservation is the prime concern for every industry. Distillation {{is probably the most}} studied unit operation in terms of optimization and control. Since distillation columns are major energy-intensive units in chemical plants and given the recent increase in fuel cost, the plant engineers are obliged to find better operating strategies and control systems. One of the significant sections that can be worked upon is finding the optimum feed tray locations of distillation columns. The energy consumptions during distillation can have a strong impact on overall profitability. Hence, the optimization of a column is aimed towards greater production and an increase in quality. Since a column is multivariable system, disturbance in any parameter can affect the overall performance as well as production loss.

Here we show that a simple reformulation allows us to handle the disappearance or reappearance of phases and thus allows us to solve a wider class of process problems. The proposed strategy uses a penalty function approach, called Penalty Simulation of Nonsmooth Algebraic Terms and Attributes (P-SONATA), to accomodate the nonsmooth nature of the system. To solve the vapor-liquid equilibrium problem, we also extend the theoretical results of the approach of Bullard and Biegler (1991) to characterize descent and convergence properties for P-SONATA. The performance of this formulation is demonstrated for process models involving phase equilibrium, such as transitions from one and two phases in flash and distillation problems, where mass and energy balances must be satisfied but the phase equilibrium expression can be relaxed. Isothermal flash problems with ideal and nonideal phase equilibrium relations are considered {{as well as a}} case which exhibits retrograde condensation behavior near the critical point. Finally, we examine limiting distillation cases including columns operating below the <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratio (resulting in dry trays) and below the minimum reboiler heat duty (resulting in vaporless trays).

40|$|Abstract—Ethyl acetate {{with the}} minimum purity of 85. 0 % by mole is inevitably needed {{as an active}} solvent used {{in a wide range}} of {{applications}} across many industries. It is normally produced by the esterification of ethanol and acetic acid. Due to the equilibrium limitation, it has been reported that the ethyl acetate with the maximum purity of 52. 0 % can be obtained in a batch reactor. To achieve higher purity, further purification unit is added with the use of some energy. Alternatively, to overcome the limitation, a batch reactive distillation column, combining the reaction and separation into a single stage, is proposed. The ethyl acetate is always distilled and withdrawn out the reaction zone and the equilibrium is shifted to the right. The reactant conversion is then improved. Therefore, the objective of this work is to study an approach to produce ethyl acetate with the purity of 90. 0 % by mole by a batch reactive distillation column. Based on open loop simulations, the distillation with constant reflux ratio cannot achieve the product specification. Thus, dynamic optimization strategy is proposed to handle this problem. The optimization problem is formulated to maximize the weight of distillate product for a given product specification, reboiler heat duty, and batch operating time. For the process safety—preventing the dried column and fractured, <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratio must be determined in advance and then an optimal reflux profile is calculated to achieve optimal product yield. Simulation results show that 90. 0 % purity of distillate product can be produced by the dynamic optimization programming with two or more time intervals.

The theory of reactive-phase diagrams for two-phase systems, in which the components undergo one equilibrium chemical reaction, is developed, and the conditions for reactive-azeotropy are derived. It is shown that reactive-azeotropes do not necessarily correspond to stationary points in the chemical equilibrium surfaces. Reactive-phase diagrams, which illustrate {{the influence}} of chemical reactions on phase equilibria, are computed for some typical systems. These diagrams show that reactive-azeotropes can occur even for ideal mixtures. ^ The effect of equilibrium reactions on distillation processes is illustrated by studying the simple distillation of homogeneous reactive mixtures. The residue curve maps for some typical systems show that by allowing the components of a mixture to react we can either create or eliminate simple distillation boundaries. Moreover, the addition of reaction may prevent some non-reactive azeotropes from being obtained as products of the distillation process. ^ The study of the simple distillation of reactive mixtures led {{to the definition of}} a set of transformed composition variables that reduce the conservation equations for reactive mixtures to a form identical to that for non-reactive mixtures. These variables are used to simplify the design equations for single- and double-feed reactive distillation columns. These variables also allow the derivation of simple relationships between the dependent design variables, which are not evident when mole fractions are used. ^ The new design equations are used to devise a technique for the calculation of <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratios in single- and double-feed multicomponent reactive distillation columns. The design of reactive distillation columns for commercially important non-ideal mixtures is considered. The application of the results of this work to the synthesis of flow sheets for processes using reactive distillation is discussed. ...|$|E

The {{objective is to}} analyze {{the application of the}} short-cut techniques and heuristics (rules-of-thumb) to preliminary design, and obtain simple relationships for the distillation models. ^ Short-cut design methods and simple cost models are derived for conventional distillation and for some energy conserving distillation schemes for the separation of binary mixtures. Among the alternatives to conventional distillation columns, multiple-effect and vapor recompression are considered. The simple cost models are used to determine optimal reflux ratios and approach temperatures in the energy conserving distillation configurations. A thermodynamic analyses of the binary distillation schemes is done, and the concept of 2 ̆ 2 distillation efficiency 2 ̆ 2 is used to compare the performance configurations. Both the economic evaluation and the efficiency analysis, show that vapor recompression is preferred over the conventional system, {{especially in the case of}} closely-boiling mixtures. Of the various vapor recompression schemes, the reboiler-liquid-flashing alternative presents the most favorable performance. ^ In the sequencing problem, a simple analytical criterion was developed which can be used to obtain estimates of the optimal sequence of distillation columns for the separation of ideal multi-component mixtures. Also, simple analytical expressions for calculating the optimal pressure of the system, the reflux ratio and the cost of a separation are presented. The results and a sensitivity analyses made for a ternary mixture indicate that the direct sequence is preferred in most of the cases. The approach is also extended to quaternary mixtures. ^ Finally, short-cut techniques are developed to estimate the number of trays, <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratio and cost in more complex distillation schemes for ternary mixtures, such as sidestream distillation columns, with and without auxiliary columns. These schemes can give substantial savings compared with the conventional configurations for certain ranges of feed compositions. ...|$|E
40|$|A multiobjective genetic {{algorithm}} optimization of the extractive distillation process of acetone–methanol minimum azeotropic mixture with heavy entrainer water is investigated. The process includes the extractive and entrainer regeneration columns, and the optimization minimizes the energy cost objective function (OF) and total annual cost (TAC) and maximizes efficiency indicators Eext and eext that describe {{the ability of}} the extractive section to discriminate the product between the top and the bottom of that section. Earlier work (You et al. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2015, 54, 491) found that improvement of some designs in the literature led to an increase in those indicators. A two-step optimization strategy for extractive distillation is conducted to find suitable values of the entrainer feed flow rate, entrainer and azeotropic mixture feed locations, total number of trays, two reflux ratios, and two distillates in both the extractive column and the entrainer regeneration column. The first step relies upon the use of a nonsorted {{genetic algorithm}} (NSGA) with the four aforementioned criteria. Second, the best design taken from the GA Pareto front is further optimized focusing on decreasing the energy cost by using a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. In this way, the most suitable design with optimal efficiency indicators, low energy consumption, and low cost are obtained. Analyzed with respect to thermodynamic insights underlying the extractive section composition profile map, the Pareto front results show that there is maximum Eext at a given reflux ratio, and there is <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratio for a given Eext. There is an optimal efficiency indicator Eext,opt which corresponds to the minimum TAC taken as the best design. In other words, Eext,opt can be a criterion for the comparison between different designs for the same separating system. A SQP-based design is only < 1 % better in TAC than the best NSGA design, showing that this later method is able to find a consistent design for the extractive process concerning the 1. 0 - 1 a class mixture...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this contribution, a {{sequential}} and hierarchical {{approach for}} the feasibility analysis and the preliminary design of reactive distillation columns is extended to systems involving vapour phase chemical reaction and is successfully {{applied to the}} HI vapour phase decomposition to produce H 2. The complex phase and physico chemical behaviour of the quaternary HI-H 2 -I 2 -H 2 O system {{is represented by the}} Neumann's thermodynamic model and instantaneous vapour phase chemical equilibrium is assumed. Then, from minimal information concerning the physicochemical properties of the system, three successive steps lead to the design of the unit and the specification of its operating conditions: the feasibility analysis, the synthesis and the design step. First, the analysis of reactive condensation curve map method (rCCM), assuming infinite internal liquid and vapour flow rate and infinite reflux ratio, is used to assess the feasibility of the process. It determines the column structure and estimates the attainable compositions. These results are used as inputs data for the synthesis step. Based on the boundary value design method (BVD), considering finite internal liquid and vapour flow rate and finite reflux ratio while neglecting all thermal effects and assuming a constant heat of vaporisation, the synthesis step provides more precise information about the process configuration (<b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> ratio, number of theoretical stages, localisation and number of reactive plates, position of the feed plate). Finally, the BVD method results are used to initialise rigorous simulations, based on an equilibrium stage model with energy balance, to estimate the reflux ratio taking into account thermal effect on the process. The resulting design configuration consists in a single feed and entirely reactive distillation column. The column operates under a pressure of 22 bars. The feed of the reactive distillation column, coming from the Bunsen reaction section [xHI= 0. 10; xI 2 = 0. 39 xH 2 O= 0. 51], is at its boiling temperature. The residue consists in pure iodine. Water and produced hydrogen are recovered at the distillate. The column operates at a reflux ratio of 5 and is composed of 11 theoretical plates including the reboiler and the partial condenser with the feed at the stage 10 (counted downwards). The obtained HI dissociation yield is 99. 6 %...|$|E
40|$|Student Number : 9510423 G PhD Thesis School of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentTechniques for {{the design}} and {{analysis}} of simple column separations are well established. Shortcut design techniques have been employed in the initial design of these “traditional” distillation systems {{for a number of}} years and these columns are well understood. However, few currently available techniques are useful in the design of novel or complex configurations. The techniques that are available tend to be configuration specific. An all inclusive or universal, design and analysis tool, that can be applied to any and all configurations, is required. Tapp et al (2004) introduced Column Profile Maps (CPMS) as a means of addressing this issue. These are maps of composition profiles for column sections with defined net-molar-flow and reflux ratio. It is suggested that by producing CPMs for a configuration a designer can essentially superimpose these, determine feasible operating profiles and hence column operating parameters. In this thesis we show that this technique can be used to, not only produce quick and easy complex column designs but gain a comprehensive understanding of the steady-state operation of these arrangements. We demonstrate this analytical potential first by application of the CPM technique to the two-product feed distribution problem. It is shown that feed distribution can lower the minimum required reflux ratio for non-sharp separations and in some cases produce feasible separations from previously infeasible product specifications. A composition region of operation for all distributed feed policies is also found. The potential for detailed analysis, design and optimisation of complex configurations is demonstrated via application of the CPM procedure to the fully thermally coupled (Petlyuk) distillation column at both sharp and non-sharp split conditions. A detailed design methodology for any configuration results from this. It is found that the Petlyuk column can operate under five possible bulk/net flow conditions and that very interesting and counter-intuitive net-molar-flows are possible. A feasible column parameter region equivalent to the optimality region (Halvorsen and Skogestad, 2001) is found for zeotropic systems. Importantly a <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> condition for the Petlyuk column is found. This condition can be applied to all zeotropic systems for all product specifications. It is also demonstrated that the CPM technique can be used for design optimisation of separation systems...|$|E
40|$|While it {{has been}} known for about 130 years that azeotropes are {{influenced}} by changing pressure, this fact has never been fully exploited. In this dissertation it is shown how pressure effects can be used to advantage or can foil attempts to distill homogeneous azeotropic mixtures and how an analysis of the fixed points of the distillation model leads to new important insights into extractive distillations. ^ As the pressure varies, not only the composition but also the number of azeotropes can change. A change in the number of azeotropes corresponds to a transcritical bifurcation. A bifurcation-theoretic treatment provides a model-independent method for locating global changes in the residue-curve map of a mixture as the pressure changes and for predicting the presence of severe tangent pinches. ^ Existing methods for synthesizing thermally-integrated distillation sequences frequently fail when applied to nonideal and azeotropic systems because changing column pressures often introduces new azeotropes and distillation boundaries into the mixture, which make some separation tasks infeasible. A new, systematic thermal-integration procedure is presented that combines a bifurcation and residue-curve map analysis with the method of Andrecovich and Westerberg and results in substantial energy savings. ^ A new pressure-swing distillation process is presented that makes it possible to separate mixtures in which the desired products lie in different distillation regions when one end of the distillation boundary is a pressure-sensitive azeotrope. Thus pressure-insensitive binary azeotropes can be separated using novel entrainers that form pressure-sensitive distillation boundaries. ^ In addition to a <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux,</b> every extractive distillation also exhibits a maximum reflux, above which the desired separation is impossible, and a minimum entrainer flow rate, below which the separation is also impossible. Both of these quantities are shown to correspond to bifurcations of the finite-difference equations describing the middle section of the column and, given a VLE model, both can be easily calculated knowing only information about the column feed and the desired product compositions [...] i. e., prior to any column design calculations. ^ Both the minimum entrainer flow and the maximum reflux ratio have important implications for extractive distillations. A comparison of minimum entrainer flows provides a simple method to discriminate between entrainers with the same feasible residue-curve map. A heuristic is presented for estimating a near optimal design value of the entrainer flow. Maximum reflux results in the separation becoming more difficult at both low and high reflux ratios, requiring nonstandard control action in certain reflux ranges. ...|$|E
40|$|Dispersed niobia {{catalysts}} {{were prepared}} via a non-aqueous synthesis route. The {{effects of the}} type of oxide support, the support thermal pre-treatment, the calcination temperature and the niobia loading on the activity and selectivity for mesityl oxide (MO) synthesis at 160 C were investigated in an autoclave reactor. The morphological and chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized via EDXRF, XRD, BET and Raman spectroscopy. The strength and nature of the acid sites were elucidated via in situ DRIFT spectra of the adsorption of pyridine as well as the temperature programmed desorption of NH 3 interacting with the surface oxide phase. All four catalyst parameters had significant effects on the catalytic properties. Significantly, the nature of the acidity was clearly linked to the catalyst activity and particularly the catalyst stability. Catalysts exhibiting predominantly Lewis acidity invariably deactivated despite good initial activity, with the final acetone conversion dependent on the catalyst formulation. In contrast, catalysts exhibiting Bronsted acidity showed no evidence of catalyst deactivation after 8 hours of reaction. A plausible mechanism which explains these observations is proposed. Catalysts exhibiting Lewis acidity were more active when the supports were first activated at elevated temperature, likely due to a stronger support-surface oxide interaction as a consequence of increased surface coordinative unsaturation of the support. SiO¬ 2 supported catalysts exhibiting Bronsted acidity were more active if the supports were initially activated at 100 C. Evidently, the hydroxyl groups on the oxide support contribute to the generation of Bronsted acidity. Different oxide supports gave rise to distinct acidic and catalytic properties in the niobia overlayer. The most striking example of this was the direct comparison of niobia dispersed onto two kinds of silica supports following the same preparative method. Unique and very strong acid sites were observed in niobia dispersed onto a commercial SiO¬ 2 catalyst carrier that were not observed in niobia dispersed onto fumed SiO¬ 2. For SiO 2 catalysts, the activity increased linearly with niobia loading regardless of calcination temperature. In contrast, Al 2 O 3 catalysts exhibited an initial increase in activity for MO synthesis with niobia loading followed by a decrease in activity after reaching a maximum activity below 1 / 3 monolayer coverage. The effect was more pronounced for catalysts exhibiting Bronsted acidity. It is proposed that adlineation sites are primarily responsible for catalytic activity in Nb 2 O 5 /-Al 2 O 3 catalysts exhibiting Bronsted acidity. Niobia catalysts were developed using commercially available catalyst carriers as supports. The macrokinetics of MO and MIBK syntheses were investigated in a benchtop fixed bed flow reactor. The catalysts showed excellent activity for MO and MIBK syntheses at 160 °C, typically 0. 9 to 1. 3 [g/hr*gcat]. However, the MIBK selectivity was constrained from 82 to 85 % due to the coproduction of 2 -propanol and diisobutyl ketone. The productivity for MO synthesis was found to be strongly dependent on the space velocity suggesting product inhibition. The intrinsic kinetics of the one-step synthesis of MIBK over a 15. 2 wt% Pd/Nb 2 O 5 /SiO 2 catalyst was investigated in an autoclave reactor. A kinetic model was developed and is reported. The one step synthesis of MIBK was investigated at the pilot plant scale via catalytic distillation (CD). An important finding was that while operating at 100 % reflux, the accumulation of water in the reactive section resulted in the suppression of the DAA dehydration reaction. The in situ removal of water from the reactive section via an overhead distillate stream operating at 83 to 97 % reflux directly resulted in an increase in MIBK productivity and hydrogen uptake efficiency by factors of about 20 yielding a moisture free reboiler product stream with as high as 53 wt% MIBK. The process was found to be controlled by the external mass transfer of hydrogen. Interestingly, the results suggest that the catalyst wetting efficiency affects the transport of hydrogen to the active sites as evidenced by the dependence of MO conversion on the reflux flow rate. The condition of <b>minimum</b> <b>reflux</b> flow rate and maximum hydrogen flow rate resulted in 97 % MO conversion and 90 wt% MIBK selectivity...|$|E
