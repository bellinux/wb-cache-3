A total of 120 teeth was tested, 40 per sealer namely AH26, Sultan, and Sealapex; 20 each with and without the smear layer. The teeth were split longitudinally, and the internal surfaces were ground flat. In the smear layer-free specimens the smear layer was removed by washing for 3 minutes with 17% EDTA followed by 5.25% NaOCl. Using a specially designed jig, the sealer was placed into a 4-mm wide × 4-mm deep well which was then set onto the tooth at a 90-degree angle and allowed to set for 7 days. This set-up was then placed into a <b>mounting</b> <b>jig</b> which was designed for the Instron Universal Testing Machine so that only a tensile load was applied without shearing. The set-up was subjected to a tensile load at a crosshead speed of 1 mm per min.

Nine students from the 8 th and 10 th periods of the Federal University of Goias, aged over 18 years and whom presented complete natural dentition were included in the study. The four cast maxillaries of each subject were mounted in a single semi-adjustable articulator, using one of the following mounting techniques: face-bow, universal <b>mounting</b> <b>jig</b> of 0 º, of 15 º or universal <b>mounting</b> <b>jig</b> of 20 º. On each side of the articulator three points were defined: one in the articulator (A, in the condylar region) and two in the cast (B and C). Images were obtained on each side of the articulator. Using Image J software, "the angle " "β " formed by the intersection of the line segments AB/BC was acquired. The level of significance was set at α = 0. 05. Results. Only the universal <b>mounting</b> <b>jig</b> of 15 degrees was not significantly different to the face-bow.

We have studied a retrograde locking nail technique through a 2.5 -cm incision in the non-weightbearing part of the sole of the foot. Remaining cartilage in the ankle joint, where necessary, was percutaneously removed through an anterior approach and the locking nail was inserted after reaming of os calcis, talus and tibia. Locking screw insertion was in the sagittal plane (p.a. direction), in talus os calcis and tibial diaphysis using a nail <b>mounted</b> <b>jig.</b> Ten patients were entered in the study (age 27 - 60 years). The initial aetiology for attempted fusion was post-traumatic in nine cases and rheumatic in one case. There were 25 previous operations in the cohort not leading to fusion. An additional temporary external fixator was used in four cases to reach and maintain the optimum position for the procedure. The intervention time was 30 - 75 min. Dynamisation of the nail was performed after four months under local anaesthesia. The mean duration of follow-up was 4 years (3 - 5.5 years). Radiologically and clinically, fusion was achieved in 16 weeks (range, 12 - 20 weeks). There was no loosening of the implant or implant failure. A leg length discrepancy was avoided using this technique. There was one complication with varus malunion in a heavy smoker which united after corrective osteotomy, revision nailing and bone grafting.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Accurate {{determination}} of working length during endodontic therapy {{is critical in}} achieving a predictable and successful outcome. Working length {{is determined by the}} use of electronic apex locators, tactile perception, knowledge of average tooth lengths and dental radiography. Due to the increasing use of digital radiography in clinical practice, a comparison with conventional film in working length determination is justified. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine if there is a difference between Schick digital radiography and Kodak Ultra-speed film in the accurate {{determination of}} working lengths when vertical angulation of the object is variable. Twelve teeth with # 15 K-flex files at varying known lengths from the anatomical apex were mounted in a resin-plaster mix to simulate bone density. A <b>mounting</b> <b>jig</b> for the standardization of projection geometries allowed for exact changes in vertical angulation as it related to the object (tooth) and the film/sensor. Each tooth was imaged using Schick CDR and Kodak Ultra-speed film at varying angles with a consistent source-film distance and exposure time. Four dental professionals examined the images and films independently and measured the distance from the tip of the file to radiographic apex and recorded their results. The error in working length was calculated as the observed value minus the known working length for each tooth type. A mixed-effects, full-factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to model the error in working length. Included in the ANOVA model were fixed effects for type of image, vertical angulation, and the interaction of angle and film type. Tooth type and examiner were included in the model as random effects assuming a compound symmetry covariance structure. The repeatability of each examiner, for each film type, was assessed by estimating the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC was determined when 12 randomly selected images and radiographs were reevaluated 10 days after initial measurements. The repeatability of each examiner for Schick CDR was good with ICCs ranging from 0. 67 to 1. 0. Repeatability for the conventional film was poor with ICCs varying from - 0. 29 to 0. 55. We found the error in the working length was not significantly different between film types (p = 0. 402). After adjusting for angle, we found that error in the working length from the digital image was only 0. 02 mm greater (95 -percent CI: - 0. 03, 0. 06) than the conventional film. Furthermore, there was not a significant difference among the angles (p = 0. 246) nor in the interaction of image type with angle (p = 0. 149). Based on the results of our study, we conclude that there is not a statistically significant difference in determining working length between Schick CDR and Kodak Ektaspeed film when vertical angulation is modified...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} color changes and force degradation of orthodontic elastomeric ligatures in different stretching patterns during a 8 -weeks period. METHODS: Two elastomers with the minimum and two with the maximum color changing, and gray elastomers of two brands (American Orthodontics and Ortho Technology) were selected according to an opinion poll with clinicians and color changes after 4 weeks of intraoral use were evaluated. These elastomers were <b>mounted</b> on special <b>jigs</b> fabricated using a CAD-CAM technique, underwent different stretching patterns and the force was measured in 0, 24 hours, 2, 4 and 8 weeks. During in vivo part of the study, force levels of elastomers were measured after 4 weeks on a material testing machine. Data were analyzed with four-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests. RESULTS: All the elastomers showed color changing but the degree of color stability was significantly different. The mean force degradation was higher in 1 -mm stretch groups. After 8 weeks, the average residual force of elastomers was 1. 45 ± 0. 18 N and the maximum force decay was seen in the elastomers that exhibited the maximum initial force. CONCLUSION: There is significant relationship between the stretching pattern and the amount of residual force of elastomers. Elastomers with higher initial forces exhibited higher percentages of force loss after 8 weeks. It seems that there is a relationship between initial color and color changing of elastomers...|$|R
40|$|Provisional crowns may be {{used for}} many weeks during healing of soft tissues, while other dental {{procedures}} are being performed and whilst the permanent restorations are being fabricated. The provisional occlusion they present serves a diagnostic purpose for fine tuning biological and biomechanical requirements. They need to be strong enough to withstand masticatory forces during this time, as it is costly, inconvenient and time consuming to repair breakages. There is no ideal provisional crown material, and new products appear on the market regularly. Dentists need to know which perform best in terms of strength, durability, ease of use, aesthetics and cost to facilitate selection and purchase. This study was undertaken to compare the compressive strengths of seven different provisional crown materials, consisting of three acrylic resins, three composites and one CAD/CAM fabricated sample set. A custom-made stainless steel split mould was constructed having a circular opening of 4 mm in diameter and 6 mm in-depth and was used to prepare ten specimens for each material. For the composites, the various materials were syringed into the circular openings and compacted using a ball burnisher. After five minutes, specimens were removed. The heat cured acrylic resin specimens were further processed in a pressure pot for five minutes. All samples were stored in distilled water at 370 C for 24 hours before being tested. Test specimens were <b>mounted</b> into a <b>jig</b> on the Instron machine and loaded under a compressive force until they fractured or the compression limit was reached.

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Although bonding to all-ceramic restorations is desirable, {{there is}} little {{information}} {{on the use of}} resin cements containing a phosphate monomer, and the importance of different surface treatments on their adhesion to high-strength core materials. PURPOSE: This study attempted to determine the shear bond strength values between Panavia 21 resin cement (Kuraray) and an alumina core material (In-Ceram) after 3 surface treatments and the application of a silane coupling agent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five In-Ceram cylindrical rods were fabricated and assigned to 3 groups. Group I specimens were treated with a 9. 5 % hydrofluoric (HF) acid, group II with a 5 % HF acid, and group III were sandblasted. All specimens were coated with a silane coupling agent (Cavex Clearfil Photobond and Activator) before cementation with Panavia 21 to sandblasted nickel-chromium rods. As a control, group IV consisted of 8 porcelain (Vitadur Alpha) rods treated with a 5 % HF acid and silane. All specimens were subjected to a load of 1. 2 kg during cementation, then stored under water for 36 hours. A <b>jig</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Hounsfield Universal Testing machine was used at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min to test the shear bond strengths. RESULTS: The results were 14. 65 +/- 4. 64 MPa for group I, 18. 03 +/- 6. 13 MPa for group II, and 22. 35 +/- 5. 98 MPa for group III In-Ceram specimens; and 18. 05 +/- 8. 46 MPa for control (group IV). CONCLUSION: The use of Panavia 21 resin cement and a silane coupling agent can achieve a successful bond between either sandblasted or 5 % HF acid-etched In-Ceram core material. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This {{in vitro}} study {{investigated}} and compared the fracture strength and behaviour patterns {{of a conventional}} posterior composite resin, a composite resin reinforced with nano-scale electrospun glass-fibres and a conventional composite resin placed on a fibre substructure, all used in cusp-replacing posterior composite resin restorations. Methods: Seventy-five extracted, lower, left, first and second molars were prepared to accept standardized restorations replacing the mesio-lingual cusp. The specimens were randomly divided into 3 groups of 25 each: Group A (control) was restored with a conventional posterior composite resin, Group B was restored with the composite resin reinforced with nano-scale electrospun glass fibres and Group C was restored with a conventional posterior composite resin reinforced with a fibre substructure. All restored specimens were thermocycled for 500 cycles between 5 ° C and 55 ° C with a dwell time of 30 seconds, then imbedded in plastic cylinders in acrylic resin. The specimens were loaded at a 30 ° angle to the long axis of the tooth, using a <b>jig</b> <b>mounted</b> in a universal testing machine until fracture occurred. Fracture strength was recorded and specimens were then stained to highlight fracture patterns and subsequently studied under a microscope. Fractures were classified as restorable/non-restorable. Sub-classification included adhesive and cohesive failures. Results: Compared to Group A both techniques of fibre inclusion significantly strengthened the cusp-replacing composite restoration (ANOVA p = 0. 05) Compared to Groups A and B the group of restorations placed on a fibre sub-structure (Group C) exhibited significantly more fractures that were classed as restorable. Compared to Group A and C the group restored with the composite resin reinforced with nano scale electrospun glass fibres (Group B) displayed significantly more fractures that were classed as non-restorable (Fisher s Exact Test p = 0. 05). Conclusion: Both fibre inclusion techniques significantly strengthened cuspreplacing posterior composite restorations.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis deals with the analysis of a microwave Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) on a conical dielectric radome illuminated by a feed hom located at the base. Two approaches have been adopted to solve this problem. The first approach is to calculate the element currents {{under the assumption that}} the surface is locally flat. Consequently, the element current at that locality can be determined by employing Floquet modal analysis. The local incidence has been modelled from the radiation pattern of the source or the aperture fields of the feed. Three types of feed model were used to account for the field illumination on the radome. The transmitted fields from the curved surface are obtained from the sum of the radiated fields due to the equivalent magnetic and electric current sources distributed in each local unit cell of the conical surface. This method treats the interaction of neighbouring FSS elements only. In the second approach the curvature is taken into account by dividing the each element into segments which conform to the curved surface. An integral formulation is used {{to take into account the}} interaction of all the elements. The current source in each FSS element from the formulation is solved using the method of moments (MOM) technique. A linear system of simultaneous equations is obtained from the MOM and has been solved using elimination method and an iterative method which employs conjugate gradients. The performance of both methods has been compared with regard to the speed of computations and the memory storage capability. New formulations using quasi static approximations have been derived to account for thin dielectric backing in the curved aperture FSS analysis. Computer models have been developed to predict the radiation performance of the curved(conical) FSS. Experiments were performed in an anechoic chamber where the FSS cone was <b>mounted</b> on a <b>jig</b> resting on a turntable. The measuring setup contained a sweep oscillator that supplied power to a transmitting feed placed at the base of the cone. Amplitude and phase values of the far field radiation pattern of the cone were measured with the aid of a vector network analyser. Cones with different dimensions and FSS element geometries were constructed and the measured transmission losses and radiation patterns compared with predictions...|$|R
40|$|Adiabatic {{demagnetization}} refrigerators (ADR) are {{operated in}} space to cool detectors of cosmic radiation {{to a few}} 10 s of mK. A key element of the ADR is a superconducting magnet operating at about 0. 3 K that is continually energized and de-energized in synchronism with a thermal switch, such that a piece of paramagnetic salt is alternately warm in a high magnetic field and cold in zero magnetic field. This causes the salt pill or refrigerant to cool, and {{it is able to}} suck heat from an object, e. g., the sensor, to be cooled. Current has to be fed {{into and out of the}} magnets from a dissipative power supply at the ambient temperature of the spacecraft. The current leads that link the magnets to the power supply inevitably conduct a significant amount of heat into the colder regions of the supporting cryostat, resulting in the need for larger, heavier, and more powerful supporting refrigerators. The aim of this project was to design and construct high-temperature superconductor (HTS) leads from YBCO (yttrium barium copper oxide) composite conductors to reduce the heat load significantly in the temperature regime below the critical temperature of YBCO. The magnet lead does not have to support current in the event that the YBCO ceases to be superconducting. Cus - tomarily, a normal metal conductor in parallel with the YBCO is a necessary part of the lead structure to allow for this upset condition; however, for this application, the normal metal can be dispensed with. Amorphous silicon dioxide is deposited directly onto the surface of YBCO, which resides on a flexible substrate. The silicon dioxide protects the YBCO from chemically reacting with atmospheric water and carbon dioxide, thus preserving the superconducting properties of the YBCO. The customary protective coating for flexible YBCO conductors is silver or a silver/gold alloy, which conducts heat many orders of magnitude better than SiO 2 and so limits the use of such a composite conductor for passing current across a thermal gradient with as little flow of heat as possible to make an efficient current lead. By protecting YBCO on a flexible substrate of low thermal conductivity with SiO 2, a thermally efficient and flexible current lead can be fabricated. The technology is also applicable to current leads for 4 K superconducting electronics current biasing. A commercially available thin-film YBCO composite tape conductor is first stripped of its protective silver coating. It is then <b>mounted</b> on a <b>jig</b> that holds the sample flat and acts as a heat sink. Silicon dioxide is then deposited onto the YBCO to a thickness of about 1 micron using PECVD (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition), without heating the YBCO to the point where degradation occurs. Since SiO 2 can have good high-frequency electrical properties, it can be used to coat YBCO cable structures used to feed RF signals across temperature gradients. The prime embodiment concerns the conduction of DC current across the cryogenic temperature gradient. The coating is hard and electrically insulating, but flexible...|$|R
