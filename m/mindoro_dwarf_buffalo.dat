50|$|The tamaraw or <b>Mindoro</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>buffalo</b> (Bubalus mindorensis) is a small, hoofed mammal {{belonging}} to the family Bovidae. It is endemic to the island of Mindoro in the Philippines, {{and is the only}} endemic Philippine bovine. It is believed, however, to have once also thrived on the larger island of Luzon. The tamaraw was originally found all over Mindoro, from sea level up to the mountains (2000 meters above sea level), but because of human habitation, hunting, and logging, it is now restricted to only a few remote grassy plains and is now an endangered species.|$|E

5000|$|S. c. nanus (forest <b>buffalo,</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>buffalo)</b> is the {{smallest}} subspecies; the height at the withers is less than 120 cm and average weight is about 270 kg. The color is red, with darker patches {{on the head and}} shoulders, and in the ears, forming a brush. The <b>dwarf</b> <b>buffalo</b> is common in forest areas of Central and West Africa. This subspecies is so different from the standard model, some researchers consider it still a separate species, S. nanus. Hybrids between the typical subspecies and dwarf are not uncommon.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{objective is to}} estimate and study the genaral picture of <b>dwarf</b> <b>buffalo</b> (Bubalus sp) in oder that their presence around can still be recorded and better managed in Sulawesi. Descriptive research method was used by applying line transect to observe population quadrat transect was used to analyze habitat composition. Based on footprints found, there were estimated that were about less that 12 adult, 8 teenagers and 5 young <b>dwarf</b> <b>buffaloes</b> around within 13 obrvation points with density of 1. 23 dwarf buffaloes/km 2 or around 1 – 2 per square kilometres. For habitat vegetaton, there were about 85 species function as supporting habitat and about 33 species as food sources. Laboratory analysis noted that soil texture on the sites are clay with salinity level of 0. 72 µS/cm. In addition, it was recorded that the temperature during the morning time were about 140 C – 180 C, 180 C – 200 C during the noon time, and arond 200 C – 150 C during the evening time. To summarize, the population sze of <b>dwarf</b> <b>buffalo</b> can be conculded as low leading to extinction if illegal hunting and habitat destruction continuously occu...|$|R

50|$|There are 127 known {{mammalian}} {{species in}} Sulawesi. A {{large percentage of}} these mammals, 62% (79 species) are endemic, meaning that they are found nowhere else in Indonesia or the world. The largest native mammals in Sulawesi are the two species of anoa or <b>dwarf</b> <b>buffalo.</b> Other mammalian species inhabiting Sulawesi are the babirusas, which are aberrant pigs, the Sulawesi palm civet, and primates including a number of tarsiers (the spectral, Dian's, Lariang and pygmy species) and several species of macaque, including the crested black macaque, the moor macaque and the booted macaque. Although virtually all Sulawesi's mammals are placental, and generally have close relatives in Asia, several species of cuscus, marsupials of Australasian origin, are also present.|$|R

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{position of}} the Anoa is discussed, with reference to its nomenclature and taxonomic history. Two distinct types of Anoa are found all over Celebes, a large one with white legs, long tail and rugged horns, and a small one with legs mainly the same colour as the body, short tail and conical horns. There is some indication that the small Anoa inhabits mountainous areas. In {{the absence of any}} evidence of intergradation they must be classed as two distinct species; since the Anoa is closely related to the Indian Buffalo and the Tamarao, the two must be called Bubalus (Anoa) depressicornis and B. (A.) quarlesi. The definitive fusion of vomer to palatines is a long-established character; according to Pilgrim (1939) it was shown already in the Dhok Pathan (Plio-The Anoa is the <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Buffalo</b> of Celebes. While closely similar to the Asiatic Buffalo (Bubalus), many authors (Mohr, 1921; Pilgrim, 1939; Hooijer, 1948, 1950) have regarded the Anoa as forming a genus on its own, Anoa H. Smith, 1827.

40|$|Endemic bovids are {{intriguing}} {{elements of}} insular faunas. The living species include the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) and the Formosan serow (C. swinhoei), the tamaraw from Mindoro, Philippines, (Bubalus mindorensis) and the anoas (B. depressicornis and B. quarlesi), 2 species of <b>dwarf</b> <b>buffalos</b> endemic to Sulawesi, Indonesia. Fossil endemic bovids are only recorded in some Asian, North American and Western Mediterranean islands. Here {{we present a}} comprehensive overview {{of the changes in}} body size and evolutionary patterns exhibited by both extant and extinct insular bovids. Our appraisal indicates that each insular representative of Bovidae shows its own peculiar evolutionary model, albeit some parallel trends exist (e. g. reduction in body size, allometric changes in limb bones, alteration of the life history traits). Some changes in morphology (e. g. the simplification of horn cores, the increase in hypsodonty, the acquisition of a 'low-gear' locomotion), for instance, appear as common, albeit not general, patterns triggered by a combination of selective forces. Body size patterns support the 'generality of the island rule' and suggest that biotic interaction had/have a major role in influencing body size evolution in these species, although in different ways on different islands. All things considered, available evidence suggest that {{a major role in the}} evolution of insular bovids is played by the structure of the insular community, the nature of available niches and by the dynamics of ecological interactions...|$|R
5000|$|Western lowland gorillas are tracked in the Dzanga-Sangha Reserve in {{the south}} of the Central African Republic, apart from {{witnessing}} elephants in groups of 30-100 bathing in mud pools and feeding. Forest elephants, heavily poached in the past, found only in the rain forests, are comparatively smaller in size in relation with the elephants found in the savanna habitat; even their ivory are stated to be harder, stronger with a different shade called the [...] "pink or hot ivory". Likewise, forest buffaloes found here, also called the <b>dwarf</b> <b>buffaloes,</b> are shorter in size compared to those found in the savanna. Black rhino (Diceros bicornis) is now reported to be an extinct species in the CRA dropping [...] "from 3000 to 0". Due to poaching and diseases caused due to introduction of illegal cattle transhumance, elephant (Loxodonta africana) and buffon kob (Kobus kob) populations declined by over 80% each, over a period of 20 years.Breeding of elephants in the dry months of December to March and July-August has some interesting aspects. Males are said to be in rut or musth when it is noted that secretions appear near their head as dark stains combined with continuous dribbling of urine. During this musth time they roam in the forest in search of females in estrous state, based on smell and the “estrous song”, which the females belt out, which are heard over several miles in the forest. Hunting of elephants is totally prohibited.|$|R
40|$|Ecosystem {{services}} generate {{benefits that}} enter human consumption {{either directly or}} indirectly via their contribution to human production activities. In this contribution, we provide evidence that (i) the demand of peasants for ecosystem services in rural Indonesia depends on relative poverty; and that (ii) the type of reaction to poverty depends on the specific relation of the ecosystem services to peasant production and consumption. In early 2005 a representative choice experiment study was conducted in the Lore Lindu area in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to quantify regional economic preferences (marginal willingessto- pay: MWTP) for four different ecosystem services (n= 249; rattan and water availability, shading in cacao agroforestry, population size of the endemic forest dwelling <b>dwarf</b> <b>buffalo</b> "anoa"). Relative poverty was calculated with the 2005 data using a 0, 1 -normally distributed relative poverty index developed from a socio-demographic household survey administered to the same sample in 2004. For shading in cocoa, a linearly decreasing trend is observed indicating a stronger preference for "sun-grown" cocoa in the less poor farmers indicating a constant poverty elasticity of WTP. The empirical poverty elasticity for anoa supports its luxury good characteristic only in part. For rattan and water, we find an inverted U-shape relation between MWTP for ecosystem services and relative poverty - probably due to serious restrictions in the ability to pay in the poorest households and a smaller resource dependency in the less poor households. In sum, the relationship between relative poverty and MWTP for ecosystem services appears more complex than classical micro-economic theory admits.
