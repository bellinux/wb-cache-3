25|$|In 2003, The UK ECT Review group {{published}} a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing ECT to placebo and antidepressant drugs. This meta-analysis demonstrated a large effect size (high efficacy {{relative to the}} <b>mean</b> <b>in</b> terms of the standard deviation) for ECT versus placebo, and versus antidepressant drugs.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} that a value is of a certain distance from the mean can subsequently be calculated from the relation between standard score and prediction intervals. For example, a standard score of 2.58 corresponds to a prediction interval of 99%, corresponding to a probability of 0.5% that a result is at least such far from the <b>mean</b> <b>in</b> the absence of disease.|$|E

When this requirement is violated this is called heteroscedasticity, in such case a more efficient estimator would be weighted least squares. If the errors have infinite variance then the OLS estimates will also have infinite variance (although by the law of large numbers they will nonetheless tend toward the true values so long as the errors have zero <b>mean).</b> <b>In</b> this case, robust estimation techniques are recommended.|$|E

25|$|When Frondizi took office, he {{fulfilled}} {{his promise}} {{of maintaining a}} united CGT. Three groups of trade unions operated under the CGT umbrella at the time, and the idea was fiercely opposed by the 32s and 19s, since one centralized trade union would <b>mean,</b> <b>in</b> practice, that the workers movement would be controlled by the Peronists. The government faced two options, one was an election in which the proportional representation system was used; the other option was an electoral system which hand control of the trade unions to the majority (Peronist). Frondizi reversed Aramburu's attempts to de-Peronize labor, promptly returning six unions to their Peronist leadership, and appointing one of their own, Alfredo Allende, as Labor Minister.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, the Dean and Chapter {{commissioned}} public artist Martin Firrell {{to create}} a major public artwork to mark the 300th anniversary of the topping-out of Wren's building. The Question Mark Inside consisted of digital text projections to the cathedral dome, West Front and inside onto the Whispering Gallery. The text was based on blog contributions {{by the general public}} as well as interviews conducted by the artist and on the artist's own views. The project presented a stream of possible answers to the question: 'What makes life meaningful and purposeful, and what does St Paul's <b>mean</b> <b>in</b> that contemporary context?' The Question Mark Inside opened on 8 November 2008 and ran for eight nights.|$|E
25|$|In {{probability}} theory, Chebyshev's inequality (also spelled as Tchebysheff's inequality, , {{also called}} Bienaymé-Chebyshev inequality) guarantees that, {{for a wide}} class of probability distributions, {{no more than a}} certain fraction of values can be more than a certain distance from the mean. Specifically, no more than 1/k2 of the distribution's values can be more than k standard deviations away from the mean (or equivalently, at least 1−1/k2 of the distribution's values are within k standard deviations of the mean). The rule is often called Chebyshev's theorem, about the range of standard deviations around the <b>mean,</b> <b>in</b> statistics. The inequality has great utility because it can be applied to any probability distribution in which the mean and variance are defined. For example, {{it can be used to}} prove the weak law of large numbers.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s Leeds College of Art was the {{starting}} point for the careers of the sculptors Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore, and in the 1950s, and 60s {{it was one of the}} leading centres for radical art education in Britain under the guidance of artists such as Harry Thubron and Tom Hudson, and the art historian Norbert Lynton. Their attempts to redefine what art education should <b>mean</b> <b>in</b> the post-Second World War period led the artist Patrick Heron to claim in 1971 in The Guardian newspaper that 'Leeds is the most influential art school in Europe since the Bauhaus'. This willingness to push at the boundaries of acceptable public behaviour from artists was also evident in 1966 when Leeds College of Art staged an exhibition of paintings by the Cypriot artist Stass Paraskos, who taught at the College, which was raided by the police after allegations of obscenity.|$|E

25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should <b>mean,</b> <b>in</b> light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to make South African courts more just in their convictions, the concept of extenuating {{circumstances}} came into being. However, no concrete definition of extenuating circumstances was ever made. The South African courts began using the testimony of expert social psychologists to define what extenuating circumstances would <b>mean</b> <b>in</b> the justice system. Examples include: deindividuation, bystander apathy, and conformity. In the case of S. vs. Sibisi and Others (1989) eight members of the South African Railways and Harbours Union were involved in the murder of four workers who chose not to join in the SARHWU strike. Psychologists Scott Fraser and Andrew Colman presented evidence for the defense using research from social psychology. Social anthropologist Boet Kotzé provided evidence for the defense as well. He testified that African cultures are characterized by a collective consciousness. Kotzé testified that the collective conscious contributed to the defendants' willingness to act with the group rather than act as individuals. Fraser and Colman stated that bystander apathy, deindividuation, conformity and group polarization were extenuating factors in the killing of the four strike breakers. They explained that deindividuation may affect group members' ability to realize that they are still accountable for their individual actions even when with a group. They also used research on bystander apathy by Latané and Darley to illustrate why four of the eight defendants watched as the other four defendants killed four men. The testimonies of Fraser and Colman helped four of the defendants escape the death penalty.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} standard and non-standard linguistic <b>means</b> <b>in</b> three novels by Michal Viewegh. Novels were selected as follows: Výchova dívek v Čechách, Zapisovatelé otcovský lásky and Román pro muže. Linguistic means found were classified and their function in novels was determined. Classification of non-standard means was done according to summary compiled {{in compliance with}} the contemporary stylistics. General description of non-standard level Czech function in the literature was a basis for determination of function of non-standard linguistic means. Basic function of non-standard <b>means</b> <b>in</b> specific novels by Michal Viewegh is the characterizing one. A non-standard level Czech is often used in emotive situations and language of youth. This level of Czech expresses personal relations of speakers to other persons.

There were too many questions (his parentage) and teased confrontations (the White Walkers) that would be left unresolved, and the show's entire Wall story line would be left with a bastard-sized hole in the middle." [...] Egner also referred to the previous plot in the show involving Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, and speculated what it could <b>mean</b> <b>in</b> regards to Jon Snow's personality being changed, or becoming less of his former self, as with Dondarrion. Sarah Larson of The New Yorker also reviewed the episode positively, saying, [...] "Last night's episode, still catching us up on all the characters while continuing to move its armies of plot lines forward, was full of fratricide, patricide, head-crushing, infanticide, trompe-l'oeil eyeballs, eunuch jokes, and glorious returns." ...|$|E
