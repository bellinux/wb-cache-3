5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by acidic water or because it passed through the digestive tract of a predator. The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four <b>main</b> <b>roots,</b> which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to that of}} Nectomys, {{the skull}} is lightly built and has narrow nasals and a broad, round braincase without {{conspicuous}} ridges on it. The zygomatic plate is broad. The incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of the palate) extend between the first molars and are broadest in their back halves. The broad mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate, is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities. The molar crowns are not as simplified as in Nectomys species, but the front cusps of the upper (anterocone) and lower first molar (anteroconid) are not divided in two. In addition to the <b>main</b> <b>roots,</b> the upper and lower first molars have smaller additional roots.|$|E
5|$|The molars are high-crowned (hypsodont) and planar, {{with the}} main cusps {{as high as the}} crests {{connecting}} them, a configuration shared only with Holochilus and Carletonomys among oryzomyines. The first molars are the longest and the third molars are longer but narrower than the second molars. The molars lack many accessory ridges, including the anteroloph on the first upper molar, the posteroloph on the first and second upper molar, and the anterolophid and mesolophid on all lower molars. The first and second upper molar have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the first lower molar, the anteroconid, encloses a large internal pit. Most of the folds between the cusps and crests are open at the margins of the molars, but two—the posteroflexid on the lower second molar and the entoflexid on the lower third molar—are closed by a wall, or cingulum, at the inner margin of the tooth. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side and the lower molars have a single root at the front and back of each molar; in addition, the first upper molar has another labial root and the first lower molar has a small labial and usually also a small lingual root located between the <b>main</b> <b>roots.</b>|$|E
40|$|The most unique {{components}} of Ginkgo biloba extracts are terpene trilactones (TTLs) including ginkgolides and bilobalide. Study of TTLs biosynthesis has been stagnant in recent years. Metabolic profiling of 40 compounds, including TTLs, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, were globally analyzed in leaf, fibrous <b>root,</b> <b>main</b> <b>root,</b> old stem and young stem extracts of G. biloba. Most of the flavonoids were mainly {{distributed in the}} leaf and old stem. Most of phenolic acids were generally distributed among various tissues. The total content of TTLs decreased {{in the order of}} the leaf, fibrous <b>root,</b> <b>main</b> <b>root,</b> old stem and young stem. The TTLs were further analyzed {{in different parts of the}} <b>main</b> <b>root</b> and old stem. The content of TTLs decreases in the order of the <b>main</b> <b>root</b> periderm, the <b>main</b> <b>root</b> cortex and phloem and the <b>main</b> <b>root</b> xylem. In old stems, the content of TTLs in the cortex and phloem was much higher than both the old stem periderm and xylem. The expression patterns of five key genes in the ginkgolide biosynthetic pathway were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-Q-PCR). Combining metabolic profiling and RT-Q-PCR, the results showed that the fibrous <b>root</b> and <b>main</b> <b>root</b> periderm tissues were the important biosynthesis sites of ginkgolides. Based on the above results, a model of the ginkgolide biosynthesis site and transport pathway in G. biloba was proposed. In this putative model, ginkgolides are synthesized in the fibrous <b>root</b> and <b>main</b> <b>root</b> periderm, and these compounds are then transported through the old stem cortex and phloem to the leaves...|$|R

[...] Hoof-shaped and shelf-like conks are located on the sides of hosts; short, oblong-topped conks with tapering pore surfaces occur on the <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> of the host; and centrally substipitate (conical) conks are found on the tops of stumps. The cap surface of young fruit bodies are covered with a dense mat of white mycelial fibers (up to several millimeters long) that in age darken in color and often become stuck together at their tips. Although the surface is typically brown or darker, it may appear green due to epiphytic associations with algae such as Coccomyxa or Charicium species. Bryophytes or sometimes vascular plants grow on the upper surface of the conk. The texture of the fruit body is fibrous; it is rubbery and tough when fresh, but becomes hard and brittle when it is dry.

40|$|Changes in {{the defence}} {{compounds}} pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in roots and shoots of Senecio jacobaea {{are reported in}} response to nutrient addition in order to investigate whether changes in concentration are adaptive. PA concentrations were examined in leaves and roots of 40 vegetative ragwort plants, subjected to four nutrient treatments in a climate chamber study. Roots from 10 plants were subdivided into <b>main</b> <b>root</b> cortex, <b>main</b> <b>root</b> vascular cylinder, lateral roots and root tips and analysed for PA concentrations. Increasing nutrients lead to {{a significant reduction in}} total PA concentration of both roots and shoots. All individual PAs except jacobine decreased in concentration. The total amount of PA produced in the whole plant was not influenced by nutrient supply. Root tips contained a three times lower concentration than the <b>main</b> and lateral <b>roots.</b> The concentrations in the <b>main</b> <b>root</b> cortex were five times higher than concentrations in the vascular cylinder.

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate aluminum tolerance of five genotypes of Urochloa decumbens (D 24, CD 24 - 2, CD 24 - 27, CD 24 - 45 e D 62) and five genotypes of Urochloa ruziziensis (R 30, R 44, R 46, R 50 and R 125) in hydroponic system. Uniform tillers were collected from these genotypes and transferred to two solutions: solution 1 (200 μM CaCl 2, pH 4. 2) and solution 2 (200 μM CaCl 2 + 200 μM AlCl 3, pH 4. 2). Twenty-one days later, {{the roots of the}} plants were separated, stained and digitalized for analysis of the length and diameter of the <b>main</b> <b>root.</b> The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, in factorial (genotypes × doses) with three replications. A significant interaction occurred between genotype and dose for length and width of the <b>main</b> <b>root,</b> and the results presented in average, a significant difference for most genotypes. The means of <b>main</b> <b>root</b> length in the absence and presence of aluminum were not significant for D 62 (U. decumbens cv. Basilisk), CD 24 - 45 and R 46. Means were not significant for the diameter of the <b>main</b> <b>root</b> for CD 24 - 2, CD 24 - 27 and D 62. Genotype D 62 was the only one classified as tolerant to aluminum and R 50 the only one classified as sensitive. Most evaluated genotypes showed medium to low tolerance. This classification was based on confidence intervals (IC 99 %) for the mean of the relative tolerance indices estimated for length and diameter of the <b>main</b> <b>root.</b> These results can be used in the choice of progenitors aiming at developing segregating populations for studies of inheritance and mapping of genes and/or loci related to aluminum tolerance in Urochloa...|$|R
60|$|June 11th.--I {{walked with}} J----- {{yesterday}} to Bebington Church. When I first saw this church, {{nearly two years}} since, {{it seemed to me}} the fulfilment of my ideal of an old English country church. It is not so satisfactory now, although certainly a venerable edifice. There used some time ago to be ivy all over the tower; and at my first view of it, there was still a little remaining on the upper parts of the spire. But the <b>main</b> <b>roots,</b> I believe, were destroyed, and pains were taken to clear away the whole of the ivy, so that now it is quite bare,--nothing but homely gray stone, with marks of age, but no beauty. The most curious thing about the church is the font. It is a massive pile, composed of five or six layers of freestone in an octagon shape, placed in the angle formed by the projecting side porch and the wall of the church, and standing under a stained-glass window. The base is six or seven feet across, and it is built solidly up in successive steps, to the height of about six feet,--an octagonal pyramid, with the basin of the font crowning the pile hewn out of the solid stone, and about a foot in diameter and the same in depth. There was water in it from the recent rains,--water just from heaven, and therefore as holy as any water it ever held in old Romish times. The aspect of this aged font is extremely venerable, with moss in the basin and all over the stones; grass, and weeds of various kinds, and little shrubs, rooted in the chinks of the stones and between the successive steps.|$|E

30|$|There are two <b>main</b> {{types of}} <b>root</b> systems in plants, defined by their {{developmental}} origin and branching patterns: taproot systems and fibrous root systems. The taproot system occurs in dicot {{plants such as}} Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and pea (Pisum sativa), while fibrous root systems occur in monocots such as rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays) (Atkinson et al. 2014). In taproot systems, the primary <b>root</b> is the <b>main</b> <b>root,</b> and branching consists of secondary, smaller lateral roots (LRs) and root hairs. A fibrous root system, by contrast, consists of a dense mass of adventitious roots (also called crown roots in cereals) that arise from the stem, which are distinct from the primary root, LRs, and root hairs (Coudert et al. 2010). Because the primary root (embryonic root) dies as the monocots age, the adventitious <b>roots</b> are the <b>main</b> <b>root</b> tissues in the fibrous root system of monocot plants.|$|R
