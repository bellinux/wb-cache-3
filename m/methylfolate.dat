40|$|Rats {{exposed to}} N 20 show a {{decrease}} in liver folate to about 25 % of the initial value after 10 days. There is a transient increase {{in the amount of}} 5 -methylterrahydropteroylpolyglutamate in the first 24 h, but thereafter the content decreases. The level of 5 -methyltetrahydropterolymonoglutamate declines without any transitory increase. The transient accumulation of 5 -methyltetrahydropteroylpolyglutamate is due to failure of methionine synthetase. Thereafter the decrease in the amount of <b>methylfolate</b> makes it improbable that trapping of <b>methylfolate</b> is the explanation for failure of folate metabolism in vitamin B 12 deficiency...|$|E
40|$|The <b>methylfolate</b> trap, a {{metabolic}} blockage {{associated with}} anemia, neural tube defects, Alzheimer's dementia, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, {{was discovered in}} the 1960 s, linking the metabolism of folate, vitamin B 12, methionine and homocysteine. However, the existence or physiological significance of this phenomenon has been unknown in bacteria, which synthesize folate de novo. Here we identify the <b>methylfolate</b> trap as a novel determinant of the bacterial intrinsic death by sulfonamides, antibiotics that block de novo folate synthesis. Genetic mutagenesis, chemical complementation, and metabolomic profiling revealed trap-mediated metabolic imbalances, which induced thymineless death, a phenomenon in which rapidly growing cells succumb to thymine starvation. Restriction of B 12 bioavailability, required for preventing trap formation, using an "antivitamin B 12 " molecule, sensitized intracellular bacteria to sulfonamides. Since boosting the bactericidal activity of sulfonamides through <b>methylfolate</b> trap induction can be achieved in Gram-negative bacteria and mycobacteria, it represents a novel strategy to render these pathogens more susceptible to existing sulfonamides...|$|E
40|$|Haematological sequellae {{of vitamin}} B 12 {{deficiency}} {{are attributed to}} disturbed DNA synthesis, but vitamin B 12 itself plays no role in DNA biosynthesis. A proposed explanation {{for this is the}} <b>methylfolate</b> trap hypothesis. This hypothesis states that B 12 deficiency impairs overall folate metabolism because 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 MTHF) becomes metabolically trapped. This trap results from the fact that 5 MTHF can neither be metabolised via the methionine synthase pathway, nor can it be reconverted to its precursor, methylenetetrahydrofolate. Other manifestations of the <b>methylfolate</b> trap include cellular folate loss because of shorter 5 MTHF polyglutamate chains and global hypomethylation. The <b>methylfolate</b> trap has never been demonstrated in humans. We describe a patient with B 12 deficiency who was homozygous for the common methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C 677 T mutation. We analysed red blood cell (RBC) folate vitamers and global DNA methylation by liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with tandem mass spectrometry, and 5 MTHF polyglutamate length by LC-electrochemical detection. Compared to post-B 12 supplementation values, homocysteine was higher (52. 9 micromol/l vs. 16. 8 micromol/l), RBC folate was lower (268. 92 nmol/l vs. 501. 2 nmol/l), the 5 MTHF fraction of RBC folate was much higher (94. 5 % vs. 67. 4 %), polyglutamate chain length was shorter (more tetra- and pentaglutamates), and global DNA methylation was 22 % lower. This {{is the first time that}} virtually all features of the <b>methylfolate</b> trap hypothesis have been demonstrated in a human with vitamin B 12 deficiency...|$|E

40|$|Background: The C 1561 T {{variant of}} the {{glutamate}} carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) gene is critical for natural methylfolylpolyglutamte (<b>methylfolate)</b> absorption, and {{has been associated with}} perturbations in folate metabolism and disease susceptibility. However, little is known on C 1561 T-GCPII as a risk factor for colorectal cancer. Therefore, this study examined whether C 1561 T-GCPII influences folate metabolism and adenomatous polyp occurrence. Materials and Methods: 164 controls and 38 adenomatous polyp cases were analysed to determine blood folate and plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level, dietary intake of natural <b>methylfolate,</b> synthetic pteroylglutamic acid (PteGlu), vitamin C and C 1561 T-GCPII genotype. Results: In controls and cases, 7. 3 and 18. 4 percent of subjects respectively, were found to have the CT genotype, increasing the risk for adenomatous polyp occurrence 2. 86 times (95 % CI: 1. 37 - 8. 0, p= 0. 035). Total dietary folate, <b>methylfolate</b> and PteGlu intake and the level of erythrocyte folate and plasma Hcy did not predict the occurrence of an adenomatous polyp. However, dietary natural vitamin C intake was associated with adenomatous polyp risk within C 1561 T-GCPII CT genotype subjects (p= 0. 037). Conclusions: The findings suggest that C 1561 T-GCPII variation may be associated with risk for adenomatous polyp, and vitamin C may modify risk by interacting with the variant gene, its expression product and/or folate substrates...|$|E
40|$|After an {{intraperitoneal}} injection of 100 mumol of methionine to rats, there is rapid oxidation of the methyl group of hepatic 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate to formate and CO 2.

40|$|The {{megaloblastic}} anemia of cobalamin deficiency appears {{secondary to}} decreased methionine synthetase activity. Decreased activity of this enzyme should cause 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate to accumulate intracellularly, and consequently, decrease purine and DNA synthesis; {{this is the}} basis of the "methylfolate trap" hypothesis of cobalamin deficiency. However, only some of the clinical and biochemical manifestations of cobalamin deficiency {{can be explained by the}} <b>methylfolate</b> trap. We investigated cobalamin deficiency by treating cultured human lymphoblasts with N 2 O since N 2 O inhibits methionine synthetase activity by inactivating cobalamin. We found that 4 h of N 2 O exposure reduced rates of methionine synthesis by 89 %. Rates of purine synthesis were not significantly reduced by N 2 O when folate and methionine were present at 100 microM in the medium; however, at the physiologic methionine concentration of 10 microM, N 2 O decreased rates of purine synthesis by 33 and 57 % in the presence of 100 microM folate and in the absence of folate, respectively. The dependency of rates of purine synthesis on methionine availability would be expected in cells with restricted methionine synthetic capacity because methionine is the immediate precursor of S-adenosylmethionine, a potent inhibitor of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate synthesis; methionine serves as a source of formate for purine synthesis; and rates of purine synthesis are dependent on the intracellular availability of essential amino acids. We conclude that cobalamin inactivation decreases purine synthesis by both <b>methylfolate</b> trapping and reduction of intracellular methionine synthesis...|$|E

40|$|Methionine given parenterally to rats caused rapid {{disappearance}} of methyltetrahydrofolate from {{the liver and}} a corresponding rise in tetrahydrofolate and formyl-tetrahydrofolate concentrations. When [14 C]H 3 [...] H 4 folate was given, methionine caused an increased [14 C] 0 (2) excretion, indicating that oxidation of the methyl group had occurred. Methionine was more effective than S-adenosylmethionine at causing oxidation, but serine was ineffective. The lowest dose of methionine to produce an effect was 0. 5 mumol, which {{is less than the}} daily dietary intake in a rat.

40|$|Objective: There is burgeoning {{interest}} in augmentation strategies for improving inadequate response to antidepressants. The adjunctive use of standardized pharmaceuticalgrade nutrients, known as nutraceuticals, {{has the potential}} to modulate several neurochemical pathways implicated in depression. While many studies have been conducted in this area, to date no specialized systematic review (or metaanalysis) has been conducted. Method: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted up to December 2015 for clinical trials using adjunctive nutrients for depression. Where sufficient data were available, a random-effects model analyzed the standard mean difference between treatment and placebo in the change from baseline to endpoint, combining the effect size data. Funnel plot and heterogeneity analyses were also performed. Results: Primarily positive results were found for replicated studies testing S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), <b>methylfolate,</b> omega- 3 (primarily EPA or ethyl-EPA), and vitamin D, with positive isolated studies for creatine, folinic acid, and an amino acid combination. Mixed results were found for zinc, folic acid, Vitamin C, and tryptophan, with nonsignificant results for inositol. No major adverse effects were noted in the studies (aside from minor digestive disturbance). A meta-analysis of adjunctive omega- 3 versus placebo revealed a significant and moderate to strong effect in favor of omega- 3. Conversely, a metaanalysis of folic acid revealed a nonsignificant difference from placebo. Marked study heterogeneity was found in a Higgins test for both omega- 3 and folic acid studies; funnel plots also revealed asymmetry (reflecting potential study bias). Conclusions: Current evidence supports adjunctive use of SAMe, <b>methylfolate,</b> omega- 3, and vitamin D with antidepressants to reduce depressive symptoms...|$|E
30|$|Folate {{deficiency}} {{increases the}} risk of anaemia, neural tube defects, cancer, vascular disease and neurological disorders (Bailey 1995, 2009). In addition to dietary inadequacy, a functional folate deficiency can be caused by anything that interferes with the bioavailability of the folate, including any defect in the hydrolysis, absorption, transport or cellular utilization (McNulty and Pentieva 2009; Gregory 1995). Folate antagonists include alcohol, and medicines used for the treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and other disorders (McNulty and Pentieva 2009; Gregory 1995). Gastro-intestinal disease or mutations in genes for folate transport or metabolism also affect folate bioavailability (McNulty and Pentieva 2009). A deficiency of vitamin B 12 can cause a secondary, functional, folate deficiency by means of the <b>methylfolate</b> trap (Tisman and Herbert 1973; Smulders et al. 2006; Scott and Weir 1981).|$|E
40|$|Folate {{is present}} in food {{primarily}} in reduced polyglutamate form. In the process of absorption, folate must be deconjugated. A significant precentage of folate is converted to the main transport and storage form (<b>methylfolate)</b> {{in the process of}} absorption. Adequate assessment of ability of a given agent to interfere with human folate metabolism requires evaluation of possible interference not only with intracellular use of folate but also ability to interfere with absorption of folate from food, bile folate excretion and reabsorption, and folate transport, distribution, cellular uptake, and release from cells. Evidence to date indicates that trimethoprim (TMP) reduces use of folate by normal human cells by the same mechanism as its action against invading organisms, i. e., by blocking dihy-drofolate reductase. The therapeutic index of the drug (i. e., toxicity to invading organisms / toxicity to host cells) may be relatively narrow when the host cells are deficient in folate, resulting in megaloblastosis, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Evidence so far suggests that the sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) part of TMP-SMZ therapy does not substantially damage folate metabolism i...|$|E
40|$|Folate {{and related}} gene {{variants}} are significant risk {{factors in the}} aetiology of colorectal cancer. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is critical in the metabolism of synthetic folic acid (pteroylmonoglutamatamic, PteGlu) to tetrahydrofolate following absorption. Therefore, the 19 bp deletion variant of DHFR {{may lead to the}} alteration of folate-related colorectal disease susceptibility. This study examined the association between PteGlu and 19 bp del-DHFR, and adenomatous polyp (AP) occurrence, an antecedent of colorectal cancer. A total of 199 subjects (162 controls and 37 AP cases) were analysed to determine dietary intake of total folate, natural <b>methylfolate</b> and synthetic PteGlu, level of erythrocyte folate and plasma homocysteine (tHcy), and genotype of 19 bp del-DHFR. Dietary folate intake, erythrocyte folate, tHcy and 19 bp del-DHFR variants did not independently predict the occurrence of AP. However, a gene-nutrient interaction was observed when subjects were stratified according to dietary folate intake. In subjects with a folate intake above the median value due to significant dietary PteGlu content, the presence of the 19 bp-deletion allele decreased the risk for AP (OR= 0. 35, 95 % CI: 0. 13 - 0. 97). However, such association was not evident in individuals with a folate intake below the median value. In conclusion, the finding suggests that folate nutrition and 19 bp del-DHFR variation may interact to modify AP risk...|$|E
40|$|Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is a folate binding protein {{commonly}} {{diminished in}} human hepatoma yet {{its role in}} tumor development remains to be established. GNMT binds to <b>methylfolate</b> but is also inhibited by it; how such interactions affect human carcinogenesis is unclear. We postulated that GNMT {{plays a role in}} folate-dependent methyl group homeostasis and helps maintain genome integrity by promoting nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA repair. To test the hypothesis, GNMT was over-expressed in GNMT-null cell lines cultured in conditions of folate abundance or restriction. The partitioning of folate dependent 1 -carbon groups was investigated using stable isotopic tracers and GC/MS. DNA damage was assessed as uracil content in cell models, as well as in Gnmt wildtype (Gnmt +/+), heterozygote (Gnmt +/−) and knockout (Gnmt −/−) mice under folate deplete, replete, or supplementation conditions. Our study demonstrated that GMMT 1) supports methylene-folate dependent pyrimidine synthesis; 2) supports formylfolate dependent purine syntheses; 3) minimizes uracil incorporation into DNA when cells and animals were exposed to folate depletion; 4) translocates into nuclei during prolonged folate depletion. In conclusion, loss of GNMT impairs nucleotide biosynthesis. Over-expression of GNMT enhances nucleotide biosynthesis and improves DNA integrity by reducing uracil misincorporation in DNA both in vitro and in vivo. To our best knowledge, the role of GNMT in folate dependent 1 -carbon transfer in nucleotide biosynthesis has never been investigated. The present study gives new insights into the underlying mechanism by which GNMT can participate in tumor prevention/suppression in humans...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: To {{review the}} main results of {{intervention}} trials which showed {{the efficacy of}} periconceptional folic acid-containing multivitamin and folic acid supplementation {{in the prevention of}} neural-tube defects (NTD). Methods and Results: The main findings of 5 intervention trials are known: (i) the efficacy of a multivitamin containing 0. 36 mg folic acid in a UK nonrandomized controlled trial resulted in an 83 - 91 % reduction in NTD recurrence, while the results of the Hungarian (ii) randomized controlled trial and (iii) cohort-controlled trial using a multivitamin containing 0. 8 mg folic acid showed 93 and 89 % reductions in the first occurrence of NTD, respectively. On the other hand, (iv) another multicenter randomized controlled trial proved a 71 % efficacy of 4 mg folic acid in the reduction of recurrent NTD, while (v) a public health-oriented Chinese-US trial showed a 41 - 79 % reduction in the first occurrence of NTD depending on the incidence of NTD. Conclusions: Translational application of these findings could result in a breakthrough in the primary prevention of NTD, but so far this is not widely applied in practice. The benefits and drawbacks of 4 main possible uses of periconceptional folic acid/multivitamin supplementation, i. e. (i) dietary intake, (ii) periconceptional supplementation, (iii) flour fortification, and (iv) the recent attempt for the use of combination of oral contraceptives with 6 S- 5 -methytetrahydrofolate (<b>methylfolate),</b> are discussed.

40|$|In {{addition}} to {{its role in the}} endogenous synthesis of cysteine, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL) is a major physiological source of the vasorelaxant hydrogen sulfide. Cgl null mice are potentially useful for studying the influence of this compound upon vascular tone and endothelial function. Here, we confirm a previous report that female Cgl null mice exhibit an approximate 45 -fold increase in plasma total homocysteine compared to wild type controls. This level of homocysteine is approximately 3. 5 -fold higher than that observed in male Cgl null mice and is essentially equivalent to that observed in mouse models of cystathionine beta synthase deficient homocystinuria. Cgl null mice of both sexes exhibited decreased expression of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase compared to WT controls. Female Cgl null mice exhibited a sex-specific induction of betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase and methionine adenosyltransferase 1, alpha and a 70 % decrease in methionine synthase expression accompanied by significantly decreased plasma methionine. Decreased plasma cysteine levels in female Cgl null mice were associated with sex-specific dysregulation of cysteine dioxygenase expression. Comparative histological assessment between cystathionine beta-synthase and Cgl null mice indicated that the therapeutic potential of cystathionine against liver injury merits possible further investigation. Collectively, our data demonstrates the importance of considering sex when investigating mouse models of inborn errors of metabolism and indicate that while female Cgl null mice are of questionable utility for studying the physiological role of hydrogen sulfide, they could serve as a useful model for studying the consequences of methionine synthase deficiency and the <b>methylfolate</b> trap...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} the physico-chemical properties of mono and triglutamate forms of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolaten (5 CH₃–H₄–PteGlun) in human gastric juice and under artificial conditions, {{typical of the}} upper gastrointestinal tract. Degradation of 5 CH₃–H₄–PteGlun to 5 -methyldihydrofolaten (5 CH₃– 5, 6 -H₂PteGlun) {{and on to the}} C₉–N₁₀ scission product p-aminobenzoylglutamate (P-ABG), and the salvage of 5 CH₃–H₄–PteGlun from 5 CH₃– 5, 6 -H₂PteGlun was examined with emphasis on the influence of pH and ascorbic acid. At pH 3. 5, physiological levels of ascorbic acid (50 μMol/l) salvage both 5 CH₃–H₄PteGlu₁ and 5 CH₃–H 4 PteGlu₃ from acid labile 5 CH₃– 5, 6 -H₂PteGlun and prevent loss of vitamin activity as indicated by P-ABGn formation. This process is less efficient at pH 7. 0, although under such conditions 5 CH₃– 5, 6 -H₂PteGlun is rendered relatively stable. Ascorbic acid (50 μMol/l) reduces degradation of 5 CH₃–H₄PteGlu₁ and 5 CH₃–H₄PteGlu₃ at both pH 3. 5 and 7. 0. However, irrespective of ascorbic acid, 5 CH₃–H₄PteGlu₁ and 5 CH₃–H₄PteGlu₃ are both more stable at pH 3. 5 than pH 7. 0. There is a clear differential between mono- and polyglutamate stability, since, irrespective of pH or the presence of ascorbic acid, 5 CH₃–H₄PteGlu₁ is inherently more stable than 5 CH₃–H₄PteGlu₃. While ascorbic acid clearly stabilises mono- and triglutamate forms of <b>methylfolate</b> in human gastric juice, a factor in gastric juice removes any differential instability as seen in buffer solution. We speculate that this endogenous factor could be either a binding protein or some other antioxidant.

There have been no documented case reports of VTE in female astronauts during spaceflight in the published literature. Some female astronauts use hormonal contraception to control their menstrual cycles and it is currently unknown how this affects their risk of VTE. Current terrestrial risk prediction models do {{not account for the}} spaceflight environment and the physiological changes associated with it. We therefore aim to estimate a specific risk score for female astronauts who are taking hormonal contraception for menstrual cycle control, to deduce whether they are at an elevated risk of VTE. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to identify and quantify known terrestrial risk factors for VTE. Studies involving analogues for the female astronaut population were also reviewed, for example, military personnel who use the oral contraceptive pill for menstrual suppression. Well known terrestrial risk factors, for example, obesity or smoking would not be applicable to our study population as these candidates would have been excluded during astronaut selection processes. Other risk factors for VTE include hormonal therapy, lower limb paralysis, physical inactivity, hyperhomocysteinemia, low <b>methylfolate</b> levels and minor injuries, all of which potentially apply to crew members LSAH data will be assessed to identify which of these risk factors are applicable to our astronaut population. Using known terrestrial risk data, an overall estimated risk of VTE for female astronauts using menstrual cycle control methods will therefore be calculated. We predict this will be higher than the general population but not significantly higher requiring thromboprophylaxis.

Approximately 30 %– 40 % of patients with major depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients with mood disorders. This {{review of the literature}} examines evidence-based data on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals {{over the past two decades}} were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, St John&# 39;s wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega- 3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and <b>methylfolate</b> found that, while these were useful in physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies support the adjunctive role of omega- 3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Omega- 3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline, inositol, 5 -hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such treatments are effective.

40|$|Background: Vitamin B 12 {{deficiency}} is {{a common}} condition, particularly among the elderly. The classical manifestations include megaloblastic anemia, due to ineffective erythropoiesis, and neurological complication such as peripheral neuropathy, depression, cognitive disturbances and dementia, due to demyelination of the cervical and thoracic dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord. Most common causes are pernicious anemia, gastrectomy, ileal resection, atrophic gastritis, long-term vegetarian or vegan dietary. The interaction between folate and B 12 {{is responsible for the}} megaloblastic anemia seen in both vitamin deficiency. Folate metabolism plays an essential role in DNA synthesis and methylation processes. <b>Methylfolate</b> trap hypothesis {{is based on the assumption}} that 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 -MTHF) cannot be transformed back to its precursor 5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate (5, 10 -MTHF), because the reaction catalyzed by MTHFR is irreversible. In cobalamin deficiency, methionine synthase is inactive, causing accumulation of 5 -MTHF. So trapped 5 -MTHF flows out of the cells, leading a progressive cellular loss of plyglutamated folates. The C 677 T and A 1298 C MTHFR gene polymorphisms are associated with a decreased enzyme activity. So homozygous genotype may protect patients with reduced methionine synthase activity from defective DNA synthesis because folate metabolism tends to be shifted to thymidylate synthesis. Aims: Our aim is to examine cobalamin-deficient patients with reduced MTHFR activity, according to the polymorphisms mentioned, in order to evaluate their predisposition to develop anemia, neurological symptom and atrophic gastritis. Methods:We studied 80 Caucasian patients with a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia consecutively admitted to our Hematology Division from 2006 to December 2013. All patients were tested for C 677 T and A 1298 C SNPS by polymerase chain reaction. By univariate analysis we correlate hemoglobin, MCV, white blood count (WBC), neutrophil count, platelets count, folate and B 12 levels, neurological symptoms and presence of atrophic gastritis and positivity of parietal cells antibody (PCA) at diagnosis with the distribution of C 677 T and A 1298 C genotypes (Table 1). Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher’s exact test and x 2 test. Results: We found a correlation statistically significant between patients carrying MTHFR C 677 T homozygous genotype and lower hemoglobin value (P= 0. 022), higher MCV value (P= 0. 05), lower WBC (P= 0. 03) and lower platelet count (P= 0. 05). Forty of the 80 patients had a diagnosis of atrophic gastritis documented by istological examination; twentyseven patients were positive for PCA. We found a significant association between patients carrying MTHFR C 677 T homozygous genotype and patients with a diagnosis of atrophic gastritis and the absence of antiparietal cell anytibodies (P= 0. 03). MTHFR A 1298 C polymorphism showed no correlation with all the variables previously analyzed. Moreover the analysis of plasma levels of folate and vitamin B 12 showed the presence of low folate levels in patients with gastric biopsy negative (p= 0. 02) and antibody negative (P= 0. 04). Summary and Conclusions: On the basis of results it can be assumed that MTHFR C 677 T polymorphism, which shunt folate towards thymidylate synthesis and away from methionine synthesis, do not protect against macrocytic anemia and it is associated with a lower WBC and a lower platelet count. Moreover we can speculate that impaired MTHFR function could increase susceptibility to atrophic gastritis in cobalamin deficient-patient with PCA negativity...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - PhD (Food Science) Folic acid {{has been}} the focus of {{extensive}} research since it plays an essential role in the human body as a major coenzyme in one-carbon metabolism. This metabolic role facilitates both methionine and DNA synthesis. It has been suggested that increased folate intake, and hence blood status, provides benefits in maintaining health. However, a growing body of literature now reports differing opinions with respect to the level of folic acid intake, the type of vitamer and pathoaetiological outcomes. Part of this controversy lies in the study of cancer aetiology, particularly in the context of adenomatous polyp (AP) occurrence. AP is an antecedent of colorectal cancer. As part of the present study an in vivo model was therefore developed in order to re-examine the role of folate in carcinogenesis, taking into account both genetic variants and environmental factors. To obtain further evidence, the biological characteristics of folate vitamers in promoting cancer cell proliferation were examined using an in vitro model. 202 individuals were recruited and placed into two groups depending upon whether they had been diagnosed with AP or were control subjects. The blood folate, thiol levels, dietary folate intake, including synthetic and natural forms, and intake of nutrients related to one-carbon metabolism (pyridoxine, riboflavin, cobalamin, niacin, methionine and vitamin C) of each subject were evaluated. Sixteen major genetic variants in folate metabolism were also determined as potential risk factors in AP aetiology: MTHFR C 677 T, A 1208 C, G 1793 A, SHMT C 1420 T, TS 1496 del 6, TSER 2 R 3 R, TS 3 RG>C, GCPII C 1561 T, CBS 844 ins 66, DHFR 19 bp del, RCF G 80 A, CTH G 1364 T, IVS 10 - 430 C>T, BHMT G 595 A, MS A 2756 G and MSR A 66 G. Statistical analysis has provided evidence to suggest that AP aetiology depends upon a range of interactions between genes and nutrition. The following factors were found to be associated with an increased risk of developing AP: RBC folate level (p for females = 0. 0021 and males = 0. 004), nutritional intake (p for <b>methylfolate</b> intake below the median = 0. 0189 and cobalamin intake above median = 0. 0402) and genetic variants (p for CBS 844 ins 68 = 0. 035, TS 1496 del 6 = 0. 048, MSR A 66 G = 0. 025 and MTHFR C 677 T- CBS 844 ins 66 = 0. 0403). Although no direct correlation was found between PteGlu intake and the occurrence of AP, genetic variants predicted a differential AP risk depending on total dietary folate intake level (in subjects with total dietary folate intake above the RDI: p for MTHFR A 1298 C= 0. 026, MTHFR C 677 T-A 1298 C-G 1793 A= 0. 016, TS 1496 del 6 = 0. 024, DHFR 19 bp del = 0. 032, and, in subjects with total dietary folate intake below the RDI: MTHFR A 1298 C 2 = 0. 011, RFC G 80 A-GCPII C 1561 T 3 = 0. 033). Additionally, vitamin C was also associated with occurrence of AP when examined by RCF G 80 A and GCPII C 1561 T genotype (p for RFC G 80 A AA = 0. 0473, GCP II C 1561 T CT= 0. 0276 and RFC G 80 A-GCPII C 1561 T AA/CC = 0. 0026). An in vitro model utilizing both colon (Caco- 2) and breast cancer (MCF 7) cell lines was developed. The cells were cultured for 8 days. There was found to be a differential growth response depending upon which folyl vitamer was used as a source of one-carbon units, its concentration and the presence/absence of a folate protecting antioxidant. At a relatively low concentration (≤ 1 μg/mL) of PteGlu no significant difference in Caco- 2 cell growth was observed, but the cells showed a differential growth pattern at higher concentrations (50 μg/mL and 500 μg/mL). Fully reduced, labile 5 -CH 3 H 3 PteGlu with no added antioxidant inhibited Caco- 2 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, but this inhibition was altered by the presence of an antioxidant. The addition of 10 μg/mL of GSH resulted in a similar, but enhanced, inhibition of Caco- 2 cell growth to that of 5 -CH 3 H 4 PteGlu in the absence of any additional antioxidant. By contrast, 5 -CH 3 H 4 PteGlu in the presence of ascorbic acid (10 μg/mL) exhibited a differential change depending on time of incubation and vitamin concentration. Partially oxidised 5 -CH 3 H 2 PteGlu increased cell growth in both cell lines, providing evidence that 5 -CH 3 H 2 PteGlu could potentially enter the one-carbon metabolic pool in this in vitro model. The photo-oxidative degradation products of 5 -CH 3 H 2 PteGlu did not show a significant effect on growth in Caco- 2 cells. Findings from the current study provide new information on the physico-chemical characteristics of folate vitamers and their role in cell proliferation. The interactions between these vitamers and nutrients related to methyl group metabolism and genetic variants collectively illuminate the multifactorial nature of AP aetiology. In terms of gene-gene, gene-nutrient and nutrient-nutrient interactions, this study has generated valuable new information about the molecular mechanisms that play a role in AP and their response to the nutritional environment...|$|E
