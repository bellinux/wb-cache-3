40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of zirconia polycrystals decrease drastically at high temperature due to thermally activated grain boundary (GB) sliding, leading to plastic or even super-plastic deformation.

They reveal, in general, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> peak, which evolves into an exponential increase at higher temperature.

40|$|Future {{generations of}} {{gravitational}} wave detectors will require {{significant progress in}} the reduction {{of all forms of}} noise affecting the system. One form of noise it is critical to reduce is thermal noise, which can be described as the consequence of the atoms which make up the measurement optics experiencing vibrations because of their non-zero temperature. The dielectric multilayer coatings of the mirror in an interferometric gravitational wave detector are known to contribute significantly to the overall levels of thermal noise. The next generation of gravitational wave detectors may need to use exotic coatings, cryogenic operating temperatures and silicon mirror substrates in an effort to mitigate the effects of thermal noise. Chapter Two describes thermal noise in detail, and introduces the concepts of substrate noise, coating noise, thermoelastic dissipation, <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> and the formulae used to calculate them. Chapter Three describes the current state of research on the factors affecting <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> in dielectric coatings. The technique of probing the structure and dissipation characteristics of materials by assessing the shape and position of the low temperature excess loss feature known as a Debye peak is introduced. The cryogenic <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> measurement apparatus used in Chapters Four, Five and Six is described and characterised. Chapter Four concerns the variation of <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> of ion-beam sputtered silica coatings with temperature and investigates the effects of heat-treatment upon them. The low-temperature Debye peak was found in some modes of a sample heat treated at 300 oC and an Arrhenius analysis provided a characteristic energy for the dissipation process of (17. 3 ± 2. 3) meV. Further heat treatment of silica at 600 oC and 800 oC appears to narrow the Debye peak, which is thought to be indicative of the narrowing of the distribution of bond angles in the amorphous silica network. Hafnia is investigated as an alternative coating material in Chapter Five. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> of hafnia heat-treated at 300 oC was measured and two excess loss features were discovered, one below 100 K and one above 200 K. Electron scattering measurements indicate that this sample may already have developed polycrystalline regions which are known to be connected to high levels of <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss.</b> The <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> of an un-heat-treated hafnia coating is also measured and an extremely low coating loss of 1. 87 × 10 − 5 is found at 20 K. Chapter Six describes an experiment to find the <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> of a hydroxycatalysis bond between silicon cantilevers at temperatures between 10 K and 300 K. This new technique for the measurement of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> of bond material produced a minimum upper limit of the bond loss of (0. 13 ± 0. 03) occurring in the fundamental mode at 80 K and upper limit of the bond loss of (0. 19 ± 0. 07) occurring in the third mode at 15 K. Chapter Seven describes the development and testing of a nodal support system to enable cryogenic measurements of cylindrical bulk mirror substrates to be made. The efficacy of the support varied significantly with the frequency of the mode and the cryogenic measurements were partially successful. The major results in this work are the successful measurements of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> of amorphous hafnia coatings at low temperatures and the use of a structure made from hydroxy-catalysis bonded silicon cantilevers to obtain an upper limit for the <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> of the bond material. These results may inform technological advances that reduce the level of thermal noise experienced in future gravitational wave detectors.

40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{spectroscopy}} is {{a unique}} technique {{that is capable of}} detecting extremely fine traces of rolling oil left on the surface of cold-rolled steel sheets. In this study we have demonstrated that a characteristic <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> spectrum occurs in the low-temperature range from 180 K to 280 K only in the two following situations: (1) if traces of the rolling oil are left on the surface of sheets or (2) if the sheets are covered with a thin film of the rolling oil. Nearly the same loss spectra have been observed in subresonant <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> measurements of paper micro-samples covered with a thin film of rolling oil. It can therefore be concluded that the observed <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> phenomena take place in the rolling oil, that is, they do not depend on whether the substrate is metallic or paper. Moreover, the subresonant mechanical spectroscopy can readily resolve the complex <b>mechanical</b> <b>loss</b> spectrum into three constituent peaks located at 188 K, 215 K, and at around 270 K, respectively. Rolling oils containing different amounts of sulphur generate low-temperature peaks of substantially different height.
