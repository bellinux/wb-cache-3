40|$|The {{values of}} private {{association}} and self-help through individual effort {{have been a}} compelling aspect of the American philosophy. Reaffirming Americanism {{was not the only}} reason that immigrant or minority groups created mutual aid or self-help societies, however, since immediate economic and social goals were significant motivations for such associations. Because studying self-help and <b>mutual</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>groups</b> can aid the understanding of minorities in this country, this project was undertaken with the goal of developing materials for classroom use in high school history classes. The story of Victoria Earle Matthews, {{a founding member of the}} National Conference of Colored Women in 1895 and supporter of residences for urban black women, illustrates the importance of self-help for minority groups. The Young Men's Hebrew Association of New York is another example of a self-help group at work. ...|$|R
30|$|There are {{regional}} <b>mutual</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>groups</b> where emergency help is mobilized {{to restore}} power with repair crews literally borrowed or contracted from unaffected systems. But {{as a recent}} report notes (EEI 2016, p. 6): “Our current <b>mutual</b> <b>assistance</b> program works well for regional events, but was not designed to be scalable for national events.” Following Hurricane Irma, the President and CEO of FPL (Florida Power & Light) was quoted in a 2017 FPL news report {{as part of a}} lengthier statement expressing a commitment that highlights this need: “For example, we understand that what our customers want to know more than anything else is when will their power be restored. Unfortunately {{we were not able to}} accurately and consistently provide the kind of useful and detailed restoration estimates that our customers have come to expect from us during normal operations. We are going to get better at this and we’re already working on it” (FPL 2017, § 3). In order to make such predictions, the probability of failure to restore power (or the chance of non-restoration) must be determined or estimated as a function of time, so new data and outage prediction methods are clearly needed. Previous estimates have only been made for the average outage duration times following hurricanes using statistically-based geographic models, not the time-varying outage number (Nateghi et al. 2014).|$|R
2500|$|The order {{originated}} among a {{group of}} men who engaged in different businesses and periodically met for <b>mutual</b> <b>assistance.</b> This <b>group</b> included John W. Talbot, Joseph E. Talbot, George D. Beroth, J. Lott Losey, John J.Johnson, John D. Burke, William Weaver and Frank Dunbar. They got around to discussing the teachings and methods of different fraternal orders and decided to create a new one, named after the owl. After several months of planning by [...] "the best constitutional lawyers in the Middle West", the constitution was adopted and the order was founded at the law offices of Talbot and Talbot on Nov. 20, 1904 in South Bend, Indiana.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, the Organisation des ressortissants de l'Ouest de la Côte d'Ivoire, {{a social}} and mutual aid organization, was founded. Chicago is a major city with a large Ivorian population. Most of them come from the west of Ivory Coast, {{culturally}} similar to Malians. However, there are also important groups from the north of Ivory Coast and small groups from the east {{and south of the}} country, which sometimes gather together to celebrate social events and for <b>mutual</b> <b>assistance.</b> Thus, these <b>groups</b> invite each other to parties, christenings and other events. Although also meet with other people from West Africa. Groups are also involved in political activity, locally representing the main political parties in Côte d'Ivoire, such as the Popular Front for the Ivory Coast or the Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire African Democratic Rally.|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} {{involvement of}} men and women as part of a community-wide approach to shifting deep-rooted norms is critical for the abandonment of female genital mutilation and cutting (FGM-C). However, there is limited research exploring how and why men engage in processes of abandonment and how this relates to shifts in gender relations within private and public spaces. This study assessed the process of change among men and boys targeted by Kembatti Mentti Gezzimma (KMG) Ethiopia’s intervention in the Kembatta zone of Ethiopia, which has challenged social acceptance of, and reduced the prevalence of, FGM-C at phenomenal rates (UNICEF 2008). Across four villages, in two districts in the Kembatta Zone, 21 interviews were conducted with KMG staff, male and female beneficiaries, and stakeholders including women’s group association members, youth <b>group</b> members, idir (<b>mutual</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>groups</b> or agricultural <b>assistance</b> <b>groups),</b> and religious and sub-district leaders. Additional interviews were conducted with a staff member in Sidama zone and two KMG management staff in Addis Ababa. Interviews assessed achievements of KMG’s intervention and how men and boys were successfully engaged. Most significant stories of change, which elicited narratives around how and why KMG has impacted participants’ lives, were collected from all interviewees. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. The data indicates how KMG considers boys and men as agents of change including as members of community FGM-C prevention assemblies, supporting boys and men to disseminate prevention information, and developing and implementing sanctions for those who continue the practice. KMG’s community conversations educated men and women collectively about the harmful health, economic and interpersonal effects of FGM-C, and the related benefits of abandoning the practice. Providing alternative income generating opportunities for traditional circumcisers, celebrating whole body, ‘healthy life’ 1 events to replace former celebrations of FGM-C, and integrating economic and environmental development were particularly effective for harnessing community support. The data indicated that the intervention diminished other harmful practices including bride abduction and widow inheritance and generated shifts in men’s and women’s support for women’s access to property inheritance, political participation, positive sexuality, household decision-making and reducing women’s domestic burden. Although men were effectively engaged in both public and private spaces, men’s participation appeared to be more gender transformative in interpersonal domains. Given the significant achievements, many valuable lessons can be learned from KMG’s approach to shift underlying social norms, and meaningfully engage men in FGM-C abandonment and gender equality...|$|R

The study of self-help groups for minorities is a useful part of U. S. history and can help student understanding of minorities. The materials are related to the discussion and essays in Part 1 of the project, which introduces the mutual aid organiz. itio-and provides three detailed examples of this type of association. Three pedagogical methods are suggested that have proven useful in the study of historical material. The first is the biopoem, a device for letting students break materials down into a poem that is meaningful to them personally.
