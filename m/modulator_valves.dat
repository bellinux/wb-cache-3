40|$|Previous {{studies by}} the Cambridge Vehicle Dynamics Consortium (CVDC) have {{suggested}} that, by improving the control bandwidth of conventional Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) brake actuators and using a ‘slip control’ braking strategy, HGV stopping distances could be reduced by up to 30 % over existing systems. The work covered in this thesis looks to: validate the CVDC’s previous braking performance predictions through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) simulation, investigate how in-plane tyre dynamics may influence such a system’s performance, develop and build a next generation high-bandwidth braking system for vehicle implementation and carry out comparative back-to-back vehicle tests between the new system and commercially available HGV ABS. An introduction to HGV brake hardware and control is presented in Chapter 1. This is followed by straight-line braking simulations of a HGV using a HiL test rig in Chapter 2. In these tests, a conventional ABS is compared to a prototype braking system consisting of highspeed pneumatic valves (designed by a previous CVDC researcher) and a sliding mode slip controller. Results indicate that the novel system could reduce stopping distances and air consumption by 21 % and 17 % respectively. Chapter 3 considers the influence of longitudinal tyre dynamics on the straight-line braking performance of a HGV slip control system. A novel, HGV specific, dynamic tyre model is presented. Two vibration modes involving the tyre tread band and wheel hub (an in-phase mode at 20 Hz, and an anti-phase mode at 55 Hz) are identified that can influence {{the performance of a}} slip control system. It is shown that a gain scheduled sliding mode slip controller can be designed to be robust to oscillations in wheel speed associated with these modes. Overspinning of the wheel hub during brake release (a phenomenon seen in conventional ABS vehicle test data) is also correctly predicted by the novel tyre model. Chapter 4 focuses on the design of a next generation high-speed ABS modulator valve suitable for installation on a test vehicle. Prototype valve blocks are built and shown to meet the requirements of a typical UK semi-trailer. Frequency response tests with the new valves indicate that the system can achieve a pressure control bandwidth of 10 Hz, significantly higher than the previous generation high-speed valve system (6 Hz) and conventional ABS hardware (1. 5 Hz). Chapter 5 discusses the installation of high-speed ABS <b>modulator</b> <b>valves</b> on a tri-axle semi-trailer. Straight-line braking tests are then carried out in Chapter 6 – comparing the new valve system with conventional ABS. On average, stopping distance and air use are reduced by 15 ± 3 % and 50 ± 10 % respectively. An increase in Mean Fully Developed Deceleration (MFDD) of 16 ± 4 % is also achieved by the new system...|$|E
50|$|One unique {{feature of}} this {{transmission}} is its use of both a <b>modulator</b> <b>valve</b> and a throttle valve (TV) cable. Most transmissions either use {{one or the other}} to control shift points and shift smoothness. On the Turbo 440-T4, the TV cable exclusively controls the shift points, while the <b>modulator</b> <b>valve</b> controls the shift feel, with very little overlap between the effects of one adjustment on the other. This feature makes it very easy for a do-it-yourself mechanic to adjust the transmission shift points with minimum effect on the shift feel.|$|R
50|$|The {{governor}} {{is connected to}} the output shaft and regulates the hydraulic pressure depending on the vehicle speed. The engine load is monitored either by a throttle cable or a vacuum <b>modulator.</b> The <b>valve</b> body is the hydraulic control center that receives pressurized fluid from the main pump operated by the fluid coupling/torque converter. The pressure coming from this pump is regulated and used to run a network of spring-loaded valves, check balls and servo pistons. The valves use the pump pressure and the pressure from a centrifugal governor on the output side (as well as hydraulic signals from the range selector valves and the throttle <b>valve</b> or <b>modulator)</b> to control which ratio is selected on the gearset; as the vehicle and engine change speed, the difference between the pressures changes, causing different sets of valves to open and close. The hydraulic pressure controlled by these valves drives the various clutch and brake band actuators, thereby controlling the operation of the planetary gearset to select the optimum gear ratio for the current operating conditions. However, in many modern automatic transmissions, the valves are controlled by electro-mechanical servos which are controlled by the electronic engine control unit (ECU) or a separate transmission control unit (TCU, also known as transmission control module (TCM).|$|R
40|$|Multiplexing {{techniques}} for recording of 3 D objects and for synthesizing of holograms are discussed. Proposals are given for recording of 3 D scenes by large diameter telescope-type imaging systems applying multiple lens cameras. Suggestions {{are made for}} an optoelectronic synthesis of still and animated holograms based on photo emulsions and optoelectronic holograms respectively. Two synthesizing methods are described: an optical synthesis utilizing 2 D perspective views and a synthesis based on calculating and writing of the interference pattern onto the hologram. The 2 D pictures and interference pattern are procreated by optoelectronic light valves. The hologram plate consists of photoemulsions for still holograms. For animated holograms very-high-resolution optoelectronic spatial light modulators are considered. Possible types of light <b>modulators</b> and light <b>valves</b> {{which can be used}} for the real-time holographic imaging system are discussed. It is shown that animated holographic 3 D images can be obtained, if the optoelectronic light modulators are available...|$|R
40|$|Atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD) {{are highly}} heritable, {{clinically}} significant congenital heart malformations. Genetic and environmental modifiers of risk {{are thought to}} work in unknown combinations to cause AVSD. Approximately 5 – 10 % of simplex AVSD cases carry a missense mutation in CRELD 1. However, CRELD 1 mutations are not fully penetrant and require interactions with other risk factors to result in AVSD. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) is a well-characterized <b>modulator</b> of heart <b>valve</b> development. A functional VEGFA polymorphism, VEGFA c. - 634 C, which causes constitutively increased VEGFA expression, {{has been associated with}} cardiac septal defects suggesting it may be a genetic risk factor. To determine if there is an allelic association with AVSD we genotyped the VEGFA c. - 634 SNP in a simplex AVSD study cohort. Over-representation of the c. - 634 C allele in the AVSD group suggested that this genotype may increase risk. Correlation of CRELD 1 and VEGFA genotypes revealed that potentially pathogenic missense mutations in CRELD 1 were always accompanied by the VEGFA c. - 634 C allele in individuals with AVSD suggesting a potentially pathogenic allelic interaction. We used a Creld 1 knockout mouse model to determine the effect of deficiency of Creld 1 combined with increased VEGFA on atrioventricular canal development. Morphogenic response to VEGFA was abnormal in Creld 1 -deficient embryonic hearts, indicating that interaction between CRELD 1 and VEGFA has the potential to alter atrioventricular canal morphogenesis. This supports our hypothesis that an additive effect between missense mutations in CRELD 1 and a functional SNP in VEGFA contributes to the pathogenesis of AVSD...|$|R
