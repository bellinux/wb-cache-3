2500|$|The super-speed Transrapid maglev {{system has}} no wheels, no axles, no gear transmissions, no steel rails, and no {{overhead}} electrical pantographs. The maglev vehicles do not roll on wheels; rather, they hover above the track guideway, using the attractive magnetic force between two linear arrays of electromagnetic coils—one {{side of the}} coil on the vehicle, the other side in the track guideway, which function together as a magnetic dipole. During levitation and travelling operation, the Transrapid maglev vehicle floats on a frictionless <b>magnetic</b> <b>cushion</b> with no physical contact whatsoever with the track guideway. On-board vehicle electronic systems measure the dipole gap distance 100,000 times per second to guarantee the clearance between the coils attached to {{the underside of the}} guideway and the magnetic portion of the vehicle wrapped around the guideway edges. With this precise, constantly updated electronic control, the dipole gap remains nominally constant at [...] When levitated, the maglev vehicle has about [...] of clearance above the guideway surface.|$|E

It’s the great significance to upgrade technology and enhance the capability of the independent innovations for enterprises. After the product technology system was decomposed, we can summarize the core functions and core technical subsystems and analyze the current technology evolution state of the product core technical subsystems. For the mature stage of the product, the radical innovation technology forecasting inherent basic law is revealed through establishing product technology system evolution process model for radical innovation based on technology evolution theory. The technology forecasting process of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cushion</b> belt conveyor is taken as an example to validate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with turbulent non-isothermic jets and separated flows of incompressible liquid. The aim is to develop the algorithms for calculation of non-stationary separated flows on base of solving the Reynolds total equations and jet flows in approximation of boundary layer. The following methods {{have been used in}} the paper: finite difference methods for solving Reynolds stationary and non-stationary total equations with use of the two-parametric turbulence model, integrated and numerical methods for solving the boundary layer equations. The investigation of difference finite diagrams and methods for numerical solving Reynolds total equations and the development of algorithm for calculating vibrations of the cylindrical bodies in the two-dimensional parallel flow have been performed. As a practical result the numerical modelling of jet and separated flows has been realized by means of the different methods with algebraic and differential models of turbulence; besides, the calculation of the constrained and free cross vibrations of cylindrical bodies in two-dimensional parallel flow has been performed. The developed algorithms for calculation of jet and separated flows have been used at calculation of the aerodynamic device characteristics in Central Aero- and Hydrodynamic Institute and aviation experimental design bureaus. The recommendations on choice of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cushion</b> apparatus parameters and methods of flow control in the aerodynamic tunnels have been given. Area of application: calculation and evaluation of aerodynamic characteristics for flying vehicles, constructions and internal flows in canalsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} demand for automated cell reprogramming {{in the fields}} of cell biology, biotechnology and the biomedical sciences. Microfluidic-based platforms that provide unattended manipulation of adherent cells promise to be an appropriate basis for cell manipulation. In this study we developed a magnetically driven cell carrier to serve as a vehicle within an in vitro environment. To elucidate the impact of the carrier on cells, biocompatibility was estimated using the human adenocarcinoma cell line Caco- 2. Besides evaluation {{of the quality of the}} magnetic carriers by field emission scanning electron microscopy, the rate of adherence, proliferation and differentiation of Caco- 2 cells grown on the carriers was quantified. Moreover, the morphology of the cells was monitored by immunofluorescent staining. Early generations of the cell carrier suffered from release of cytotoxic nickel from the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cushion.</b> Biocompatibility was achieved by complete encapsulation of the nickel bulk within galvanic gold. The insulation process had to be developed stepwise and was controlled by parallel monitoring of the cell viability. The final carrier generation proved to be a proper support for cell manipulation, allowing proliferation of Caco- 2 cells equal to that on glass or polystyrene as a reference for up to 10 days. Functional differentiation was enhanced by more than 30 % compared with the reference. A flat, ferromagnetic and fully biocompatible carrier for cell manipulation was developed for application in microfluidic systems. Beyond that, this study offers advice for the development of magnetic cell carriers and the estimation of their biocompatibility...|$|E
