5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Belgium in September 1944, there was a boom of new <b>magazines</b> for the youth, both in French and Dutch.

5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's <b>magazines</b> flooded. The forward <b>magazines</b> were {{promptly}} flooded, but the aft <b>magazines</b> were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch <b>magazines.</b> The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch <b>magazines,</b> resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.|$|E
