40|$|Global {{crop yields}} {{are limited by}} water and {{nutrient}} availability. Soil <b>mulching</b> (with plastic or straw) reduces evaporation, modifies soil temperature and thereby affects crop yields. Reported effects of <b>mulching</b> are sometimes contradictory, likely {{due to differences in}} climatic conditions, soil characteristics, crop species, and also water and nitrogen (N) input levels. Here we report on a meta-analysis of the effects of <b>mulching</b> on wheat and maize, using 1310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries. Our results indicate that <b>mulching</b> significantly increased yields, WUE (yield per unit water) and NUE (yield per unit N) by up to 60 %, compared with no-mulching. Effects were larger for maize than wheat, and larger for plastic <b>mulching</b> than straw <b>mulching.</b> Interestingly, plastic <b>mulching</b> performed better at relatively low temperature while straw <b>mulching</b> showed the opposite trend. Effects of <b>mulching</b> also tended to decrease with increasing water input. <b>Mulching</b> effects were not related to soil organic matter content. In conclusion, soil <b>mulching</b> can significantly increase maize and wheat yields, WUE and NUE, and thereby may contribute to closing the yield gap between attainable and actual yields, especially in dryland and low nutrient input agriculture. The management of soil <b>mulching</b> requires site-specific knowledge. </p...|$|R

The results indicated that <b>mulching</b> mode had significant effects on micro-meteorological factors and individual growth of rice, as shown by an increase of relative humidity, a better internal micro-meteorological environment of rice population, a significant reduction under the rice canopy temperature, especially during high-temperature periods. Rice plants under <b>mulching</b> cultivation conditions displayed a stronger transpiration and lower leaf temperature, thereby improving the ability of anti-high temperature stress and markedly increasing the photosynthetic rate. Furthermore, the yield components of rice were significantly optimized under <b>mulching</b> cultivation, of which with plastic film <b>mulching</b> displayed the highest grain number per panicle and seed-setting rate, and a yield increase of 16. 81 % compared with the control; and with straw <b>mulching</b> displayed an increase of effective panicle number and a 9. 59 % increase of total yield compared to the control...|$|R
40|$|Straw <b>mulching</b> is an {{effective}} measure to improve soil properties, crop growth, and yield. To further understand the advantage mechanisms of straw <b>mulching,</b> a field experiment with seven straw <b>mulching</b> levels (0 to 18 000 kg ha- 1) was conducted to {{study the effects of}} straw <b>mulching</b> on maize (Zea mays L.) photosynthesis and rhizosphere soil micro-ecological environment. Results showed that maize chlorophyll content was evidently affected by straw <b>mulching,</b> and the highest chlorophyll content was at 12 000 kg ha- 1 (M 4). Straw <b>mulching</b> could significantly improve the photosynthetic characteristics of maize, and the difference between M 4 and 0 kg ha- 1 (M 0) was significant. There was as trend change in soil microbe quantity; it first increased and then decreased with increasing straw <b>mulching</b> levels, and the most suitable straw <b>mulching</b> level for different types of microorganisms was 9000 kg ha- 1 (M 3) or M 4. Straw <b>mulching</b> significantly enhanced soil enzyme urease, invertase, dehydrogenase, and protease activities, but when the straw <b>mulching</b> level reached a certain level, the effect of straw <b>mulching</b> was no longer apparent and even had some adverse effects at straw <b>mulching</b> levels higher than 15 000 kg ha- 1 (M 5). Yield in M 4 (10 186. 84 kg ha- 1) was the highest compared with M 0 (9365. 12 kg ha- 1), and yield significantly increased by 8. 8 %. Correlation analyses indicated that the soil microbe quantity and aforementioned enzyme activities were all significantly and positively correlated with maize chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, and yield. Findings suggest that straw <b>mulching</b> can apparently increase soil microbe quantity and enzyme activities and improve crop photosynthesis and yield; the M 4 level is the most reasonable straw <b>mulching</b> level in this study under comprehensive consideration, and a straw <b>mulching</b> level that is too high (over M 5) will have some negative effects...|$|R

40|$|Improving farming {{practices}} {{of soil and}} water conservation has profound effects on the yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in dryland farming regions of the Loess Plateau in China. <b>Mulching</b> has proven to be an effective practice to increase crop yield, and possibly contrib-ute to replenishing groundwater. This evaluation study collected and analyzed the data of 1849 observations published in 38 papers using meta-analysis to investigate effects of the <b>mulching</b> practices on wheat yield in terms of different rainfall and regions in comparison with conventional tillage. The main results of the study follow. The effects of the <b>mulching</b> practices were ranked in the order of RFM (ridge–furrow <b>mulching)</b> >MTMC (<b>mulching</b> with two materials combined) >MOM (<b>mulching</b> with other materials) >WSM (wheat straw <b>mulching)</b> > FM (flat <b>mulching).</b> The effects of the <b>mulching</b> practices at the different levels of rainfall during the wheat growing season were in the order: ( (> 250 mm) > (150 – 250 mm). The effects of the <b>mulching</b> practices in the different regions were in the order of Henan> Shanxi> Shaanxi>Gansu. WSM, MTMC and FM performed better in im-proving wheat yield for rainfall of 250 mm during the growing season, respectively. The wheat yield with FM, MTMC, MOM and MOM was higher than those with the other <b>mulching</b> practices in Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan and Shanxi. The wheat yield with RFM was 27. 4 % higher than that with FM, indicating that RFM was the most effective prac-tice to improve wheat yield among all the practices.
