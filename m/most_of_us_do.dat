There is currently no substitute for undertaking surgery under supervision, as close as necessary according to the surgeon’s experience, on real patients with real problems: assessing those problems carefully and undertaking the appropriate and well-planned surgery to {{try to deal with}} these problems. This does not, of course, mean just turning up to an operating list; it involves careful history-taking, clinical assessment, and examination, as well as obtaining the patient’s informed consent. It involves observing how a variety of clinicians deal with different problems, assessing the aggressive and timid approaches to surgery, and looking at the audit of results, where these exist. Most units, though, lack any defined way of assessing the efficacy of their surgeries.|$|R

"Because of {{the safety}} in the Sea Valley, which {{was because of the}} wall and the watchers and the guards, and because there was food in plenty for all without having to fight for it, many {{families}} came in from the coast valleys on both sides and from the high back mountains where they had lived more like wild animals than men. And it was not long before the Sea Valley filled up, and in it were countless families. But, before this happened, the land, which had been free to all and belonged to all, was divided up. Three-Legs began it when he planted corn. But <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>did</b> not care about the land. We thought the marking of the boundaries with fences of stone was a foolishness.

6000|$|Hence, {{when his}} name was casually {{mentioned}} by neighbouring yeomen, the listener said, [...] "Ah, Clym Yeobright: {{what is he doing}} now?" [...] When the instinctive question about a person is, What is he doing? it is felt that he will be found to be, like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>doing</b> nothing in particular. There is an indefinite sense that he must be invading some region of singularity, good or bad. The devout hope is that he is doing well. The secret faith is that he is making a mess of it. Half a dozen comfortable marketmen, who were habitual callers at the Quiet Woman as they passed by in their carts, were partial to the topic. In fact, though they were not Egdon men, they could hardly avoid it while they sucked their long clay tubes and regarded the heath through the window. Clym had been so inwoven with the heath in his boyhood that hardly anybody could look upon it without thinking of him. So the subject recurred: if he were making a fortune and a name, so much the better for him; if he were making a tragical figure in the world, so much the better for a narrative.|$|R

It is even possible that she enjoyed moments of it, when {{she was one of the}} gay circle in the little house of dreams. But if Anne ever hoped that she was forgetting Owen Ford she would have been undeceived by the furtive hunger in Leslie's eyes whenever his name was mentioned. Pitiful to that hunger, Anne always contrived to tell Captain Jim or Gilbert bits of news from Owen's letters when Leslie was with them. The girl's flush and pallor at such moments spoke all too eloquently of the emotion that filled her being. But she never spoke of him to Anne, or mentioned that night on the sand-bar.|$|E

I'd demand all I could get--whether I finally settled down to designing frocks or building temples or pressing pants. What if you do drop back? You'll have had the adventure. Don't be too meek toward life! Go! You're young, you're unmarried. Try everything! Don't listen to Nat Hicks and Sam Clark and be a 'steady young man'--in order to help them make money.

40|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>doing</b> {{research}} have a preferred material, {{a set of}} well-tried techniques, a standing list of unsolved problems, {{ways of looking at}} or of doing things, which we share to a large extent with colleagues in the same laboratory and others in the same area of specialization, be they friends, former associates, or competitors. All this and more is encompassed by the concept of "experimental system" as introduced and used by Hans-Jörg Rheinberger (76, 77), a historian of science. His concept, rather flexible and rich in metaphors, may be easily adapted to the present narrative, which proceeds from a personal view rather than from a critical historical examination. A careful restriction of material, techniques, and nomenclature allows more constructive interactions between different laboratories and different generations of scientists in the same field. Of course, carried out to excess, this process will stifle developments in new areas and defer some discoveries. Max Delbrück, who in the early forties had forcefully advocated the study of bacteriophage as the royal road to the secrets of replication and recombination, was quite outspoken about the necessity for workers on that road to use a common material (the T phages in Escherichia coli B) and precisely standardized techniques (1). Of course, the T phages are generally virulent, take-no-prisoner parasites of bacteria and thus could not instruct us about the more shadowy interactions between "weaker" bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts: about lysogeny, where infection meets heredity...|$|R

60|$|Being {{surrounded}} with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy, Gabriel had to revolt into something, so he revolted into {{the only thing}} left--sanity. But there was just enough in him of the blood of these fanatics to make even his protest for common sense a little too fierce to be sensible. His hatred of modern lawlessness had been crowned also by an accident. It happened that he was walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite outrage. He had been blind and deaf for a moment, and then seen, the smoke clearing, the broken windows and the bleeding faces. After that he went about as usual--quiet, courteous, rather gentle; {{but there was a}} spot on his mind that was not sane. He did not regard anarchists, as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>do,</b> as a handful of morbid men, combining ignorance with intellectualism.

60|$|To {{read all}} of Burke's {{collected}} works, and so to understand him thoroughly, {{is something of a}} task. Few are equal to it. On the other hand, to read selections here and there, as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>do,</b> is to get a wrong idea of the man and to join either in fulsome praise of his brilliant oratory, or in honest confession that his periods are ponderous and his ideas often buried under Johnsonian verbiage. Such are the contrasts to be found on successive pages of Burke's twelve volumes, which cover the enormous range of the political and economic thought of the age, and which mingle fact and fancy, philosophy, statistics, and brilliant flights of the imagination, to a degree never before seen in English literature. For Burke belongs in spirit to the new romantic school, while in style he is a model for the formal classicists. We can only glance at the life of this marvelous Irishman, and then consider his place in our literature.|$|E

He migrates--he makes wars and conquests--one race mingles with another--different customs are brought into contact--the habits of a migrating or conquering race are modified by the different circumstances of a new country. The civilized race which conquered Egypt must have developed its mode of building in a forest country where timber was abundant, for it is not probable, {{that the idea of}} cylindrical columns originated in a country destitute of trees. The pyramids might have been built by an indigenous race, but not the temples of El Uksor and Karnak. In Grecian architecture, almost every characteristic feature can be traced to an origin in wooden buildings. The columns, the architrave, the frieze, the fillets, the cantelevers, the form of the roof, all point to an origin in some southern forest-clad country, and strikingly corroborate the view derived from philology, that Greece was colonised from north-western India. But to erect columns and span them with huge blocks of stone, or marble, is not an act of reason, but one of pure unreasoning imitation. The arch is the only true and reasonable mode of covering over wide spaces with stone, and therefore, Grecian architecture, however exquisitely beautiful, is false in principle, and {{is by no means a}} good example of the application of reason to the art of building.

It was not strange that he should so heartlessly have betrayed his friends' confidence, nor that he hesitated not at all to gratify a whim {{at the cost of}} another's misery. That was in his character. He was a man without any conception of gratitude. He had no compassion. The emotions common to <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> simply <b>did</b> not exist in him, and it was as absurd to blame him for not feeling them as for blaming the tiger because he is fierce and cruel. But it was the whim I could not understand.|$|R
