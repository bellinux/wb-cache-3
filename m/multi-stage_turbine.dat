5000|$|By 1905, when steam {{turbines}} were coming into use on fast ships (such as [...] ) and in land-based power applications, {{it had been}} determined that it was desirable to use one or more Curtis wheels {{at the beginning of}} a <b>multi-stage</b> <b>turbine</b> (where the steam pressure is highest), followed by reaction stages. This was more efficient with high-pressure steam due to reduced leakage between the turbine rotor and the casing. This is illustrated in the drawing of the German 1905 AEG marine steam turbine. The steam from the boilers enters from the right at high pressure through a throttle, controlled manually by an operator (in this case a sailor known as the throttleman). It passes through five Curtis wheels and numerous reaction stages (the small blades at the edges of the two large rotors in the middle) before exiting at low pressure, almost certainly to a condenser. The condenser provides a vacuum that maximizes the energy extracted from the steam, and condenses the steam into feedwater to be returned to the boilers. On the left are several additional reaction stages (on two large rotors) that rotate the turbine in reverse for astern operation, with steam admitted by a separate throttle. Since ships are rarely operated in reverse, efficiency is not a priority in astern turbines, so only a few stages are used to save cost.|$|E

Tests were carried out using the two-stage Low Speed Research Turbine of the Aerodynamics Research Laboratory of GE Aircraft Engines. Blading in this facility models current, state-of-the-art low pressure turbine configurations. The instrumentation technique involved arrays of densely-packed hot-film sensors on the surfaces of second stage rotor and nozzle blades. The arrays were located at mid-span on both the suction and pressure surfaces. Boundary layer measurements were acquired over a complete range of relevant Reynolds numbers. Data acquisition capabilities provided means for detailed data interrogation in both time and frequency domains. Data indicate that significant regions of laminar and transitional boundary layer flow exist on the rotor and nozzle suction surfaces. Evidence of relaminarization both near {{the leading edge of}} the suction surface and along much of the pressure surface was observed. Measurements also reveal the nature of the turbulent bursts occuring within and between the wake segments convecting through the blade row. The complex character of boundary layer transition resulting from flow unsteadiness due to nozzle/nozzle, rotor/nozzle, and nozzle/rotor wake interactions are elucidated using these data. These measurements underscore the need to provide turbomachinery designers with models of boundary layer transition to facilitate accurate prediction of aerodynamic loss and heat transfer...|$|E
40|$|For the {{calculation}} of <b>multi-stage</b> <b>turbines</b> it is common practice to use inviscid duct-flow and through-flow methods which make an attempt to acquire frictional influences by appropriate models for {{taking into account the}} clearance and secondary flows as well as losses. Even against the backdrop of rapidly increasing computer capacities such methods are indispensible with regard to reasonable CPU times for multi-stage machines. One disadvantage of the models and empirical correlations used for this purpose is that they rely on existing airfoil families. For this reason these loss models certainly cannot approximate the real blade geometry and the flow field lying within it as good as any calculation of the viscous three-dimensional flow in the individual cascade does. The objective of this project is to determine and test an improved loss modeling for a quasi-three-dimensional through-flow method on the basis of individual cascade calculations by means of an available 3 -d Navier-Stokes method in accordance with Weskamp {{based on the work of}} Luecking and Lawrenz.

40|$|The two {{principal}} existing methods of calculating axially-symmetric compressible flow in turbomachines are: (1) a simplified one-dimensional analysis, and (2) numerical methods using the complete or linearized flow equations.

The purpose of this investigation is to extend the approximate methods, successfully used in calculating incompressible flow in compressors with constant blade height, {{to the analysis of}} compressible flow in turbomachines with variable blade height. Assuming that the blades can be completely defined by the exit flow angle, and neglecting the influence of downstream blades, the analysis is made considering the flow between successive blade rows only. With these restrictions, subsonic and isentropic supersonic flow patterns can be determined for arbitrary boundary shapes as long as separation does not occur.

40|$|A turbine was {{investigated}} by various methods of calculating its efficiency. The project {{was based on}} an existing impulse turbine, a one-stage turbine set in an organic Rankine cycle with the working fluid being R 245 fa. Various methods of loss calculation were explored in the search for a method sufficiently accurate to make valid assumptions regarding the turbine performance, while simple enough to be time efficient for use in industrial research and development.   The calculations were primarily made in an isentropic manner, only taking into account losses due to the residual velocity present in the exit flow. Later, an incidence loss was incorporated in the isentropic calculations, resulting in additional losses at off-design conditions. Leaving the isentropic calculations, the work by Tournier, “Axial flow, <b>multi-stage</b> <b>turbine</b> and compressor models” was used. The work presents a method of calculating turbine losses separated into four components: profile, trailing edge, tip clearance and secondary losses. The losses applicable to the case were implemented into the model. Since the flow conditions of the present turbine are extreme, the results were not expected to coincide with the results of Tournier. In order to remedy this problem, the results were compared to results obtained through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of the turbine. The equations purposed by Tournier were correlated in order to better match the present case.

40|$|The {{gas turbine}} has the {{potential}} for power production at the highest possible efficiency. The challenge is to ensure that gas turbines operate at the optimum efficiency so as to use the least fuel and produce minimum emissions. A key component to meeting this challenge is the turbine. Turbine performance, both aerodynamics and heat transfer, is one of the barrier advanced gas turbine development technologies. This {{is a result of the}} complex, highly three-dimensional and unsteady flow phenomena in the turbine. Improved turbine aerodynamic performance has been achieved with three-dimensional highly-loaded airfoil designs, accomplished utilizing Euler or Navier-Stokes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. These design codes consider steady flow through isolated blade rows. Thus they do not account for unsteady flow effects. However, unsteady flow effects have a significant impact on performance. Also, CFD codes predict the complete flow field. The experimental verification of these codes has traditionally been accomplished with point data - not corresponding plane field measurements. Thus, although advanced CFD predictions of the highly complex and three-dimensional turbine flow fields are available, corresponding data are not. To improve the design capability for high temperature turbines, a detailed understanding of the highly unsteady and three-dimensional flow through multi-stage turbines is necessary. Thus, unique data are required which quantify the unsteady three-dimensional flow through <b>multi-stage</b> <b>turbine</b> blade rows, including the effect of the film coolant flow. Also, as design CFD codes do not account for unsteady flow effects, the next logical challenge and the current thrust in CFD code development is multiple-stage analyses that account for the interactions between neighboring blade rows.

40|$|For the {{aerodynamic}} {{design of}} multistage compressors and turbines Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays a fundamental role.

Together with the availability of more and more powerful computing resources, current trends pursue the adoption of such high-fidelity tools and state-of-the-art technology even in the preliminary design phases. Within such a framework Graphical Processing Units (GPUS) yield further growth potential, allowing a significant reduction of CFD process turn-around times at relatively low costs. The target of the present work is to illustrate the design and implementation of an explicit density-based RANS coupled solver for the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of multi-dimensional time-dependent compressible fluid flows on polyhedral unstructured meshes. The solver has been developed within the object-oriented OpenFOAM framework, using OpenCL bindings to interface CPU and GPU and using MPI to interface multiple GPUS.

The principal objective of the study has been to develop and validate computer modelling methods of the cooling flow distribution and heat transfer management, in the environs of <b>multi-stage</b> <b>turbine</b> disc rims and blade fixings, with a view to maintaining component and sub-system integrity, whilst achieving optimum engine performance and minimising emissions. A fully coupled analysis capability has been developed using combinations of commercially available and in-house computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element (FE) thermo-mechanical modelling codes. The main objective of the methodology is to help decide on optimum cooling configurations for disc temperature, stress and life considerations. The new capability also gives us an effective means of validating the method by direct use of disc temperature measurements, where otherwise, additional and difficult to obtain parameters, such as reliable heat flux measurements, would be considered necessary for validation of the use of CFD for convective heat transfer. A two-stage turbine test rig has been developed and improved to provide good quality thermal boundary condition data with which to validate the analysis methods. A cooling flow optimisation study has also been performed to support a re-design of the turbine stator well cavity, to maximise the effectiveness of cooling air supplied to the disc rim region.

40|$|The flow in a <b>multi-stage</b> <b>turbine</b> is characterised by complex {{steady and}} {{unsteady}} 3 D - flow phenomena such as rotor-stator interactions or secondary flow phenomena like the passage - or the vortex. The unsteady flow field itself {{is influenced by}} different parameters, like the blade geometry, the flow in the shroud cavities or the relative position of the guide vanes respectively the rotating blades among each other (clocking). Understanding the basic mechanism relating development and propagation of secondary flow phenomena is key to reducing the aerodynamic losses. The aim of this project was {{the investigation of the}} influence of open and closed shroud cavities, blade geometry, axial blade distance, relative positions of the guide vanes and the rotor blades to each other (clocking) and the operating conditions on the flow losses, related by the interaction between the guide vanes and the rotor blades. These influences are analysed by coupled experimental and numerical investigation on a two-stage test turbine. The test turbine is built up in a modular way, so that different bladings (a basis- and an optimised blading) and different endwall, rotor and hub geometries can be investigated. For the numerical investigations the in-house Navier-Stockes - solver CHT-flow has been used. The comparison of the basis blading and the optimised blading shows that due to the design of the optimised blading the secondary flow regions at the hub and the tip could have been reduced significantly. Thus, a radially homogeneous flow field and therefore an increased efficiency could be achieved for the optimised blading. Further numerical and experimental investigations showed that due to opened shroud cavities the boundary layer at the hub and the tip has been increased. This leads to a displacement of the secondary flows from the endwalls towards the middle of the channel. Furthermore additional losses are induced, leading to an overall decrease in efficiency. Investigations concerning the clocking showed a potential in increase of efficiency of about 0. 5 % between the worst and the optimised clocking position. Furthermore, the 'balance-based'-method has been applied successfully into the numerical in-house flow solver CHT-flow. Due to the closely co-operation with the industrial partner ALSTOM it is warranted, that the main results can be implemented directly in the internal development processes. (orig.)

40|$|Turbomachines have {{experienced}} a fast development over the last years, and are present {{in a wide range}} of devices involved in the generation of electricity and the transportation sector. Current challenges in both sectors have driven quite a number of developments regarding the increase of efficiency and use of new types of devices. Those changes have also affected turbomachinery design, and new innovative approaches are being used in order to solve current problems. As the design of those machines is sometimes done without lot of prior knowledge, new design techniques are required. Design optimization is usually involving a wide range of disciplines. When it comes to turbomachinery applications, this becomes more challenging as there are lot of parameters involved in the design. The heterogeneous range of applications imposes challenges from the designer point of view as different architectures may need to be considered, different working fluids, different number of stages, etc. In this Master Thesis, the problem of multi-stage turbomachinery analysis will be undertaken. Simulation of multi-stage turbomachinery presents a number of limitations when it comes both to modelling of the problem and the use of CFD codes, among which the main one is the modelling of the stator-rotor interface. To overcome this problem, a number of solutions are proposed, of which some are presented in the present report. The Mixing-Plane interface is one of the most used, especially when design optimization is considered. The Mixing-Plane interface creates an artificial interface between turbomachinery blade rows which forces the match of the average of physical quantities at both upstream and downstream sides of the interface. However, since in general specialised turbomachinery solvers are multi-block structured, current approaches based on the Mixing-Plane interface are not adapted to unstructured edge based solvers. This imposes limitations in the mesh types that can be used for simulating turbomachinery, and add some design constrains. In this Master Thesis the existing methods are analysed and extended to the edge based unstructured solver SU 2. After implementing the proposed approach, a <b>multi-stage</b> <b>turbine</b> for which experimental data is available is simulated.

The desired overall pressure ratio for the engine cycle is usually achieved by multiple axial stages on the core compression. Rolls-Royce tend to split the core compression into two with an intermediate pressure (IP) supercharging the HP compressor, both units being driven by turbines with a single stage, mounted on separate shafts. Consequently, the HP compressor need develop only a modest pressure ratio (e.g., ~4.5:1). US civil engines use much higher HP compressor pressure ratios (e.g., ~23:1 on the General Electric GE90) and tend {{to be driven by}} a two-stage HP turbine.

40|$|Aero-engines {{have high}} speed rotors {{carrying}} <b>multi-stage</b> <b>turbine</b> and compressor discs. Such systems need continuous monitoring during the operating regime. These rotors are mounted on ball bearings supported with squeeze film dampers {{and connected to}} stator casings. The motions of bearings and rotor are influenced by each other and therefore such a system requires structural dynamic studies. These rotors involve several nonlinear factors including contact forces, varying compliance vibration of ball bearing, nonlinear oil-film force of squeeze film damper etc Solving such nonlinear dynamic problems using the traditional transfer matrix method, modal synthesis approach, finite element method or impedance coupling technique is therefore a challenging task. Present work focuses on modelling of rotors using ball bearing nonlinearities along with nonlinear secondary transient excitations using finite element modelling. In order to validate the finite element model, preliminary dynamic analysis is carried out using linear spring-damper bearing elements. Results are illustrated both for LP rotor model and twin-spool rotor. Initially, the natural frequencies obtained from the computer program based on Timoshenko beam elements are validated with ANSYS results. Further, the results are also validated with those obtained from impact hammer tests on a scaled dual disk rotor-bearing system. To utilize this finite element model, the time and frequency-domain response studies are conducted with double-row ball bearing forces, rub-impact forces, Muszynska’s gas transients along with squeeze-film forces. In all the cases, differences from simple rotor supported by single-row ball bearings with only unbalance excitations have been reported. Using the fundamental frequency and its amplitude, an inverse modelling approach is applied to predict the parameters of rotor bearing system such as increased bearing clearance, changes in disc unbalances and the centralizing spring constants in squeeze-film damper. In this regard, a trained model of 3 -layer perceptron neural network model is employed. In the second study, changes in dynamic response due to waviness and race-way defects in ball-bearings are first studied using modified contact force relations. Using this data, type of bearing fault is estimated from the statistical parameters of the time-domain signal by training an unsupervised Kohenen’s neural network model. Here, the simulated data is collected from the rotor over an operating speed range. In the third study, the additional stiffness of rotor due to rub-impact forces is identified from optimization modelling. Such identification of rotor stiffening effect using finite element modelling is a new concept. Two types of control studies are proposed to minimize the amplitudes of rotor during the critical operating conditions. Semi active electromagnetic damper design helps in reducing vibration amplitudes of the LP rotor over a frequency range of interest. Here, the damper comprises of an electro-magnet and a spring. The required current and spring stiffness are identified from the basic relations {{and the results of}} control are illustrated with a two-disc LP rotor model. In active controller design, an electromagnetic actuator model is employed. The nominal gap maintained between the rotor and actuator coils is used in computing the actuator force. A proportional derivative (PD) control strategy is used to estimate the required forces. A neural network based alternate control scheme also proposed to compute the required actuator forces. In overall, the work focussed on the dynamic analysis of dual disc rotor model subjected to parametric nonlinear bearing loads under the action of various external forces and some controller design aspects applicable to this rotor. ...|$|E

5000|$|Contra-rotating turbines. With axial turbines, some {{efficiency}} advantage can {{be obtained}} if a downstream turbine rotates {{in the opposite direction}} to an upstream unit. However, the complication can be counter-productive. A contra-rotating steam turbine, usually known as the Ljungström turbine, was originally invented by Swedish Engineer Fredrik Ljungström (1875-1964) in Stockholm, and in partnership with his brother Birger Ljungström he obtained a patent in 1894. The design is essentially a <b>multi-stage</b> radial <b>turbine</b> (or pair of 'nested' turbine rotors) offering great efficiency, four times as large heat drop per stage as in the reaction (Parsons) turbine, extremely compact design and the type met particular success in back pressure power plants. However, contrary to other designs, large steam volumes are handled with difficulty and only a combination with axial flow turbines (DUREX) admits the turbine to be built for power greater than ca 50 MW. In marine applications only about 50 turbo-electric units were ordered (of which a considerable amount were finally sold to land plants) during 1917-19, and during 1920-22 a few turbo-mechanic not very successful units were sold. Only a few turbo-electric marine plants were still in use in the late 1960s (ss Ragne, ss Regin) while most land plants remain in use 2010.|$|R

Steam turbines {{are available for}} a wide range of steam conditions, power ratings and speeds. In this work, a simple predictive tool, which is easier than existing approaches, less complicated with fewer computations, is presented for rapid prediction of steam rate, turbine efficiency, and the inlet and exhaust nozzle diameters to determine the actual steam rate (ASR) and total steam requirements for both <b>multi-stage</b> and single-stage <b>turbines.</b> The proposed method predicts the above mentioned parameters for inlet steam pressures up to 12, 000 kPa, turbine ratings up to 10, 000 kW as well as the exhaust air over inlet air ratios of up to 0. 55. The predictions from the proposed predictive tool have been compared with reported data and found good agreement with average absolute deviation hovering around 1. 4 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to make a detailed systematic analysis of two-stage, axial flow turbine by using of different losses models and a new suggested algorithm based on one-dimensional simulation. The suggested method is found to be effective, fast and stable, in obtaining performance characteristics of <b>multi-stage</b> axial flow <b>turbines.</b> In one-dimensional modeling, mass flow rate, pressure ratio and efficiency are unknown, with define turbine geometry, inlet total pressure and temperature the turbine performance characteristics can be modeled. This modeling is based on common thermodynamics and aerodynamics principles in a mean stream line analysis under steady state condition. Finally, in order to have a better understanding of the loss models behavior and verify the suggested algorithm accuracy, the analytical results from modeling were compared with experimental results and the comparison shows that good adaptation is obtained.

40|$|Transonic {{flows through}} axial, <b>multi-stage,</b> {{transcritical}} ORC <b>turbines,</b> are investigated {{by using a}} numerical solver including advanced multiparameter equations of state and a high-order discretization scheme. The working fluids in use are the refrigerants R 134 a and R 245 fa, classified as dense gases due to their complex molecules and relatively high molecular weight. Both inviscid and viscous numerical simulations are carried out to quantify the impact of dense gas effects and viscous effects on turbine performance. Both supercritical and subcritical inlet conditions are studied for the considered working fluids. In the former case, flow across the turbine is transcritical, since turbine output pressure is subcritical. Numerical results show that, due to dense gas effects characterizing the flow at supercritical inlet conditions, supercritical ORC turbines enable, for a given pressure ratio, a higher isentropic efficiency than subcritical turbines using the same working fluid. Moreover, for the selected operating conditions, R 134 a provides a better performance than R 245 fa. ADEME-PROJET SUROR...|$|R
