Anders Sandberg estimates that there is 1.82 kg of easily usable building <b>material</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600kg/m2—about 8–20cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79 kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42kg/m2.|$|E

5|$|Fly ash {{and bottom}} ash are two {{byproducts}} made through {{the burning of}} coal in power stations.

Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill <b>material</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction industry and {{in the production of}} grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled.
