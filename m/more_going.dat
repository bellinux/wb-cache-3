25|$|Once in Harlem, a news {{broadcast}} about {{the bombing of}} the convent causes the group to realize there is <b>more</b> <b>going</b> on than they know. The Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess only desires power and uses invented miracles to court converts. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport and bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora examines her again. When he leaves, Aurora reveals (without being told) that she is pregnant with twins despite being a virgin.|$|E
25|$|Frederick I of Prussia, Elector of Brandenburg {{and future}} King of Prussia, saw an {{immediate}} {{interest in what}} Huguenot Refugees could represent for his country. Indeed, he was both a francophile and an admirer of the French. In October 1685, he published the Edict of Potsdam granting the Huguenots everything the Edict of Fontainebleau refused them: safe passage to Brandenburg, freedom {{to live and work}} where they chose, religious freedom and the right to worship in their native French, tax exemptions for 10 years, and <b>more,</b> <b>going</b> as far as granting them the same rights as citizens of the states of Brandenburg-Prussia. Meanwhile, his envoy to King Louis XIV of France's court at Versailles, the Count of Schwerin, dispensed subsidies and passports to all who requested them, provided, of course, that those requesting appeared to be of some benefit to his sovereign. As a result, the Kingdom of Prussia became for many Huguenots, in particular for the noblesse militaire, the ideal place of refuge, for Jean de Forcade de Biaix.|$|E

I think {{what was on the}} page, what I foresawnot knowing where it was going, because no one would ever tell me anythingthere was always a lot <b>more</b> <b>going</b> on in his head than he was going to show anybody, including his sons. Because, indeed, there was a lot <b>more</b> <b>going</b> on." [...] Kripke later confirmed this, stating, [...] "It's our view that John knew everything the producers of the show know. John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, {{and by the time he}} showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} team used a 3-D layout system {{to render the}} interior shots ahead separately and in advance. The art team was tasked to draw lighting boards to show the position of light sources in the scene to improve {{the overall quality of}} the animation. One of the themes in the series was [...] "Motoko Kusanagi's rebirth". The team had a difficult time portraying Motoko Kusanagi and her return to Section 9. Kenji Kamiyama stated that he felt the characters have obtained [...] "ghosts" [...] of their own and that Kusanagi needed a convincing story in order to return to Section 9. Shotaro Shuga noted that Kusanagi was <b>more</b> <b>going</b> back to her old self rather than showing the new strength she found when she left Section 9.|$|E
500|$|... "Company Picnic" [...] {{was filmed}} in Malibu, California. The episode {{featured}} about 360 extras, and was shot {{over the course}} of four days. Actor Ed Helms said of the episode, [...] "What the writers did is really fun and creative. It doesn't boil down to passive aggressive little picnic games with a vengeance. There's a lot <b>more</b> <b>going</b> on than that." [...] The episode marked return appearances of former guest stars Amy Ryan as Holly Flax and Idris Elba as Charles Miner. Ryan said she would love the prospect of returning to The Office in future episodes, but that there are currently no plans for such a return: [...] "I think that door [...] will always be open, just because it's such a nice party to go to. But that said, there are no plans any time soon for them to be reunited again." ...|$|E
500|$|Munro's {{influences}} {{included the}} work of General Idea, and the queercore movement. Speaking about the confluence of his music events and his art, Munro said in 2004, [...] "This is where the music scene and gay underground come together. We're {{at a time when}} all kinds of shifts are happening. The structure of artists' galleries are changing. Magazines are changing. There's more different kinds of artist activity that's happening. All this is having an impact on my visual work. And my visual work is more and <b>more</b> <b>going</b> into performance." [...] Galleries exhibiting his work have included Art in General, in New York City, Confederation Centre Art Gallery in Charlottetown, and Toronto galleries Zsa Zsa, Mercer Union, YYZ Artists' Outlet, Paul Petro Contemporary Art, and the Art Gallery of York University. Munro was named on the longlist of finalists for the Sobey Art Award in 2010.|$|E

500|$|Varietys Brian Lowry {{called it}} [...] "clever, irreverent, satirical and outfitted" [...] {{but that it}} was [...] "just barely" [...] capable of {{sustaining}} a running time longer than a television episode. Lisa Schwarzbaum praised the voice cast but stated that the [...] "'action' sequences sometimes falter". When comparing the film to the early episodes of the show, Stephen Rowley concluded that the film [...] "has <b>more</b> <b>going</b> for it than the show in its later years, but {{is still a long way}} short of what made it so invigorating". The Monthly critic Luke Davies echoed Lowry's concerns about the length: [...] "everything moves with the whip-crack speed of a half-hour episode. And that's the paradox: it makes the film feel like three episodes strung together. We're in a cinema, and we expect something epic." [...] He opined that [...] "in the great arc that is the history of The Simpsons, this film will come to be seen as oddity rather than apotheosis." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Circles" [...] {{was issued}} on 5 November 1982 as the closing track on Gone Troppo, sequenced after Harrison's {{song from the}} Time Bandits soundtrack, [...] "Dream Away". By this point, [...] "Circles" [...] had gained a degree of notoriety, as a title that {{frequently}} appeared on lists of the Beatles' unreleased compositions. The album's arrival coincided with heavy marketing of the Beatles' past work and a new television documentary, celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the band's debut single, [...] "Love Me Do". Writing in Mojo in 2011, John Harris described [...] "Circles" [...] as [...] "one bit of Fabs-related intrigue" [...] on a release that otherwise received little notice, due to Harrison's refusal to promote his [...] "contract-finisher" [...] with Warner Bros. Records, the distributor of his Dark Horse record label. Author Alan Clayson comments that the song's [...] "sense of once <b>more</b> <b>going</b> through the old routine" [...] matched its [...] "world-weary lyrics" [...] – {{a reflection of the}} artist's disenchantment after Warner's had rejected part of the content of his previous album, Somewhere in England.|$|E
500|$|Network Ten's {{national}} publicity director, Brian Walsh, {{believed the}} wedding episode {{would be an}} ideal marketing opportunity. He arranged for Minogue and Donovan to attend a wedding breakfast at the Park Royal Hotel in Parramatta and invited four hundred competition winners to join them. Minogue and Donovan later made an appearance with the wedding cake at Westfield Parramatta. Walsh recalled [...] "I'd {{never seen anything like}} it; there would have been 6000 people. Security had to prevent any <b>more</b> <b>going</b> inside. It was as simple as Jason and Kylie and a wedding cake on stage. There was a speech and the cutting of the cake. Then there was this near riot. We had to stop the appearance at this point to prevent people getting crushed." [...] The actors made several more appearances with replica cakes in shopping centres throughout Sydney and Melbourne. They would cut the cakes and then hand out slices to thousands of fans. The episode later become the main focus on covers of TV Week and the Australian edition of Time magazine.|$|E

500|$|David Fricke of Rolling Stone {{felt the}} album's lyrics have an [...] "emotional and {{pictorial}} directness, rare for Yorke". The lines [...] "No <b>more</b> <b>going</b> {{to the dark}} side with your flying saucer eyes / No more falling down a wormhole that I have to pull you out", from the track [...] "Atoms for Peace", were inspired by an [...] "admonition" [...] from Yorke's partner Rachel Owen. According to the Globe and Mail, [...] "The Clock", influenced by Arabic music, is a [...] "gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that you are still in charge'." [...] "Analyse" [...] was inspired by a blackout Yorke experienced in his hometown Oxford: [...] "The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built. It was beautiful." [...] The song [...] "Atoms for Peace" [...] references a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The album title was inspired by [...] "these huge elephants {{that we have in the}} room at the moment, in the west, and people are desperately trying to erase them from public consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, writing: [...] "I give the movie a {{negative}} review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying {{us what we}} more or less deserve from a Batman story. No matter how hard you try, superheroes and film noir don't go together; {{the very essence of}} noir is that there are no more heroes." [...] He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that [...] "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum called DeVito [...] "a pale substitute for Jack Nicholson from the first film" [...] and felt that [...] "there's no suspense in Batman Returns whatsoever". Batman comic book writer/artist Matt Wagner was quoted as saying: [...] "I hated how Batman Returns made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked." [...] Ty Burr in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-; he wrote that [...] "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's <b>more</b> <b>going</b> on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by Batman Returns: Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mirabeau {{sincerely}} {{wanted to}} reconcile the queen with the people, and she {{was happy to see}} him restoring much of the king's powers, such as his authority over foreign policy, and the right to declare war.

With time, Mirabeau would support the queen even <b>more,</b> <b>going</b> as far as to suggest that Louis XVI [...] "adjourn" [...] to Rouen or Compiègne.

2500|$|Carl Sandburg, {{then known}} {{better as a}} {{journalist}} than a poet, wrote an angry account accusing regulators of ignoring safety issues and claimed {{that many of the}} workers were there on company orders for a staged picnic. Sandburg also wrote a poem, [...] "The Eastland", that contrasts the disaster with the mistreatment and poor health of the lower classes at the time. After first listing the quick, murderous horrors of the disaster, then surveying the slow, murderous horrors of extreme poverty, Sandburg concludes by comparing the two: [...] "I see a dozen Eastlands/Every morning on my way to work/And a dozen <b>more</b> <b>going</b> home at night." [...] The poem was too harsh for publication when written but was eventually released as part of a collection of poems during 1993.|$|E
