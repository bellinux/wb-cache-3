50|$|The UH-2 was {{selected}} to be the airframe for the interim Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopter in October 1970. LAMPS evolved in the late 1960s from an urgent requirement to develop a <b>manned</b> <b>helicopter</b> that would support a non-aviation ship and serve as its tactical Anti-Submarine Warfare arm. Known as LAMPS Mark I, the advanced sensors, processors, and display capabilities aboard the helicopter enabled ships to extend their situational awareness beyond the line-of-sight limitations that hamper shipboard radars and the short distances for acoustic detection and prosecution of underwater threats associated with hull-mounted sonars. H-2s reconfigured for the LAMPS mission were redesignated SH-2D. On 16 March 1971, the first SH-2D LAMPS prototype first flew.|$|E

Cornu's performance was a considerable progress because his aircraft flew without additional support and lifted Cornu about 30 cm (1 ft) for 20 seconds [...] Unfortunately this early helicopter was scarcely maneuverable and had only a few additional flights.

Since much of the software and avionics systems were shared between Maverick and A160, Maverick remained in service long after A160 began flight operations. After acquiring Frontier Systems in 2004, Boeing halted most development of Maverick but it continued flying as a training asset and for reducing risk in technology development for the A160.|$|E

40|$|To {{collect the}} {{information}} on devastated districts, it is effective to use helicopters. However, the operation using <b>manned</b> <b>helicopters</b> costs a lot. It is expected {{that the use of}} unmanned helicopters can reduce the cost of these tasks. It is known to be more difficult to operate unmanned helicopters remotely than to oper-ate <b>manned</b> <b>helicopters.</b> The reason is that an oper-ator cannot know the attitude of the helicopter when the operator is far apart from it, and the coordination system between them varies drastically depending on the attitude of the helicopter. In this paper, we propose an immersive teleoper-ating method of unmanned helicopters which allows an operator to control unmanned helicopters easily and intuitively as if the operator is on board. In this method, an operator controls a helicopter remotely while watching the surrounding views of the helicopter through a head mounted display(HMD). To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we first developed a flight simulator and conducted comparative experi-ments. Then we developed an immersive teleoperat-ing system of unmanned helicopters which consists of an omnidirectional vision sensor and a HMD with an angle sensor. The experimental results indicate our proposed method has an advantage over the conven-tional operating method. ...|$|R

50|$|In December 2012, Boeing {{demonstrated}} their Unmanned Little Bird to the South Korean Army. The pilotless aircraft flew autonomously in a 25-minute demonstration {{for the purpose}} of showing unmanned capabilities technologies, such as enhanced ISR and resupply, in the system that could be integrated into Army MD 500 helicopters. In October 2015, Korean Air Aerospace Division (KAL-ASD) unveiled a mock-up of their unmanned MD 500, designated the Korean Air Unmanned System-Vertical Helicopter (KUS-VH), featuring blacked out windows, a large fuel tank where the rear seats would be that extends endurance to four hours, and an armament of two Hellfire missiles and a 2.75 in rocket pod; unlike Boeing's optionally manned and unarmed ULB, the KUS-VH is completely unmanned and armed as well as having an EO/IR sensor. The KUS-VH is envisioned to perform missions including ISR, attack, aerial delivery, coast guard, amphibious landing support, and emergency reinforcement to back up <b>manned</b> <b>helicopter</b> units. A KUS-VH unit would consist of two to four aircraft and sensor packages, a ground control system and ground support system, and it could operate alone or in conjunction with manned attack helicopters. A request for proposals for an unmanned scout helicopter is expected in 2016-2017, for which the company says making the up to 175 MD 500s unmanned would be a cheap way of reusing them after retirement from service over the next 10 years for safely performing dangerous attack missions.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{decentralized}} hybrid controller for fixed-wing UAVs assisting a <b>manned</b> <b>helicopter</b> in a United States Coast Guard {{search and rescue}} mission.

We consider two UAVs, one flying {{on either side of}} the helicopter, with constant velocity and maximum turn rate constraints. Tracking the helicopter around sharp corners will be difficult due to these constraints and the difference in path lengths for the two UAVs. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid controller that allows the UAVs to swap positions in an attempt to improve the tracking and ground coverage perfor-mance of the formation. We discuss tracking control, the position swapping algorithm and collision avoidance.

40|$|Field {{strength}} or signal-in-space (SIS) measurements {{have been performed}} by using <b>manned</b> <b>helicopters,</b> aircrafts or from ground level using extendable masts. With the availability of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) such as multicopters a new versatile platform for SIS measurements is deployable. Larger types show up to eight individually driven electric motors and controllers (therefore called octocopter). They provide the ability to fly along predefined traces, to hover at waypoints and to initiate other actions when those have been reached. They provide self-levelling and stabilisation and moreover, they may gear at a point of interest regardless of their actual position, e. g. during their flight around a tower. Their payload mainly depends on the platform size and allows integration of complex measurement equipment. Upgrading their navigation capabilities including state-of-the-art global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and ground station transmitter (real-time kinematic – RTK) enables precise localisation of the UAS. For operation in electromagnetic harsh environments a shielding can be considered and integrated into the concept. This paper describes concept and design of an octocopter and its instrumentation, along with applications in recent projects, in which we measure and validate terrestrial navigation systems applied in air traffic and the weather forecast services. Among those are instrumentation landing systems (ILS), VHF omnidirectional radio ranges (VOR), airport traffic and weather radars as well as military surveillance radars, and UHF wind profilers. Especially to investigate the possible interaction of VORs and radars with single wind turbines (WT) or wind power plants {{has become a major}} request of economy, military and politics. Here, UAS can be deployed to deliver measurement data investigating this interaction. Once developed and setup to a certain extent, UAS are easy and cost-efficient to operate. Nonetheless, due to their compact size, UAS will have rather low interaction with the electromagnetic field to be measured compared to the operation of <b>manned</b> <b>helicopters...</b>|$|R
