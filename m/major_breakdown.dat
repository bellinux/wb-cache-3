25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 23 June 2009, a severe thunderstorm struck Gweedore. It was centred on the adjoining villages of Bunbeg and Derrybeg, and lasted for several hours, causing two rivers to burst their banks, flooding houses, shops and factories, ripping up roads and destroying bridges. Lightning which lasted for two hours damaged power lines and caused a <b>major</b> <b>breakdown</b> of mobile phone service, leaving people trapped by the floods unable to contact help. Up to 20 houses were {{cut off from the}} outside world after three access bridges were carried away by the swollen rivers.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, Fry's {{mental health}} started to {{deteriorate}} severely. He had encountered {{mental health problems}} earlier in his life, experiencing a breakdown during his final year at Oxford, which meant that, although academically brilliant, he achieved a poor degree. In the late 1920s, he had a <b>major</b> <b>breakdown</b> and became deeply paranoid. He reached breaking point in 1928 {{during a visit to}} India, becoming convinced that an Indian had cast a spell on him. For the rest of his life, he dressed in bizarrely unconventional clothes. He did recover enough to become a popular writer on cricket and other sports, and even into his sixties he entertained hopes of becoming a Hollywood star. At one point when he was staying in Brighton he was supposed to have gone for a walk along the beach {{early in the morning and}} suddenly shed all his clothes, trotting around stark naked.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Waldron had a <b>major</b> <b>breakdown</b> {{caused by}} a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was {{necessary}} for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E

As she slipped closer to a <b>major</b> <b>breakdown,</b> her manager, B.P. Schulberg, began referring to her as [...] "Crisis-a-day-Clara".

The Great Clock was shut down {{for a total of}} 26 days over nine months– it was reactivated on 9 May 1977. This was the longest break in operation since its construction. During this time BBC Radio 4 broadcast the pips instead. Although there were minor stoppages from 1977 to 2002, when maintenance of the clock was carried out by the old firm of clockmakers Thwaites & Reed, these were often repaired within the permitted two-hour downtime and not recorded as stoppages. Before 1970, maintenance was carried out by the original firm of Dents; since 2002, by parliamentary staff.|$|E

40|$|The {{perspective}} of natural phenomena as computational expression {{can help us}} find ways to carry out anticipatory computing. With this goal in mind, we can reach back to Feynman’s attempt to define quantum computation. His understanding that space-time states can be defined not only {{in reference to the}} past and the present, but also to the future proves significant for showing how anticipatory processes can be computationally simulated. Anticipatory computing is embodied in adaptive, non-deterministic, and open-ended information processes. Given the realization that failure to acknowledge anticipation results in <b>major</b> <b>breakdowns</b> (such as the current global financial crisis), the need for anticipation-based computational applications is higher than ever. In this article, an anticipatory control mechanism implemented for the automotive industry is presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to identify {{factors that contribute to}} the sustainability of rural water supply facilities (WSFs). Twenty-four interviews were conducted: 16 from rural communities and 8 from water supply agencies.

Major threats to the sustainability of WSFs include high poverty levels in communities, weak institutional framework and inability of communities to handle <b>major</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Social WorkM.

40|$|Abstract – Now a days {{manufacturing}} {{industries are}} facing a greater competition in the market. Because of this, they try to improve and increase both quality and productivity continuously. One way to increase the productivity {{is to increase the}} availability of existing machines; Total productive maintenance aims to increase the availability of existing equipment so no further capital investment is needed. Availability of machines can be increased by reducing the downtime or Breakdowns of the machines. The main objective {{of this study is to}} find out the <b>major</b> <b>breakdowns</b> causing production losses to the company and to suggest counter measures by which these problems can be reduced. In the study a Root cause analysis is conducted to find the root cause of breakdowns and some parallel improvement opportunities were also identified for implementation so as to reduce the downtime...|$|R
40|$|The Technical {{infrastructure}} (electricity, cooling, etc.) {{is expected}} to have a more serious impact on the operation of the LHC than that of the SPS and LEP. For the prevention of <b>major</b> <b>breakdowns</b> and for an efficient recovery afterwards, it is mandatory to define the activities and responsibilities of the different actors contributing to the overall accelerator system operation. Additionally, a method common to all actors to monitor the status of the equipment needed for a given mode of accelerator operation is essential to improve the overall co-ordination and efficiency. This method covers the analysis, documentation and presentation of systems and system interactions and has successfully been applied to the SPS. The implications and the recommendations for its implementation in the TCR with respect to the existing accelerators or experimental areas and in particular for the LHC are discussed...|$|R

An attempt was made to probe into the factors which influence the {{second language}} acquisition in bilingual contexts. This paper employed an analytical approach to explore the viewpoints of various scholars with regard to second language acquisition and bilingualism. In this regard, psycholinguistic issues, sociolinguistic issues, neuropsychological issues, bilingual education issues, issues of formal instruction, issues of language input and issues of teacher talk were analyzed. Besides these, the different learning models like interactional language learning, content-based language learning, and cooperative learning were analyzed to find out how best these models help the students acquire the second language. The analysis of research studies by different scholars made one thing very clear that bilingual children do acquire the languages very easily without encountering any <b>major</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in the process of acquisition...|$|R
40|$|The {{communication}} and coordination between the CERN accelerator and technical control rooms will be a critical issue for an efficient operation of the LHC and its injectors, which are expected to provide also beams for fixed target experiments, for detector component tests and for other activities including machine development. Early detection of faults in the accelerator and technical infrastructure (electricity, cooling, etc.) and their possible consequences on operation are useful not only to prevent <b>major</b> <b>breakdowns</b> but also to recover from them and to reschedule efficiently machine operation to satisfy the overall beam time requests from the different and concurrent users. To meet these requirements a method to define and provide common monitoring tools for all the actors involved in machine operation has been established.
