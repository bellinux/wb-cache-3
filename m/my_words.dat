500|$|Olivia later {{viewed the}} {{recording}} of the album as a learning experience for her future music ventures; she said her time at the record label [...] "was cut short by {{the politics of the}} industry and me not actually taking my career into my own hands". She said record executives took away her control over the creation of the album given her youth and inexperience. In her 2014 autobiography Release Me: My Life, <b>My</b> <b>Words,</b> Olivia wrote that she did not consider building a cohesive set of songs during the recording process and identified the album as lacking a clear direction.

500|$|Among {{contemporary}} reviews, Time magazine declared [...] "Something" [...] to be {{the best}} track on Abbey Road, while John Mendelsohn wrote in Rolling Stone: [...] "George's vocal, containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before, is one of many highlights on his 'Something,' some of the others being more excellent drum work, a dead catchy guitar line, perfectly subdued strings, and an unusually nice melody. Both his and Joe Cocker's version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it." [...] Writing in Saturday Review magazine, Ellen Sander described [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "certainly {{one of the most beautiful}} songs George Harrison has ever written" [...] and added: [...] "He feels his way through the song, instinctively cutting through its body and into the core, emoting so clearly and so gracefully that at the moment he peals 'I don't know, I don't know,' it is shown that even what is not known can be understood." [...] In his review of the single, Derek Johnson of the NME lauded the track as [...] "a real quality hunk of pop" [...] with a [...] "strident lead guitar which exudes a mean and moody quality". Johnson stated his regret that Harrison [...] "isn't featured more regularly as a singer", and concluded of [...] "Something": [...] "It's a song that grows on you, and mark <b>my</b> <b>words,</b> it will – in a big way!" ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Life of William Marshal, {{which dates}} to soon after 1219, when word reached William Marshal, {{one of the}} richest and most {{influential}} barons, that Richard was dead, he consulted with Walter and discussed whom to support as the next king. Marshal's choice was John, but Walter initially leaned towards John's young nephew Arthur of Brittany. When Marshall was insistent on John, who was an adult, the author of the Life has Walter say in reply [...] " [...] 'So be it then,' said the archbishop, 'but mark <b>my</b> <b>words,</b> Marshal, you will never regret anything in your life as much as this.'" [...] This is almost certainly a retrospective comment that has been inserted into the biography, however, based on John's later behaviour. Once John knew he had the support of Walter and William Marshal, he sent Walter ahead to England to request all free men to pledge fealty to the new king. On 27 May 1199 Walter crowned John, supposedly making a speech that promulgated, for the last time, the theory of a king's election by the people. This story is only contained in the writings of Matthew Paris, however, and although it seems certain that Walter made a speech, it is not certain what the exact contents were. On his coronation day, John appointed Walter Lord Chancellor. W. L. Warren, historian and author of a biography of John, says of Walter that [...] "No one living had a firmer grasp of the intricacies of royal government, yet even in old age his mind was adaptable and fecund with suggestions for coping with new problems." ...|$|E
500|$|In 632, {{at the end}} of {{the tenth}} year after {{migration}} to Medina, Muhammad completed his first true Islamic pilgrimage, setting precedence for the annual Great Pilgrimage, known as Hajj. [...] On the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah Muhammad delivered his Farewell Sermon, at Mount Arafat east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. For instance, he said a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white except by piety and good action. He abolished old blood feuds and disputes based on the former tribal system and asked for old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammad asked his male followers to [...] "be good to women, for they are powerless captives (awan) in your households. You took them in God's trust, and legitimated your sexual relations with the Word of God, so come to your senses people, and hear <b>my</b> <b>words</b> ..." [...] He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness. He addressed the issue of inheritance by forbidding false claims of paternity or of a client relationship to the deceased and forbade his followers to leave their wealth to a testamentary heir. He also upheld the sacredness of four lunar months in each year. According to Sunni tafsir, the following Quranic verse was delivered during this event: [...] "Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you" [...] (Quran [...] ). According to Shia tafsir, it refers to the appointment of Ali ibn Abi Talib at the pond of Khumm as Muhammad's successor, this occurring a few days later when Muslims were returning from Mecca to Medina.|$|E
