5000|$|For every-day use, the {{equality}} (or near-equality) {{of the values}} for Macaulay and <b>modified</b> <b>duration</b> can be a useful aid to intuition. For example a standard ten-year coupon bond will have Macaulay duration somewhat but not dramatically less than 10 years and from this we can infer that the <b>modified</b> <b>duration</b> (price sensitivity) will also be somewhat but not dramatically less than 10%. Similarly, a two-year coupon bond will have Macaulay duration somewhat below 2 years, and <b>modified</b> <b>duration</b> somewhat below 2%.

Therefore, new singers often learn through listening to previous performance and depend on rote learning and memory. In this paper, we introduced a new patah lagu contour to be incorporated {{in a speech to}} singing synthesis model of Malay traditional asli music. It works by <b>modifying</b> <b>duration</b> and fundamental frequency (F 0) contour of input Malay spoken lyrics and convert it into singing voice based on musical notes, length and values from the score.

40|$|Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is {{the most}} widely grown grain crop in Australia and {{throughout}} the World, and yield is often limited by environmental stresses like drought. Australia’s wheat crop is grown mainly under rain - fed conditions, and yield losses vary with the timing and intensity of drought. Phenology genes {{play an important role}} in adaptation to a particular environment by <b>modifying</b> <b>duration</b> of crop developmental phases, and hence breeders have the opportunity to optimize developmental phases for differing environments by manipulating the allelic composition of the phenology genes. Vernalization (Vrn), photoperiod (Ppd) and autonomous earliness per se (Eps) genes are the components of wheat phenology that interact in the flowering pathway to determine the development and time of maturity of wheat. The aim of this study is to determine the most appropriate allelic combinations of Vrn 1 and Ppd genes that would improve yield in water limited environments. In a preliminary study with a double haploid (DH) population segregating for all Vrn 1 alleles, we observed nearly a month variation in physiological maturity. The number of dominant alleles pre sent was positively correlated with early flowering and maturity, but seed weight was reduced, possibly due to a reduction in the duration of grain filling. This earliness could be utilized to optimise yield in those environments where terminal drought occurs. Additional research is being undertaken in both glasshouse and field trials with segregating populations for Vrn 1 and Ppd genes, to determine the most suitable allelic combinations for changing the duration of pre - and post - flowering growth phases to optimize wheat yield in water limited environments of Western Australian wheat bel...|$|R

As would be expected, general linear model statistical analysis (GLM) showed that speech rate normalization strongly reduced the variance explained by the factor `speaker'. Nevertheless, the variance explained by the interaction between `speaker' and `phone type' remained constant. Consequently, each speaker has individual intrinsic phone durations...|$|R
