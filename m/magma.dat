5|$|Based on its composition, it {{is assumed}} that the <b>magma</b> at Licancabur formed from the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis. This <b>magma</b> melted part of the mantle wedge above the subducting plate, mixing with the melt products. Further {{contamination}} by crustal Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite-like rocks from the Archean, crystal fractionation and <b>magma</b> mixing further up in the crust then yielded the Licancabur magmas. The younger lavas may have formed from the mixing of dacite with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be from wall rocks of the <b>magma</b> chamber.|$|E
5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding <b>magma,</b> which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood.

5|$|<b>Magma</b> {{sitting in}} an {{underground}} chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The effect {{is to increase the}} concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid <b>magma,</b> making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich <b>magma</b> approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying <b>magma.</b> Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the <b>magma</b> more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.|$|E
5|$|Plinian eruptions (or Vesuvian) are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named for the historical eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD that buried the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum and, specifically, for its chronicler Pliny the Younger. The process powering Plinian eruptions starts in the <b>magma</b> chamber, where dissolved volatile gases are stored in the <b>magma.</b> The gases vesiculate and accumulate as they rise through the <b>magma</b> conduit. These bubbles agglutinate and once they reach a certain size (about 75% of the total volume of the <b>magma</b> conduit) they explode. The narrow confines of the conduit force the gases and associated <b>magma</b> up, forming an eruptive column. Eruption velocity {{is controlled by the}} gas contents of the column, and low-strength surface rocks commonly crack under the pressure of the eruption, forming a flared outgoing structure that pushes the gases even faster.|$|E
5|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of Lastarria rocks, {{like those}} of other volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone, involves the prolonged interaction with crustal rocks in <b>magma</b> chambers {{as well as the}} fractionation of certain minerals. Enriched lower crust and upper mantle might also contribute. Finally, the mixing of <b>magma</b> chamber contents with new and more mafic <b>magma</b> shortly before each eruption {{played an important role in}} rock genesis. In the case of Lastarria, this mixing occurs in a stratified <b>magma</b> chamber, with active convection occurring between lighter and colder upper contents and hotter and denser lower contents.|$|E
40|$|<b>Magmas</b> is {{a nuclear}} gene that encodes for the {{mitochondrial}} import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim 16. <b>Magmas</b> is overexpressed {{in the majority}} of human pituitary adenomas and in a mouse ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma cell line. Here we report that <b>Magmas</b> is highly expressed in two out of four rat pituitary adenoma cell lines and its expression levels inversely correlate to the extent of cellular response to staurosporine in terms of apoptosis activation and cell viability. <b>Magmas</b> over-expression in rat GH/PRL-secreting pituitary adenoma GH 4 C 1 cells leads to an increase in cell viability and to a reduction in staurosporine-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation, in parallel with the increase in <b>Magmas</b> protein expression. These results indicate that <b>Magmas</b> plays a pivotal role in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli and confirm and extend the finding that <b>Magmas</b> protects pituitary cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis, suggesting its possible involvement in pituitary adenoma development...|$|R
50|$|The lava domes were erupted between 89,000-94,000 years ago. In Runtu Jarita, Argon-argon dating on {{sanidine}} {{has yielded}} ages of 88,000±4,000 to 97,000±2,000 BP. The eruption {{may have been}} caused by the injection of mafic <b>magmas</b> in the magmatic system. Presumably, the <b>magmas</b> {{were in the process of}} forming a pluton when the injection of new <b>magmas</b> led to eruption. The eruptions of Chascon initially were phreatomagmatic and influenced by local lakewaters.

40|$|Redox {{imbalance}} generates multiple cellular damages {{leading to}} oxidative stress-mediated pathological {{conditions such as}} neurodegenerative diseases and cancer progression. Therefore, maintenance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis is most important that involves well-defined antioxidant machinery. In the present study, we have identified {{for the first time}} a component of mammalian protein translocation machinery <b>Magmas</b> to perform a critical ROS regulatory function. <b>Magmas</b> overexpression has been reported in highly metabolically active tissues and cancer cells that are prone to oxidative damage. We found that <b>Magmas</b> regulates cellular ROS levels by controlling its production as well as scavenging. <b>Magmas</b> promotes cellular tolerance toward oxidative stress by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, thus preventing induction of apoptosis and damage to cellular components. <b>Magmas</b> enhances the activity of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, causing reduced ROS production. Our results suggest that J-like domain of <b>Magmas</b> is essential for maintenance of redox balance. The function of <b>Magmas</b> as a ROS sensor was found to be independent of its role in protein import. The unique ROS modulatory role of <b>Magmas</b> is highlighted by its ability to increase cell tolerance to oxidative stress even in yeast model organism. The cytoprotective capability of <b>Magmas</b> against oxidative damage makes it an important candidate for future investigation in therapeutics of oxidative stress-related diseases...|$|R
5|$|Volcanic ash is also {{produced}} during phreatomagmatic eruptions. During these eruptions fragmentation occurs when <b>magma</b> comes {{into contact with}} bodies of water (such as the sea, lakes and marshes) groundwater, snow or ice. As the <b>magma,</b> which is significantly hotter than the boiling point of water, comes into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms (Leidenfrost effect). Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to direct coupling of the cold water and hot <b>magma.</b> This increases the heat transfer {{which leads to the}} rapid expansion of water and fragmentation of the <b>magma</b> into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent. Fragmentation causes an increase in contact area between <b>magma</b> and water creating a feedback mechanism, leading to further fragmentation and production of fine ash particles.|$|E
5|$|Crystallization of this <b>magma</b> ocean {{would have}} created a mafic mantle from the {{precipitation}} and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the <b>magma</b> ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.|$|E
5|$|Explosive eruptions {{occur when}} <b>magma</b> decompresses as it rises, {{allowing}} dissolved volatiles (dominantly water and carbon dioxide) to exsolve into gas bubbles. As more bubbles nucleate a foam is produced, which decreases {{the density of}} the <b>magma,</b> accelerating it up the conduit. Fragmentation occurs when bubbles occupy ~70-80 vol% of the erupting mixture. When fragmentation occurs, violently expanding bubbles tear the <b>magma</b> apart into fragments which are ejected into the atmosphere where they solidify into ash particles. Fragmentation is a very efficient process of ash formation and is capable of generating very fine ash even without the addition of water.|$|E
40|$|Controversies {{about the}} role of carbonate-rich melts in {{processes}} ranging from mantle metasomatism to carbonatite eruptions involve debates about the following issues.

(3) Are carbonatite <b>magmas</b> derived in the crust by liquid immiscibility or crystal fractionation? Experimental data provide the following constraints: primary carbonatite <b>magmas</b> formed in mantle lherzolite at depths greater than ∼ 70 km are dolomitic; melts richer in calcite can be formed only in wehrlites at shallower depths; immiscible carbonatite <b>magmas</b> formed in the crust have variable Ca/Na, with no more than 80...|$|R
40|$|We compare {{concentrations}} of Pt, Pd, and Ir in mantle-derived <b>magmas,</b> ranging from tholeiitic basalts to komatiitic basalts, komatiites, and various alkaline <b>magmas,</b> and in oceanic and continental settings. The alkaline <b>magmas</b> {{tend to have}} higher Pt/Pd ratios, but lower Pd/Ir ratios {{than most of the}} other <b>magmas.</b> We suggest this is attributable to different melting conditions in the mantle. Under relatively "dry" melting conditions applicable to tholeiites and komatiites, Pt-alloys and Os-Ir-Ru-Rh-enriched rnonosulfide solid solution (Mss) behave in a refractory manner, resulting in sub-chondritic Pt/Pd and super-chondritic Pd/Ir. Under fluid-rich melting regimes in metasomatised lithospheric mantle sources that may be applicable to the generation of many alkaline <b>magmas,</b> the alloys/mss are more fusible, resulting in PGE ratios closer to chondrite. Bushveld <b>magmas</b> and some continental flood basalts also have relatively high Pt/Pd ratios and may thus contain a component of the metasomatised sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Komatiites have relatively low Pt/Pd suggesting that they are derived from a dry mantle source...|$|R

5|$|Of {{the five}} major volcanoes in Washington, only Glacier Peak and Mount St. Helens have had large eruptions {{in the past}} 15,000 years. Since both volcanoes {{generate}} <b>magma</b> of dacitic origin, the viscous <b>magma</b> builds up since it cannot flow through the eruptive vent. Gradually, the pressure grows, culminating in an explosion that ejects materials such as tephra, which in its simplest form, is ash.|$|E
5|$|Strombolian eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the volcano Stromboli, which has been erupting continuously for centuries. Strombolian eruptions are driven by the bursting of gas bubbles within the <b>magma.</b> These gas bubbles within the <b>magma</b> accumulate and coalesce into large bubbles, called gas slugs. These grow large enough to rise through the lava column. Upon reaching the surface, the difference in air pressure causes the bubble to burst with a loud pop, throwing <b>magma</b> {{in the air in}} a way similar to a soap bubble. Because of the high gas pressures associated with the lavas, continued activity is generally in the form of episodic explosive eruptions accompanied by the distinctive loud blasts. During eruptions, these blasts occur as often as every few minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of ash from eruptions of high-viscosity magmas (e.g., rhyolite, dacite, {{and some}} andesites) is mostly {{dependent on the}} shape of vesicles in the rising <b>magma</b> before disintegration. Vesicles are formed by the expansion of magmatic gas before the <b>magma</b> has solidified. Ash particles can have varying degrees of vesicularity and vesicular particles can have extremely high surface area to volume ratios. Concavities, troughs, and tubes observed on grain surfaces {{are the result of}} broken vesicle walls. Vitric ash particles from high-viscosity <b>magma</b> eruptions are typically angular, vesicular pumiceous fragments or thin vesicle-wall fragments while lithic fragments in volcanic ash are typically equant, or angular to subrounded. Lithic morphology in ash is generally controlled by the mechanical properties of the wall rock broken up by spalling or explosive expansion of gases in the <b>magma</b> as it reaches the surface.|$|E
40|$|<b>Magmas,</b> a conserved {{mammalian}} protein {{essential for}} eukaryotic development, is overexpressed in prostate carcinomas and cells exposed to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Reduced <b>Magmas</b> expression resulted in decreased proliferative rates in cultured cells. However, the cellular function of <b>Magmas</b> is still elusive. In this report, we have showed that human <b>Magmas</b> is an ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pam 16 having similar functions and {{is critical for}} protein translocation across mitochondrial inner membrane. Human <b>Magmas</b> shows a complete growth complementation of delta pam 16 yeast cells at all temperatures. On {{the basis of our}} analysis, we report that <b>Magmas</b> localizes into mitochondria and is peripherally associated with inner mitochondrial membrane in yeast and humans. <b>Magmas</b> forms a stable subcomplex with J-protein Pam 18 or DnaJC 19 through its C-terminal region and is tethered to TIM 23 complex of yeast and humans. Importantly, amino acid alterations in <b>Magmas</b> leads to reduced stability of the subcomplex with Pam 18 that results in temperature sensitivity and in vivo protein translocation defects in yeast cells. These observations highlight the central role of <b>Magmas</b> in protein import and mitochondria biogenesis. In humans, absence of a functional DnaJC 19 leads to dilated cardiac myophathic syndrome (DCM), a genetic disorder with characteristic features of cardiac myophathy and neurodegeneration. We propose that the mutations resulting in decreased stability of functional Magmas:DnaJC 19 subcomplex at human TIM 23 channel leads to impaired protein import and cellular respiration in DCM patients. Together, we propose a model showing how Magmas:DnaJC 19 subcomplex is associated with TIM 23 complex and thus regulates mitochondrial import process...|$|R

25|$|Generally speaking, more mafic <b>magmas,</b> such {{as those}} that form basalt, are hotter and less viscous than more silica-rich <b>magmas,</b> {{such as those}} that form rhyolite. Low {{viscosity}} leads to gentler, less explosive eruptions.|$|R
5|$|The {{types of}} {{minerals}} present in volcanic ash {{are dependent on}} the chemistry of the <b>magma</b> from which it erupted. Considering that the most abundant elements found in silicate <b>magma</b> are silicon and oxygen, {{the various types of}} <b>magma</b> (and therefore ash) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly explained in terms of their silica content. Low energy eruptions of basalt produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~45 - 55% silica that is generally rich in iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg). The most explosive rhyolite eruptions produce a felsic ash that is high in silica (>69%) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition (e.g., andesite or dacite) have a silica content between 55-69%.|$|E
5|$|These highly {{explosive}} eruptions {{are associated}} with volatile-rich dacitic to rhyolitic lavas, and occur most typically at stratovolcanoes.

40|$|The Aira caldera {{was formed}} about 22, 000 {{years ago in}} {{association}} with large-scale pyroclastic erup-tions of more than 400 km 3 felsic ejecta. Petrography was described and major/trace element compositions and K-Ar ages were determined for Aira precaldera lavas in the Yoshino-dai area, {{in order to examine}} mechanisms by which a series of the Aira precaldera and climactic <b>magmas</b> were produced. Precaldera lavas in the Yoshino-dai area mainly consist of augite-olivine basalt and two-pyroxene andesite, as previous workers indicated. K-Ar ages of precaldera basalts and andesites are> 0. 5 Ma and, in contrast, K-Ar age of precaldera rhyolite is < 0. 5 Ma and eruptions of precaldera dacites and minor pyroclastic flows may have oc-curred after — 0. 5 Ma. The precaldera and climactic ejecta show a single chemical trend with the cusp at Si 02 65 wt. % for some elements. It follows that a series of Aira precaldera <b>magmas</b> was not produced by a single process such as fractional crystallization from basaltic <b>magmas</b> or two-end-member mixing between basaltic <b>magmas</b> and rhyolitic <b>magmas.</b> The generation of a series of Aira precaldera <b>magmas</b> requires at least two processes; production of basaltic to andesitic <b>magmas</b> before — 0. 5 Ma and of dacitic to rhyolitic <b>magmas</b> after 0. 5 Ma.
