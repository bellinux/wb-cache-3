40|$|Reproductive modes are {{diverse and}} unique in anurans. Selective {{pressures}} of evolution, ecology and environment {{are attributed to}} such diverse reproductive modes. Globally forty different reproductive modes in anurans have been described to date. The genus Nyctibatrachus has been recently revised and belongs to an ancient lineage of frog families in the Western Ghats of India. Species of this genus are known to exhibit mountain associated clade endemism and novel breeding behaviours. The {{purpose of this study}} is to present unique reproductive behaviour, oviposition and parental care in a new species Nyctibatrachus kumbara sp. nov. which is described in the paper. Nyctibatrachus kumbara sp. nov. is a <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> stream <b>dwelling</b> frog. It is distinct from the congeners based on a suite of morphological characters and substantially divergent in DNA sequences of the mitochondrial 16 S rRNA gene. Males exhibit parental care by mud packing the egg clutch. Such parental care has so far not been described from any other frog species worldwide. Besides this, we emphasize that three co-occurring congeneric species of Nyctibatrachus, namely N. jog, N. kempholeyensis and Nyctibatrachus kumbara sp. nov. from the study site differ in breeding behaviour, which could represent a case of reproductive character displacement. These three species are distinct in their size, call pattern, reproductive behaviour, maximum number of eggs in a clutch, oviposition and parental care, which was evident from the statistical analysis. The study throws light on the reproductive behaviour of Nyctibatrachus kumbara sp. nov. and associated species to understand the evolution and adaptation of reproductive modes of anurans in general, and Nyctibatrachus in particular from the Western Ghats...|$|R

Environmental capabilities of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises are found to be bound to energy efficiency projects, with very few small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises having a strategic outlook toward developing these capabilities. The majority of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises did not access governmental grants to improve energy efficiency, and those who did accessed governmental rather than NGO or private sources. Around a third of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises did not invest in any form of Environmental Management System or Environmental Management Accreditation over the last two years. Environmental capabilities, which are considered to have a direct positive impact on cost reduction, are found to be attracting the highest demand from small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises.

The focus of the paper is on the international diffusion of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> firms innovations. Small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> firms face two challenges in globalization: property rights protection and barriers to entry. We suggest that these barriers can frequently be circumvented by using existing multinationals as international conduits for small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> firms' innovations. However, such intermediated modes of expansion is adversely affected by transaction difficulties and intermediator's rent extraction. We raise two categories of questions: (i) is the private sector systematically making the wrong choice between the direct and intermediated mode of international expansion? and (ii) What should be the policy guidelines to improve the overall rate of international diffusion of innovation by small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises...|$|R

As China begin to strengthen air pollution control, many coal-fired utility boilers have been installed SCR or SCR-SNCR denitration devices,but small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> coal-fired industrial boilers have not yet carried out an effective control of nitrogen oxide emissions. With the promulgation of "Boiler air pollutant emission standards" (GB 13271 - 2014), NOx concentration of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> coal-fired industrial boilers flue gas will be limited by stage.

Cobb-Douglas production, cost-benefit (C: B) and break-even ratios {{were employed to}} assess resource use efficiency and profitability and financial efficiency of cross and local breed dairy farms. The regression coefficients with respect to concentrate for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> cross breed farms are positive and significant at 10 % level. The coefficient of dry fodder for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> cross breed and local breed are positive and significant at 10 % level. For small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed farms, the coefficient for dry fodder is positive and significant at 5 % level and labor is positive and significant at 5 % level {{in the case of}} small size cross breed. For small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed farms, the coefficient for miscellaneous are positive and significant at 10 % level. There is difference between the present and optimum levels of inputs. The optimum levels of inputs with respect to concentrate are 30. 21 quintal and 24. 82 quintals for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> cross breed farms, respectively. For dry fodder, the optimum is 32. 70 quintals and 12. 84 quintal for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> cross and local breed farms, respectively. where as, 8. 88 quintals for small size local breed farms. Green fodder, the optimum level is 10. 88 quintals for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed farms. The optimum level for labor is 403. 12 man day for small size cross breed farms. For miscellaneous cost the optimum levels are 228. 54 Birr and 336. 47 Birr for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> local bred farms, respectively. The C:B results indicated that cross breed farms were profitable (1. 0 : 3. 02) than local breed farms (1. 0 : 2. 18). Both medium and small categories of cross breed farms were profitable (1. 0 : 3. 45 and 1. 0 : 2. 74, respectively). In local breed <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> farms were profitable (1. 0 : 2. 19). The ratio of break-even milk output from the actual milk production for cross breed and local breed cows owning farms needed 13 % of the actual milk {{production and}} 18 % additional milk production over the actual milk production to cover fixed cost, respectively. Cross breed small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> farms needed 8 % and 11 % milk output and local breed small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> farms requires additional 31 % and 14 % over the actual milk production. In conclusion, dairy cow's owner should be advised to use the optimum levels inputs and replace their indigenous cow with cross breed cow.
