500|$|For the U.S. and its allies, {{the victory}} in the Tenaru battle was psychologically {{significant}} in that Allied soldiers, {{after a series of}} defeats by Japanese Army units throughout the Pacific and east Asia, now knew that they could defeat the Imperial Armies in a land battle. [...] The battle also set another precedent that would continue throughout the war in the Pacific, which was the reluctance of defeated Japanese soldiers to surrender and their efforts to continue killing Allied soldiers, even as the Japanese soldiers lay dying on the battlefield. On this subject Vandegrift remarked, [...] "I have never heard or read of this kind of fighting. These people refuse to surrender. The wounded wait until men come up to examine them...and blow themselves and the other fellow to pieces with a hand grenade." [...] Robert Leckie, a Guadalcanal veteran, recalls the aftermath of the battle in his book Helmet For <b>My</b> <b>Pillow,</b> [...] "Our regiment had killed something like nine hundred of them. Most lay in clusters or heaps before the gun pits commanding sandspit, as though they had not died singly but in groups. Moving among them were the souvenir hunters, picking their way delicately as though fearful of booby traps, while stripping the bodies of their possessions." ...|$|E

500|$|A 2006 review asserted: [...] "Many are the {{knowledgeable}} and discriminating {{people for whom}} Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific, brilliantly co-written and staged by Joshua Logan, was the greatest musical of all." [...] In 1987, however, John Rockwell of The New York Times reviewed the City Opera production, commenting that while South Pacific had been innovative for 1949, [...] "Sondheim has long since transcended its formal innovations, and the constant reprises of the big tunes sound mechanical. In 1949, South Pacific epitomized {{the concerns of the}} day– America's responsibilities {{in the world and the}} dangers of racism.... At its 1967 State Theater revival, the show struck many as dated. It still seems that way, with M*A*S*H having contemporized this same setting". [...] A 2008 Huffington Post review criticized the play as having an Orientalist and Western-centric storyline in which stereotypical natives take on [...] "exotic background roles" [...] in relation to Americans, and it characterized the relationship between Cable and Liat as underage prostitution, charging that she [...] "speaks not a word in the whole musical, only smiles and takes the Yankee to bed." [...] South Pacific is the only major American musical set in World War II, but former Marine Robert Leckie wrote his memoir of that conflict, Helmet for <b>My</b> <b>Pillow,</b> after he walked out of a performance: [...] "I have to tell the story of how it really was. I have to let people know the war wasn't a musical." ...|$|E
500|$|When Cisneros {{describes}} the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, {{the theme of}} place often emerges. Place refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, {{but also to the}} positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, {{or in the case of}} their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: [...] "Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and <b>my</b> <b>pillow,</b> my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after." [...] An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for [...] "a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem." [...] She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses other women in the same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead [...] "a site of poetic self-creation." [...] One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay [...] "A Room of One's Own", that [...] "a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction," [...] or put another way, [...] "economic security" [...] and personal liberty are necessary for [...] "artistic production." ...|$|E

60|$|Merciless {{and cruel}} her {{features}} seemed to me. There was no pity, no love, not {{a shadow of}} response to my half-formed, appealing gesture. I let her go and sank back upon <b>my</b> <b>pillows,</b> weeping bitterly, with {{a deep sense of}} utter loneliness and desolation.|$|R
60|$|I {{lay back}} on <b>my</b> <b>pillows,</b> and I groaned. Here was a predicament! Mistaking me for that miserable rebel I had succoured at Mirepoix, and whose letters I bore upon me that I might restore them to some one whose name {{he had failed to}} give me at the last moment, the Vicomte de Lavedan had poured the damning story of his treason into my ears.|$|R
6000|$|I {{cried the}} whole afternoon, cowering among <b>my</b> <b>pillows.</b> I {{never wanted to}} go out of that room again. I never wanted to see anybody again. I hated the thought of facing Aunt Philippa with her cold eyes and her miserable stories that seemed to strip life of all beauty and love of all reality. I could hear her scornful, [...] "That's the men for you," [...] if she heard what was in Mark's letter.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2000, Conway {{released}} her fourth studio album, Exquisite Stereo, on Shock Records.

This was {{much more of a}} rock record than previous releases, it [...] "was a mature album featuring a wide variety of styles, from acoustic love song ("You Come to Earth") and Radiohead-styled epics ("Interzone") to full tilt rockers ("I Lay Down on <b>My</b> <b>Pillow</b> and Cried All Night")".|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of November 28, 1859, at 9:00 pm, only eight months after {{completing}} the final volume of his Washington biography, Washington Irving {{died of a heart}} attack in his bedroom at Sunnyside at the age of 76. Legend has it that his last words were: [...] "Well, I must arrange <b>my</b> <b>pillows</b> for another night. When will this end?" [...] He was buried under a simple headstone at Sleepy Hollow cemetery on December 1, 1859.|$|R

6000|$|We now went to bed, {{placing the}} crib close to <b>my</b> wife's <b>pillow.</b> All this turmoil had worn upon me, and within two minutes I was {{something}} more than half asleep. Mrs. McWilliams roused me: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, come hither," [...] {{says the}} housekeeper. [...] "Hither, child, towards <b>my</b> Lady's <b>pillow.</b> I {{am not sure}} that it is dark enough yet, but listen! Can you hear the sound upon the terrace, through the music, and the beat, and everything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, Punch," [...] {{returned}} my parent, testily, [...] "I'm in no humour for jesting. Go away, {{and let me}} get to bed and <b>pillow</b> <b>my</b> head on oblivion if possible." ...|$|R

60|$|All {{this left}} me {{presently}} very thoughtful, filled with wonder and amazement. Then their talk shifted again, {{and it was}} of the vintage they discoursed, the fine yield of grapes about Fontana Fredda, and the heavy crop of oil {{that there would be}} that year. And then with the hum of their voices gradually receding, it ceased altogether for me, and I was asleep with <b>my</b> head <b>pillowed</b> upon <b>my</b> arms.|$|R
60|$|I {{shook my}} head. She {{sprinkled}} a drop {{or two of}} eau de Cologne on <b>my</b> sheet and <b>pillow,</b> gently bathed <b>my</b> temples and hands, kindled a night-light, and left me once more to my own reflections.|$|R
6000|$|So, when I am in a voluptuous vein, [...] I <b>pillow</b> <b>my</b> {{head on the}} sweets of the rose, And list to {{the tale}} of the wreath, and the chain, [...] Till its echoes depart; then I sink to repose.|$|R

6000|$|... "Poor lad!" [...] she murmured, as I {{staggered}} {{and fell}} into a chair, unable longer to retain my feet. She rose immediately, and came hurrying towards me with a basin of goat's milk. The draught refreshed my body as her gentle words of comfort soothed my troubled soul. Seated there, her stout arm about my shoulders, <b>my</b> head <b>pillowed</b> upon her ample, motherly breast, I was very near to tears, loosened in my overwrought state by the sweet touch of sympathy, for which may God reward her.|$|R

Be-off-away--and bring her back to me before night!" ...|$|R
