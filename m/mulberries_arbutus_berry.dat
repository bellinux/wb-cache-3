40|$|In the Panasqueira mine area, Arbutus unedo L. (arbutus tree) {{grows on}} soils {{developed}} on waste materials and on soils impacted by mining activity. The <b>arbutus</b> <b>berry</b> brandy {{is considered a}} product with economic value. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate the biogeochemical impact of the mining activity on soils and arbutus trees, to assess the possible risks associated with human consumption of the fruits and the derived brandy, and to evaluate the potential of the arbutus tree in phytostabilization. Soil samples (10 - 15 cm deep) developed on waste materials, on schists affected by seepage water or treatment plant effluents and on colluvium-alluvium materials were characterized (fraction < 2 mm) for pH, particle size distribution, organic carbon (C-org), cation exchange capacity (CEC) and NPK by classical methodologies. Plant (A. unedo) samples (roots, leaves and twigs, and fruits) were collected at the same sites as the sampled soils, washed with tap and distilled water and dried at 40 A degrees C. The elements' concentrations in soils (total fraction-four-acid digestion and available fraction-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid extraction), plants (ashing followed by acid digestion) and brandy samples produced with fruits collected on contaminated and non-contaminated sites were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The soils are mainly acid, silty loam, with variable values for C-org, CEC and NPK. They are contaminated with As (158 - 7, 790 mg/kg), Cd (0. 6 - 79 mg/kg), Cu (51 - 4, 080 mg/kg), W (19 - 1, 450 mg/kg) and Zn (142 - 12, 300 mg/kg). The available fraction of the soils is quite variable between < 0. 04 and 76 % of the total, depending on the element. Trace elements' concentrations, in leaves and twigs, are within the normal range for plants, except for Cd and Zn that, in some samples, are above the normal values, but without phytotoxic symptoms. Trace elements' concentrations in fruits are low. The calculated hazard quotient for all trace elements in <b>arbutus</b> <b>berry</b> was < 0. 1. In the brandy, elemental concentrations are within the legal standards, except for Pb, whose higher concentrations may result from distillery equipment. According to the EC 466 / 2001 legislation and with a hazard quotient of < 1, the <b>arbutus</b> <b>berry</b> consumption does not constitute health risks for humans. The fruits can be used to produce local brandy. The concentration of copper in brandy is within the range established by the Portuguese legislation. Arbutus unedo can be used in the phytostabilization programs in the Panasqueira area, for it is a pioneer species and a non-accumulator of trace elements...|$|R
60|$|I rose {{each day}} with the morning sun, and left my desolate inn. As my feet strayed through the unpeopled country, my {{thoughts}} rambled through the universe, and I was least miserable when I could, absorbed in reverie, forget {{the passage of the}} hours. Each evening, in spite of weariness, I detested to enter any dwelling, there to take up my nightly abode--I have sat, hour after hour, {{at the door of the}} cottage I had selected, unable to lift the latch, and meet face to face blank desertion within. Many nights, though autumnal mists were spread around, I passed under an ilex--many times I have supped on <b>arbutus</b> <b>berries</b> and chestnuts, making a fire, gypsy-like, on the ground--because wild natural scenery reminded me less acutely of my hopeless state of loneliness. I counted the days, and bore with me a peeled willow-wand, on which, as well as I could remember, I had notched the days that had elapsed since my wreck, and each night I added another unit to the melancholy sum.|$|R
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Ciências Agrárias, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2016 Edible {{coatings}} enriched with {{essential oils}} or their constituents {{have been studied}} for their effect on increasing food storage life. The objective {{of the present study}} was to find the best edible coating formulations based on polysaccharides enriched with essential oils compounds to increase storage life of small fruit and fresh-cut. In the first year of this study, edible coating formulations based on alginate and pectin enriched with citral and eugenol were tested on <b>Arbutus</b> unedo <b>berries,</b> strawberries, raspberries and fresh-cut „Bravo de Esmolfe‟apples. General quality parameters [color CIE (L*hºC*), firmness, soluble solids content (SSC), weight loss, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), microbial growth and taste panels] were evaluated through cold storage. From them, two edible coatings which better preserved shelf-life for each polysaccharide (alginate and pectin) were chosen. The previous selected edible coatings were tested for cytotoxicity, then applied to the same fruit for studying their effect on nutritional and sensory parameters [color CIE (L*hºC*), firmness, soluble solids content, weight loss, microbial growth, taste panels, phenol compounds (total phenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins), sugars, organic acids, antioxidant activity (TEAC, ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) and DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) and taste panels]. Ethylene and CO 2 production as well as ethanol and acetaldehyde were also measured. The edible coating which better preserved fruit quality while increasing storage life was selected for commercial recommendation. Those were for <b>arbutus</b> <b>berries</b> alginate 1 % + eugenol 0. 1 % + citral 0. 15 %, for fresh-cut „Bravo de Esmolfe‟ apple was alginate 2 % + eugenol 0. 1 % plus dip in ascorbic acid, strawberries was alginate 2 % + citral 0. 15 % + eugenol 0. 1 % and for raspberrieswas pectin 1 % + citral 0. 15 %+ eugenol 0. 1 %...|$|R
40|$|Lyophilized powder (LP) from Algerian <b>arbutus</b> wild <b>berries</b> (<b>Arbutus</b> unedo L.) was obtained. This present paper {{reports about}} the {{dissolution}} (releasing) properties of LP-based tablets, evaluated through the electric conductivity (EC) of distilled water which is employed as surrounding medium, at three different temperatures (291, 298 and 309 K). In addition to this, secondary physicochemical characteristics such as elementary analysis, color and compressibility were evaluated. Regarding the modeling of ionic transfer, among the three tested models, namely Peleg, Singh et al. and Singh and Kulshestha, the latter {{seems to be the}} most appropriate (R 2 = 0. 99), particularly in the case of compacted tablets under 2000 Pa. The temperature dependence of the dissolution process was also studied applying Arrhenius equation (R 2 > 0. 8) which allowed to deduce the activation energy, ranging from 18. 7 to 21. 4 kJ. mol- 1 according to the model and compression force employed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} coating Arbutus unedo fresh fruit with alginate-based edible {{coatings}} enriched with the essential oils compounds (EOC) eugenol (Eug) and citral (Cit) was studied. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against the main postharvest pathogens were determined for Eug and Cit giving values of 0. 10 and 0. 15 (w/v), respectively. Twelve formulations of edible coatings were used: sodium alginate (AL) was tested at 1 and 2 % (w/v) with incorporation of Eug and Cit at MIC and double MIC or their combination at MIC. <b>Arbutus</b> <b>berries</b> were dipped in those solutions for 2 min, and then stored at 0. 5 degrees C. Control consisted of uncoated fruit. On days 0, 14 and 28, samples {{were taken to}} perform physicochemical and biochemical analysis [color CIE (L*, h degrees), firmness, soluble solids content (SSC), weight Loss, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), microbial growth and taste panels]. Results showed that edible coatings of 1 % AL were the best to maintain most quality attributes of the commodity through storage at 0. 5 degrees C. The incorporation of Cit and Eug into the alginate edible coatings improved the coatings in most cases, AL 1 % + Eug 0. 20 % and AL 1 % + Cit 0. 15 % + Eug 0. 10 % being those that better preserved sensory and nutritional attributes and reduced microbial spoilage. Thus, these coatings may be useful for improving postharvest quality and storage life of fresh arbutus fruit. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In the Mediterranean region {{the fruits}} of the {{strawberry}} tree (Arbutus unedo L.) may be fermented and distilled to produce a traditional beverage very much appreciated in Southern Europe. The aim of the present work was to study the diversity of the yeast population and the killer activity of the isolates identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, obtained during solid state industrial fermentations of the <b>arbutus</b> <b>berries.</b> The identification of the isolates was performed by the 5. 8 S rRNA-ITS region restriction analysis and by sequencing the D 1 /D 2 region of the large subunit of the rRNA gene. At the start of the fermentations, various non-Saccharomyces species were detected including Aureobasidium pullulans, Dothichiza pithyophila, Dioszegia zsoltii, Hanseniaspora uvarum and yeasts belonging to the genera Metschnikowia, Cryptococcus and Rhodotorula. However, as the biological processes progressed the number of different species decreased with S. cerevisiae and Pichia membranaefaciens becoming dominant at advanced stages of the must fermentation that is characterized by high concentrations of ethanol. Forty three isolates identified as S. cerevisiae were tested for killer activity against two sensitive reference strains and Zygosaccharomyces bailii. Their killer sensitivity in relation to five killer referenced toxins (K 2, K 5, K 8, K 9 and K 10) was also studied. Out of the isolates analyzed, 95. 3 % were sensitive and 4. 7 % were tolerant against the killer toxins tested. Only three isolates revealed killer activity against one sensitive strain and two of them against the spoiler yeast Z. bailii. The microbiota obtained revealed an interesting potential to be used as starter cultures to overcome unpredictable uncontrolled fermentations of the arbutus fruits as well as in other applications of biotechnological interest.

Thornton, Sr., died the same year his son was born, and the young Thornton, Jr. was brought up by his mother in Sandwich. They lived in humble circumstances. As a youth, he worked tending cows, picking trailing <b>arbutus</b> (mayflowers) or <b>berries,</b> shipping water lilies from local ponds, selling candy, and trapping muskrats. William C. Chipman, one of his employers, lived on Discovery Hill Road, a wildlife habitat of woodland and wetland.

40|$|Berries contain {{significant}} amounts of phytochemicals, including polyphenols, which are reported to reduce cancer risk, coronary heart disease and other degenerative diseases. These effects are mainly attributed to the antioxidant capacity of polyphenols found in <b>berries.</b> Strawberry tree (<b>Arbutus</b> unedo) <b>berries</b> are used in folk medicine but seldom eaten as fresh fruits. Their phenolic profile and antioxidant capacity reveal a high potential, {{but they are not}} well characterized as a “health promoting food”. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the antioxidant properties of the edible strawberry tree fruit in vitro and in a neurodegeneration cell model. Raspberry (Rubus idaeus), a well documented health-promoting fruit, was used as a control for comparison purposes. A. unedo yielded a similar content in polyphenols and a slightly lower value of total antioxidant capacity in comparison to R. idaeus. Although the chemically-measured antioxidant activity was similar between both fruits, R. idaeus increased neuroblastoma survival in a neurodegeneration cell model by 36. 6 % whereas A. unedo extracts caused no effect on neuroblastoma viability. These results clearly demonstrate that a promising level of chemically-determined antioxidant activity of a plant extract is not necessarily correlated with biological significance, as assessed by the effect of A. unedo fruit in a neurodegeneration cell model...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we attempt to}} {{investigate}} the possibility of use tableting as alternate way for valorization of some agro-resource species, including, certain date (Phoenix dactylifera L.) fruit varieties as ordinary edible fruit, strawberry tree (<b>Arbutus</b> unedo) <b>berries</b> and numerous medicinal plants. The preliminary results obtained are conclusive. In all cases, the date fruit powder is used as base matrix because of its capacity to undergo tableting. The combination of various plant species with date fruits allowed to obtain tablets with convenient physical proprieties in terms of hardness, disintegration time, erosion…Also, the final product acquired an appetizing flavor which is of a particular interest when the initial non-food matrix has a disagreeable taste. Thus, the formulation of such tablets from medicinal plants hides the bitterness, making the product more acceptable to consumers, especially those suffering from various diseases. Also, the fast dissolution of the date powder, thanks {{to the presence of}} natural simple sugars, make the obtained tablets very convenient for some patients. The physical-chemical proprieties of powder and then tablets from lyophilized strawberry berries are also investigated. Taking into account its high content in vitamin C, this powder can be employed as other natural ingredient enhancing the nutritional value of tablets, as well as their stability. Finally, the effervescent ability of date powder is studied, varying the proportions of some chemical reactants like tartaric acid, citric acid, sodium carbonate and bicarbonat...|$|R
