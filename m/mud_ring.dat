50|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>ring</b> feeding (or mud plume fishing) is a {{cooperative}} feeding behavior seen in bottlenose dolphins {{on the lower}} Atlantic coast of Florida, United States. Dolphins use this hunting technique to forage and trap fish. A single dolphin will swim {{in a circle around}} a group of fish, swiftly moving his tail along the sand to create a plume. This creates a temporary net around the fish and they become disoriented. The fish begin jumping above the surface, so the dolphins can lunge through the plume and catch the fish.|$|E
50|$|Beatty {{believed}} that, {{while the}} earlier 8th Class locomotives (later the SAR Class 8) steamed well, they would steam even {{better if they}} had a larger firegrate area. He was hampered {{by the fact that the}} firebox wrapper plates had to fit between the rearmost coupled wheels. The result was that the greatest inside width obtainable on a firebox which was arranged between the wheels of a Cape gauge locomotive was 27+1/2 in. He overcame this by designing an 8th Class locomotive with a deep curve in the foundation ring (<b>mud</b> <b>ring)</b> to clear the intermediate coupled wheels and a steep slope towards the rear to clear the trailing wheels. In the process he was able to increase the firegrate area from 21 to 27.5 sq ft.|$|E

50|$|However, Legion {{had escaped}} {{to the moon}} to {{continue}} his vendetta. When Jordan was taken to be trained by Kilowog, Legion went to Oa for a final assault on the Guardians. He easily broke through their defenses, and Jordan and Kilowog were forced to assist in Oa's defense. Nothing seemed able to stop him, and many Lanterns were killed. He reached the Guardian's citadel, but Jordan, thinking quickly, covered him with <b>mud</b> (so his <b>ring</b> could affect him) and shattered his armor, believing this would kill him. Instead, its consciousness absorbed the power of Oa and grew to immense proportions.|$|R
50|$|Individual role {{specialization}} {{has also}} been observed in bottlenose dolphins. The bottlenose dolphins form groups of three to six. One dolphin acts as the “driver” and herds the fish in circles towards the “barrier dolphins” who are tightly grouped {{together to form a}} barrier. The driver performs fluke-slaps to cause the fish to leap into the air. As the fish begin to leap, the driver moves next to the barrier dolphins, who all catch the fish in the air with their mouths open. Stefanie Gazda and colleagues predict that this role specialization is more common in marine than terrestrial animals due to a higher variability in prey diversity, biomass, and predator mobility in the ocean. One specific type of cooperative feeding behavior is <b>mud</b> <b>ring</b> feeding.|$|E
50|$|Keystone {{wall plates}} {{are used in}} {{commercial}} and industrial buildings to cleanly attach telecommunication cables etc. to a junction box, surface mount box, or a <b>mud</b> <b>ring</b> mounted in the drywall of a building. Keystone wall plates are made to work with {{many different types of}} cabling solutions, including coaxial, twisted pair, HDMI, optical fiber, etc. Keystone wall plates are made of plastic and have one to twelve ports. A keystone port is a hole in the wall plate which allows the insertion of a keystone module or other male or female cabling connectors. The most common colors of keystone wall plates are beige and white. Keystone wall plates are commonly made to be compatible with NEMA standard openings and boxes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>ring</b> feeding {{was first}} {{observed}} in 1999 {{in a group}} of 18 dolphins. An appearance of a thick cloud of suspended sediment {{on the surface of the}} water was noticed. The sediment plume then grows linearly or curvilinearly and the dolphin is observed to lead at the edge of the plume rather than just ahead. Lengths of the plume are estimated to be between 5.4 and 10.8 m. The entire behavior is observed to last an average of 17.0 seconds from the initiation of the mud plume through the final lunge. In all cases of the behavior, it is performed by a single animal and the plume is used once; though it has been seen that simultaneous plumes can be created separately by other dolphins in the group.|$|E
50|$|Some {{involved}} highly specialised hunting behaviour {{that has}} only recently been discovered. In the shallow, muddy waters of Florida Bay, one pod of bottlenose dolphins have learned a unique hunting technique called mud-ring feeding. Aerial photography shows the lead dolphin circling a shoal of mullet, flicking its tail flukes to disturb mud on the seabed. The fish trapped inside the <b>mud</b> <b>ring</b> panic and leap {{out of the water}} to escape the trap, straight into the waiting mouths of the pod. In Kenya's Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, three cheetah brothers have learned to take on prey many times their own size. They are filmed bringing down an ostrich, but also hunt zebra, eland and oryx. A film crew travelled to the Falkland Islands to follow up reports of an orca that had learned to take elephant seal pups from a nursery pool. On the Indonesian island of Rinca, the first footage of Komodo dragons hunting a water buffalo corroborated new scientific evidence suggesting the dragons used venom to kill their prey.|$|E
