Most mail orders involved fans mailing in forms, <b>money</b> <b>orders,</b> and <b>return</b> postage in the event the order could not be filled. [...] In 2005, Musictoday became the official in-arena merchandise vendor for Madison Square Garden. [...] On August 1, 2006, {{it was announced that}} Musictoday was sold to major concert promoter Live Nation. Musictoday became a division of Live Nation subsidiary Ticketmaster until 2014, when the merchandise e-commerce division was sold to Delivery Agent, a multi-channel e-commerce provider focused on television.

50|$|In the United States, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are {{typically}} sold by third parties {{such as the}} United States Postal Service, grocery stores, and convenience stores. Some financial service companies such as banks and credit unions may not charge for <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> to their clients. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> remain a trusted financial instrument. However, just because a particular business can issue a <b>money</b> <b>order</b> {{does not necessarily mean}} that they will cash them. The U.S. Postal Service issues <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> for a small charge at any location.|$|R

50|$|United States Postal <b>Money</b> <b>Orders</b> appear {{facially}} as a draft {{against an}} account {{held by the}} United States Postal Service, and the United States Postal Service requires a purchaser to know, in advance, where presentment of the instrument will occur.

In the United States, international <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are pink and domestic <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are green.|$|R
50|$|In this case, Western Union {{had issued}} <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> that were either never {{redeemed}} or erroneously underpaid (e.g. a <b>money</b> <b>order</b> for $500 paid as $300), and enough {{time had passed}} {{that the value of}} the <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> was considered unclaimed property. In such a case, unclaimed <b>money</b> <b>order</b> escheats to the state. The question of the case was, which state should get the money, the state where the <b>money</b> <b>order</b> was purchased, or the state where Western Union was incorporated? As is the practice in original jurisdiction cases, the Supreme Court had a special master hear the case and make a decision.|$|R
50|$|An {{international}} <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is {{very similar}} in many aspects to a regular <b>money</b> <b>order</b> except {{that it can be}} used to make payments abroad. With it, a buyer can easily pay a seller for goods or services if he or she resides in another country. International <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are often issued by a buyer's bank and bought in the currency that the seller accepts. International <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are thought to be safer than sending currency through the post because there are various forms of identification required to cash an international <b>money</b> <b>order,</b> often including a signature and a form of photo identification.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is used non-uniformly in Canada, {{with some}} {{institutions}} offering both <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> and bank drafts {{depending on the}} amount, with others only offering {{one or the other}} for any amount.

50|$|In June 1966, bank {{officials}} at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. discovered that Robert Taliento, a teller at the bank, had cashed several forged <b>money</b> <b>orders.</b> When he was {{questioned by the}} FBI, Taliento confessed that he had supplied John Giglio, the petitioner, with signature cards {{from one of the}} bank's customers, which Giglio used to forge $2,300 in <b>money</b> <b>orders.</b> Taliento then processed the forged <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> through the bank.|$|R
50|$|Postal <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> {{provide a}} safe {{alternative}} to sending cash through the mail, and are available in any amount up to $1000. Like a bank cheque, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are cashable only by the recipient. Unlike a personal bank check, they are prepaid and therefore cannot be returned because of insufficient funds. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> are a declining business for the USPS, as companies like PayPal, PaidByCash and others are offering electronic replacements.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{increased}} public awareness of fraudulent US Postal <b>Money</b> <b>Orders,</b> counterfeiters are using these US Postal and other companies' (see above) <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> to dupe their victims. By obtaining their [...] "mark's" [...] postal zip code, they will draft bogus <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> based on whichever franchises {{will most likely be}} in their victim's home area as the familiarity of the store's name offers a sense of security.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is {{purchased}} {{for the amount}} desired. In this way it {{is similar to a}} certified cheque. The main difference is that <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are usually limited in maximum face value to some specified figure (for example, the United States Postal Service limits domestic postal <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> to US $1,000.00 [...] ) while certified cheques are not. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> typically consist of two portions: the negotiable cheque for remittance to the payee, and a receipt or stub that the customer retains for his/her records. The amount is printed by machine or checkwriter on both portions, and similar documentation, either as a third hard copy or in electronic form and retained at the issuer and agent locations.|$|R
50|$|Check cashersA check casher is {{a person}} whose primary {{business}} is the cashing of checks, drafts or <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> for a fee. (A license is not required when a person cashes checks, drafts or <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> without charge, or when the person cashes checks, drafts or <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> as an incident to the conduct of another lawful business (e.g. a store) and not more than $1.00 is charged.) Check cashers are licensed by the Superintendent of Banks under Article IX-A of the Banking Law.|$|R
5000|$|When {{purchasing}} {{an international}} <b>money</b> <b>order,</b> {{it is important}} to ensure that the specific type of <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is acceptable in the destination country. Several countries are very strict that the <b>money</b> <b>order</b> be on pink and yellow paper and bear the words [...] "international postal money order." [...] In particular, the Japan Post (one of the largest banking institutions in the world) requires these features. Most other countries have taken this as a standard when there is any doubt of a document's authenticity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> {{have limited}} {{acceptance}} {{in the insurance}} and brokerage industry because of concerns over money laundering. Because of provisions within the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> have far more regulatory processing requirements than personal cheques, cashier's cheques, or certified cheques.|$|R
50|$|The United States Postal Service {{began selling}} <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> as an {{alternative}} to sending currency through the postal system in order to reduce post office robberies, an idea instituted by Montgomery Blair who was Postmaster-General 1861-1864. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> were later offered by many more vendors than just the postal service as a means to pay bills and send money internationally where there were not reliable banking or postal systems. Companies that now offer <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> include 7-11, QuikTrip, Cumberland Farms, Safeway, Western Union, MoneyGram, CVS, Wal-Mart, and 3T Solutions.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology elaborated for forecasting {{the volume of}} postal services {{on the basis of}} statistical methods of regression analysis on the example of the Republic of Komi.

The conceptual foresight of development of the regional market of postal <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> for 2011 – 2012 is presented. Regression models were analyzed not only for the dynamic sequence of data, but also for sequences of data on territories, which revealed independent correlated factors which are weakly changing and evolving over time.

5000|$|The {{counterfeit}} cashier's check scam is {{a scheme}} where {{the victim is}} sent a cashier's check or <b>money</b> <b>order</b> for payment on an item for sale on the Internet. When the <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is taken to the bank {{it may not be}} detected as counterfeit for 10 business days or more, but the bank will deposit the money into the account and state that it has been [...] "verified" [...] or is [...] "clear" [...] in about 24 hours. This gives the victim a false feeling of security that the <b>money</b> <b>order</b> was real, so they proceed with the transaction. When the bank eventually discovers that the <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is counterfeit and reverses the account credit many days later, the customer will usually have already mailed the item. In many cases the [...] "check" [...] or [...] "money order" [...] is for more than the amount owed, and the victim is asked to refund the difference in cash.|$|R
