5|$|In 1918, Espanyol {{started a}} counter-petition against autonomy, which {{at that time}} had become a {{pertinent}} issue. Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been <b>more</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.|$|E

In its early decades, the journal tended to publish articles that would {{be of interest to}} accounting practitioners, but over time it shifted towards a preference for quantitative model building and mathematical rigor. In the 1980s the AAA began to publish two other journals, Issues in Accounting Education and Accounting Horizons, that were <b>more</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> accounting educators and accounting practitioners respectively, to allow The Accounting Review to focus more heavily on quantitative articles.|$|E

5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from their lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. As the years passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs <b>more</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|Călinescu viewed such {{intellectual}} traits as {{shared by}} Creangă with his Wallachian counterpart Anton Pann, in turn linking both writers to the satirical component of Renaissance literature, and specifically to François Rabelais. Within local tradition, the literary historian saw a symbolic connection between Creangă {{and the early}} 18th century figure, Ion Neculce, one of Moldavia's leading chroniclers. While he made his own comparison between Creangă and Pann, Tudor Vianu concluded that the Moldavian writer was in fact superior, {{as well as being}} <b>more</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> literature than Petre Ispirescu, the prime collector of tales in 19th-century Wallachia. Also making use of the Rabelais analogy, literary chronicler Gabriela Ursachi found another analogy in local letters: Ion Budai-Deleanu, an early 19th-century representative of the Transylvanian School, whose style mixes erudite playfulness with popular tastes. These contextual traits, researchers assess, did not prevent Creangă's overall work from acquiring a universal aspect, particularly since various of his writings use narrative sequences common throughout world literature.|$|E

Metamedia coincides with postmodernism in that they both rework old work rather than create new work. New media avant-garde is about new ways of accessing and manipulating information (e.g. hypermedia, databases, search engines, etc.). Meta-media {{is an example of}} how quantity can change into quality as in new media technology and manipulation techniques can recode modernist aesthetics into a very different postmodern aesthetics.|$|E

25|$|The 1950s were a {{significant}} period {{of change and}} reform within Anglican and other Christian denominations throughout Australia, as they sought to become <b>more</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> contemporary society. Developments in religious theology and liturgy, coupled with an expansionary building program, led to {{a radical departure from}} established architectural traditions. Reflecting international trends, church designs moved away from historical revival styles and became increasingly influenced by Modernism. However, it was expected that a church would still be recognisable as such, resulting {{in a wide range of}} variations combining traditional church elements, symbols and functions with new construction techniques, materials and forms.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than have}} his ideas {{dismissed}} wholesale because of potential flaws {{in any one}} area, Velikovsky then chose to publish them {{as a series of}} book volumes, aimed at a lay audience, dealing separately with his proposals on ancient history, and with areas <b>more</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the physical sciences. Velikovsky was a passionate Zionist, and this did steer the focus of his work, although its scope was considerably more far-reaching than this. The entire body of work could be said to stem from an attempt to solve the following problem: that to Velikovsky there appeared to be insufficient correlation in the written or archaeological records between Biblical history and what was known {{of the history of the}} area, in particular, Egypt.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Andreas Vesalius and Francesco Piccolomini {{were the}} first to {{distinguish}} between white matter, the cortex, and the subcortical nuclei in the brain. About a century later, Thomas Willis noticed that the corpus striatum was typically discolored, shrinkened, and abnormally softened in the cadavers of people who had died from paralysis. The view that the corpus striatum played such a large role in motor functions was the most prominent one until the 19th century when electrophysiologic stimulation studies began to be performed. For example, Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig performed them on dog cerebral cortices in 1870, while David Ferrier performed them, along with ablation studies, on cerebral cortices of dogs, rabbits, cats, and primates in 1876. During the same year, John Hughlings Jackson posited that the motor cortex was <b>more</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> motor function than the corpus striatum after carrying out clinical-pathologic experiments in humans. Soon it would be discovered that the theory about the corpus striatum would not be completely incorrect.|$|E

25|$|Interpretation, thus, {{is not an}} act (be it {{successful}} or inherently {{condemned to}} failure) of discovering the meaning of text, but rather of constructing it, or, as Shusterman would like to put it, of “making sense’” of text. One of the corollaries of this account is that correctness of interpretation is always relative to the “rules” (typically implicit) of a given interpretation game. Since {{there are many different}} incommensurable games existing {{at the same time and}} since some of them have undergone some significant changes over history (and some may even have disappeared from use), we can speak of a plurality of correct interpretations of the same text both in synchronic and diachronic dimensions. Another consequence of this theory is Shusterman’s logical pluralism which claims not only that there can be different (even contradictory), yet equally true interpretations (that would be only a cognitive pluralism), but also that there are legitimate forms of approaching texts which do not even aim at interpretational truth or plausibility, but rather aim at other useful goals (e.g., providing pleasure or making an old text <b>more</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> contemporary readers).|$|E
25|$|The Sanbō Kyōdan {{was also}} {{influential}} in introducing charismatic authority in Western Zen, by its dependency on {{the authority of}} Yasutani, while simultaneously standing outside the mainstream of Japanese Zen. It was transplanted into a culture that is unaware of the specific characteristics of Japanese culture regarding authority. The stress on kenshō as means of authority, coupled to the primacy of maintaining the correct dharma transmission, led to institutional problems when Yasutani's heir Yamada Koun died, {{in the view of}} some disaffected former members. Shortly before his death in 1989 Yamada Koun passed on the leadership of the Sanbo Kyodan directly to Kubota Jiun Roshi, who was its abbot until 2004, whereupon the abbacy passed to Yamada Ryoun Roshi. While a handful of Western teachers authorized by Sanbo-Zen left the organization, some 40 or so remain within it, and the institution itself has evolved and shows signs of growing strength and resilience. The direct lineage of the “Three Clouds” (Harada, Yasutani and Yamada) maintains a strong core and trunk in today's Sanbo-Zen. Seeing one's nature gives an autonomous confirmation of Zen's ultimate truth, which may conflict with the need to maintain institutions and traditions. On the other hand, it may foster a renewal and revitalization of the core of Zen teaching, and allow for styles of Zen practice to emerge that are <b>more</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> non-Japanese contexts.|$|E
25|$|The CASI {{began as}} two {{separate}} measures that {{were developed to}} assist clinicians in obtaining information about youths from their caregivers. Although a variety of checklists were already available, most were not clearly connected to the diagnostic system used by psychiatry and many other professions. The authors saw this need and began to create a symptom checklist in 1984 {{that was based on}} the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Their goal was to obtain information about children who were receiving special education services so that they could assign them into groups based on their learning and behavioral problems that were <b>more</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> conventional psychiatric diagnoses (need citation). In this way, the measures helped gather information that helped the clinician form a diagnostic impression. The items also rated the severity of the symptoms. Adding them created a severity score that help guide selection of treatment targets. The original motivation for developing the checklist was to aid with research and gathering of fairly large amounts of data in schools; however, the creators soon saw the possible application of these symptom inventories in clinical settings. To that end, they began work in 1986 on an instrument that would be used by teachers and parents to give a comprehensive look at a youth's emotional and behavioral symptoms. This led to the earliest measure related to the CASI- the Stony Brook Child Symptom Inventory-3 (CSI-3). In 1987 this was followed by the CSI-3R based on the revised third edition of the DSM (DSM-III-R). The CSI-3R included both teacher and parent checklists. The teacher checklist focused on youth behaviors more likely take place in a school setting. In 1990, Dr. Gabrielle Carlson adapted the parent checklist from the CSI-3R for use with adolescents, which became the first version of the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI-3R). After the fourth edition of the DSM was published in 1994, the CSI-4 was developed in response to those changes. The CSI-4 was available in both Spanish and English. In 1995, the ASI was also updated to the ASI-4 to account for modifications in the DSM.|$|E
