50|$|Another major {{fear that}} {{companies}} have {{when it comes}} to using <b>multisourcing</b> is that the customer often cannot state which supplier is ultimately responsible for a given failure, or cannot prove it to a sufficient standard to enable the customer to enforce its rights and remedies under the contract.

The central research {{question is whether or not}} it is possible to measure change in work behavior, as a result of training, with <b>multisource</b> feedback in a reliable and valid way. A procedure for training evaluation was developed and three quasi-experimental studies were carried out. The psychometric properties of the <b>multisource</b> feedback instruments used are discussed as well as the training effects that were found.

40|$|Abstract—The {{combination}} of <b>multisource</b> remote sensing and geographic data {{is believed to}} offer improved accuracies in land cover classification.

In this paper, several single and multiple classifiers, that are appropriate for the classification of <b>multisource</b> remote sensing and geographic data are considered. The focus is on multiple classifiers: bagging algorithms, boosting algorithms, and consensus-theoretic classifiers. These multiple classifiers have different characteristics.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} {{when it comes}} to using <b>multisourcing.</b> First of all, moving suppliers is quicker and easier, if something isn't working, and doesn't seem likely to work, you don't have to render the whole service but just a small part of it. This is extremely effective because clients are no longer tied down by the fact that one supplier deals with all their needs. This leads to another point which is that companies are keen on reducing their dependence on sole suppliers {{for longer periods of time}} driven by 10-15 year contract terms, thereby giving them the flexibility to align their products/services much faster and in-line with end-customer demands. This flexibility makes sure that companies always have the option of improving upon what they already have. It ensures that suppliers are always working to their maximum potential to fulfil their clients needs and gives the clients more options.|$|E
50|$|Given {{the nature}} of the <b>multisourcing</b> model, clients and {{suppliers}} have to create the right environment to ensure that this model works. Firstly, the sourcing strategy needs to become coequal with other parts of strategy planning, like operations strategy and IT strategy, rather than an afterthought. The proper sequence of strategy development requires that sourcing strategies be set as a direct outflow of business strategy. It is essential that companies have workshops with the goal of breaking down the agreements they have with their suppliers to the most basic level to ensure that everyone understands their role and the quality of work that is required of them. By breaking down activities at this granular level, providers can collectively agree on how each shared process will work and how they will engage with each other, clarifying their accountability. In these workshops, providers are taken through business scenarios to confirm details like method, data content and timescales for each cross-provider interaction. The outputs of these workshops are operational level agreements (OLAs) which are signed and agreed upon by all providers to maximize performances and ensure that everyone is aware of the requirements of their job.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>multisource</b> {{remote sensing}} data for land cover {{classification}} has {{attracted the attention}} of researchers because the complementary characteristics of different kinds of data can potentially improve classification results. Such a <b>multisource</b> approach becomes increasingly important with the ready availability of a variety of satellite imagery. However, using more input data does not necessarily increase the classification performance. On the contrary, using too many remotely sensed input datasets increases data volumes, including noise, redundant information and uncertainty within the dataset. Therefore it is essential to select relevant input features and combined datasets from the <b>multisource</b> data to achieve the best classification accuracy. Other challenging tasks are the development of appropriate data processing and classification techniques to efficiently exploit the advantages of <b>multisource</b> data. The goal of this thesis is to improve the land cover classification process by using <b>multisource</b> remote sensing data with recent advanced input feature selection, data processing and classification techniques. The capabilities of non-parametric classifiers, such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were investigated using various <b>multisource</b> datasets over different study areas in Vietnam and Australia. Results showed that the <b>multisource</b> datasets always gave higher classification accuracy than the single-type datasets. The non-parametric classifiers clearly outperformed the commonly used Maximum Likelihood algorithm. The feature selection (FS) technique, specifically the wrapper approach, based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) was proposed to search for the appropriate combined datasets and classifiers parameters. The integration of GA and SVM classifier was employed for classifying <b>multisource</b> data in Western Australia, including multi-date, multi-polarised SAR and optical images. It was revealed that the SVM-GA model gave significantly higher classification accuracy with less input data than the traditional method. The GA algorithm also performed better than the conventional Sequential Forward Floating Search algorithm. The Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS) or classifier ensemble technique, which can potentially improve classification performance by exploiting the strengths and alleviating the weaknesses of different classifiers, was also evaluated using different algorithms and combination rules. An experiment was carried out with the MCS technique using the ANN, SVM and Self-Organising Map (SOM) classifiers over a study area in New South Wales, Australia. The investigation shows that the MCS technique, in general, provided higher classification accuracy than individual classifiers. Finally, a synergistic model using the FS based on GA and MCS techniques was developed to further increase the performance of <b>multisource</b> data classification. Results confirmed that the hybrid model of FS-GA and MCS outperformed other methods and significantly improved on the performance of both the FS-GA and MCS algorithm. Results and analyses presented in this thesis emphasise that using <b>multisource</b> remote sensing data is an appropriate approach for improvement of land cover classification. The proposed methodologies are very efficient for handling high dimensional, complex datasets such as combined <b>multisource</b> data...|$|R

Many companies are optimising the way research and development is staffed internally, outsourced, or carried out offshore. This research was undertaken to determine the factors that drive and influence <b>multisourcing</b> in South African technology companies. The literature was reviewed to determine the factors that drive and influence <b>multisourcing</b> at research and development companies globally. The South African information technology and electronics industries were reviewed {{to determine the extent}} of <b>multisourcing</b> in technology companies in South Africa. As literature on South African <b>multisourcing</b> is scarce, this research and the findings add more light on this subject. An in-depth, qualitative interview method was used to gather data on the factors that influence <b>multisourcing.</b> Senior executives from various information technology and electronics companies were interviewed on their company's <b>multisourcing</b> practices. The findings of this research are that most technology companies in South Africa operate within niche markets and view their research and development expertise as their core competency. These companies primarily employ skilled staff to carry out research and development functions. Many of these companies outsource some research and development locally. Larger companies that consist of geographically dispersed offices choreograph their research and development across their branches. Some companies prefer importing certain products developed overseas than developing these products in-house, if this makes business sense. Factors such as costs, risks, scalability and technology influence <b>multisourcing</b> decisions.

40|$|Abstract—A {{data fusion}} {{approach}} to the classification of multi-source and multitemporal remote-sensing images is proposed. The method {{is based on the}} application of the Bayes rule for minimum error to the “compound ” classification of pairs of <b>multisource</b> images acquired at two different dates. In particular, the fusion of <b>multisource</b> data is obtained by using multilayer perceptron neural networks for a nonparametric estimation of posterior class probabilities. The temporal correlation between images is taken into account by the prior joint probabilities of classes at the two dates. As a novel contribution of this paper, such joint probabilities are automatically estimated by applying a specific formulation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to the data to be classified.

40|$|Applications of {{artificial}} neural networks (ANN) in remote sensing and <b>multisource</b> spatial data classification have been frequently {{reported in the}} past several years. In the previous research, backpropagation ANN (BPANN) has commonly been applied. This popularity primarily revolves around the ability of backpropagation paradigm to learn complicated multidimensional mapping. Other ANN paradigms, however, are seldom applied and reported. Technically, the demand of development of efficient ANN architectures for handling <b>multisource</b> spatial data still remains. In <b>multisource</b> spatial data land cover classification, while more information can be supplied by those data, noise, redundancy and confusion may also be introduced. If artificial neural network paradigms with modular functions or competition mechanisms can be developed, the information process for each data source will be decomposed, and the contribution of each data set will be separately evaluated. Therefore, the advantages from each data source will be discovered and efficiently employed to perform the classification. To reach this goal, other architectures of neural network paradigms, such as modular artificial neural network (MANN) and learning vector quantization (LVQ) network, are alternatives requiring further investigation. ^ In this research, three network paradigms of BPANN, MANN, and LVQ were developed and evaluated in <b>multisource</b> spatial data land cover classifications. Traditional maximum likelihood classification (MLC) was also compared in classification performance. <b>Multisource</b> spatial data in different combinations were classified by the three ANN paradigms, respectively. Comparable land cover classification results were achieved by BPANN and MLC. Both MANN and LVQ networks achieved better classification results than MLC. It is concluded that all three artificial neural network paradigms can be applied in high dimensional multispectral, multitemporal, <b>multisource</b> spatial data classification. With a modular design and competition mechanism, the MANN and LVQ networks performed well and are the reliable alternatives in <b>multisource</b> spatial data land cover classification. ...|$|R
