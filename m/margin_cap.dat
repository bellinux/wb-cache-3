5|$|The {{fruit body}} is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom, with a cap 6â€“10cm (2.5â€“4in) in diameter, though larger specimens occasionally reach 15cm (6in). The cap is initially hemispherical before flattening with maturity, and has a broad, shallow umbo. The <b>cap</b> <b>margin</b> is initially curled inwards but uncurls as it matures. The cap surface is silvery-grey and covered with concentrically patterned darker scales of a grey, brown or blackish colour that grow paler toward the <b>cap</b> <b>margin,</b> Secretan noting its resemblance to the cap of Sarcodon imbricatus. The gills are free (unattached to the stalk), white and thick, may have a yellow or greenish tint, and may drip water, as may {{the top of the}} stalk when broken. With age, the gill edges can become jagged and rough. The gill spacing is rather variable, ranging from distant to crowded; typically, between 100â€“120 gills extend fully from the stalk {{to the edge of the}} cap, with a variable number of lamellulae (shorter gills not extending fully from stalk to <b>cap</b> <b>margin).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The fruit {{bodies have}} caps that are {{initially}} convex, before flattening out or becoming slightly depressed, {{often with a}} blunt umbo.

Measuring 4.3 - 7.2 cm long by 2-4 mm thick (expanding to up to 6 mm at the base), the stem is hollow, and has a smooth, fibrillose surface. A membranous, whitish ring is located on the upper portion of the stem, but it does not last long before disintegrating.

40|$|We {{present the}} results from {{processing}} and interpreting nine multichannel seismic reflection lines collected during the 1992 Erable experiment over the northeastern <b>margin</b> of Flemish <b>Cap</b> offshore Newfoundland. These lines, combined into five cross-sections, provide increased seismic coverage over this lightly probed section of the margin and reveal tectonically significant along-strike variations in the degree and compartmentalization of crustal thinning. Similar to the southeastern <b>margins</b> of Flemish <b>Cap</b> and the Grand Banks, a transitional zone of exhumed serpentinized mantle is interpreted between thinned continental and oceanic crust. The 25 km wide transitional zone bears similarities to the 120 km wide transitional zone interpreted as exhumed serpentinized mantle on the conjugate Irish Atlantic margin but the significant width difference is suggestive of an asymmetric conjugate pair. A 40 â€“ 50 km wide zone of inferred strike-slip shearing is interpreted and observed to extend along most of the northeastern <b>margin</b> of Flemish <b>Cap.</b> Individual shear zones (SZs) may represent extensions of SZs and normal faults within the Orphan Basin providing further evidence for the rotation and displacement of Flemish Cap out of Orphan Basin. The asymmetry between the Flemish Cap and Irish conjugate pairs is likely {{due in large part}} to the rotation and displacement of Flemish Cap which resulted in the Flemish <b>Cap</b> <b>margin</b> displaying features of both a strike-slip margin and an extensional margin. ...|$|R
