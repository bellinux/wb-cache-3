40|$|To {{characterize}} the cleanliness of <b>minienvironments</b> and process tools, PWP measurements are used. The PWP (particles per wafer pass) value is {{obtained from the}} difference between the measuring of particle sizes and counts on an unstructured wafer surface before and wafer handling in any kind of process equipment. For higher requirements, PWP-counts of e. g. 0. 005 - 0. 001 have to be obtained. Not only is the proof of these values are not economically viable due to of the large number of samples require, but also that these low particle additions on the wafer surface must be identified within the detection limit of the existing wafer measuring system. The previous qualification procedure with so many samples involved can not be used economically. Based on statistical considerations and the analysis of experiments, a cost-optimized procedure needs to be developed and proved. To fulfil this aim, an experimental set-up must also be installed. With the combination of statistical analysis and experimental investigations the expected PWP values and the qualification costs.

This article presents laboratory-measured performance of seven relatively new and large FFUs, with a section size of 122 -cm 122 -cm, or 4 -ft 4 -ft. In addition, this article includes {{a comparison of the}} performance of these large FFUs with that of smaller, 122 -cm 61 -cm (or 4 -ft 2 -ft) FFUs that were previously tested. The comparison was based upon a set of performance metrics such as total pressure efficiency (TPE) and energy performance index (EPI). This article found that there were wide variations in the energy performance of FFUs, and that using a consistent evaluation method can generate comparable FFU performance information. When operating at the maximal setting of speed control dials used to control their respective fan-wheel speeds, the larger units in this study tended to be more energy efficient than their smaller counterparts. The energy efficiency level of the same unit may vary considerably, depending on actual operating conditions such as airflow speeds and pressure rise across the units.

[1][2][3] Fan-filter units deliver re-circulated air and provide particle filtration control for clean environments. Much of the energy in cleanrooms (and <b>minienvironments)</b> is consumed by 2 -foot x 4 -foot (61 -cm x 122 -cm) or 4 -foot x 4 -foot (122 -cm x 122 -cm) fan-filter units that are typically located in the ceiling (25 - 100 % coverage) of cleanroom controlled environments.

40|$|A <b>minienvironment</b> is {{normally}} used {{to maintain a}} level of stringent cleanliness through controlling particle concentrations within a tightened volume of clean spaces. Because minienvironments are expected to locally achieve {{a higher level of}} cleanliness than their adjacent clean room, {{it is important to understand}} the characteristics of their design and operation and effectiveness in environmental control. This paper presents findings from an in-situ study on a group of minienvironments, with the focus on characterizing and evaluating environmental performance of the minienvironments as part of a large-scale of in-situ investigation into the total performance of the minienvironments operating in a clean room. In particular, this paper summarizes design and operating characteristics and presents measured environmental performance of five minienvironments and the clean room that housed them. The study discovers that pressure differentials as low as under 0. 2 Pa can be sufficient for achieving a high level of air cleanliness to meet environmental control expectation and requirements. Comparisons with relevant industry standards show that existing standards or guidelines may have been suggesting thresholds that are higher than necessary at least in some <b>minienvironment</b> applications.

The encapsulation often consists of simple wall units with access for maintenance. However, the optimal air-flow around the product cannot be achieved with this method. Turbulence is created by such simple encapsulation systems, forming dust-accumulating areas, stagnant air and dead zone areas at processing level.

40|$|Cleanroom air-recirculation systems {{typically}} {{account for}} {{a significant portion of}} the HVAC energy use in cleanrooms. High electric power density is normally required for fans to deliver large volume of airflows that were designed, supplied, recirculated, and exhausted within a given time. With the increasing demand for specific contamination control, it is important to optimize design of clean spaces. Best practice in cleanroom air system design includes right-sizing the systems in cleanrooms and adopting minienvironments. Implementing and integrating minienvironments in cleanrooms can improve contamination control and save significant energy. A <b>minienvironment</b> is a localized environment created by an enclosure to isolate a product or process from the surrounding environment. The advantages in using minienvironments include the following: (1) Minienvironments may create better contamination control and process integration. (2) Minienvironments may maintain better contamination control by better control of pressure difference or through use of unidirectional airflows, e. g., cleanliness-class upgrade required for certain process. (3) Minienvironments may potentially reduce energy costs. The use of fan-filter units (FFU) in minienvironments is common. The energy efficiency of such air-delivery systems can vary significantly because of the difference in energy performance, airflow paths, and operating conditions. Simply adding minienvironments with fan-filter units in an existing cleanroom will increase power density and energy intensity for delivering airflow in the space served, if everything else is unchanged. However, by considering contamination control requirements in the various spaces minienvironments can be integrated with the surrounding cleanroom to optimize the overall electric power demand for the facility and to achieve specific cleanliness in each area. In addition, selecting energy efficient <b>minienvironment</b> systems will further improve the overall energy efficiency of the clean spaces...|$|E

This enables a material selection already in the planning phase of a cleanroom or other environment. An easy-to-use simulation model enables the user to estimate the expected VOC-level and therefore the ISO-AMC-Classsification according to ISO 14644 - 8 of the environment to be constructed...|$|E
40|$|CD-PEB {{temperature}} experiments {{show that}} post-exposure bake (PEB) temperature non-uniformity (both in steady-state and transient phases) impacts across-wafer CD uniformity [1]. Continued improvement in CD uniformity requires across-wafer temperature uniformity {{for the entire}} PEB cycle. This poses new challenges {{for the design of}} PEB thermal modules. This paper proposes a novel PEB thermal module design together with a novel robust control methodology to address this challenge. The proposed PEB thermal module relies on an intelligent wafer “carrier”, which includes an array of Peltier devices and thermal sensors, so that the thermal uniformity of the wafer/carrier assembly can be continuously measured and controlled. The wafer resides in the carrier during the entire thermal processing cycle – transport, chill, and bake. This design enables the system comprising the wafer and the carrier to be in continual closed-loop control. As a result, thermal fluctuations due to PEB plate dynamics are largely eliminated and sharp temperature non-uniformities that result from introducing a wafer into the PEB process are greatly reduced. In essence, our design offers a thermally regulated <b>minienvironment</b> for silicon wafers during the entire PEB cycle. Simulation results show that this design can achieve temperature uniformities of less than 0. 1 o C across the wafer, through the entire PEB cycle (transient, as well as steady state). Given that today’s state of the art bake plates achieve close to 0. 1 o C uniformity only in steady-state, and may have several degrees non-uniformity during the transient, this would result in a significant improvement in across-wafer CD uniformity. The same system can be used if {{there is a need to}} customize the PEB temperature history across the wafer in order to cancel out other sources of CD non-uniformity...|$|E
40|$|In such {{fields as}} {{semiconductor}} and space cleanroom technology, materials implemented in specific applications {{need to be}} assessed for emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and classified in order to permit direct comparisons to be made. The presentation shows a standardized procedure for testing and classifying materials with uniform sample preparation and defined storage times. It describes preparation of the samples, their storage in a VOC-reduced <b>minienvironment,</b> avoidance of cross-contamination, sampling using appropriate adsorbers in semi-automated micro-chambers and analysis via thermodesorption coupled with chromatography and mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS). Once the active surface area, sampling time and VOC mass emitted are known, a specific emission rate can be determined which is then converted into a classification number. Knowledge of the emission class enables the VOC charge of a defined area at a specific point in time to be calculated in reality. The standardized procedure is laid down in the new guideline VDI 2083 part 17. The test and classification allow a fast material screening compared to existing large chamber measurements and other cleanroom relevant methods. The resulting material classification numbers are entered into the database www. cleanmanufacturing. fraunhofer. de and www. ipa. csm. com of the Fraunhofer industrial alliance CSM - cleanroom suitable materials to allow the tested products to be directly compared with one another. This enables a material selection already in the planning phase of a cleanroom or other environment. An easy-to-use simulation model enables the user to estimate the expected VOC-level and therefore the ISO-AMC-Classsification according to ISO 14644 - 8 of the environment to be constructed. A measurement setup is demonstrated for the verification of a cleanroom air cleanliness class according to ISO 14644 - 8 regarding volatile organic contamination...|$|E
