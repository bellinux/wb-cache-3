40|$|In {{order to}} deliver eye care, many {{resources}} {{have to be}} in place at the right time: your patients, your staff, your facilities, your equipment, and <b>your</b> <b>supplies.</b> In this article, we focus on how you can <b>manage</b> <b>your</b> <b>supplies</b> to ensure that your eye service runs smoothly. These supplies, or consumables, include every little thing needed in the course of your daily work: IOLs, medicines, gloves, forms used for patient care, housekeeping supplies, and equipment spares. If any of these items become unavailable, your eye centre will be unable to provide the same high quality of services, and you may even have to turn patients away...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} supply chain {{management}} has become an important issue for companies today {{in order to keep}} or gain competitive advantage. It is all about <b>managing</b> <b>your</b> <b>supply</b> chain to reach the highest possible efficiency and increase profits through cooperation with <b>your</b> <b>supply</b> chain partners. A supply chain is however vulnerable to several threats, or risks, that decreases the overall efficiency and influences the business performance. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the internal risks that {{can be found in a}} basic internal supply chain in order to make an assessment of their manageability and impact using a specific case. To do this a case study of Thule Trailers AB in Jönköping was conducted. Thule Trailers AB chose to offshore their main production of components to Poland in 2003, so the company’s internal supply chain was expanded outside of Sweden. This research looks closer at the interactions between Thule Trailers AB in Jönköping and their internal supplier plant in Poland. The research was conducted using a qualitative method with several interviews with representatives in both Jönköping and Poland, during which a number of internal risks were identified in Thule Trailers AB in Jönköpings’ internal supply chain. The conclusions made are that the internal risks identified, i. e. communication risks, quality risks etc, might not have as great an influence on the company as would external risks, they can however in comparison be managed. The findings suggest that the issues with e. g. quality and delivery basically come down to insufficient communication inside the internal supply chain. Another conclusion that could be drawn is that since the internal risks in the internal supply chain all are ripple effects, its source is almost always external, which implies that their avoidance is difficult. At least they cannot be eliminated completely by the company itself, it needs to be done in cooperation with the company’s external supply chain partners. There is potential to solve most of the internal problems that can be managed internally if both parties are prepared to put some real effort into reducing the risk sources. The risks are manageable and need to be managed to reduce the impact it has for the customer and end customer in turn. The authors of this thesis believe that for a company to be successful, the end customer has to be prioritized in almost every situation, and this goes for all of the members in the supply chain, especially the internal ones...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Your</b> <b>Supply</b> Chain {{can be a}} {{competitive}} weapon? ABSOLUTELY!!! However, the fundamental principles that guide the creation and management of supplier relationships must change! If your organization continues to look at <b>your</b> <b>supply</b> chain as nothing but a <b>supply</b> <b>base</b> from which you must extract the annual pound of flesh of a few percentage points, you are probably conceding a tremendous competitive advantage to your competitors. Why? Because your suppliers are probably working with your competitors to help them gain {{a competitive}} advantage. The choice is simple for you as a supply chain/strategic sourcing professional. You can either lead your organization to extract significant value from <b>your</b> <b>supply</b> chain and convert it to a competitive advantage or you can {{continue to focus on}} getting the best contracts and SLA’s while your competitors are stealing your lunch. 25 years ago Professor William Ouichi of the University of California did not have suppliers in mind when he proposed that American companies could meet the Japanese challenge by changing their organizations faulty assumptions about management and the workforce that had led to sub-optimal productivity. The relevant point here for us is that the assumptions w...|$|R
