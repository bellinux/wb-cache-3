5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs</b> which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

Funding shortfalls have contributed to a chronic deferral of <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> projects. The resulting backlog of critical unfunded requirements for facilities maintained by the O&M appropriation totaled $ 2 billion at the end of fiscal year 1995. OPNAV's objective is to stabilize or reduce this backlog over time while providing <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> funding for the major claimants consistent with readiness objectives. This thesis develops a multiobjective, infinite horizon linear program to determine multi-year <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> funding levels for the major claimants while adhering to annual budget constraints and a standard Navy facility priority system linked to operational readiness. The model produces funding recommendations that are managerially and administratively feasible, and it shows an improved capacity to apportion funding consistently with the existing priority system[URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R
25|$|The Yonkers Depot {{is located}} at 59 Babcock Place {{at the foot of}} Alexander Street in the Getty Square section of Yonkers, New York, near the {{facilities}} of Greyston Bakery. The site was initially a freight yard for the adjacent Hudson Line, used by the New York Central Railroad. The depot was originally built for Riverdale Transit Corp, which later became a part of the Liberty Lines Express system. It is currently owned by New York City and leased to MTA Bus Company, sold by Liberty Lines on January 3, 2005 for $10.5 million. The depot consists of an administration building, a shop for bus <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs,</b> and an outdoor parking lot used for storing 80 express buses. The buses from the depot provide express service between Yonkers or Western Bronx and Manhattan. The city of Yonkers plans to acquire at least a portion of the site from the MTA, as part of the redevelopment of the waterfront area, a former industrial section.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, {{with even more}} engines {{requiring}} urgent <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs,</b> orders were placed for an additional ten P class locomotives which would be improved through modifications to the boilers, bogies, headlights and valve gear. These new locomotives were constructed at the Midland Railway Workshops. The boilers featured an increase in pressure from 160 to 175psi, which provided more power, and the bogies were constructed in cast steel. These improved locomotives were delivered to the same operating specifications as the original P class, with the same weight distribution and boiler pressure limited to 160 psi, though improvements to the track and bridges on the Eastern Goldfields Railway in 1940 meant {{that they could be}} altered to use their designed power through the increasing of the axle load from 12.8 to 14.2 tons and the resetting of the boiler-top safety valves to 175 psi. The result was a 9% increase in tractive effort with the same economical running of the P class.|$|E

The Army National Guard helicopters were also used to do photographic reconnaissance work. Training for ATF agents included such subjects as Close Quarters Combat, and combat medical instruction, and a mock up of the Mount Carmel complex was constructed at Fort Hood, Texas for rehearsals. ATF also received several surplus helmets, flack vests, canteens, first aid dressings, empty magazines, and some night-vision equipment, in addition to MREs and diesel fuel. The FBI would request and receive the use of Bradley Armored Fighting Vehicles, and tank retrieval vehicles, as well as overflights by UH-1 and CH-47 helicopters.|$|E

25|$|A 1980 AMC Concord {{served as}} the test vehicle in s {{conceptual}} design study of the automotive Improved Gas Turbine (IGT) powertrain. Working under a NASA contract for U.S. DOE's Division of Automotive Technology Development, Williams Research performed the design and analysis on the gas turbine engine, while AMC's AM General subsidiary did the vehicle installation studies, supplied the vehicle, transmission, drivetrain, and the typical car accessories. The two-door sedan used a dual-rotor gas turbine with variable power turbine nozzle, and a 3-speed automatic transmission for conventional rear-wheel-drive. Williams Research conducted all the performance and fuel economy analysis, with the turbine powered Concord meeting expectations. The final report estimated that the IGT vehicle would have a 10% higher cost over the conventional piston engine, of which {{less than half of}} the cost penalty would be in the turbine engine, but the remainder would be the cost of adapting existing production of vehicles and systems. However, fuel economy improvements, as well as reduced <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs,</b> would result in an overall life-cycle cost saving of 9% for the IGT vehicle.|$|E
25|$|While Sampo had {{not been}} damaged in the war, she was docked at the Hietalahti {{shipyard}} for extensive <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs</b> — when she left to the port of Hanko in mid-February 1919, 69 bottom plates had been replaced. In December 1922 Sampo struck a rock in the port of Loviisa and her bow propeller shaft was damaged, {{but there was no}} time for repairs and for the rest of the season she had to assist ships to the port of Helsinki without her bow propeller. Another incident occurred on 24 March 1926 when the bow propeller of Sampo hit a stone bank in the port of Helsinki, came loose and dropped to the bottom. It was found after searching for a couple of days and winched on board. On 30 March, while Sampo was assisting a Finnish steamship Albert Kasimir, the stern propeller shaft snapped when the engine was reversed and the propeller dropped to the bottom. While the icebreaker still had its bow propeller, it was of no use as it was waiting for installation on the foredeck. Murtaja towed the immobilized icebreaker to Hanko on the following day and to Helsinki for repairs on 20 April.|$|E
25|$|In Augustus' {{capacity}} as supreme {{head of the}} public road system, he converted the temporary cura {{of each of the}} great roads into a permanent magistracy. The persons appointed under the new system were of senatorial or equestrian rank, according to the relative importance of the roads respectively assigned to them. It was the duty of each curator to issue contracts for the <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairs</b> of his road, and to see that the contractor who undertook the work performed it faithfully, as to both quantity and quality. Moreover, he authorized the construction of sewers and removed obstructions to traffic, as the aediles did in Rome. It was in the character of an imperial curator, though probably of one armed with extraordinary powers, that Corbulo (as has been already mentioned) denounced the magistratus and mancipes of the Italian roads to Tiberius. He pursued them and their families with fines and imprisonment for 18 years (AD 21-39), and was rewarded with a consulship by Caligula, who was himself in the habit of condemning well-born citizens to work on the roads. It is noticeable that Claudius brought Corbulo to justice, and repaid the money which had been extorted from his victims.|$|E
