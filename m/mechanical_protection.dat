2500|$|Caffeine {{in plants}} {{acts as a}} natural pesticide: it can paralyze and kill {{predator}} insects feeding on the plant. High caffeine levels are found in coffee seedlings when they are developing foliage and lack <b>mechanical</b> <b>protection.</b> In addition, high caffeine levels {{are found in the}} surrounding soil of coffee seedlings, which inhibits seed germination of nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving seedlings with the highest caffeine levels fewer competitors for existing resources for survival. [...] Caffeine is stored in tea leaves in two places. Firstly, in the cell vacuoles where it is complexed with polyphenols. This caffeine probably is released into the mouth parts of insects, to discourage herbivory. Secondly, around the vascular bundles, where it probably inhibits pathogenic fungi from entering and colonizing the vascular bundles. Caffeine in nectar may improve the reproductive success of the pollen producing plants by enhancing the reward memory of pollinators such as honeybees.|$|E

50|$|Special {{versions}} of non-metallic sheathed cables, such as US Type UF, {{are designed for}} direct underground burial (often with separate <b>mechanical</b> <b>protection)</b> or exterior use where exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a possibility.

50|$|The uterus or womb is {{the major}} female {{reproductive}} organ. The uterus provides <b>mechanical</b> <b>protection,</b> nutritional support, and waste removal for the developing embryo (weeks 1 to 8) and fetus (from week 9 until the delivery).

50|$|Some early {{electric}} lighting installations {{made use of}} existing gas pipe serving gas light fixtures which had been converted to electric lamps. Since this technique provided very good <b>mechanical</b> <b>protection</b> for interior wiring, it was extended to all types of interior wiring and by the early 20th century purpose-built couplings and fittings were manufactured for electrical use.|$|E
50|$|Fluoropolymer / HMWPE {{insulation}} {{cathodic protection}} cable is typically made with dual insulation. It features a primary layer of a fluoropolymer such as ECTFE which is chemically resistant to chlorine, sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid. Following the primary layer is an HMWPE insulation layer, which provides pliable strength and allows considerable abuse during installation. The HMWPE jacketing provides <b>mechanical</b> <b>protection</b> as well.|$|E

50|$|For {{pipelines}} that encounter saturated soils or water, wood lagging {{is often}} installed in between bolt-on concrete weights, {{acting as a}} spacer to keep the weights in place {{as well as to}} provide <b>mechanical</b> <b>protection</b> to the pipe.

5000|$|An SY {{control cable}} is a {{flexible}} instrumentation electrical cable designed for measuring, control or regulation {{in the field}} of process automation. It is a highly flexible multicore cable, with (class 5) copper conductors and a galvanised steel wire braid (GSWB) for <b>mechanical</b> <b>protection.</b> The cable is typically manufactured with PVC insulation, bedding and a transparent PVC sheath. [...] The transparent sheath means signs of deterioration, damage or corrosion can be detected with ease.|$|E
50|$|Then, {{to promote}} {{daylighting}} all rooms open onto the outside. Protection {{from the sun}} already exists, as several trees have been planted in strategic locations around the building. In addition, <b>mechanical</b> <b>protection</b> such as solar shading with angle blades operating like shelf lights prevent the glare effect due to the direct sunshine by reflecting the light onto the ceiling and thus enhancing daylighting. Moreover, some windows are embedded in the wall itself, therefore {{the thickness of the}} façade acts as a sunscreen.|$|E
