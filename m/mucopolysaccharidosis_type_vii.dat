In this study we tested whether recombinant adenovirus that encodes β-glucuronidase (Adβgluc), delivered intravenously and into the brain parenchyma of MPS <b>type</b> <b>VII</b> mice, could provide long-term transgene expression and correction of lysosomal distension. We also tested whether systemic treatment with the immunosuppressive anti-CD 40 ligand antibody, MR- 1, affected transgene expression. We found substantial plasma β-glucuronidase activity for over 9 weeks after gene transfer in the MR- 1 - treated group, with subsequent decline in activity corresponding to a delayed anti-β-glucuronidase antibody response. At 16 weeks, near wild-type amounts of β-glucuronidase activity and striking reduction of lysosomal pathology were detected in livers from mice that had received either MR- 1 cotreatment or control antibody. In the lung and kidney, β-glucuronidase activity was markedly higher for the MR- 1 -treated group. β-Glucuronidase activity in the brain persisted independently of MR- 1 treatment. Activity was intense in the injected hemisphere and was also evident in the noninjected cortex and striatum, with dramatic improvements in storage deposits in areas of both hemispheres. These results indicate that prolonged enzyme expression from transgenes delivered to deficient liver and brain can mediate pervasive correction and illustrate the potential for gene therapy of MPS and other lysosomal storage diseases...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCorneal {{transparency}} is maintained, in part, by specialized fibroblasts called keratocytes, which {{reside in}} the fibrous lamellae of the stroma. Corneal clouding, a condition that impairs visual acuity, is associated with numerous diseases, including <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) <b>type</b> <b>VII.</b> MPS VII is due to deficiency in β-glucuronidase (β-glu) enzymatic activity, which leads to accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and secondary accumulation of gangliosides. Here, we tested the efficacy of canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV- 2) vectors to transduce keratocyte in vivo in mice and nonhuman primates, and ex vivo in dog and human corneal explants. Following efficacy studies, we asked if we could treat corneal clouding by the injection a helper-dependent (HD) CAV- 2 vector (HD-RIGIE) harboring the human cDNA coding for β-glu (GUSB) in the canine MPS VII cornea. β-Glu activity, GAG content, and lysosome morphology and physiopathology were analyzed. We found that HD-RIGIE injections efficiently transduced coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor-expressing keratocytes in the four species and, compared to mock-injected controls, improved the pathology in the canine MPS VII cornea. The key criterion to corrective therapy was the steady controlled release of β-glu and its diffusion throughout the collagen-dense stroma.

40|$|Genetic {{diseases}} {{arise from}} the aberrant expression of genes. These disorders can potentially be treated via the introduction of corrective genes (in a process referred to as gene therapy). Two main obstacles to gene therapy of the brain are the inability to introduce therapeutic genes into all necessary cells {{and the lack of}} long-term expression of the transferred gene. ^ The focus of this dissertation has been on the development of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV- 1) as a vector for gene therapy of murine <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) <b>type</b> <b>VII,</b> a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase (GUSB). HSV- 1 is a promising vector for brain gene therapy because HSV- 1 efficiently infects and spreads through nervous tissue. The ability of HSV- 1 vectors to drive long-term transgene expression is under debate. ^ I have engineered a HSV- 1 vector (1716 -LAT-hGUSB) that expresses human GUSB in order to study brain transduction in mice. 1716 -LAT-hGUSB is able to transduce many anatomical brain regions after a single, site-specific intracranial injection. The ensuing patterns of viral latency and transgene expression differ depending upon the inoculation route. Many regions of latency are consistent with axonal transport from the injection site. ^ A quantitative analysis was performed to measure long-term (one year) transgene expression in the mouse brain. The vector genome was stably maintained at all latent time points. Expression of both latency-associated transcripts and GUSB activity both peaked in the first weeks/months of infection before reaching stable levels. The stable levels of GUSB enzymatic activity were higher than the minimal therapeutic range reported for treatment of MPS VII. ^ Adult MPS VII mice suffering from lysosomal storage were treated with 1716 -LAT-hGUSB, and lysosomal storage was corrected in several brain regions after a single intracranial injection. This study represents the first report of correction of an inherited disorder with a HSV- 1 vector, and demonstrates the potential for widespread, long-term correction with HSV- 1 -based vectors in the nervous system. ...|$|R

Several mice from each treatment group lived to at least 1 yr of age. Liver and spleen samples had beta-glucuronidase levels ranging from 2. 4 to 19. 8 % of normal and showed a parallel decrease in lysosomal storage. The combination of enzyme replacement therapy followed by BMT reduced lysosomal distension in meninges, corneal fibroblasts, and bone when compared with treatment with enzyme alone.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by deficiency of α-L-iduronidase and {{characterized by a}} progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I is classified into two forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid progressive neurological involvement and attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and Scheie syndromes), which presents with slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant α-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We present here the clinical and laboratory results in an 12 -year-old patient affected by the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I treated by enzyme-replacement therapy {{from the age of}} 5 months, compared with his 17 year old affected sister, who started therapy at 5 years of age. CASE PRESENTATION: Clinical evaluation of these siblings shows that initiation of therapy prior of the onset of clinically detectable disease resulted in considerable improvement in outcome in the young sibling. After 12 years of enzyme-replacement therapy, facial appearance, linear growth rate, and liver and spleen volumes were normal; moreover, the degree of joint disease, vertebral, and cardiac valvular involvement were only minimal compared with those of his sister.

40|$|Enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (ERT) effectively reverses storage in several lysosomal storage diseases. However, improvement in brain {{is limited by}} the blood-brain barrier except in the newborn period. In this study, we asked whether this barrier could be overcome by higher doses of enzyme than are used in conventional trials. We measured the distribution of recombinant human β-glucuronidase (hGUS) and reduction in storage by weekly doses of 0. 3 - 40 mg/kg administered i. v. over 1 - 13 weeks to <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>VII</b> mice immunotolerant to recombinant hGUS. Mice given up to 5 mg/kg enzyme weekly over 3 weeks had moderate reduction in meningeal storage but no change in neo-cortical neurons. Mice given 20 - 40 mg/kg three times over 1 week showed no reduction in storage in any area of the CNS except the meninges. In contrast, mice receiving 4 mg/kg per week for 13 weeks showed clearance not only in meninges but also in parietal neocortical and hippocampal neurons and glia. Mice given 20 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks also had decreased neuronal, glial, and meningeal storage and averaged 2. 5 % of wild-type hGUS activity in brain. These results indicate that therapeutic enzyme can be delivered across the blood-brain barrier in the adult <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>VII</b> mouse if administered at higher doses than are used in conventional ERT trials and if the larger dose of enzyme is administered over a sufficient period.

40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>VII</b> is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{resulting from}} inherited deficiency of β-glucuronidase (GUS). <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>VII</b> {{is characterized by}} glycosaminoglycan storage in most tissues, including brain. In these disorders, enzyme delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the main obstacle to correction of lysosomal storage in the CNS. Prior studies suggested mouse brain is accessible to GUS in the first 2 weeks of life but not later. To explore a possible role for the mannose 6 -phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor in GUS transport across the BBB in neonatal mice, we compared brain uptake of phosphorylated GUS (P-GUS) and nonphosphorylated GUS (NP-GUS) in newborn and adult mice. 131 I-P-GUS was transported across the BBB after i. v. injection in 2 -day-old mice. The brain influx rate (Kin) of 131 I-P-GUS in 2 -day-old mice was 0. 21 μl/g·min and decreased with age. By 7 weeks of age, transport of 131 I-P-GUS was not significant. Capillary depletion revealed that 62 % of the 131 I-P-GUS in brain was in brain parenchyma in 2 -day-old mice. In addition, uptake of 131 I-P-GUS into brain was significantly reduced by coinjection of unlabeled P-GUS or M 6 P in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the Kin of 131 I-NP-GUS (0. 04 μl/g·min) was significantly lower than 131 I-P-GUS in 2 -day-old mice. Transcardiac brain perfusion confirmed that neither 131 I-P-GUS nor 131 I-NP-GUS crossed the BBB in adult mice. These results indicate that 131 I-P-GUS transport into brain parenchyma in early postnatal life is mediated by the mannose 6 -phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor. This receptor-mediated transport is not observed in adult mice...|$|E

40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>VII</b> {{collagen}} is {{the major}} component of anchoring fibrils, structures within basement membranes beneath stratified squamous epithelium thought to mediate the adherence of the epidermis to the dermis of human skin. <b>Type</b> <b>VII</b> collagen has affinity for fibronectin. The interaction between <b>type</b> <b>VII</b> collagen and fibronectin is mediated through the collagen-binding domain on the amino terminus of fibronectin. Heretofore, the domain on the <b>type</b> <b>VII</b> collagen molecule that binds to fibronectin was not known. In this study, we mapped the binding site of fibronectin to a specific subdomain of the triple helical collagenous region of <b>type</b> <b>VII</b> collagen, immediately adjacent to the small carboxyl terminal non-collagenous domain. This fibronectin-binding site within the <b>type</b> <b>VII</b> collagen molecule lies between nucleotide residues 615 and 1161...|$|R
