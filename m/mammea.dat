2500|$|The mutiny of {{the army}} in Germany that {{resulted}} in the murder Alexander Severus and his dominating mother, Julia Avita Mamaea, and their replacement by Maximinus Thrax might have been expected to set back the career {{of a man who had}} been so closely associated with the Severan Dynasty and with <b>Mammea</b> herself. However, not only did Timesitheus survive, but his career continued to prosper. Under the new regime he became Procurator provinciae Bithyniae Ponti Paphlagoniae tam patrimoni quam rationis privatae ibi vice procuratoris XXXX, item vice proco(n)sulis - i.e. fiscal administrator of the Asiatic Black Sea provinces of Bithynia, Pontus, and Paphlagonia with particular responsibility for managing the Imperial domains, both patrimonial and private. In addition, he was made acting procurator responsible for the collection of the custom duties levied at one-fortieth ad valorem. As in his previous posting in Germania he was also appointed acting proconsul - i.e. governor of these provinces - thus replacing a senatorial appointee (this time of consular status) for whom that office would normally have been reserved). Whatever reservations Maximinus Thrax may have entertained regarding Timesitheus's loyalties, [...] his need for money to finance his German wars obviously did not allow him the luxury of foregoing the financial and administrative expertise the man could bring to his government of the Empire. (At the time - it was before the assaults on this region mounted by barbarians from the lands to the north of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov that were to characterise the middle years of the Third Century - the provinces given over to Timesitheus's care were among the richest in the Roman world). However, it may be indicative of the emperor's reservations that, whereas in Germany Timesitheus had commanded two legions, he now had none, Asia consisting of provinciae inermes - i.e. provinces where there were no Imperial troops permanently in garrison.|$|E

50|$|Background: The 13-year-old Alessandro Severo (Alexander Severus) {{had become}} Roman emperor {{after the murder}} of his uncle Elagabalus. He {{remained}} under the guardianship of his mother Giulia <b>Mammea</b> (Julia Mamaea), who arranged his marriage to the young noblewoman Salustia. Alessandro soon fell in love with Salustia, named her empress and awarded her several honours which had previously been reserved for his mother. Giulia thus became jealous of her daughter-in-law and used all the resources at her disposal to get rid of her hated rival.|$|E

50|$|In 1754 Galli {{returned}} to Italy where she {{spent more than}} the next 10 years performing in major opera houses in Genoa, Naples, and Venice. On 10 July 1758 she created the role of Valentiniano III in {{the world premiere of}} Gaetano Latilla's Ezio at the Teatro di San Carlo. She performed in several other premieres at that house, including the roles of Medarse in Pasquale Errichelli's Siroe on 26 December 1759; Teagene in Johann Adolph Hasse's Achille in Sciro on 4 November 1759; and Arpalice in Niccolò Piccinni's Ciro riconosciuto. At the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice she portrayed the role of Giulia <b>Mammea</b> in the world premiere of Antonio Sacchini's Alessandro Severo in 1762. In the summer of 1766 she created the title role in the premiere of Josef Mysliveček's Semiramide at the Teatro di Cittadella in Bergamo.|$|E
5000|$|The leading {{singer in}} the company of San Bartolomeo was the contralto Nicolò Grimaldi, known as [...] "Cavalier Nicolino", a true star of the {{international}} operatic stage. Then nearing his sixties, he had been {{at the top of his}} profession for three decades. Next to him, in the role of secondo amoroso was Angiola Zanuchi (or Zanucchi), a mezzosoprano of probably limited scope who specialised in travesti roles. While the tenor role was taken by the expert singer Francesco Tolve, the company's true speciality was its female cast. The rank of prima donna indisputably belonged to the young soprano Lucia Facchinelli, known as [...] "La Becheretta", who was well paired with [...] "Nicolino" [...] and had arrived in Naples with him. Otherwise, not one but two singers were available: Teresa Cotti (or Cotte), from Milan, a longstanding seconda donna, who had played the role of Salustia in a previous setting of Alessandro Severo; and the young Anna Mazzoni, who had been active in Naples for a couple of years and would go on to have a career as a prima donna across Italy and Europe in the 1740s. The libretto, perhaps chosen by design, perfectly suited this type of cast. Apart from the five customary main characters, a sixth was provided, that of Giulia <b>Mammea,</b> the far from exemplary mother of Emperor Alessandro. Roles for mothers (and wives) were virtually absent from the canonical Metastasian drama and only by reverting to a slightly old-fashioned libretto like Zeno's was it possible to supply such a prominent wicked-mother role as Giulia <b>Mammea,</b> for which the experienced Cotti appeared to be highly suited. But the problems of casting did not end there. The almost sixty-year-old Nicolino, perhaps because he was no longer able to cope with the vocal acrobatics demanded by the part of primo amoroso, perhaps simply because he was now tired of playing the role of the [...] "young hero" [...] in which he risked looking ridiculous, had already shown himself willing to compromise regarding his position. At the premiere of Artaserse by Johann Adolf Hasse in 1730, for example, he had handed over the rank of primo amoroso to the rising star Farinelli and had instead accepted the part of the villainous father Artabano, a typical tenor role. Another role of the kind was Massimiano, protagonist of the opera of the same name by Giuseppe Maria Orlandini, to a text by Zeno, in which he had starred in Venice in early 1731. All the evidence suggests that at Naples too, Nicolino, the theatre management and the young Pergolesi agreed to follow the same route, which entailed upsetting the usual hierarchy of the male section of the company: the primo musico took the role of the father (Marziano, a sort of evil male counterpart to Giulia <b>Mammea),</b> Zanuchi was promoted to the position of primo amoroso, in the role of the weak emperor Alessandro, and the tenor Tolve had to make do with the remaining role of Claudio.|$|E
5000|$|Barringtonia asiatica (fish poison tree, putat [...] or sea poison tree) is {{a species}} of Barringtonia native to {{mangrove}} habitats on the tropical coasts and islands of the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean from Zanzibar east to Taiwan, the Philippines (where it is locally known as botong or bitoón), Fiji, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands, Wallis and Futuna and French Polynesia. It is grown along streets for decorative and shade purposes {{in some parts of}} India, for instance in some towns on southeastern shore. It is also known as Box Fruit due the distinct box-shaped fruit it produces. The local name futu {{is the source of the}} name for the Polynesian island Futuna.

50|$|The {{bay duiker}} mainly prefers fruits. It feeds {{on the large}} fruits of Irvingia species (wild mango), Detarium macrocarpum and the spherical fruits of <b>Mammea</b> africana. Other fruits the duiker may eat are those of Ricinodendron heudelotii and oil-palms, the orange ones of Chrysophyllum beguei, the olive-like ones of Pseudospondias longifolia, the green plums of Panda oleosa and those of Cola rostrata, that {{resemble}} cocoa pods. The bay duiker extracts the pulp from the seeds, making a grating sound. If the seeds are large, the duiker spits them out. Smaller seeds {{such as those of}} Antrocaryon species may be ingested. A 1989 study found that the soft seeds of plants such as Drypetes gossweileri, Staudtia gabonensis, Dacryoides buettneri, Ongokea gore, Santiria trimera, Annonidium mannii and Pentaclethra macrophylla are preferred. There have been reports of the bay duiker preying on birds (without feeding on the legs and wings) and the embryo of unhatched eggs, carrion, remains of African porcupines and kusimanses, termites, beetles and ants. Dog food may serve as supplement for captive individuals.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAdvanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are {{associated}} with many pathogenic disorders such as pathogenesis of diabetes or endothelial dysfunction leading to cardiovascular events. Therefore, the identification of new anti-AGE molecules or extracts aims at preventing such pathologies. Many Clusiaceae and Calophyllaceae species are used in traditional medicines to treat arterial hypertension as well as diabetes. Focusing on these plant families, an anti-AGE plant screening allowed us to select <b>Mammea</b> neurophylla for further phytochemical and biological studies. Indeed, both DCM and MeOH stem bark extracts demonstrated in vitro their ability to prevent inflammation in endothelial cells and to reduce vasoconstriction. A bioguided fractionation of these extracts allowed us to point out 4 -phenyl- and 4 -(1 -acetoxypropyl) coumarins and procyanidins as potent inhibitors of AGE formation, potentially preventing endothelial dysfunction. The fractionation steps also led to the isolation of two new compounds, namely neurophyllols A and B from the DCM bark extract together with thirteen known <b>mammea</b> A and E coumarins (<b>mammea</b> A/AA, <b>mammea</b> A/AB, <b>mammea</b> A/BA, <b>mammea</b> A/BB, <b>mammea</b> A/AA cycloD, <b>mammea</b> A/AB cycloD, disparinol B, <b>mammea</b> A/AB cycloE, ochrocarpin A, <b>mammea</b> A/AA cycloF, <b>mammea</b> A/AB cycloF, <b>mammea</b> E/BA, <b>mammea</b> E/BB) as well as δ-tocotrienol, xanthones (1 -hydroxy- 7 -methoxyxanthone, 2 -hydroxyxanthone) and triterpenes (friedelin and betulinic acid).

40|$|<b>Mammea</b> {{coumarins}} are isoprenylated 4 -alkyl or 4 -phenylcoumarins. Their {{distribution is}} limited to 3 Clusiaceae/Calophyllaceae genera. We recently reported on their presence in <b>Mammea</b> neurophylla bark extracts, where they exhibited anti-AGE properties associated with a prevention of the endothelial dysfunction. About 120 <b>mammea</b> coumarins were already described so, in order to focus further phytochemical analysis on original or bio-active compounds, we developed a methodology to facilitate the detection and identification of compounds of interest. Our aim {{was to develop a}} LC-DAD–ESI-MSn method for rapid, sensitive and simple analysis of the <b>mammea</b> coumarins in calophyllaceous/clusiaceous species. For that, full LC-DAD–MSn data were acquired from 11 4 -phenylcoumarins previously isolated in our laboratory. Bark, leaves and fruits of M. neurophylla were then extracted with DCM using an ASE apparatus. Extracts were finally analyzed through LC-DAD–HRMSn and UV and MS profiles were compared to our database as well as literature data. Detected new compounds were isolated and their structures elucidated through 1 H, 13 C and 2 D NMR analysis. Finally, 24 known <b>mammea</b> coumarins were dereplicated from bark, leaf and fruit DCM extracts of M. neurophylla and the structure of 4 unreported compounds could be predicted. In particular, the structures of <b>mammea</b> A/AA 9 -hydroxyCycloF and <b>mammea</b> A/AB 9 -hydroxyCycloF were confirmed after purification and extensive NMR analyses. By comparison of UV and mass fragmentation data from a small library of reference compounds, LC-DAD–HRMSn analysis of <b>mammea</b> coumarins in crude extracts allows the structure prediction of novel or bio-active compounds.
