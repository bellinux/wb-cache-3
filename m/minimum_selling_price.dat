Suppliers of travel products often impose a <b>minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> for their products. For instance, a hotel might give the wholesaler a room at cost price X, but on the condition that the room is not sold for less than Y (hotels do this to prevent wholesalers from competing with themselves). With dynamic packaging, the customer is not presented with the room price, only the overall package price, so hotels typically allow the wholesaler to discount the (hidden) price of the hotel more.|$|E
50|$|The third {{alternative}} {{explanation was}} that people have habitual bargaining behaviors, such as overstating their <b>minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> or understating their maximum bargaining price, that may spill over from strategic interactions where these behaviors are useful to the laboratory setting where they are sub-optimal. An experiment was conducted to address this by having the clearing prices selected at random. Buyers who indicated a willingness-to-pay higher than the randomly drawn price got the good, and vice versa for those who indicated a lower WTP. Likewise, sellers who indicated a lower willingness-to-accept than the randomly drawn price sold the good and vice versa. This incentive compatible value elicitation method did not eliminate the endowment effect but did rule out habitual bargaining behavior as an alternative explanation.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the possibility of recycling enzymes during saccharification of cellulose for the production of ethanol from woodchips. To make enzyme recycling feasible and economical when woodchips are processed for ethanol, the lignin in the wood is to be removed before the enzymes are added. Since enzymes constitute a major part of the input costs, second only to the feedstock, the ability to reuse the enzymes could lead to a considerable decrease in the production cost of ethanol. Tulip poplar woodchips were selected as the feedstock. Different delignification methods with recovery of byproducts were investigated. Alkali extraction, using dilute NaOH for the removal of lignin after steam pretreatment, was used as the base case against which all other processes were compared. Recovery of furfural and methanol, produced during the pretreatment of the woodchips, for sale as byproducts was one modification to the alkali extraction process that was investigated. The conversion of xylose to furfural and the recovery of the furfural as a byproduct was the third case explored. Solvent extraction using a 50 : 50 ethanol-water mixture instead of extraction with NaOH was the fourth case examined. Process flow sheets were then developed to recycle the enzymes during the hydrolysis and fermentation of this prehyrolyzed and delignified wood. Two reactor setup schemes were examined for enzyme recycling. One scheme involved a single train of reactors, with the whole pretreated slurry flowing from one reactor to the next, whereas, in the other scheme, the slurry was split among parallel trains of reactors. The activity loss of the enzymes was modeled such that a part of the enzymes entering the reactor lost all their activity. The loss of activity in multiple steps, with enzymes losing only some of their activity, was also modeled. Here the enzymes entering the reactor constituted a mixture with different activities instead of all the enzymes having the same activity like in the previous single step model. Recovering methanol and furfural reduced the <b>minimum</b> ethanol <b>selling</b> <b>price.</b> High temperature ethanol water pretreatment and lignin extraction reduced the <b>minimum</b> ethanol <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> compared to the base case of steam pretreatment followed by alkali extraction. Enzyme recycling also reduces the <b>minimum</b> ethanol <b>selling</b> <b>price.</b> The magnitude of the price reduction depends on the recycling scheme selected and the rate of enzyme deactivation, which has not been measured.

40|$|The {{production}} of alternative transportation fuels {{is imperative to}} meet future energy demands without contributing to global climate change. Advances in alternative processing techniques that have emerged due to interest in microalgae as a feedstock {{have led to a}} variety of potential processing pathways for the {{production of}} bio-based fuels. A major hurdle in the algal production process is maintaining a fast and stable algae culture. Monocultures, developed for their high lipid content, suffer from low productivity, are susceptible to crashes and require a constant supply of carbon dioxide to maintain productivity. In an effort to circumvent these obstacles, algal turf scrubber systems (ATS) are now being targeted not only for water purification, but as a means of producing algae feedstocks for fuel conversion. The resulting algae are capable of being harvested at a much higher density, requiring less energy for dewatering purposes. ATS systems do present other drawbacks that downstream technologies need to account for to make this system a viable means for fuel conversion. While polyculture algae species display great growth characteristics, they contain high percentages of nitrogen containing proteins and low lipid content. If not removed this nitrogen pollutes any resulting biocrude making it unacceptable for diesel fuel blends. This study investigates a processing method which reduces the nitrogen content of the resulting fuel by fermenting both carbohydrates and proteins into intermediate compounds. By tuning the E. coli fermentation stain it is hoped that the process will yield higher value co-products than those investigated in this study. The research contained herein incorporates laboratory experimentation with engineering systems modeling to assess the economic feasibility and environmental impacts of generating biofuels from ATS cultivated algae. Results show a <b>minimum</b> fuel <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> of $ 5. 93 per gasoline gallon equivalent and greenhouse gas emissions of - 0. 0185 kg CO 2 eq per MJ fuel.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{examined}} individuals' <b>minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> or certainty equivalents for lotteries as measures of preference, but few have examined maximum buying prices. Because every transaction involves a buyer {{as well as a}} seller, buyers' pricing behavior is of interest in its own right. Two prospect theory based descriptive models of maximum buying prices [...] -the integration and segregation models [...] -are developed from different assumptions about cognitive encoding processes. The models were tested experimentally using an incentive-compatible cash payoff scheme in which maximum buying prices for bets and choices between bets were elicited from subjects. Surprisingly, observed maximum buying prices were far below expected values even for bets with probabilities of winning near 1. 0. This suggests buyers are strongly influenced by loss aversion and that the conventional assumption that the buying price for a risky alternative is a reduction in the alternative's payoffs fails to describe behavior. Instead, it appears subjects predominately employed a segregation encoding process in which the buying price was encoded separately from the bet's payoffs and treated as a sure loss. However, an additional result was not explained adequately by either encoding model: Buying prices were less risk averse than choices for $ 3 expected value bets [...] -creating preference reversals of the standard kind (Lichtenstein and Slovic 1971) [...] -but more risk averse for $ 100 expected value bets [...] -creating reverse preference reversals (Casey 1991).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the economic feasibility of second generation ethanol from sugar cane, whereby traditional ethanol production is combined with the use of lignocellulosic biomass for ethanol production. By applying cost-benefit analysis, this study evaluated the viability of the second generation ethanol technology as an alternative to conventional sugarcaneto- ethanol, both in terms of processing technology, and of land use impacts. Furthermore, an attempt is made to analyze impacts on CO 2 mitigation and land use in economic. The research results indicate that: i) from an economic point of view, the first generation plant is clearly preferable. With IRR of 18. 7 %, <b>Minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> of US$ 0. 31 per liter, and NPV of US$ 213. 0 million, first generation ethanol production from sugar cane has a large economic advantage compared to the second generation plant (IRR of 13. 5 %, <b>Minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> of US$ 0. 40 per liter and NPV of US$ 78. 5 million). ii) from an environmental point of view, a second generation biofuel that makes use of lignocellulosic biomass plant is clearly preferable. The second generation plant uses 49. 6 % less land and avoids a CO 2 debt average of 942, 282 ton per year throughout the life of the project. iii) Productivity gains improve profitability (IRR) and reduce biofuel prices (Minimum selling prices). Increasing the yearlt Ethanol and sugar cane productivity’s growth rate from 0. 5 % to 4. 0 % leads to a range of IRR from 17. 5 % to 21. 5 %, and of price from 0. 29 US$/l to 0. 32 US$/l for first generation plant, and from 13. 2 % to 14. 2 % and of price from 0. 39 US$/l to 0. 40 US$/l for second generation plant. iv) Process improvement shows little economic impact but matters on environmental side because less land is needed. Up to 10 % more land can be saved compared to least advanced technology. v) Energy conversion development can improve income of the plant, especially for the first generation plant. Each 5 % improvement can lead to 0. 6 % change in IRR project, and a reduction of 1. 1 % in the <b>Minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price.</b> vi) Equipment investment is the most sensitive parameter to alter biofuel prices and profitability. The conventional plant is more sensitive to equipment investment, land prices and trash costs in this order while second generation plant is sensitive to equipment investment and almost insensitive to land prices and trash costs changes. vii) Assuming an average payment of US$ 29. 43 or higher per ton CO 2 debt, the second generation plant may become a competing alternative to conventional, first generation plant. On average, the technology could be paid at reasonable cost (Revenue average of US$ 27. 7 million). viii) Productivity gains reduce the repayment time of CO 2 debt, with ethanol productivity having a stronger contribution. Besides, from a growth rate of ethanol and sugar cane productivity from 0. 5 % to 4. 0 % per year, the repayment time changes from 11. 8 years to a range between 6. 5 years and 5. 5 years and 13 and 9. 5, respectively.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three essays about consumer judgment and decision making. In Essay 1, I develop a novel explanation for the well-known endowment effect - the tendency for owners to value goods more than non-owners do. According to a prominent explanation for this effect, the prospect of losing possessions creates psychological pain, inducing sellers to demand more than buyers will pay. My alternative account is based on transaction disutility: consumers are reluctant to trade on terms that are disadvantageous with respect to perceived market prices. The endowment effect appears {{to be caused by}} inflated <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> because market prices usually exceed the value of ownership to consumers. But I show that reducing reference prices relieves sellers' transaction disutility, shrinking or eliminating the effect. Moreover, very low reference prices create disutility among buyers, resulting in disparities driven by a reluctance to buy, not to sell. Essay 2 explores the implications of transaction disutility for consumer preferences. Maximum buying and <b>minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> are commonly believed to reveal preferences: a consumer who prefers one good over another presumably has a higher reservation price for it. But transaction disutility can distort reservation prices away from underlying values. If alternative measures of preference - such as binary choices between goods - are not regarded by consumers as transactions, they are not subject to such distortions. This difference can create preference reversals, that is, incoherence between explicit choices and the preferences implied by stated reservation prices. I find strong experimental evidence for this proposition. The "Bayesian Truth Serum" (BTS) is a survey scoring method designed to provide truth telling incentives for respondents answering multiple choice questions about intrinsically private matters: opinions, tastes, past behavior. (cont.) My final essay discusses several tests of BTS. In one questionnaire, respondents indicated their familiarity with various items (e. g. electronics brands), one-third of which were nonexistent foils. BTS did in fact reward truth telling: the scoring method severely penalized "recognition" of foils. Also, survey takers viewed the BTS method as credible: people who were paid for achieving higher BTS scores claimed to recognize fewer foils, even when facing competing incentives to deceive. by Ray Weaver.

The present study focuses on procedures used to elicit preferences according to an evaluability hypothesis.

Subjects had to express preferences between high-variance gambles (HVGs) and low-variance gambles (LVGs) either by choosing one gamble {{to play in a}} lottery or by assigning gambles minimum selling prices. We show that HVGs are preferred in both choice and pricing conditions when gambles are evaluated separately, and LVGs are preferred in both choice and selling conditions when gambles are evaluated in pairs: i. e., when the evaluation mode is held constant, classic preference reversal disappears. These results support the evaluability hypothesis, and suggest that preferences depend on whether subjects are allowed to compare the options they are asked to choose from or judge, independently {{of the nature of the}} scale (i. e., attractiveness vs. <b>minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price)</b> they are required to adopt.

The current paper presents three studies which demonstrate that materialism moderates this “endowment effect”.

Increasing the attachment to material values with a mortality salience procedure augments the endowment effect even more, particularly for materialists.

40|$|This study {{explored}} how preference reversals, {{induced by}} changes in response mode (choice vs. pricing), are moderated by how lotteries are represented, as being played 1, 10, or 100 times. Ss chose which {{of a pair of}} gambles they preferred to play and determined the <b>minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> of each gamble. Replicating previous research, the preference reversal was obtained for single-play representations: Ss tended to choose the gambles with the higher probabilities of winning, but priced them lower. However, for multiple-play representations, preference reversals were reduced, and consistency between pricing and choice behaviors was increased. Both response modes were sensitive to differences in the expected values of gambles, but sensitivity did not vary significantly with the number of plays. These results support the hypothesis that violations of expected utility theory are reduced for multiple-play gambles. The evaluation of a monetary gamble requires consideration of two basic types of information: (a) the probabilities associated with winning and losing, and (b) the amounts to be won and lost. The well-documented phenomenon of preference reversals provides strong evidence that the processing of this information depends on how the evaluation is expresse...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of bio-based chemicals has received tremendous attention in recent years, but {{little has been}} done to understand the broad patterns of the economics of different processes for making these molecules. The diversity of potential chemicals simultaneously makes such an understanding both important and difficult to glean during these early-stages. By using cost correlations and standard scale-factors, a spreadsheet-based early-stage cost estimation tool was developed. The tool, named BioPET (Biorenewables Process Evaluation Tool), allows users to specify up to seven primary unit operations (fermentation, separation, three catalytic stages, and purification), and basic defining inputs for each operation. With these inputs, BioPET computes an estimated <b>minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> for the pathway of interest. Validation of BioPET was conducted by comparing results to literature values and a commercial economic analysis tool for three molecules: ethanol, succinic acid, and adipic acid. BioPET produced virtually identical prices to SuperPro DesignerÂ® for the three chemicals, although the costs were not identically distributed amongst the categories; BioPET produced estimates that were within 40 % of other literature values at low feedstock costs, and within 5 % at high feedstock costs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — According to {{the usual}} {{paradigm}} in electronic commerce, a consumer wants to buy something from a merchant, but neither party is much concerned with privacy. In an earlier paper, we introduced the concept of Blind Electronic Commerce, in which both parties should enjoy a maximum of privacy, and we gave solutions {{for some of the}} problems that arise in this context. Ideally, the customer should be able to remain anonymous, hide her browsing pattern and even hide from the merchant what she is interested in buying. Conversely, the merchant should not have to reveal anything unnecessary about his catalogue, especially prices. The issue considered here concerns the negotiation of a fair price in this context. This is challenging because the merchant does not know for what item he is negotiating, nor even his own starting price! Nevertheless, he must be prepared to reduce the price and/or introduce better sales conditions, or risk losing the sale. But of course, the consumer should have to negotiate without being able to guess anything about the merchant’s strategy, such as the <b>minimum</b> <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> for the item under negotiation. In this paper, we provide cryptographic solutions to solve this Blind Negotiation conundrum. I...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} an economic feasibility {{study of a}} 5, 000 head, cooperatively owned, sheep operation for leafy spurge control. The objectives were 1) determine the return on investment of the cooperative, 2) determine the proposed structure of the cooperative, and 3) ascertain the amount of capital investment required by members in the cooperative. Three sheep flock management alternatives were initially considered for the cooperative. These were 1) winter lambing, 2) spring lambing, and 3) fall lambing. The fall lambing scenario {{was determined to be}} infeasible because of logistics associated with gathering and transportation of pregnant ewes and lack of grazing pressure on leafy spurge throughout the grazing season. The total capital investment per ewe for the winter lambing scenario was more than the spring lambing scenario - - $ 301 and $ 216, respectively. The expected net income generated by the winter lambing scenario was negative. The <b>minimum</b> break-even lamb <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> or lambs sold per ewe for the winter lambing scenario was $ 84. 10 /cwt and 1. 33, respectively. The spring lambing scenario returned $ 124, 000 annually. The <b>minimum</b> breakeven lamb <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> or lambs sold per ewe for the spring lambing scenario was $ 59. 51 /cwt and 0. 94, respectively. The expected return on investment (50 % equity) for cooperative members with the spring lambing scenario, assuming a 50 -acre leafy spurge infestation in a 100 -acre pasture and new fence, was 16 percent (stocking rate of 1 ewe and lambs per acre of leafy spurge). While these returns are not a guarantee of success for the spring lambing alternative, they do provide an indication of the potential that such a cooperative may have.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for predicting coal prices in regional markets for the target time frames 1985 and 2000 that could subsequently {{be used to}} guide {{the development of an}} advanced coal extraction system. The model constructed is a supply and demand model that focuses on underground mining since the advanced technology is expected to be developed for these reserves by the target years. Coal reserve data and the cost of operating a mine are used to obtain the <b>minimum</b> acceptable <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> that would induce the producer to bring the mine into production. Based on this information, market supply curves can be generated. Demand by region is calculated based on an EEA methodology that emphasizes demand by electric utilities and demand by industry. The demand and supply curves are then used to obtain the price targets. The results show a growth {{in the size of the}} markets for compliance and low sulphur coal regions. A significant rise in the real price of coal is not expected even by the year 2000. The model predicts heavy reliance on mines with thick seams, larger block size and deep overburden...|$|R
