40|$|An {{important}} {{environmental problem}} facing {{industries such as}} railroads, utilities and telecommunications is the proper disposal of spent cadmium <b>containing</b> <b>batteries.</b> For example, spent industrial nickel-cadmium <b>containing</b> <b>batteries</b> are regulated in the United States as a hazardous waste. This means that industries that generate spent cadmium <b>containing</b> <b>batteries</b> for disposal are subject {{to all of the}} regulations under RCRA as well as the liabilities under CERCLA. This paper presents the recycling of nickel-cadmium <b>containing</b> <b>batteries</b> through apyrometallurgical process as a disposal option. The three steps ofpyrometallurgical process: (I) Feed Preparation, (2) Reduction, (3) Smelting and Casting are examined in detail. The fate of the metal components of the batteries are traced in the paper. Thepaperconcludes withadiscussion oftherequirements and the advantages of this method of treatment...|$|R

40|$|Mercury was {{traditionally}} used {{in agricultural}} chemicals as a fungicide, mildewcide, or pesticide. All food uses of mercury-containing pesticides were cancelled in 1969, and all US pesticide registrations were canceled in as of early 1995. The last four uses {{to be cancelled}} were turf fungicide, mildewcide for fresh cut wood, latex paint fungicide/preservative, and outdoor fabric treatment. However, many <b>mercury-</b> <b>containing</b> chemicals may still be present on farms or golf courses {{in the form of}} old stockpiles. These materials should be targeted by waste pesticide collection programs or clean sweep programs to prevent further emissions to the environment. tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt John Gilkeson of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency began his extensive inventory of mercury-containing products through an examination of mercury used in pesticides. He has developed a list of over 150 trade and chemical names of pesticides used between the 1950 ’s and present that contain mercury. John reports that some mercury-containing pesticides are still being manufactured and used in developed countries. For example, Canada still allows the use of mercuric pesticides for turf mold.
