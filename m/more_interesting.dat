5|$|Teeuw {{wrote that}} the moral {{messages}} and sentimentality in Sitti Nurbaya are overdone, similar to Azab dan Sengsara. However, he considers the plot of Sitti Nurbaya <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> for a reader from a Western background than the older novel.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a seductive detail in a {{training}} context might be a training class that includes cartoons on slides containing tips for effective supervision. Although not necessarily relevant to the topic, the cartoons are designed to make the training material <b>more</b> <b>interesting,</b> but the results of multiple studies suggest that their inclusion will harm recall from the primary training content.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{includes}} {{the debut of}} the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl. After the episode, it was moved into the Simpsons' basement, where it has since reappeared as a prop {{in the background of}} several episodes, although never in a major role. The design was partially based on real Olmec heads, but changed to look <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and grotesque.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} mallets {{used by the}} player could also vary as well. For most occasions, only one mallet is used but for other {{technique}}s, the player could use two mallets, one in each hand. An even <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> technique uses only one balu but requires the player to play the agung in reverse order of pitches. Called patuy, this technique and the one with two mallets are normally reserved only for competition and exhibition instances.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{originally}} wrote Veronica Mars as a {{young adult}} novel, featuring a male as the protagonist. He changed {{the gender of the}} protagonist because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and unique. The original pilot script was darker in tone than the one filmed, and several details were changed. Although it ranked low in the ratings, the pilot was critically acclaimed and Bell's performance as the protagonist was praised.|$|E
5|$|What {{were the}} {{possibilities}} which thus presented themselves? Firstly, in that {{of making a}} film not noticeably similar to any previously made in the English language. Secondly, that of using this English language... in a more varied and, to me, <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> way than I had previously had the chance of doing in a film. Thirdly, that of making a picture which paid no regard whatever to established, although not practised, moral convention.|$|E

5|$|After {{continuing}} {{to search for}} acting work, in 1987, Cartwright auditioned for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on The Tracey Ullman Show. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the middle child; when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of Bart—Lisa's brother—to be <b>more</b> <b>interesting.</b> Matt Groening, the series' creator, allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called The Simpsons. For her subsequent work as Bart, Cartwright received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992 and an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation in 1995.|$|E
5|$|British {{palaeontologist}} David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable {{it is that}} Owen, {{who previously}} had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus though it {{could serve as a}} prime example of this hypothesis and its fossil {{was one of the most}} complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E
5|$|Central Saint Giles {{provides}} 66,090m² {{of floor}} space – almost {{double that of}} the old St Giles Court – split between two separate buildings. The 15-storey west block is for residential use, providing 109 flats of which 53 are designated as affordable. The much larger horseshoe-shaped eastern block, standing 11 storeys high, encircles a publicly accessible courtyard comprising 27% of the site's area. It provides 37,625m² of office space with {{by far the largest}} floor plates of any office block in the West End of London, with 4,000m² on all but the top two floors. At ground level, 2,276m² of space is available for retail outlets and restaurants. The block is irregularly shaped with recesses, projections and roof terraces intended to make it look <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and to break up its bulk.|$|E

5000|$|... “Dead Old Man” was {{replaced}} with “Mary Jane/Mary Lane.” This was done because Kevin & Dan felt the former was a visually static solo. That kind of number works better on stage than on film. They thought “MJ/ML” would be <b>more</b> visually <b>interesting.</b>|$|R
5|$|Crittenden's {{support of}} a new {{election}} was both popular and politically expedient. When the U.S. Senate term of Martin D. Hardin, one of Slaughter's unpopular nominees, expired in 1817, the Kentucky General Assembly chose Crittenden to fill the vacancy. Though he was {{the youngest member of}} the body, he served as the second-ever chairman of the newly created Committee on the Judiciary. He was {{also a member of the}} Committee on Naval Affairs. During his term, he introduced legislation to reimburse and indemnify persons who were fined under the 1798 Sedition Act. He found state politics <b>more</b> <b>interesting,</b> however, and this fact, coupled with increased financial responsibilities incurred by the birth of his third and fourth children, prompted his decision to resign his seat on March 3, 1819.|$|E
5|$|Each {{enemy was}} {{designed}} to exhibit a unique behavior toward the character; random elements were programmed into the enemies' behaviors to make the game <b>more</b> <b>interesting.</b> The first two designed were the simplest: Electrodes and Grunts. Electrodes are stationary objects that are lethal to the in-game characters, and Grunts are simple robots that chase the protagonist by plotting the shortest path to him. Grunts were designed to overwhelm the player with large groups. While testing the game with the new control system and the two enemies, Jarvis and DeMar were impressed by the gameplay's excitement and fun. As a result, they began steadily {{increasing the number of}} on-screen enemies to over a hundred to see if more enemies would generate more enjoyment.|$|E
5|$|Grisedale Tarn is the {{starting}} point for the south ridge of Helvellyn, and may be reached from Grasmere or Patterdale, or from Dunmail Raise by a path alongside Raise Beck. Above the tarn the old pony track zigzags up the fellside, and takes a safe but unexciting route well away from crags {{on the side of the}} ridge, and avoiding all the intermediate tops. In suitable weather a <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and scenic route is to follow the edge of the crags as closely as possible, over the tops of Dollywagon Pike, High Crag and Nethermost Pike.|$|E

60|$|A {{flash of}} light and {{whistling}} of bullets overhead effectually stopped the Irishman's discourse. Not {{that he was at}} all alarmed by the familiar incident, but being a change of subject it became <b>more</b> absorbingly <b>interesting</b> than the conversation, besides necessitating some active precautions.|$|R
5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game <b>more</b> <b>interesting,</b> Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E
5|$|Planet Moon Studios' {{blending}} of two genres in Giants {{has earned the}} acclaim of reviewers. Game Revolution and GameSpot found the simplified real-time strategy task of resource gathering in Giants <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> than tedious, and Troy Dunniway, Microsoft's Head of Game Design in 2002, commented that the real-time strategy elements enhanced the game's shooter aspect rather than making it a hybrid of two genres. Sci Fi Weekly was impressed that both styles of play never interfered with each other, which was complemented by the unique gameplay of each race. The Entertainment Depot, however, found the base building in several missions tedious; they said the player had to rebuild the base several times due to being forced to leave the base defenseless, which allowed the enemy destroy the structures.|$|E
5|$|The aborted Apollo 13 {{mission was}} {{originally}} scheduled {{to land at}} Fra Mauro, with Apollo 14 scheduled to land in the Littrow region of Mare Serenitatis. After Apollo 13 failed to land, {{it was decided to}} re-target Apollo 14 to Fra Mauro, as it was regarded as <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> scientifically than the Littrow site. There, Apollo 14 had the objective of sampling ejecta from the Imbrium impact to gain insight into the Moon's geologic history. A landing site near the freshly formed Cone crater was chosen, as this crater served as a 'natural drill hole' to allow the astronauts to obtain Imbrium ejecta, the primary objective of the mission.|$|E

5|$|Thomas {{initially}} wrote Veronica Mars as a {{young adult}} novel, which featured a male protagonist; he changed the gender because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and original. Filming began in March 2004, and the series premiered in September to 2.49 million American viewers. The critically acclaimed first season's run of 22 episodes garnered an average of 2.5 million viewers per episode in the United States. Veronica Mars appeared {{on a number of}} fall television best lists, and garnered several awards and nominations. During the series' run, it was nominated for two Satellite Awards, four Saturn Awards, five Teen Choice Awards and was featured on AFI's TV Programs of the Year for 2005.|$|E
5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it <b>more</b> <b>interesting,</b> two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party <b>more</b> <b>interesting,</b> including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E
