25|$|With {{the advent}} of modern {{electron}} <b>microscopic</b> <b>techniques</b> in the early 1950s, nerve endings were found to contain {{a large number of}} electron-lucent vesicles. The term synaptic vesicle was first introduced by De Robertis and Bennett in 1954. This was shortly after transmitter release at the frog neuromuscular junction was found to induce postsynaptic miniature end-plate potentials that were ascribed to the release of discrete packages of neurotransmitter (quanta) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. It was thus reasonable to hypothesize that the transmitter substance (acetylcholine) was contained in such vesicles, which by a secretory mechanism would release their contents into the synaptic cleft (vesicle hypothesis).|$|E
25|$|The {{imperfect}} fungus Tubakia dryina Sutton is a leaf parasite {{reported to}} occur {{on a wide}} range of host plants, including species of Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2–5mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of D.dryina were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of <b>microscopic</b> <b>techniques.</b> D.dryina infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that D.dryina can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and chlorosis caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of Dicarpella dryina. Tannins (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by D.dryina.|$|E

50|$|There are {{numerous}} microscopy methods for defining gel structures which include SEM and TEM. Use of <b>microscopic</b> <b>techniques</b> can directly determine the physical {{parameters of the}} gel matrix. These include measurements of pore diameter, wall thickness {{and shape of the}} gel network. Use of SEM can distinguish between gels that have a fibrous network as opposed to those that have a three-dimensional cross linked structure. It must be noted that microscopy techniques may not yield quantitatively accurate results. If a high vacuum is used during imaging, the liquid solvent can be removed from the gel matrix-inducing strain to the gel which leads to physical deformation. Use of an environmental SEM, which operates at higher pressures, can yield higher quality imaging.|$|E
50|$|The {{field of}} 2D crystal {{engineering}} has advanced {{over the years}} especially through the advent of scanning probe <b>microscopic</b> <b>techniques</b> which enable one to visualize networks with sub-molecular precision. Understanding the mechanism of these two dimensional assemblies may provide insights to the bottom up fabrication processes at the interfaces. The many aspects of developments in this field include the understanding of interactions, studies on polymorphism, design of nanoporous networks. Engineering the size and symmetry of the cavities and performing host guest chemistry inside the pores under nano confinement remains an attractive interest of this field. More recently, multicomponent networks are also studied that are formed by the application of crystal engineering principles. Although, {{there is a very}} high influence of the underlying substrate on the formation of the two dimensional assemblies, at least in a few cases, a relation was found between 2D assemblies and the bulk crystal structures.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of {{suitable}} plate culture techniques, some microbes require culture within live animals. Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals, although serological and <b>microscopic</b> <b>techniques</b> make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, {{or the use of}} a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi, an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected. The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut.|$|E
