40|$|AbstractFor {{aircraft}} manufacturing industries, {{the analyses}} and prediction of part <b>machining</b> <b>error</b> during <b>machining</b> process {{are very important}} to control and improve part machining quality. In order to effectively control <b>machining</b> <b>error,</b> the method of integrating multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) and stream of variations (SoV) is proposed. Firstly, <b>machining</b> <b>error</b> is modeled by multi-operation approaches for part machining process. SoV is adopted to establish the mathematic model {{of the relationship between the}} error of upstream operations and the error of downstream operations. Here error sources not only include the influence of upstream operations but also include many of other error sources. The standard model and the predicted model about SoV are built respectively by whether the operation is done or not to satisfy different requests during part machining process. Secondly, the method of one-step ahead forecast error (OSFE) is used to eliminate autocorrelativity of the sample data from the SoV model, and the T 2 control chart in MSPC is built to realize <b>machining</b> <b>error</b> detection according to the data characteristics of the above error model, which can judge whether the operation is out of control or not. If it is, then feedback is sent to the operations. The error model is modified by adjusting the operation out of control, and continually it is used to monitor operations. Finally, a machining instance containing two operations demonstrates the effectiveness of the <b>machining</b> <b>error</b> control method presented in this paper...|$|R

Closed kinematic chains are considered more advantageous in rigidity, power-output, and accuracy than open kinematic chains.
