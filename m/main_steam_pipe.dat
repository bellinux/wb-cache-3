25|$|Unlike in Garratt's patent, Tasmanian Railways {{insisted on}} a {{compound}} arrangement with cylinders facing inwards, {{in order to reduce}} the distances between both the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> and the high-pressure cylinders, and between the high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders. This made the locomotive unnecessarily complicated and placed the high-pressure cylinders directly underneath the cab, making it uncomfortably hot, especially in summer. The pattern was not repeated on later Garratt designs. Only one more Garratt locomotive, again built by Beyer, Peacock & Co. in 1927, was produced with compound propulsion for the Burma Railways.|$|E
5000|$|The Roscoe-type {{lubricator}} {{to lubricate}} the cylinders was affixed {{on top of}} the smokebox {{to the rear of the}} chimney, since this position was convenient for obtaining a good connection with the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The most {{noticeable}} external {{difference from the}} experimental Class MD engine was the altered arrangement of the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> necessitated by the superheater. Instead of being led vertically down from the dome directly to the high-pressure cylinders, an internal pipe {{was taken from the}} regulator valve in the dome to the superheater in the smokebox, from where it was brought back to the high-pressure cylinders by external <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> arranged under the running boards.|$|R
50|$|The smokebox {{incorporates}} the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> from the regulator (or superheater header), one leading to each valve chest, {{a part of}} the cylinder casting. These may pass through the smokebox wall to join with the cylinder (outside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes)</b> or may stay within the profile of the smokebox (inside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes).</b> Inside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> do not require lagging as the smokebox keeps them warm, but outside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> are more common for locomotives with cylinders outside the frames. Some locomotive classes used both types depending on the date the batch was constructed (e.g. LNER Class V2).|$|R
25|$|The II {{torpedo boat}} {{flotilla}} encountered the II Light Cruiser Squadron commanded by William Goodenough and the XI destroyer flotilla commanded by Commodore Hawksley on HMS Castor. There was still enough light for the attackers to be spotted before getting sufficiently close, {{and they were}} forced to retreat to the west. The VI flotilla was also forced back west, receiving fire for 20 minutes at ranges of 3,300 to 5,500 yards. S50 was struck by a shell which severed a <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pipe,</b> reducing her speed to 25 knots, affecting her steering and electrical power so that she had to return to the main fleet. Lahs turned eastward again at 2110 and Schuur at 2140, but now found themselves too far north. The attack was abandoned and the destroyers headed for the Skaw and a return to Germany, together with the third flotilla which had also become left behind.|$|E
500|$|On 1 January 1899 {{the ship}} was reassigned to the 1st Light Division and her most notable {{activities}} for the year were visits to the Balearic Islands and ports in the Aegean Sea and Middle East. Her <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> fractured on 20 February and injured three crewmen. Chanzy was repaired in time {{to participate in the}} annual maneuvers and spent three weeks in September attached to the elderly gunnery ship [...] before making a cruise to French North Africa. The ship began a brief deployment to the Levant on 1 February 1901 and returned on 4 April for the annual maneuvers before returning to the Levant on 30 October. She arrived back at Toulon on 1 February 1902 and began a long period of relative inactivity that lasted until she was formally placed in reserve when the new armored cruiser [...] replaced her in the squadron in May 1904.|$|E

50|$|An {{externally}} obvious {{difference was}} the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> from the dome to the high-pressure cylinders, which {{was no longer}} arranged vertically down directly to the cylinders along {{the outside of the}} boiler, but internally via the superheater in the smokebox and from there along the underside of the running boards back to the cylinders. The result was a much better performing locomotive with an increased tractive effort brought about by the larger cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The axle {{boxes of}} the leading and {{trailing}} wheels on each engine unit were equipped with roller bearings while the solid bronze coupled wheel axle boxes were fitted with Ajax grease lubrication systems. Soft grease lubrication was used throughout for the motion gear, except the piston rods, valve spindles and main crossheads which were oil-lubricated. Two four-feed sight lubricators, arranged in the cab, supplied oil to the steam chests, cylinders and the ball joint of the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> on each engine unit.|$|R

50|$|The {{single shaft}} five {{cylinder}} impulse-reaction turbine has a double flow arrangement for the I.P. cylinders {{as well as}} for the L.P. cylinders. There are double casings on H.P., I.P., and L.P. cylinders, and the last stages of the L.P. are fitted with 914.4 mm (36 in) blades. Stop valves and governor valves are situated at the inlet to the H.P. strainers and I.P. turbine. There are four 228.6 mm (9 in) bore <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pipes,</b> and four 431.8 mm (17 in) bore pipes on both the hot and cold reheat circuits to the turbine. In view of the size and increased volume of pipework compared to earlier designs, special attention was paid to mounting the valve chests as close to the machine as possible to reduce the stored energy effect of overspeed. For the H.P. valves this is done without actually mounting the valves on the cylinder, thus avoiding complication of the H.P. casing.|$|R
40|$|In {{a boiling}} water reactor (BWR) and {{advanced}} {{boiling water reactor}} (ABWR) a <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> line <b>pipe</b> rupture in the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> piping system, hereafter called <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> (MS) line, will create a decompression wave and a pressure disturbance that moves through the MS line toward the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). It expands into a large region transmitting a compression wave at acoustic speed and spreads as an acoustic wave over the adjacent dryer plate. The initial acoustic pressure force on the dryer is expected to spread from an origin at the steam line attachment. It reflects back toward the RPV wall and again to the dryer until it dissipates. This is expected in a space that is not of uniform spacing because the dryer surface is nearly flat and the vessel wall is a curved surface. The acoustic load region is bounded by the steam dryer outer surface and RPV inner wall surfaces. In this paper, simplified, conservative modeling is applied in this approach to obtain reasonable bounding loads. The method is compared against {{the result of a}} detailed fine-structure Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis using the same input data. Therefore, the simplified method may be used to quickly estimate conservative decompression forces on a dryer surface...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Research {{of loss of}} coolant {{accident}} (LOCA) postulated on {{the nuclear}} reactor coolant system (RCS) was investigated with ANSYS program. Secondary development of ANSYS was performed to form the customized module for implementing effective and efficient RCS LOCA nonlinear analysis. A standard analysis procedure was established. It has following functions, such as parameters and modular system modeling, automatically set break, static pilot analysis, LOCA nonlinear dynamic calculation and automatic reports generation. <b>Main</b> <b>pipes,</b> <b>Steam</b> generator and reactor coolant pump models were molded by parameterized modular modeling method. Those models considered the nonlinear factors, such as material nonlinearities, gap and so on, constructed component model libraries of RCS. Comparing the results calculated by ANSYS and program-specific, it is showed that the results are generally consistent...|$|R

40|$|The {{so-called}} {{creep strength}} enhanced ferritic (CSEF) 9 - 12 % Cr steels {{have been identified}} as the most promising class of materials for some of the key components in ultra-supercritical fossil-fired power plants, including the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pipes,</b> headers and superheater tubings. These steels are less costly, and they have a lower coefficient of thermal expansion and a higher thermal conductivity when compared with austenitic stainless steels, making them less susceptible to degradation through thermal fatigue. However, experience has shown that the weldments in these steels are particularly prone to premature creep failure, due to a localised form of cracking in the heat-affected zone {HAZl, which is referred to as Type IV cracking. The work presented in this thesis is concerned with the effects of residual stresses and constraint on Type IV cracking. In {{the first part of this}} work, the residual stresses in a 25. 4 mm thick, 324 mm diameter pipe girth weld, made in a P 91 steel pipe, have been measured in both the as-welded and post weld heat treated (PWHT) conditions using neutron diffraction, and compared with the corresponding metallurgical zones across each weld. It was found that the highest as-welded tensile stresses resided near the outer boundary of the HAZ, and towards t he weld root region and these were not fully relieved by the applied PWHT. In both conditions substantial tensile direct and hydrostatic stresses existed across the HAZ, including the fine-grained and intercritically-annealed regions, where premature Type IV creep failures manifest in 9 - 12 % Cr steel welds. Compressive stresses were found in the weld metal coinciding with the last weld bead to be deposited. In the second part of the work, creep tests were conducted at 625 °C on cross-weld and simulated fine-grained HAZ specimens. The contributions of specific influences on creep performance (such as residual stress, constraint and creep damage associated with relaxation of residual stresses during PWHT) were then systematically examined. It was found that the geometric constraint (introducing a triaxial stress state) was beneficial in improving creep rupture life and that residual stresses (of the order of 50 MPa) showed a. clear reduction in life. Moreover there was some evidence that residual stress relaxation associated with PWHT may introduce some creep damage. The digital image correlation (DIC) technique was applied to resolve tensile and time• dependent creep deformation properties along the length of P 91 cross-weld samples. The results demonstrated the capability of the Die technique for full field measurement of strain during both room-temperature-tensile and high temperature creep tests in the vicinity of welded joints, where the gradients in microstructure and mechanical properties can be steep.
