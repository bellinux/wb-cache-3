40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} possibilities of forwarding timber in an efficient and environmentally friendly way, under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils of Croatian lowland forests due to their increased moisture all the year round. Reduced soil bearing capacity causes restricted mobility and decreases the forwarder productivity, and also increases the level of damage caused to forest soil, reflected in its compaction and rutting (Fig. 1). In lowland even-aged forests of Croatia, <b>main</b> <b>felling</b> is mostly carried out based on wood cutting and processing by chain saws and forwarding of timber, processed by cut-to-length method, by six-wheel forwarders, usually not equipped with semitracks on rear wheels of bogie axle (Fig. 1). The analysis was carried out on {{the example of a}} medium-weight six-wheel forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (nominal load capacity of 12 t, whose dimensions and load distribution of empty vehicle are shown in Fig. 4), and this analysis involved as follows: 1) the effect of load reduction on forwarder efficiency, 2) forwarder environmental soundness under conditions of limited soil strength based on nominal ground pressure (Mellgren 1980) of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, vehicle with narrower (600 mm) and wider (710 mm) tires, or with tracks on wheels of the rear (bogie) axle. The limit value of environmental soundness would be the allowed ground pressure of limited bearing capacity < 60 kPa (Owende et al. 2002). The effect of load reduction (4 t, 8 t with respect to 12 t of the vehicle nominal load capacity) on forwarder efficiency with respect to the distance of timber forwarding, is expressed according to the multicriteria calculation model of productivity of these vehicles (Stankić 2010), which takes into account: 1) forwarder class 2) soil strength, 3) use of tracks, 4) felling density, 5) volume of the average felling tree and 6) distance of timber forwarding. The unit cost of timber forwarding was calculated according to machine rate made by the company »Hrvatske šume» d. o. o Zagreb for the forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (433. 19 kn/h). For calculating the nominal ground pressure (Fig. 3), a theoretical model of axle load distribution was used, the case of vehicle at standstill on level ground, depending on mass and length of loaded logs in the bunk area of the forwarder (Poršinsky and Horvat 2005). The analysis of axle load distribution was based on an average length of logs (4 m) made by cut-to-length method {{in the area of the}} Croatian lowland forests, and the mass of 1800 kg of a pair of semitracks. The wheel load assumed even load distribution of axle load by pertaining wheels. The contact area between wheels (tracks) and soil was calculated according to Mellgren (1980), for narrower (front – 600 / 65 - 34, rear – 600 / 55 - 26. 5) and wider (front – 710 / 55 - 34, rear – 710 / 45 - 26. 5) tires recommended by the manufacturer of forwarder. The analysis of the forwarder environmental soundness was based on: 1) values of nominal ground pressure of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, and use of narrower and wider tires, i. e. or use of tracks, and 2) the upper limit value of the allowed ground pressure (< 60 kPa) of limited bearing capacity (class 3 – Fig. 2), which prevails at the time of <b>main</b> <b>felling</b> in the Croatian lowland forests. The results of efficiency analysis of timber forwarding (Fig. 5) showed that the reduction of load under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils, as a measure for providing vehicle mobility as well as for diminishing the level of damage caused to forest soil, is highly unacceptable due to the decrease of productivity and increase of unit costs. The analysis of nominal ground pressure (Fig. 7) under wheels of the front axle and wheels (tracks) of the rear axle, showed that under conditions of limited soil bearing capacity: 1) the forwarder nominal load capacity may be used and that efficient timber forwarding may be performed, 2) the environmental soundness can be provided by the application of four-axle (eight-wheel) forwarders equipped with wider tires and half-tracks on wheels of front and rear bogie axle of the vehicle. These results should be used as guidelines for purchasing forwarders, and such approach would provide in future ecoefficient timber forwarding under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils in <b>main</b> <b>felling</b> sites of lowland forests...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{extraction}} on {{steep slopes}} is usually operated by cable crane, but recently a modified forwarder {{has made its}} appearance in Austria. It consists of a usual forwarder equipped with a winch; once the cable of the winch is anchored on a tree or a stump, the machine can drive slopes up to 70 %. The present work concerns the analysis of productivity, costs and impact on the soil of a cable-forwarder, operating on a <b>main</b> <b>felling</b> in a coniferous stand. Trees were felled and crosscut by a tracked harvester; the cable-forwarder was covering the same corridors, hauling the logs to the forest road. For data collection and statistical analysis an established protocol has been adapted to the study. All variables and times have been collected on a total of 44 extraction cycles. Statistical analyses produced three models which have been combined in order to explain the productivity (m 3 /PSH 15) of the cable-forwarder in relation to different variables. Productivity increases according to the increment of the average volume of the loaded log and to the increase of the total payload. Contrarily, a long covered distance while loading, a long transportation distance and a steep slope of the corridor are variables which depress the productivity of the machine. Considering average conditions, the cable-forwarder is able to extract about 13 m 3 /h, with a calculated operative cost around 6 €/m 3, that {{is lower than the}} extraction cost when using a cable crane in comparable conditions...|$|E

40|$|Since 2013, new {{assortment}} tables {{have been}} adopted in the Republic of Belarus, and since 2015 new growth tables for pine, spruce, birch and aspen. Growth tables were compiled based on 1353 trial plots, where 2546 model trees were taken. New growth tables shows bigger values of forest inventory indicators comparing to modern normative tables: by average diameter, up to 20 – 30 % in young growth and 6 – 10 % at older age. The sums of cross-sectional areas and reserves at equal heights in new tables overestimate for pine and spruce for young and middle-aged stands by 6 – 10 %, and in older ages to 5 %. As a result, the relative abundances of pine and spruce forest stands {{at the age of}} 20 to 50 will decrease by approximately 10 %. This will lead to the fact that pine and spruce stands at the age of thinning, having a density of 0. 8, will be protected as having a fullness of 0. 7, which, in accordance with the rules of cutting the forest in Belarus, will lead to a reduction in thinning in pure stands. 5135 model trees were used for the development of assortment tables. In general, for all tree species, new table tables show a greater yield of commercial timber and valuable assortments comparing to the tables of F. P. Moiseenko by 3 – 7 %. The amount of large-scale commercial timber is lower according to the new tables than in the old ones. This is due to the decrease in the last 50 years of large trees in the <b>main</b> <b>felling</b> areas...|$|E

Analiza je provedena na primjeru srednje teškoga šestokotačnoga forvardera Valmet 840. 2, a obuhvatila je: 1) utjecaj smanjenja tereta na djelotvornost forvardera, 2) okolišnu pogodnost forvardera u uvjetima ograničene nosivosti tla temeljem nominalnoga tlaka na podlogu (Mellgren 1980) prednjih i stražnjih kotača vozila ovisno o masi utovarenoga drva, opremljenosti vozila užim (600 mm) i širim (710 mm) gumama, odnosno opremljenosti kotača stražnje (bogi) osovine gusjenicama. Granica je okolišne pogodnosti bilo dopušteno opterećenje tla ograničene nosivosti < 60 kPa (Owende i dr. 2002). Rezultati analize djelotvornosti izvoženja drva forvarderom pokazali su da je smanjenje tereta u uvjetima ograničene nosivosti glejnih tala, kao mjera koja osigurava kretnost vozila, ali i smanjenje razine oštećivanja šumskoga tla, izrazito neprihvatljiva zbog pada proizvodnosti i rasta jediničnih troškova. Iz analize je nominalnoga tlaka na podlogu ispod kotača prednje i kotača (gusjenica) stražnje osovine vidljivo da se u uvjetima ograničene nosivosti tla: 1) može iskoristiti nominalna nosivost forvardera te djelotvorno izvoziti drvo, 2) pri čemu će okolišnu pogodnost osigurati primjena četveroosovinskih (osmokotačnih) forvardera opremljenih širim gumama te polugusjenicama na kotačima prednje i stražnje bogi osovine vozila.

40|$|The {{level of}} forest {{mechanization}} in the Alpine area is slowly but constantly raising, {{in order to}} contrast the shortage of workforce and lower the operative costs.
