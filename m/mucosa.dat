40|$|It {{is assumed}} that before there are {{clinically}} verified signs of irritation, risk factors can cause changes on tissue, which {{was the subject of}} our research. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish how much ciggarete smoking, alcohol drinking and gender exerted influence on pathohistological changes on clinically healthy masticatory <b>mucosae.</b> Our results were based on anamnestic answers and pathohistological examination of biopsies from edentulous alveolar ridge of clinically healthy masticator <b>mucosae.</b> The sample consisted of 40 patients, of bouth gender. Conclusions are that smokers have, 25 % more chance of having pathohistologicaly verified hyperceratosis on masticatory <b>mucosae</b> than nonsmokers. There are no significant differences between sex in correlation with pathohistologicaly verified changes on masticatory <b>mucosae</b> which are caused by smoking. Persons who consume alcohol have a greater chance of having pathohistologicaly verified changes on masticatory <b>mucosae.</b> Persons who smoke ciggaretes and consume alcohol drinks are most likely, 50 % and more, to have pathohistologicaly verified hyperceratosis on masticatory <b>mucosae...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{significance}} of muscularis <b>mucosae</b> involvement in metastasis of urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma. Material and Method: This was a retrospective cohort study of superficial urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma). Histopathology and patient records of 192 patients were collected from 1990 to 2004. There were 115 males and 77 females, their age ranged from 43 to 83 years old {{with an average of}} 60 + 5 years. One hundred cases did not invade muscularis <b>mucosae</b> layer (group A) and 92 cases invaded the muscularis <b>mucosae</b> layer (group B). The histopathology of biopsy or cystectomy specimens for recurrence, progression of the disease and the number of vessels above and below the muscularis <b>mucosae</b> layer of bladder cancer specimens were compared by light microscopic examination with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and followed by immunoperoxidase desmin stain. Results: The amount per high power field of the blood and lymphatic vessels below muscularis <b>mucosae</b> layer, 9 (6 - 12), was significantly higher than that above muscularis <b>mucosae</b> layer, 7 (5 - 10) (p 2) in group B had also a significantly higher percentage than that in group A, 21. 4 : 4. 0 (p < 0. 05) ...|$|R

5|$|Psoriasis in {{the mouth}} is very rare, in {{contrast}} to lichen planus, another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and mouth. When psoriasis involves the oral <b>mucosa</b> (the lining of the mouth), it may be asymptomatic, but it may appear as white or grey-yellow plaques. Fissured tongue {{is the most common}} finding in those with oral psoriasis and has been reported to occur in 6.5–20% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin. The microscopic appearance of oral <b>mucosa</b> affected by geographic tongue (migratory stomatitis) is very similar to the appearance of psoriasis. However, modern studies have failed to demonstrate any link between the two conditions.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva {{surrounding}} a tooth has a 2–3mm band of bright pink, very strong attached <b>mucosa,</b> then a darker, larger area of unattached <b>mucosa</b> that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is {{needed to keep the}} implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva {{surrounding a}}n implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer biologic width).|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach <b>mucosa.</b> The <b>mucosa</b> of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E
40|$|Gut {{microbial}} dysbiosis {{contributes to}} the development of colorectal cancer (CRC).

We analyse the gut mucosal microbiome of 47 paired samples of adenoma and adenoma-adjacent <b>mucosae,</b> 52 paired samples of carcinoma and carcinoma-adjacent <b>mucosae</b> and 61 healthy controls. Probabilistic partitioning of relative abundance profiles reveals that a metacommunity predominated by members of the oral microbiome is primarily associated with CRC. Analysis of paired samples shows differences in community configurations between lesions and the adjacent <b>mucosae.</b> Correlations of bacterial taxa indicate early signs of dysbiosis in adenoma, and co-exclusive relationships are subsequently more common in cancer. We validate these alterations in CRC-associated microbiome by comparison with two previously published data sets. Our results suggest that a taxonomicall...|$|R

5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral <b>mucosa.</b> In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the <b>mucosa</b> and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E

40|$|ERas {{activation}} and GKN 2 {{reduction in}} gastric cancer has raised some notices in recent years, while nuclear beta-catenin positivity is {{considered as a}} tumoral marker. In this study, we compared immunohistochemistry of beta-catenin, GKN 2 and ERas on tumoral and non-tumoral <b>mucosae</b> of 50 gastric carcinomas and 13 gastric samples of cancer-free patients. Nuclear positivity of beta-catenin was strong in 31 non-tumoral <b>mucosae</b> (62 %) and 29 tumoral <b>mucosae</b> (58 %). It was absent in samples of cancer-free patients. There was a correlation between non-tumoral and tumoral zones for nuclear beta-catenin positivity (P= 0. 013). ERas was positive in 35 non-tumoral tissues (70 %) and 31 tumoral tissues (62 %) but negatvie in samples of cancer-free patients. It was weak and spotty in non-tumoral <b>mucosae</b> but strong and diffuse in tumors. Positivity of ERas was age-related (P= 0. 028). However it had background staining effect. GKN 2 was expressed in 33 non-tumoral <b>mucosae</b> (66 %) and 35 tumoral <b>mucosae</b> (70 %). Though GKN 2 staining was moderate to strong in non-tumoral tissues and was comparatively weaker in tumors, their difference was minimal and difficult to discern. Conclusions: Beta-catenin nuclear location could {{be considered as a}} paraneoplastic pattern which is considerably tumor-related. ERas may be a potential biomarker for gastric cancer, but advanced studies are wanted. GKN 2 reduction is indiscernible by immunostaining...|$|R
40|$|To avoid {{detrimental}} {{interactions with}} intestinal microbes, the human epithelium {{is covered with}} a protective mucus layer that traps host defence molecules. Microbial properties such as adhesion to mucus further result in a unique mucosal microbiota with a great potential to interact with the host. As mucosal microbes are difficult to study in vivo, we incorporated mucin-covered microcosms in a dynamic in vitro gut model, the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME). We assessed the importance of the mucosal environment in this M-SHIME (mucosal-SHIME) for the colonization of lactobacilli, a group for which the mucus binding domain was recently discovered. Whereas the two dominant resident Lactobacilli, Lactobacillus <b>mucosae</b> and Pediococcus acidilactici, were both present in the lumen, L. <b>mucosae</b> was strongly enriched in mucus. As a possible explanation, the gene encoding a mucus binding (mub) protein was detected by PCR in L. <b>mucosae.</b> Also the strongly adherent Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) specifically colonized mucus upon inoculation. Short-term assays confirmed the strong mucin-binding of both L. <b>mucosae</b> and LGG compared with P. acidilactici. The mucosal environment also increased long-term colonization of L. <b>mucosae</b> and enhanced its stability upon antibiotic treatment (tetracycline, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin). Incorporating a mucosal environment thus allowed colonization of specific microbes such as L. <b>mucosae</b> and LGG, in correspondence with the in vivo situation. This may lead to more in vivo-like microbial communities in such dynamic, long-term in vitro simulations and allow the study of the unique mucosal microbiota in health and disease...|$|R
