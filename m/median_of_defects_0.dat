40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> congenital <b>defects</b> and to investigate their maternal and perinatal associated aspects by reviewing Birth Certificates. Methods: Among all born alive infants from January 2003 to December 2007 in Maternidade da Santa Casa de Misericórdia of São Carlos, Southeast Brazil (12, 199 infants), cases {{were identified as}} the newborns whose Birth Certificates registered any congenital defect. The same sex neonate born immediately after the case was chosen as a control. In total, 13 variables were analyzed: six were maternal related, three represented labor and delivery conditions and four were linked to fetal status. The chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were {{used to compare the}} variables, being significant p< 0. 05. Results: The prevalence <b>of</b> congenital <b>defects</b> was <b>0.</b> 38 % and the association of two or more defects represented 32 % of all cases. The number of mothers whose education level was equal or less than eight years was significantly higher among the group with birth <b>defects</b> (p= <b>0.</b> 047). A higher frequency of prematurity (p< 0. 001) and cesarean delivery (p= 0. 004) was observed among children with birth defects. This group also showed lower birth weight and Apgar scores in the 1 st and the 5 th minute (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: The prevalence <b>of</b> congenital <b>defect</b> <b>of</b> <b>0.</b> 38 % is possibly due to underreporting.

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{studying}} defect level distributions in the bandgap of CdTe thin films, used for solar cell development. In particular, the effects of CdCl 2 treatment on the defect levels are the main objectives of this research. Four different CdTe thin films were electroplated using three different Cd-precursors (CdSO 4, Cd(NO 3) 2 and CdCl 2), and bulk CdTe wafers purchased from industry (Eagle Pitcher and University Wafers in US) were studied using low temperature photoluminescence. The finger prints <b>of</b> <b>defects,</b> <b>0.</b> 55 eV below the conduction band down to the valence band edge were investigated. In all of the CdTe layers, four electron trap levels were observed with varying intensities but at very similar energy positions, indicating that the origin <b>of</b> these <b>defects</b> are mainly from native defects. CdCl 2 treatment and annealing eliminates two defect levels and the mid-gap recombination centres are reduced drastically by this processing step. The optical bandgap of all four as-deposited CdTe layers is 1. 50 eV, and reduces to 1. 47 eV after CdCl 2 treatment. The material grown using the CdCl 2 precursor seems to produce CdTe material with the cleanest bandgap, most {{probably due to the}} built-in CdCl 2 treatment while growing the material...|$|R

The last technique was applied successfully {{for the first time in}} the case of amorphous silicon-based semiconductors. More diagnostics techniques were used for the investigation of the transformation of the semiconductor surface properties. In the a-Si:H based MOS structures prepared by PIII technology, only two groups <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> <b>0.</b> 82 and 1. 25 eV (D(z) and D(e), respectively) were found.

The only decisive parameter determining the formation of two groups of states is the negative potential of the sample during the implantation. In aSiGe:H based MOS structures, three distributions could be prepared by a bias annealing procedure: 0. 47, 0. 58 and 0. 95 eV corresponding to p-type (D(h)) intrinsic (D(z)) and n-type (D(e)) distributions, respectively...|$|R

The pipes were fatigued by alternately pumping hot and cold low oxygen water every four minutes through 304 stainless teel pipes. The rapid change in water temperature imparted a thermal shock to the inner wall of the pipe. The pipes were stepped to f ur different thicknesses to give four different values of thermal shock stress depending on thickness. The pipes were pressurized to 17. 2 MPa (2500 psi) and the temperature cycled between 38 °C (100 °F) and 343 °C (650 °F) in three seconds. This was followed by holding at 343 °C for 237 seconds and then quenching to 38 °C in three seconds followed by another 237 second hold period. Thermal cycling continued until significant cracking was detected on the inside surface of the pipes.
