5|$|A two-week work-in {{was held}} at the end of July and {{beginning}} of August 1980. Thirty-three volunteers worked on the mill over the work-in. Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at Bury St Edmunds. On 3 August 1980, the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a <b>mobile</b> <b>crane,</b> followed by the cap frame and the cast-iron curb sections.|$|E

The Vanaja brand ceased to exist in 1971, after which the former Vanaja factory produced Sisu terminal tractors, bus chassis, military vehicles and <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> chassis. The factory now belongs to Patriawhich produces Patria AMV armoured personnel carriersand heavy-vehicle axle producer Sisu Axles.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 work-ins {{took place}} from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August. The work planned {{included}} {{the completion of}} the brickwork {{at the top of the}} tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two factors}} that prevent {{engineers}} or technicians from setting detailed mobile plans. First, {{it is difficult}} and extremely time-consuming to consider the ground contact stability applied to <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b> Second, {{there is not enough}} of a systematic technique for analyzing a lot of data for stability review of candidates. There have been previous studies that investigated the selection of optimal cranes, taking into account the lifting capacity of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes</b> and transporting routes (Reddy and Koshy [2002]; Al-Hussein et al. [2001]; Tantisevi and Burcu [2007]). However, those previous studies did not include detailed stability reviews such as the soil bearing force and ground reinforcement. Therefore, this study intends to move beyond the limits of previous studies and develop automatic design algorithms for securing the ground contact stability of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b> The algorithms proposed in this study focus on the ground stability review process of <b>mobile</b> <b>cranes.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time as the rolling stock project, the {{construction}} of what became the Eurostar terminal at Waterloo main line station was being planned, requiring construction over a large area on the north side of the station, and burying the Armstrong Lift. Also, the carriages of the new rolling stock were significantly longer than those of the 1940 stock and could not be accommodated on the Armstrong Lift. Since its removal, vehicles have been craned in and out of the Waterloo depot by a <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> positioned near Spur Road.|$|E

25|$|In February 2009, a <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> {{and a small}} {{piling rig}} arrived on site. In early March 2009, the crane began putting steel beams into the ground, as part of {{preparations}} for {{the core of the}} building. Full construction began on 16 March 2009. Demolition work on New London Bridge House started in May 2009, as part of the concurrent London Bridge Place project. The first steelwork went into the Shard's piles on 28 April. Five cranes were used to build the Shard, with four of them 'jumping' with the tower as it rose. Crane 1 was erected in September 2009 and Crane 2 was erected at the beginning of October. By 20 October 2009, steel beams began appearing on site, with concrete being poured at {{the northern part of the}} site, ready for Crane 3.|$|E
500|$|Other work {{undertaken}} by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork, digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position. A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A [...] Ruston & Hornsby 4YHR diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base {{with the aid of}} a <b>mobile</b> <b>crane.</b> After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary.|$|E

2500|$|Lifting of the Roxburgh Branch {{commenced}} on Friday 14 June 1968 {{with work}} trains hauled by DJ locomotives subsequently running {{all the way}} into Roxburgh. [...] This was the first time DJ locomotives had operated to Roxburgh. [...] By late June 1968 there was considerable removed material at Roxburgh yard ready for loading out by train. Hut accommodation for demolition workers, removal equipment such as bulldozers and a <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> on crawlers were transported to Roxburgh by a DJ hauled train on 2 July 1968. A temporary railway Hut compound was established on the Roxburgh station platform for the accommodation of some of the demolition men. [...] Mains power to the Huts, which were individually wired for electricity, was sourced from the electric power lines at Roxburgh station yard. The idea was that these temporary Huts were to be railed down to Millers Flat as the next demolition base just before the main line rail track had been fully removed from Roxburgh. At the time there was some significant concern reported in the media (and up to Ministerial level) as to why these men had been not able to use the Roxburgh Railway houses, which by now were mostly empty, rather than the expense of establishing the temporary railway workers Hut compound at Roxburgh. However, as explained by Railways at the time, this was impractical as the Huts would be needed anyway as demolition progressed further down the line and so portable accommodation was optimum and in the long run cheaper than furnishing railway houses at Roxburgh for temporary demolition gangs that would be there a few short weeks. By 19 July 1968, the yard track, main line track past the station platform [...] and turntable at Roxburgh had been removed and cleared out. [...] Men had been recruited from Winter Employment schemes and the <b>mobile</b> <b>crane</b> lifted complete track sets onto flat top wagons for transporting out. During demolition DSA class locomotives worked at the railhead shuttling empty and loaded wagons from and to the nearest exchange siding (the nearest intact station yard) on the branch whilst DJ locomotives periodically cleared out materials removed from that nearest railhead back down the branch to the Main South Line as removal progressed. Track sets were railed to either of Manuka station further down the branch for temporary storage or to Kakapuaka station south of Balclutha on the Main South Line where further Winter Employment Scheme men were employed dismantling these removed track sets. [...] By mid November 1968 removal was approaching the 40 mile peg, about five miles north of Beaumont (in the Beaumont gorge between Craig Flat and Beaumont). Work then ceased due to a labour shortage as seasonal workers went back to work in local freezing works. A weed spray train ran as far as Beaumont on Monday 11 November 1968, which by then has its all train stop board at 34 miles 37 chains, between Craigellachie and Beaumont (the line from here to the end of rails near the 40 mile peg being worked as an extended Way and Works siding). [...] Through the New Zealand summer of 1969 the line was effectively still complete to the forty mile peg, about five miles past Beaumont up the Beaumont Gorge. [...] Further back up the line, by February 1969 it was reported that the Roxburgh station was derelict without a window left in place and the goods shed was being demolished. Millers Flat station at the time though was still well preserved, {{to be used as a}} temporary hotel for a while due to the towns official one burning down.|$|E
