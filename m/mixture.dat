40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{composition}} of engineered soil media largely determines the stormwater treatment efficiency of urban bioretention basins. Laboratory flow‐through experiments {{were conducted to}} quantify infiltration, bulk density, and moisture holding capacity {{as a function of}} different composite <b>mixtures</b> of sand, soil, and compost, and to assess the effect of compaction on bulk density, moisture holding capacity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Eleven <b>mixtures</b> were evaluated that varied in volumetric proportions of sand (30 % to 70 %), sandy or silt loam soil (0 % or 20 %), and organic compost (20 % to 70 %). Steady‐state infiltration rates were high for all <b>mixtures,</b> ranging from 87 to 178 cm h- 1, and followed the order of <b>mixtures</b> containing sand and compost only> <b>mixtures</b> containing sand, compost, and sandy soil> <b>mixtures</b> containing sand, compost, and silt loam soil. Infiltration rates for <b>mixtures</b> containing sand and compost only and <b>mixtures</b> containing sand, compost, and sandy soil exhibited a significant linear relationship with the ratio of sand to compost. Bulk density of the <b>mixtures</b> was inversely related to the proportion of compost and followed the order of <b>mixtures</b> containing sand, compost, and silt loam soil> <b>mixtures</b> containing sand, compost, and sandy soil> <b>mixtures</b> containing sand and compost only.
