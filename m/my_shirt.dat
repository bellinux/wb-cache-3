500|$|Lautner {{has stated}} {{that he does not}} want to be just known for his looks, as some have {{attributed}} his popularity to that and not his actual acting skill.

[...] Lautner later said he would not bare his chest for any role that did not call for it. In June 2010, Lautner covered GQ magazine. The actor was lampooned in conservative writer Laura Ingraham's satirical The Obama Diaries, commenting to have Lautner as a mascot for the White House Easter Egg Roll, to fit their health-conscious theme, and have Lautner don a furry bunny head and appear shirtless. In 2010, Lautner was ranked number two on Glamours [...] "50 Sexiest Men of 2010 [...] " [...] list. Men's Health ranked him at third on their list of [...] "Top 10 Summer Bodies."

Warne reacted angrily to this when he was later bowling to Samuels himself; he continuously sledged Samuels, asking if he was going [...] "grab hold of <b>my</b> <b>shirt</b> too, Marlon?" [...] The incident escalated when Warne, appearing to attempt to throw the ball to the wicket-keeper, tossed it gently at Samuels, who responded by throwing his bat in Warne's direction. This led to an angry confrontation between the two mid-pitch. Both players were suspended, but Samuels missed the rest of the BBL season in any case, as he received an injury due to a bouncer from Lasith Malinga in the same game.
