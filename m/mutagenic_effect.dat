25|$|It is {{not clear}} how the cell determines the {{locations}} of de novo DNA methylation, but evidence suggests that, for many (though not all) locations, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is involved. In RdDM, specific RNA transcripts are produced from a genomic DNA template, and this RNA forms secondary structures called double-stranded RNA molecules. The double-stranded RNAs, through either the small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) pathways direct de-novo DNA methylation of the original genomic location that produced the RNA. This sort of mechanism is thought to be important in cellular defense against RNA viruses and/or transposons, both of which often form a double-stranded RNA that can be mutagenic to the host genome. By methylating their genomic locations, through an as yet poorly understood mechanism, they are shut off and are no longer active in the cell, protecting the genome from their <b>mutagenic</b> <b>effect.</b> Recently, it was described that methylation of the DNA is the main determinant of embryogenic cultures formation from explants in woody plants and is regarded the main mechanism that explains the poor response of mature explants to somatic embryogenesis in the plants (Isah 2016).|$|E

40|$|AbstractCytotoxic and <b>mutagenic</b> <b>effects</b> of {{thirteen}} commercial herbal mixtures sold in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were evaluated using the {{neutral red uptake}} (NRU) assay and the Ames test. The herbal mixtures tested included Umzimba omubi, Umuthi wekukhwehlela ne zilonda, Mvusa ukunzi, Umpatisa inkosi, Imbiza ephuzwato, Vusa umzimba, Ingwe® muthi mixture, Ibhubezi™, Supreme one hundred™, Sejeso herbal mixture Ingwe®, Lion izifozonke Ingwe®, Stameta™ BODicare® and Ingwe® special muti. The relative cytotoxicity of the herbal mixtures was established by determining their NI 50 values (50 % inhibition of neutral red uptake). The test revealed that the most toxic herbal mixture was Umpatisa inkosi with an NI 50 value of 0. 016 mg/mL and the least toxic mixture was Stameta™ BODicare® with an NI 50 value of 28. 00 mg/mL. The herbal mixtures showed no <b>mutagenic</b> <b>effects</b> against Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 102, TA 1535 and TA 1537 when the assay was done without S 9 metabolic activation.

Umpatisa inkosi also exhibited weak mutagenic activity against TA 1535 after metabolic activation.

The cytotoxic and mutagenic results reported here offer a step toward determining the safety of commercial herbal mixtures in South Africa.

50|$|Mutagens {{can cause}} {{changes to the}} DNA and are {{therefore}} genotoxic. They can affect the transcription and replication of the DNA, which in severe cases can lead to cell death. The mutagen produces mutations in the DNA, and deleterious mutation can result in aberrant, impaired or loss of function for a particular gene, and accumulation of mutations may lead to cancer. Mutagens may therefore be also carcinogens.

40|$|The {{disruption}} of ung, the unique uracil-DNA-glycosylase-encoding gene in Bacillus subtilis, slightly increased the spontaneous mutation frequency to rifampin resistance (Rifr), suggesting that additional repair pathways counteract the <b>mutagenic</b> <b>effects</b> of uracil in this microorganism. An alternative excision repair pathway {{is involved in}} this process, as the loss of YwqL, a putative endonuclease V homolog, significantly increased the mutation frequency of the ung null mutant, suggesting that Ung and YwqL both reduce the <b>mutagenic</b> <b>effects</b> of base deamination. Consistent with this notion, sodium bisulfite (SB) increased the Rifr mutation frequency of the single ung and double ung ywqL strains, {{and the absence of}} Ung and/or YwqL decreased the ability of B. subtilis to eliminate uracil from DNA. Interestingly, the Rifr mutation frequency of single ung and mutSL (mismatch repair [MMR] system) mutants was dramatically increased in a ung knockout strain that was also deficient in MutSL, suggesting that the MMR pathway also counteracts the <b>mutagenic</b> <b>effects</b> of uracil. Since the mutation frequency of the ung mutSL strain was significantly increased by SB, in addition to Ung, the <b>mutagenic</b> <b>effects</b> promoted by base deamination in growing B. subtilis cells are prevented not only by YwqL but also by MMR. Importantly, in nondividing cells of B. subtilis, the accumulations of mutations in three chromosomal alleles were significantly diminished following the {{disruption of}} ung and ywqL. Thus, under conditions of nutritional stress, the processing of deaminated bases in B. subtilis may normally occur in an error-prone manner to promote adaptive mutagenesis...|$|R
