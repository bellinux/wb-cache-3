In addition in some nuclear stations the turbine generator can power the station's house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars {{before they reach the}} step-up transformer (these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard). Even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible. Nuclear power stations are equipped with emergency power.|$|E
2500|$|WDM {{systems are}} divided into three {{different}} wavelength patterns, normal (WDM), coarse (CWDM) [...] and dense (DWDM). [...] Normal WDM (sometimes called BWDM) uses the two normal wavelengths 1310 and 1550 on one fiber. Coarse WDM provides up to 16 channels across <b>multiple</b> <b>transmission</b> windows of silica fibers. Dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) uses the C-Band (1530nm-1565nm) transmission window but with denser channel spacing. Channel plans vary, but a typical DWDM system would use 40 channels at 100GHz spacing or 80 channels with 50GHz spacing. Some technologies are capable of 12.5GHz spacing (sometimes called ultra dense WDM). New amplification options (Raman amplification) enable {{the extension of the}} usable wavelengths to the L-band (1565nm-1625nm), more or less doubling these numbers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this work}} {{we present a}} simple, but {{effective}} method of enhancing and exploiting diversity from <b>multiple</b> packet <b>transmissions</b> in systems that employ nonbinary linear modulations such as PSK and QAM. This diversity improvement results from redesigning the symbol mapping for each packet transmission. Using a general framework for evaluating the upper bound of bit error rate (BER) with <b>multiple</b> <b>transmissions,</b> a criterion to obtain optimal symbol mappings is attained. The optimal adaptation scheme reduces to solving the well known Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). Symbol mapping adaptation only requires a small increase in receiver complexity but provides very substantial BER gains when applied to flatfading channels. I...|$|R

The more competent the host immune system, the less chance {{there is for}} the parasite to survive. It may require <b>multiple</b> <b>transmission</b> events to find a suitably vulnerable host. During this time, the invader is dependent upon the survival of its current host. For this reason virulence thrives in a community with prevalent immune dysfunction and poor nutrition. Virulence weakens in a healthy population and as hosts acquire resistance. Good hygiene, nutrition and sanitation are all effective strategies against virulence.|$|E
