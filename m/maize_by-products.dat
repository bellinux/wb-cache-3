30|$|To our knowledge, this {{is first}} report that ZENC has been {{expressed}} in P. pastoris using high-density fermentation {{and applied to}} reduce the amount of ZEN from ZEN-containing materials such as maize and its by-products. We explored the effect of ZEN degradation by adding recombinant enzyme into DDGS, <b>maize</b> <b>by-products</b> and corn bran. High concentrations of ZEN are commonly reported in maize ingredients, and this limits their practical use. After the pretreatment with ZENC, the final ZEN concentrations in DDGS, maize byproducts and corn bran were 92  μg/kg, 416  μg/kg and 113  μg/kg, respectively. The maize was contaminated by the Fusarium existed in soil during the growing process, and the most of zearalenone was distributed on the surface of the corn. The degrading effect of corn bran was better than that of DDGS or <b>maize</b> <b>by-products.</b> We proposed that the high concentration of zearalenone and the simple ingredient contribute to the degrading effect of corn bran. The DDGS and <b>maize</b> <b>by-products</b> are products produced from maize, and the ingredients of DDGS and <b>maize</b> <b>by-products</b> are complex. These complex ingredient may coating the corn bran then inhibiting ZENC to reach the zearalenone, so the degrading performance of DDGS or <b>maize</b> <b>by-products</b> was not as good as that of corn bran. The maximum limits for ZEN in food and feeds differ in various countries. For example, the limit is 100  μg/kg for cereals and derived products in Italy, 1000  μg/kg for compound feeds in Japan, and 50  μg/kg for cereal products in France (Zinedine et al. 2007). Our results demonstrate that ZENC is a promising enzyme used as an additive in the food and animal feed industries, especially in corn processing. P. pastoris is suitable for expressing ZENC, which has promising pH and thermostability for industrial application.|$|E

Helping farmers lose less of their crops will be {{a key factor in}} promoting food security. In addition to pesticides GM crops {{will continue to be a}} vital tool in the diverse range of technologies that can maintain and improve living standards for the people of the world. The EU is dependent for 65 % on imports of protein-rich feedstuffs for which there are no substitutes in the short term. The EU livestock sector uses imported soybean, soybean meal and <b>maize</b> <b>by-products</b> as animal feed. Without an adequate supply of these feed ingredients, the EU’s livestock production will loose competitiveness. However, demands from the EU differ to those from third countries with respect to the GM va rieties grown, and wh at are authorised for import into the EU. The risk that supplies of soya products and <b>maize</b> <b>by-products</b> could be affected by the low-level presence of non-EU approved GM material has not been fully resolved as the EU has allowed just a 0. 1 % tolerance for this plus 0. 05 % tolerance for measuring uncertainty. This could cause supply problems for the animal feed industry, and ultimately supply of food to consumers. The importance of the EU market and EU requirements for the major soybean and maize exporter countries is declining over time and it is be coming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain a non-GM supply chain in the EU. Food companies and supermar kets will struggle to stay GM-free. EU member states dependent on imports will be forced to deal with more GM presence in their chain. Market forces are forcing governments to authorize products more efficiently, develop tolerance policies or tolerate unapproved varieties in their imports. </p...|$|E

40|$|Aquaculture feed {{manufacturers}} and producers increasingly {{recognize the importance}} of mycotoxins, which contaminate plant-based meals used in compound aquafeeds, and their potential to negatively impact production. Though data on the worldwide occurrence of legislated mycotoxins e. g., trichothecenes and zearalenone (ZEN) are well documented, relatively little information is available regarding other mycotoxins also produced by Fusarium, notably moniliformin (MON). Given that MON is known to affect the survival, growth, skeletal formation and bone mineralization in terrestrial species, its widespread occurrence on maize and <b>maize</b> <b>by-products</b> typically used in aquaculture makes it relevant to study these parameters in teleost fish. In the present work we have tested the effect of MON exposure on survival, bone development and mineralization using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model species and fish derived osteo-chondroprogenitor cell line for in vitro studies. Moniliformin exposure did not decrease bone mineralization in zebrafish larvae or extracellular matrix mineralization in the mineralogenic cell line VSa 13. Here, the minimal in vitro cytotoxicity concentration was found to be 1000 µg L− 1 MON. Incidence of deformities was also not altered by MON at the concentration tested (450 µg L− 1) although larval growth was affected, as shown by a decrease in the standard length of exposed specimens at 20 days post fertilization. Survival decreased significantly in larvae exposed to MON concentrations higher than 900 μg L− 1. Influence of MON on survival and growth might be relevant for aquaculture industry. As MON is a water-soluble mycotoxin, its leaching from feed is highly probable, so MON assimilation into the surrounding aqueous environment should also be considered. Tested levels in fish larvae are within the reported occurrence levels of MON in commercial feed and plant meals...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} ileal digestibility of {{amino acids}} in eight feed ingredients were determined using broilers and layers. The ingredients included three cereals (wheat, sorghum and <b>maize),</b> one cereal <b>by-product</b> (wheat middlings), three oilseed meals (canola, cottonseed and soybean meals) and one animal protein meal (meat and bone meal). Dietary protein in the assay diets was supplied solely by the test ingredient. All diets contained 20 g kg- 1 acid-insoluble ash as an indigestible marker, and each diet was offered ad libitum in mash form to five replicate pens of 42 -day-old broilers and 60 -week-old layers. The digestibility coefficients of most amino acids for wheat and sorghum were similar (P > 0. 05) in broilers and layers. The digestibility of most amino acids for maize was higher (P 0. 05) between broilers and layers. The influence of class of bird on digestibility in canola meal was variable. The digestibility of threonine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid and alanine were higher (P < 0. 05), {{and those of}} methionine, histidine and lysine were lower (P < 0. 05) in broilers compared to layers.

40|$|Specific {{knowledge}} of the nutritive value of raw materials is fundamental to formulate balanced diets for rabbits and allows greater use of by-products and non-conventional feedstuffs. This paper examines the feeding value of sun-dried brewers’ grain and maize silage (whole plant) for fattening rabbits. Twenty-four individually caged 8 -wk-old rabbits {{were used to determine}} the digestibility. Both wet products were sun-dried and ground before being incorporated into a basal diet. The inclusion level at the expense of all basal ingredients amounted to 30 %. Basal diet and both experimental diets were fed ad libitum to 8 rabbits during the 4 -d balance trial. The determined digestibility of protein, fat, crude fibre and neutral detergent fibre digestibility amounted to 76. 2 and 77. 2 %; 86. 5 and 99. 1 %; 8. 1 and 8. 3 % and 28. 0 and 13. 5 %, respectively, for brewers’ grain and maize silage.

40|$|The {{quest to}} broaden the narrow range of feed {{ingredients}} available to pig producers has prompted research {{on the use of}} low cost, unconventional feedstuffs, which are typically fibrous and abundant. <b>Maize</b> cobs, a <b>by-product</b> of a major cereal grown worldwide, have potential {{to be used as a}} pig feed ingredient. Presently, maize cobs are either dumped or burnt for fuel. The major challenge in using maize cobs in pig diets is their lignocellulosic nature (45 % to 55 % cellulose, 25 % to 35 % hemicellulose, and 20 % to 30 % lignin) which is resistant to pigs’ digestive enzymes. The high fiber in maize cobs (930 g neutral detergent fiber/kg dry matter [DM]; 573 g acid detergent fiber/kg DM) increases rate of passage and sequestration of nutrients in the fiber reducing their digestion. However, grinding, heating and fermentation can modify the structure of the fibrous components in the maize cobs and improve their utilization. Pigs can also extract up to 25 % of energy maintenance requirements from fermentation products. In addition, dietary fiber improves pig intestinal health by promoting the growth of lactic acid bacteria, which suppress proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in the intestines. This paper reviews maize cob composition and the effect on digestibility of nutrients, intestinal microflora and growth performance and proposes the use of ensiling using exogenous enzymes to enhance utilization in diets of pigs...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{increase in}} use of maize-based feedstuffs in California dairy cow rations has raised concerns of reduced efficiency of CP utilization {{due to the}} low lysine content of maize and <b>maize</b> <b>by-products.</b> The objectives of this research were to determine the impact of increased dietary maize CP levels on animal performance using three metabolic models of dairy cows in order to predict limiting AA’s in California dairy rations to identify a ruminally protected AA package to supplement similar rations. Since lysine was the most consistently predicted limiting AA among dairies, and metabolic models, the dairy with the ration calculated {{to be the most}} limiting in lysine was chosen to determine effects of feeding an RPL product on milk production and composition, as well as on N balance. Nutrient profiles of 16 high multiparity cow rations were evaluated and limiting AA predicted by the metabolic models Amino Cow, CPM Dairy and Shield. Higher inclusion levels of maize products in rations increased the contribution of maize CP to the total CP content of the TMR, to between 20 – 40 %, but had no impact on cow performance. Even though the lysine to methionine ratio decreased as more maize CP was included in the TMR, it did not {{have a major impact on}} the final predicted AA profile of MP, or milk component levels, but, according to Shield, it had an effect on milk yield. Methionine, isoleucine and lysine were predicted to be most limiting according to Amino Cow, CPM Dairy and Shield respectively. The models suggested three dramatically different AA packages but the high degree of consistency within model in predicting the limiting AA sequence among dairies, suggest that there may be sufficient consistency in the nutrient profiles among rations to support production of a ruminally protected AA complex. The second experiment used a double (i. e., early and mid-lactation multiparity dairy cows) 2 x 2 factorial with 28 day experimental periods. Feeding the RPL, with estimated rumen escape of lysine between 18 and 23 % suggesting an increased intestinal absorption of lysine between 8 and 22 g/d/cow, did not influence DMI or milk, true protein and lactose yields. Milk fat yield and concentration decreased, while MUN percentages increased when RPL was fed. Blood plasma levels of almost all AA’s, except lysine, decreased when RPL was fed, suggesting that lysine was the limiting AA and that its supplementation led to increased absorption and utilization of other AA. The lack of response in milk protein synthesis and the decrease in plasma 3 -MH concentrations when RPL was fed suggests that muscle protein synthesis was stimulated, and degradation reduced, with RPL feeding. It is possible that lysine had an effect, either directly or indirectly, on muscle protein turnover and energy metabolism that, impacted intakes, metabolism and absorption of AA and milk production in mid lactation cows, but it had no major impact on early lactation cows.

40|$|Background: In Pakistan and {{all over}} the world white meat {{consumption}} has increased during the last few decades. The cost of poultry feed and fish is quite high. To over come this problem a lot of research work has been done to replace high cost feed ingredients with low cost fruit by-products. This study has been carried out on the inclusion of apple by-products in poultry feed. Methods: One Hundred one day old broiler chicks purchased from the local breeders were reared in the poultry farm of the Physiology department of University of Karachi. They were divided into two groups A and B. The feed of group A contained maize in addition to other ingredients, whereas the feed of group B substituted <b>maize</b> with apple <b>by-products.</b> Feed consumed, water intake, weight gained, Feed Conversion Ration (FCR) and mortality was recorded daily. Both the groups were also vaccinated with only ND and IBD. The performance of broilers on this feed was monitored and compared between conventional feed and apple by-products mixed feed. Results: Both the groups of birds gained appropriate weight required to be marketed at the end of 6 weeks. Group B compared to Group A gained more live weight. Although there was a difference of 320 gm between live weight of the two groups. Statistical analysis shows this difference to be non-significant. Conclusion: We conclude that apple by-products are a cost effective yet equally good feed adjunct for broiler chicks...|$|R
40|$|Poultry can {{be managed}} under {{different}} feeding systems, depending on the husbandry skills and the feed available. These systems include the following: (1) a complete dry feed offered as a mash ad libitum; (2) the same feed offered as pellets or crumbles ad libitum; (3) a complete feed with added whole grain; (4) a complete wet feed given {{once or twice a}} day; (5) a complete feed offered on a restricted basis; (6) choice feeding. Of all these, an interesting alternative to offering complete diets is choice feeding which can be applied on both a small or large commercial scale. Under choice feeding or free-choice feeding birds are usually offered a choice between three types of feedstuffs: (a) an energy source (e. g. maize, rice bran, sorghum or wheat); (b) a protein source (e. g. soyabean meal, meat meal, fish meal or coconut meal) plus vitamins and minerals and (c), in the case of laying hens, calcium in granular form (i. e. oyster-shell grit). This system differs from the modern commercial practice of offering a complete diet comprising energy and protein sources, ground and mixed together. Under the complete diet system, birds are mainly only able to exercise their appetite for energy. When the environmental temperature varies, the birds either over- or under-consume protein and calcium. The basic principle behind practising choice feeding with laying hens is that individual hens are able to select from the various feed ingredients on offer and compose their own diet, according to their actual needs and production capacity. A choice-feeding system is of particular importance to small poultry producers in developing countries, such as Indonesia, because it can substantially reduce the cost of feed. The system is flexible and can be constructed {{in such a way that}} the various needs of a flock of different breeds, including village chickens, under different climates can be met. The system also offers a more effective way to use home-produced grain, such as <b>maize,</b> and <b>by-products,</b> such as rice bran, in developing countries. Because oyster-shell grit is readily available in developing countries at lower cost than limestone, the use of cheaper oyster-shell grit can further benefit small-holders in these countries. These benefits apart, simpler equipment suffices when designing and building a feed mixer on the farm, and transport costs are lower. If whole (unground) grain is used, the intake of which is accompanied by increased efficiency of feed utilisation, the costs of grinding, mixing and many of the handling procedures associated with mash and pellet preparation are eliminated. The choice feedstuffs can all be offered in the current feed distribution systems, either by mixing the ingredients first or by using a bulk bin divided into three compartments...|$|R

This study, which objective was to find out the socio-economic factors that may affect the usage of these resources, permitted to show, through interviews and surveys, that more than 8, 200 t of agro-industrial <b>by-products</b> (<b>maize</b> and wheat bran, soybean seed and maize seed cake) useable for cattle feeding were produced annually in Adamawa and that only 16 % of this production were used by livestock farmers. Among the {{factors affecting}} the effective use of these by-products, prices were the most determinant. The herds size and the number of sedentary animals had also shown a significant positive effect. On the other hand, livestock farming experience and the farmer’s age had instead shown a strong negative correlation with the use of by-products; same was the level of farmer’s education which showed positive correlation only with respect to cotton seed cake use. The distance from the livestock farming sites to the by-products production/distribution centre and/or difficult access to the sites had strong positive correlations with the by-products’ prices. The problem of supplies as a result of long distance or of difficult access to cattle production sites, the high and unstable prices of agro-industrial by-products and poor awareness of the different types of by-products produced in the Adamawa, were noted as major constraints for their use as cattle feed. Based on the above results, an effective extension system and well organized farmers groupings could improve the level of utilization of agro-industrial by-products for cattle feeding...|$|R

Six iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous diets were formulated (ME= 2900 kcal/kg and crude protein= 15. 20 g/ 100 g diet) based on the catalogue of Hy-line. The experiment was conducted as a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments including three replacement levels (0, 50, and 100 %) of corn with dried bakery byproduct replacement) and enzyme supplementation (0 and 0. 06 g/ 100 g diet of Hemicell®, a commercial ?-mannanase-based cocktail enzyme product). Each of 6 experimental diet fed hens in 5 replicates with 6 birds per each replicate (cage). The hens? performance including hen-day egg production% (EP), egg weight (EW) and feed intake (FI) was measured for 4 weeks and egg mass (EM, g/hen/day) as well as feed conversion ratio (FCR, g feed: g egg) was calculated. The data was analyzed based on completely randomized design using GLM procedure of SAS. Replacing dietary corn with BB had no significant effect on egg production (%), except in week 2. Egg production in group of 100 % corn-replacement in week 2 was lower than the other dietary groups. However, the overall EP for weeks 1 - 4 was not significantly affected by replacing dietary corn with BB. In addition, EM and FCR were not significantly affected by dietary treatment. Egg weight was affected by dietary cornreplacement in weeks 1 and 2; however, no significant difference was found in weeks 3 and 4. Egg quality characteristics were not affected by dietary treatment. Enzyme supplementation had no significant effect on performance of hens and egg quality traits. From the results of this experiment it can be concluded that dietary corn can be totally replaced with bakery by-products with no adverse effect on performance and egg quality. In addition, ?-mannanase has no beneficial effect on performance of hens fed on corn- or bakery by-productbased diets...|$|R
