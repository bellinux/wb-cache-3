Edward P.

To facilitate the Flemingdon Park development, located south-east of Don <b>Mills</b> Road and Eglinton, the entire planned route south of Lawrence to the present interchange at Don <b>Mills</b> Road was moved east to its current alignment.|$|E

5|$|Between Bow Bridge and Channelsea Bridge {{there were}} three others, said in 1303 to have been built to fill the gaps caused by the cutting of mill streams through Maud's causeway, {{although}} {{there is evidence that}} the <b>mills</b> pre-dated the causeway. However, the mill owners took responsibility for the bridges, which crossed the mill streams for St Thomas's, Spileman's and Saynes <b>mills.</b> The last two were owned by the City of London, and the bridges were called Pegshole and St Michael's Bridges. An administrative mistake around 1814 resulted in the City of London taking responsibility for St Thomas's Bridge, but the miller did not complain as Pegshole bridge was smaller and therefore less costly to maintain. The names were eventually swapped, and all three were replaced by Groves Bridge in 1933, which crossed the widened Three <b>Mills</b> Wall River, the two branches of the Waterworks River having been combined into Three <b>Mills</b> Wall River, while Three <b>Mills</b> Wall Back River was filled in.|$|E

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution the Welsh woollen {{industry}} {{was slow to}} mechanize compared to the <b>mills</b> of northern England.

Local hand-produced specialities included striped cotton ticks, checks, Nankeens and Camrays. Two cotton <b>mills</b> are visible on the 1845 Ordnance Survey map of the area.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a PCD (polycrystalline diamond) end <b>mill</b> {{with a new}} staggered structure for the <b>milling</b> of CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced plastic). The magnitude and direction of cutting force is decreased and changed by side-edge re-configuration of the structure. The flute and insert pocket of the staggered PCD end <b>mill</b> are designed considering the tool’s stiffness and welding process. The <b>milling</b> process and machining defects of the staggered PCD end <b>mill</b> are analyzed, and the structural parameters of the staggered PCD end <b>mill</b> are determined. The staggered PCD end <b>mill</b> is fabricated {{by the process of}} wire cutting, NC (Numerical Control) machining, high-frequency induction brazing, welding, grinding and passivation. <b>Milling</b> tests of multidirectional CFRP with the staggered PCD end <b>mill</b> is conducted on CNC (Computerized Numerical Control) <b>milling</b> machine. The <b>milling</b> force is measured by a dynamometer. A range analysis of the numerical results of <b>milling</b> force is conducted after <b>milling</b> test, and the influence of <b>milling</b> parameters on <b>milling</b> force is analyzed. A regression model of the <b>milling</b> force is built and verified by experiment. The effects of fiber cutting angle on <b>milling</b> force are obtained through <b>milling</b> CFRP with different fiber orientation angles...|$|R
