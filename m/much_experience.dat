In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had <b>much</b> <b>experience</b> of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E

McCudden had already flown 100 hours as a passenger with 25 different pilots including 46 hours as a regular observer since November 1915 and had <b>much</b> <b>experience</b> with his surroundings. His instructor was impressed with his grasp of the mechanics and theory. He practiced six landings and progressed to the more powerful Avro 504 as the last Farman had been written off by another student.|$|E

5|$|On 6 October 1939, Morshead was {{selected}} by Blamey to command the 18th Infantry Brigade in the new 6th Division. This brigade was composed of four battalions from the smaller states, {{and would have been}} a natural assignment for a regular officer had Prime Minister Robert Menzies not restricted commands to senior posts to Militia officers, few of whom had <b>much</b> <b>experience</b> of the Army outside their home states. Morshead met with Blamey on 13 October to select officers for the new brigade. Like the other brigadiers, he was given a regular officer as brigade major, in this case Major Ragnar Garrett.|$|E
5|$|In {{adopting}} Christianity as {{the state}} religion, Mieszko sought to achieve several personal goals. He saw Poland's baptism {{as a way of}} strengthening his hold on power, as well as using it as a unifying force for the Polish people. It replaced several smaller cults with a single, central one, clearly associated with the royal court. It would also improve the position and respectability of the Polish state on the international, European scene. The Church also helped to strengthen the monarch's authority, and brought to Poland <b>much</b> <b>experience</b> with regard to state administration. Thus, the Church organisation supported the state, and in return, bishops received important government titles (in the later era, they were members of the Senate of Poland).|$|E
5|$|On 21 September 2005 in the League Cup second round, Rehman scored {{his only}} goal for Fulham, opening a 5–4 extra-time win over Lincoln City at Craven Cottage by heading in Heiðar Helguson's cross. In January 2006 he signed for Championship club Norwich City on loan {{for the rest}} of the season as {{defensive}} cover for the club. He made five starts for them. Having made 30 appearances in all competitions for Fulham, 26 from the starting line-up and four as a substitute, Rehman had to consider his options if he was to get regular football. Although he had two years remaining on his contract, he wanted to play regular first team football, and as a result, he decided to spend the next two seasons getting as <b>much</b> <b>experience</b> as possible.|$|E

But for all this, from a want of consideration not uncommon among young ladies who are not <b>much</b> <b>experienced</b> in the world, she was a very uncomfortable travelling companion.|$|R

5|$|Employment {{in public}} {{transport}} aviation {{was difficult to}} find in 1931, but Koch was able to continue flying with the Citizen Air Force at No. 1 Squadron, Laverton. He flew as second pilot without pay for Australian National Airways in 1931, to gain experience, and was lucky not to be aboard the ill-fated Southern Cloud, when family commitments prevented him taking his position. In mid-1933 he was appointed instructor with the Australian Aero Club, based at Essendon Aerodrome. In November 1933, he was recruited by Guinea Airways as an aircraft captain, and was {{to spend the next}} five years in Papua and New Guinea. He flew the Junkers W 34, the Junkers G 31, and the Ford Tri-Motor during this time, gaining <b>much</b> <b>experience</b> with sea operations when the W34 was float equipped. He gained some fame from his efforts to deliver supplies to the second (1936–37) Archbold Expedition. The expedition had become isolated when its own aircraft was accidentally destroyed in Port Moresby harbour, and was thought to be camped in the Blucher Mountains near the headwaters of the Strickland River, low on supplies and without fuel for its generators. Koch, operating out of Mt Hagen in a Ford fitted with long range tanks, found the party and resupplied it by parachute with food and gasoline. Among his many photographs taken during this period are several of the last known days of Amelia Earhart at Lae aerodrome. He married Clarice Grant on 1 June 1933, in Melbourne; the couple were to have a daughter and two sons.|$|E
