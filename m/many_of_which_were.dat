5|$|A 2002 {{article in}} BusinessWeek {{said that a}} series of {{bankruptcies}} of McKinsey clients, such as Swissair, Kmart, and Global Crossing, in the 1990s raised questions as to whether McKinsey was responsible or had a lapse in judgement. McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating costs in its home country by developing partnerships with airlines based in other regions. In order to attract partners, Swissair acquired more than $1 billion in shares of other airlines, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>were</b> failing. This led to huge losses for Swissair.|$|E

5|$|English {{biologist}} Thomas Henry Huxley reconsidered {{the fish}} scales described by Agassiz and considered them {{to belong to}} a crocodilian. He first proposed this to the Geological Society of London in 1858, and went into more detail in an 1875 paper in the society's quarterly journal. By this time, new material had been uncovered from Elgin that indicated that Stagonolepis was not a fish, but a reptile. However, Stagonolepis was still known primarily by scutes and imprints of scutes, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>were</b> not well preserved.|$|E

The attack made the German navy very unpopular with the British public, as an attack against British civilians in their homes.

5|$|Most of the {{residential}} areas at Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>were</b> found either still in place or close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E
