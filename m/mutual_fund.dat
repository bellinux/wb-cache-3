5|$|Because of Peter's {{imprisonment}} Alicia, {{a lawyer}} herself, is {{working as a}} junior associate at a law firm. Alicia serves as second chair for senior partner Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) in a murder trial. Their client, Brad Broussard (Tom Degnan), is charged with shooting Miles Wagner. Wagner was an unpopular <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> manager who defrauded Broussard and many other out of their life savings by assisting in Bernard Madoff's investment scandal. Broussard was found covered in blood next to Wagner's body, but insists on his innocence. Diane consults ballistics expert Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), a mustachioed country man with a strict principle {{that he will not}} work if the client is guilty. Kurt testifies that Wagner was shot inside a car despite being found on the floor. Wagner's partner, Martin Knox (Kevin O'Rourke), had a strong financial motive to kill Wagner. Knox's wife, Rachel (Geraldine Hughes), strongly dislikes her husband and is willing to implicate him, but is bound by spousal privilege laws. Alicia discovers a conspiracy tactic that will allow Rachel to testify, and Broussard is vindicated and set free. The firm's investigator Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi) visits FBI agent Lana Delaney (Jill Flint) inquiring about the investigation into Peter. Delaney asks Kalinda to feed her information about Peter, but Kalinda declines.|$|E

A Unit Kegiatan Ekonomi (UKE) is considered efficient if the efficiency value reachs perfection (100 percent), on the contrary when the efficiency value is less than 100 percent, then the UKE is rated as inefficient. The variables on this research are chosen based on intermediation approach.

25|$|A {{money market}} fund (also called a money market <b>mutual</b> <b>fund)</b> is an {{open-ended}} <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> that invests in short-term debt securities such as US Treasury bills and commercial paper.

25|$|ETFs are {{structured}} for tax efficiency {{and can be}} more attractive than mutual funds. In the U.S., whenever a <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, the <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> must distribute the capital gains to its shareholders. This can happen whenever the <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> sells portfolio securities, whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund. In contrast, ETFs are not redeemed by holders (instead, holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market, as they would a stock, or effect a non-taxable redemption of a creation unit for portfolio securities), so that investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares or when the ETF trades to reflect changes in the underlying index.|$|E

We show that economies of scale in liquidity provision are limited for <b>mutual</b> <b>funds.</b> <b>Mutual</b> <b>funds</b> are large holders of cash in the aggregate, and thus liquidity provision by <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> is highly dependent on liquidity provision by the traditional banking and shadow banking sectors.

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} a sample of eight Norwegian <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> and eight global <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> over the period January 1999 to June 2006. Norwegian <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> invest in companies, which are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and global <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> invest in companies in USA, Europe, Asia and South America. This study examines the riskadjusted returns using Sharpe’s ratio, Treynor’s ratio, Jensen’s measure, Appraisal Ratio and Modigliani and Modigliani measure for these Norwegian and Global <b>mutual</b> <b>funds.</b> The analysis will focus on the funds performances in the form of risk-adjusted return. In the empirical examination, I have used arithmetic risk-adjusted monthly return. The purpose is to compare the performances of global <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> and domestic <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> and seeks to test whether the <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> achieve a higher risk-adjusted excess return than the market and if the <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> have the same risk profile and investment strategy as they claim. On the basis of the results I found in the empirical analysis, I conclude that only a few funds managed to generate a risk-adjusted excess return corresponding to the fund’s investment strategy and profile and few funds have the same risk profile as they claim. The performance evaluation methods, which are used to rank the <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> in this thesis, have strong positive correlation. This adds robustness to my results. Different fund management companies charge different management fee from their customers.
