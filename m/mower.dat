5|$|Worthington {{built the}} Buckwood Inn, an {{exclusive}} resort, with an eighteen-hole golf course designed by A. W. Tillinghast. This {{later became the}} Shawnee Country Club. The course was completed around 1910. In 1913, John McDermott won the Shawnee Open golf tournament at Shawnee-on-Delaware, ahead of top Englishmen Harry Vardon and Ted Ray. After trying unsuccessfully to keep the fairways in shape by grazing sheep on them, Worthington designed the gang <b>mower</b> with three moving wheels. He launched the Shawnee <b>Mower</b> Factory to manufacture it.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the growing Confederate activity in the area, Grant decided to dispatch troops from the Vicksburg trenches across the river. The presence of Maj. Gen. John G. Walker's Confederate division on the Louisiana side was of particular concern; its presence could possibly aid a Confederate escape from Vicksburg. Therefore, Brig. Gen. Alfred W. Ellet's Mississippi Marine Brigade and Joseph A. Mower's brigade from Sherman's corps were ordered to the vicinity of Milliken's Bend. <b>Mower</b> and Ellet were to cooperate against Walker's division, which was stationed {{in the vicinity of}} Richmond, Louisiana. Richmond also happened to be an important supply line providing Vicksburg with food from Louisiana. On June 15, Ellet and <b>Mower</b> defeated Walker and destroyed Richmond, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Four {{soldiers}} were awarded the Medal of Honor during their service with the 24th Infantry Division during World War II. They were James H. Diamond, Charles E. <b>Mower,</b> Harold H.

5000|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>mowers,</b> each suited to a {{particular}} scale and purpose. The smallest types, unpowered push <b>mowers,</b> are suitable for small residential lawns and gardens. Electrical or piston engine-powered push-mowers are used for larger residential lawns (although there is some overlap). Riding <b>mowers,</b> which sometimes resemble small tractors, are larger than push <b>mowers</b> and are suitable for large lawns, although commercial riding lawn <b>mowers</b> (such as zero-turn <b>mowers)</b> can be [...] "stand-on" [...] types, and often bear little resemblance to residential lawn tractors, being designed to mow large areas at high speed in the shortest time possible. The largest multi-gang (multi-blade) <b>mowers</b> are mounted on tractors and are designed for large expanses of grass such as golf courses and municipal parks, although they are ill-suited for complex terrain.|$|R
50|$|One {{company that}} {{produced}} rotary <b>mowers</b> commercially was the Australian Victa company, starting in 1952. Its <b>mowers</b> were lighter {{and easier to}} use than similar ones that had come before. The first Victa <b>mowers</b> were made at Mortlake, an inner suburb of Sydney, by local resident Mervyn Victor Richardson. He made his first model out of scrap in his garage. The first Victa <b>mowers</b> were manufactured, going on sale on 20 September 1952. The new company, Victa <b>Mowers</b> Pty Ltd, was incorporated on 13 February 1953.|$|R
5|$|Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry <b>Mower</b> Rice {{were among}} the speculators who {{invested}} in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin. Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to remove him from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections. Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the Eighth District—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take {{a more active role in}} the 1856 campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{continue}} to give Lisa {{a hard time}} at home, particularly since Homer is ready to host a barbecue, complete with roast pig. On {{the day of the}} barbecue, Lisa makes gazpacho for all the guests as an alternative to meat, but the partygoers laugh in her face. Enraged and deeply hurt, she climbs aboard a riding <b>mower</b> and drives away with the roast pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase her, but she pushes the pig off a slope and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into the air by a dam spillway's suction.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan rarely {{consulted}} Breckinridge {{when making}} patronage appointments, and meetings {{between the two}} were infrequent. When Breckinridge and Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota's Henry <b>Mower</b> Rice to build {{a series of three}} elaborate, conjoined row houses in which to live during their time in Washington, D.C. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave woman and her young infant which, according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended his days as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.|$|E
50|$|Rotary <b>mowers</b> with {{internal}} combustion engines come in three price ranges. Low priced <b>mowers</b> use older technology, smaller motors, and lighter steel decks. These <b>mowers</b> are targeted at the residential market and typically price {{is the most}} important selling point.|$|R
50|$|Sickle <b>mowers,</b> {{also called}} {{reciprocating}} <b>mowers,</b> bar <b>mowers,</b> sickle-bar <b>mowers,</b> or finger-bar <b>mowers,</b> {{have a long}} (typically six to {{seven and a half}} feet) bar on which are mounted fingers with stationary guardplates. In a channel on the bar there is a reciprocating sickle with very sharp sickle sections (triangular blades). The sickle bar is driven back and forth along the channel. The grass, or other plant matter, is cut between the sharp edges of the sickle sections and the finger-plates (this action can be likened to an electric hair clipper).|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. <b>Mower,</b> who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E
25|$|When <b>Mower</b> was 15 years old, {{his uncle}} fell ill {{and a family}} {{physician}} made frequent house calls to treat Mower's uncle. <b>Mower</b> {{was inspired by the}} outstanding quality of patient care the family physician provided. As a result, <b>Mower</b> applied to Johns Hopkins University to pursue medical studies.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery {{held the}} first patent on a rotary blade <b>mower.</b> In the late 1940s and early 1950s, mowers were {{equipped}} with a rotating reel assembly that was either pushed by hand or was propelled by a small gasoline engine. This kind of <b>mower</b> worked well in short grass, but it clogged up in tall grass. Montgomery did not invent this <b>mower,</b> but he obtained the patent from a frustrated inventor in Chicago, Illinois. The first commercially produced rotary <b>mower,</b> the Yazoo Master <b>Mower,</b> was then produced by a small manufacturing plant in Jackson, Mississippi. Montgomery was the Louisiana distributor of Yazoo until 1981, when he closed his lawnmower business in Ruston.|$|E
