5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the River Somme was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area, near the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Somme. This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E

5|$|Copano Bay is {{approximately}} twelve-by-six-miles, oriented {{from the southwest}} to the northeast. It is found mainly on undeveloped land, though ranches are located on parts of the west, south and north shores. The main extensions include Mission Bay, which stretches to the north to the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Mission River, and Port Bay to the west, which forms the southern boundary of the Live Oak peninsula. The peninsula {{is located on the}} eastern shore of Copano Bay and is lined with beach homes and residences, which begin just west of the inlet Salt Lake to the head of Live Oak peninsula at the confluence of Copano and Aransas Bay. This opening is spanned by the Copano Bay Causeway and the Copano Bay Fishing Pier, which once served as the main crossing to the Lamar peninsula. Holiday Beach is found on the northeastern shore of Copano Bay on the Lamar Peninsula. Just north of the community is the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Copano Creek, which marks the bay's northernmost point. From here, the shoreline turns to the southwest past the Copano Bay Oil and Gas Field and four sloughs before reaching the ruins of the ghost town Copano at Copano Point, marked by white cliffs. At the point, the Copano Reef juts out almost halfway across the bay. Further southwest, past the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Mission Bay, Bayside stretches along the coast to the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Aransas River. The shoreline turns to the southeast from this point, past the Egery Flats and Egery Island through Swan Lake and to the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Port Bay.|$|E
