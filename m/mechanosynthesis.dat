25|$|Molecular nanotechnology, {{sometimes}} called molecular manufacturing, describes engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) {{operating on the}} molecular scale. Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the molecular assembler, a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of <b>mechanosynthesis.</b> Manufacturing {{in the context of}} productive nanosystems is not related to, and should be clearly distinguished from, the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.|$|E

Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of molecular nanotechnology, but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems.|$|E
500|$|Smalley stated {{his belief}} that most {{reactions}} using <b>mechanosynthesis</b> would simply give the wrong product, and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach.

We are told, for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together." [...] He concludes that [...] "the debate over <b>mechanosynthesis</b> so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists." ...|$|E
