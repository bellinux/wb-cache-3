40|$|A main <b>mutual</b> <b>characteristic</b> of {{decorative}} arts of Islamic {{states is the}} general resemblence of motifs which form the patterns and used in decorations. This view is strengthened by the implication of those motifs which are performed in different sizes and on different materials from arcitechture to textile, from manuscripts to wood decoration from small handcraft to common tools in the general frame of Turkish-Islamic culture. It is known that with taking over their artistic traditions from Timurs,Karakoyunlu and Akkoyunlu, Turkomen have great contributions {{to the development of}} book arts (bookbinding, ornemantation, miniature). By their artists, Turkomen dynasties contributed this development by carrying their styles of bookwork and also architecture to Iran and Anatolia where they had spread. The resemblence in the rockworks of the period's architecture in Diyarbakır, which was once a capital of Akkoyunlu, and the ornoments on the book covers is in a remarkable characteristic. Apart from mutual perception seen in decorative arts in general sense those resemblences are the same in designing, not in motifs base. The performing of the cover designings which are commonly seen şemseli salbeki on ornemantations of Safa Parlı mosque's niche, pulpit and minarets points out that book ornamentation designings can be a source to architectural ornemantations...|$|E
40|$|Mineral {{inclusions}} in diamonds from Namibia document a {{range of}} mantle sources, including eclogitic, websteritic and peridotitic parageneses. Based on unusual textural features a group of inclusions showing websteritic, peridotitic and transitional chemical features is assigned to an 'undetermined suite' (12 % of the studied diamonds). The <b>mutual</b> <b>characteristic</b> of this group is the occurrence of lamellar intergrowths of clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene. In addition, the 'undetermined suite' {{is associated with a}} number of uncommon phases: in one diamond MgCO 3 is enclosed by clinopyroxene. Other minerals that form touching inclusions with the pyroxene lamellae are (1) a SiO 2 phase observed in three diamonds, together with CaCO 3 in one of them, (2) phlogopite and a Cr-rich 'titanate' (probably lindsleyite). The inclusions document a metamorphic path of decreasing pressures and temperatures after entrapment in diamond. First, homogeneous low-Ca clinopyroxenes were entrapped at high temperatures. They subsequently exsolved orthopyroxene and probably also SiO 2 (coesite) on cooling along a P,T trajectory that did not allow garnet to be exsolved as well. Phlogopite, carbonates and LIMA phases are the result of overprint of a peridotitic source rock by a carbon-rich agent. The resulting unusual, olivine-free mineral association and the host diamonds are interpreted as products of extensive carbonation of the peridotite...|$|E

Na japodskom prostoru njima su se koristili ratnicitijekom posljednje, tj. 7. faze razvoja japodske kulture, koju je velikim dijelom moguće sinkroniziratisa srednjoeuropskim Lt D 1 /D 2 stupnjem kasnoga latena.

The prehistoric {{section of}} the Archaeological museum in Zagreb has in its {{holdings}} a valuablecollection of Celtic - La Tene archaeological material, especially weapons, among which four late LaTene long single-edged knives. Their <b>mutual</b> <b>characteristic</b> is {{the curve of the}} blade, which has onboth sides under the back a fl ute. Flatly unforged handle with three holes for the welded organicpart of the handle ends in an oval plate, and at the point where blade and handle meet it has guardsbended towards the blade. They were singled out as a separate Pritoka - Bela Cerkev type accordingto the specifi c qualities of their form, as well as the number of the fi nds. The name comes from thesites which had the largest number of the registered knives of such characteristics. Two previously known knives are the examples from Prozor near Otočac (T. 2 : 1) and Zagreb (T. 2 : 2), which fi t perfectly into the standard knives of that type, and due to the insuffi cient data andlow-quality photographs, we reproduce them again. Besides the aforementioned, two more examplesof such knives are kept in the museum. One was descovered during the archaeological excavationsin 1912 on Pogorelec in Sisak (T. 1 : 2), the other has no site data (T. 1 : 1). It was recently descoveredamong the modern world fi ndings from the medieval section. Good state of its iron and bronze partsin the so-called metal state, that only objects taken from the water have, leads to the conclusionthat it also originates from Sisak. Namely, metal objects taken out of the Kupa river near Sisak areof the same state. During the 19 th and in the early 20 th century a lot of antique and prehistoricarchaeological material found while dredging between the banks of the river, was brought into themuseum. But, its state with the so-called characteristics of the „water“ fi nds and its similarity to theother knives found in Sisak also taken out of Kupa river, were not enough to defi ne its fi nding sitein Sisak area, and there is no archive documentation to support it. Analogies can be found for bothknives, {{as well as for the}} knives from Zagreb and Prozor, besides Sisak, also among the examples fromthe Obrovac area, Strmec near Bela Cerkev and Ljubljanica in Slovenia, and among the examples fromthe Iapodian necropolis Jezerine in Pritoka on Una river, south of Bihać in Bosnia. Seven knives of this type from Croatia (3 Sisak, 1 Zagreb, 1 Prozor, 1 Obrovac area, 1 unknownorigin) and seven out of eight examples from Slovenia (4 Strmec near Bela Cerkev, 4 Ljubljanica) belong to the random fi nds. Only one example found in the cremation grave in Strmec near BelaCerkev, as well as the one found in cremation and one found in skeleton grave of Iapodian necropolisJezerine in Pritoka in Bosnia, come from the closed graves with the adjoining fi nds that can be dated. The Strmec knife (Košak B 1 grave) was found together with the sword, the combination identicalto the one that the warrior from the grave 400 in the Jezerine necropolis in Pritoka had. Namely,the knife and the sword were placed on the cover of the cilindric stone urn together with the otherobjects. Identical knife was placed in the 288 grave of the same necropolis. The same typologicalcharacteristics can be found on the knives from the cremation graves 400, 237 and 99 of Jezerinenecropolis, and to a certain point on the example coming from the grave 12 of the Iapodic necropolisin Ribić, south of Bihać, as well as on the sword from the Delmatic area found in the cremationgrave 41 / pile 14 at the well of Cetina river. They all diff er only in the length of the blade and areconsiderably more massive. Finds from the aforementioned graves from Iapodic area confi rm that the knives of this type aswell as similar swords (Jezerine in Pritoka, Ribić) were used during the last or the 7 th phase of theirculture’s development. For the major part it can be synchronised to the central European Lt D 1 andD 2 stage of the late La Tene. These knives have also been placed among the characteristic forms ofthe Mokronog group, or its fi nal - Mokronog IIIb stage, also comparable to the central-European Lt D 2 stage. Mokronog group, where Tauriscs have the majority, occupied the region of the central and eastSlavonia and north-west Croatia, and on its southern end it bordered with the Iapodic country. Thecloseness of the two accustomed-to-warfare neighbours who had probably had confl icts betweenthem, as well as alliance when it came to common Roman danger, inevitably led to the knowledgeand the usage of the same kinds of weapons and consequently to the same mode of warfare.

Furthermore, the study aims to discover whether social capital generated during the project cycle {{has an effect on}} projects’ effectiveness and ability to produce added value. The empirical data is collected by interviewing employees of the four selected case studies, Latvian non-governmental organisations implementing development cooperation projects. The context of a new donor country building its capacity for development cooperation is described. The data consists of seven semi-structured open-ended interviews. Characteristics of structural and cognitive social capital or common understanding of value systems shared among project partners have been identified. Social capital provides environment for people and organisations to succeed, increase effectiveness and focus on <b>mutual</b> <b>characteristics</b> of their coordinated actions. Implementation of development cooperation projects enhance (a) financial and human resource mobilisation and management capacities; (b) process management related capacities as strategic planning, coordination, and decision making, communication, problem identification and solving; (c) knowledge acquisition and generation within organisations.

Within the premium pension system mutual fund fees are an important factor to consider since it can erode savings. This study investigates fees and performance of all mutual funds {{that existed in the}} premium pension system (PPS) between 2004 and 2016. Risk-adjusted performance and fees are adjusted to reflect the discount that is given for fees within the premium pension system to reflect actual investor experiences. The data needed to make these adjustments were obtained from the Swedish Pension Agency. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate if there is a relationship between fee and risk-adjusted return within the Swedish premium pension system. Further on this study aims to explain what <b>mutual</b> fund <b>characteristics</b> can be used to predict performance and fees within the premium pension system. Theories used in this study are efficient market hypothesis, agency theory, behavioral finance, economies of scale and portfolio theory. The factors from the Carhart 4 -factor model is used to construct the factor model utilized in this study to estimate risk-adjusted returns. This study adapts a quantitative research method and panel data regressions were conducted to determine how fee and risk-adjusted performance is related to various <b>mutual</b> fund <b>characteristics.</b> Hausman tests were conducted to evaluate if the fixed effects model or random effects model was the most appropriate to use. The result of the Hausman test proved that fixed effect model was the most appropriate model to use. This study will draw conclusions about whether the fee that the mutual fund companies charge can be justified given their risk-adjusted performance. The results for the sample of all mutual funds and the sample of equity funds imply that there exists a positive relationship between fee after discount and performance. Therefore, mutual funds in the premium pension system compensate for increasing fees with a higher risk-adjusted return. The sample of balanced funds differs since there is a negative relationship between risk-adjusted returns and fees. This study finds that size is a determinant of risk-adjusted performance, with larger mutual fund performing better than smaller funds. Because of this finding, it can be concluded that economies of scale do exist among the mutual funds in the premium pension system. Actively managed mutual funds charge higher mutual fund fees on average than passively managed funds. Further on, there is significant evidence that actively managed equity funds perform worse than passively managed equity funds. This suggests that investors are better off investing into cheaper equity index funds rather than expensive actively managed equity funds...|$|R

A novel high-gain textile antenna array system, fully {{integrated into a}} rescue-worker’s vest and operating in the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical wireless band (2. 4 – 2. 4835 GHz), is presented. The system comprises an array consisting of four tip-truncated equilateral triangular microstrip patch antennas (ETMPAs), a power divider, line stretchers, and coaxial cables. The array is vertically positioned on the human torso to produce a narrow beam in elevation, as such reducing fading and allowing to steer the maximum gain in a small angular sector centered around the broadside direction. To allow simple low-cost beam steering, we specifically minimize mutual coupling by using a relative large distance between the patches and by selecting the ETMPA element as the most suited topology from three potential patch geometries. Moreover, we investigate the stability of return loss and <b>mutual</b> coupling <b>characteristics</b> under different relative humidity conditions, when bending the array, when placing the system on-body, and when covering it by different textile layers. Reflection coefficient and gain patterns are simulated and measured for the antenna system in free space and placed on the human body. 1...|$|R
40|$|Radar {{observations}} {{have consistently}} shown that high-altitude migratory flight in insects generally occurs after mass take-off at dusk or after take-off over a more extended period {{during the day}} (in association {{with the growth of}} atmospheric convection). In this paper, we focus on a less-studied third category of emigration – the ‘dawn take-off’ – as recorded by insect-monitoring radars during the summer months in southern England. In particular, we describe occasions when dawn emigrants formed notable layer concentrations centred at altitudes ranging from ca. 240 m to 700 m above ground, very probably due to the insects responding to local temperature maxima in the atmosphere, such as the tops of inversions. After persisting for several hours through the early morning, the layers eventually merged into the insect activity building up later in the morning (from 06. 00 – 08. 00 h onwards) in conjunction with the development of daytime convection. The species forming the dawn layers have not been positively identified, but their masses lay predominantly in the 16 – 32 mg range, and they evidently formed a fauna quite distinct from that in flight during the previous night. The displacement and common orientation (<b>mutual</b> alignment) <b>characteristics</b> of the migrants are described...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of building science and technology, {{there are more and}} more super high-rise buildings. Meanwhile, difficulties in structural design and construction are also on the rise. As the finite element technology field develops, there are numerous types of structural design software, with different <b>mutual</b> functional <b>characteristics.</b> In order to satisfy the design and construction calculation of large-scale engineering, formats of different structural models shall be converted frequently, so as to satisfy the demand of design and construction calculation. In this paper, a simple method will be sought for converting the finite element model of SAP 2000 structural design into ANSYS finite element model based on super high-rise structural design model by combining the practical engineering. After conversion, simple APDL [1] programming can be applied for realizing the conversion technology of model. With {{the development}} of building science and technology, the conversion of structural height and component of modern building gets more and more complicated. In front of the gradual improvement in the difficulty of design and construction, various types of element software have their own features. ANSYS is the earliest and most powerful finite element simulation software, which is quite advantageous in node analysis and construction analysis of complicated structure, bu...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for fast object class recognition incorporating contextual information into boosting. The object is represented as a constellation of generalized correlograms that integrate both information of local parts and their spatial relations. Incorporating the spatial relations into our constellation of descriptors, we show that an exhaustive search for the best matching can be avoided. Combining the contextual descriptors with boosting, the system simultaneously learns the information that characterize {{each part of the}} object along with their <b>characteristic</b> <b>mutual</b> spatial relations. The proposed framework includes a matching step between homologous parts in the training set, and learning the spatial pattern after matching. In the matching part two approaches are provided: a supervised algorithm and an unsupervised one. Our results are favorably compared against state-of-the-art results. ...|$|R
