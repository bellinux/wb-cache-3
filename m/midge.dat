40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} biting <b>midges</b> {{of the genus}} Culicoides, which are tiny nematoceran insects {{belonging}} to the Diptera, and their parasites. Biting <b>midges</b> partake in transmissions of several parasitical organisms of various groups. Most notably, they are the vectors of several pathogenic viruses which might have a serious impact on livestock. However, the thesis deals with detection of parasites belonging to Trypanosomatids and Filarioids related to two independent biting <b>midges</b> collections - from the Czech Republic and from the Central African region. Apart from testing biting <b>midges,</b> there were carried out the tests on the occurrence of {{the same group of}} parasites within ruminant hoofed games in the Czech Republic. Our goal was to find out whether the same parasites occur with biting <b>midges</b> and their hosts (hoofed games) and whether biting <b>midges</b> could play a role as vectors. Biting <b>midges</b> are relatively overlooked group of haematophagous insects. Until recently, they had not been paid much attention, which changed with the spread of Bluetongue virus over Europe. This stimulated a widespread monitoring of biting <b>midges</b> in several European countries, including the Czech Republic. This helped to gain a large amount of data about the occurrence of biting <b>midges</b> near livestock. Nevertheless, there is no [...] ...|$|R

5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall <b>midge</b> Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E

5000|$|Reducing <b>midges</b> around {{livestock}} stables is a {{good way}} of reducing the likelihood of disease transmission. In order to “midge-proof” a stable, multiple precautions must be taken. One way to reduce entry of <b>midges</b> into the stable is to add screens with very fine mesh. Although, mesh will significantly reduce the entrance of <b>midges,</b> it is not 100% “midge-proof” on its own. [...] In addition to the mesh screen, fans can be placed strategically in the stable. Fans are effective in reducing <b>midges</b> because of their small size and poor flying capabilities. [...] Removing breeding pools around livestock is also essential. <b>Midges</b> can breed in pools as small as a hoofprint. Providing a substrate that is well-drained and resist the formation of pools can not only prevent <b>midges</b> from breeding, but can enhance the health of the animals' hooves.|$|R
40|$|Emergence of overwintered sorghum <b>midges,</b> Contarinia sorghicola (Coquillett), was {{monitored}} during 1979, 1980, and 1981. Differences in emergence {{times and}} distributions among years was {{a function of}} soil temperature and rainfall. A heat unit accumulation model incorporating a rainfall adjustment factor was developed which described adult emergence in the spring. Adult <b>midges</b> initiated emergence after accumulating 431 centigrade heat units (based on mean daily to-cm soil temperatures starting 1 April) above a threshold temperature of 14. 8 °C, whereas, 679 and 977 heat units were required for 50 and 95 % emergence, respectively. Sorghum <b>midges</b> that overwintered in johnsongrass spikelets emerged after similar heat unit accumulations as <b>midges</b> that overwintered in sorghum spikelets.

The film was directed by Gary Winick, who took over after original director Norman René died during pre-production. It was written by Polly Draper, who also produced alongside Karen Tangorra, <b>Midge</b> Sanford, Sarah Pillsbury and Larry Meistrich. Draper based the screenplay on the experiences of her noted jazz musician husband Michael Wolff, who has Tourette syndrome. Wolff's involvement as co-producer ensured the cooperation of jazz club The Village Vanguard, which granted the production permission to use its name and exterior shots of the building. Herman Leonard loaned his collection of photographs of famous jazz musicians, and the Blue Note jazz club allowed its name to be used on fake fliers. Wolff also provided the film's piano score, to which Alex Foster also contributed by providing the soundtrack for scenes of Hines' playing the saxophone.|$|E

40|$|Indigenous Culicoides biting <b>midges</b> are {{suggested}} to be putative vectors for the recently emerged Schmallenberg virus (SBV) based on SBV RNA detection in field-caught <b>midges.</b> Furthermore, SBV replication and dissemination has been evidenced in C. sonorensis under laboratory conditions. After SBV had been detected in Culicoides biting <b>midges</b> from Belgium in August 2011, it {{spread all over}} the country by the end of 2011, as evidenced by very high between-herd seroprevalence rates in sheep and cattle. This study investigated if a renewed SBV circulation in <b>midges</b> occurred in 2012 in the context of high seroprevalence in the animal host population and evaluated if a recently proposed realtime RT-PCR approach that is meant to allow assessing the vector competence of Culicoides for SBV and bluetongue virus under laboratory conditions was applicable to field-caught <b>midges.</b> Therefore <b>midges</b> caught with 12 OVI traps in four different regions in Belgium between May and November 2012, were morphologically identified, age graded, pooled and tested for the presence of SBV RNA by realtime RT-PCR. The results demonstrate that although no SBV could be detected in nulliparous <b>midges</b> caught in May 2012, a renewed but short lived circulation of SBV in parous <b>midges</b> belonging to the subgenus Avaritia occured in August 2012 at all four regions.

40|$|Culicoides biting <b>midges</b> are {{important}} vectors of Bluetongue and Schmallenberg viruses in Europe. The introduction of these viruses highlighted {{the need to}} develop novel surveillance and control tools to monitor and manage biting <b>midges.</b> Biting <b>midges,</b> as most insects, primarily use olfactory cues to recognize and discriminate resources for their survival and reproduction. Blood feeding insects rely on host-derived volatiles to locate their vertebrate hosts, and these odours can be exploited to manipulate insect-host interaction. The primary goal of this thesis was to identify host volatiles that modulate the host-seeking behaviour of biting <b>midges.</b> Through coupled gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) analysis of odour collections from cattle hair and urine, I identified several compounds that, in combination with carbon dioxide, elicited behavioural attraction or inhibition in Culicoides nubeculosus, in a dose dependent manner. Some of these host odours were evaluated in the field showing similar behavioural responses of C. impunctatus. Both laboratory and field assays emphasized the importance of release rate to obtain optimal behavioural responses. The impact of using host volatiles to monitor host-seeking biting <b>midges</b> was shown in another study. Here, I showed that incandescent light traps baited with two cattle kairomones, 1 -octen- 3 -ol and carbon dioxide, caught significantly more insects than UV light traps. UV light traps are to date the most commonly used method for monitoring biting <b>midges.</b> That said, differences were observed between trap types, both concerning species composition and the physiological state of the female biting <b>midges</b> caught. Incorporating the novel bioactive compounds, formulated in blends and released in proper ratio and rate, could further increase the efficacy of this trapping method. By incorporating these attractants together with repellent compounds identified in this project, a "push-pull"- system for biting <b>midges</b> could also be envisioned. The host volatiles identified are detected by the peripheral olfactory system of biting <b>midges.</b> A comparative analysis across biting species with different host preferences revealed a correlation between host preference and the number and types of antennal and maxillary palp sensilla. Functional characterisation of these sensillum types will be the next step to increase our understanding of how host odours are detected by biting <b>midges</b> With this thesis I have increased our understanding of the chemical ecology of host-seeking female biting <b>midges</b> and their peripheral olfactory system. Future research projects will need to develop viable commercial products that could be incorporated into management strategies for Culicoides biting <b>midges.</b> ...|$|R
