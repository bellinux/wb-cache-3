She told the interviewer that Barack Obama's mixed-race heritage did not worry her; [...] "'That didn't concern <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> had he been completely white." ...|$|E

He painted {{directly on}} the white canvas, without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I {{was struck by the}} keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas. He seemed to proceed slowly, when in reality he executed very rapidly, placing one touch after the other in its place, rarely having to go over his work more than once. There was very little perceptible movement of his body or arms. His expression was perfectly calm...|$|E
500|$|Tolkien {{also cited}} H. Rider Haggard's novel She in a {{telephone}} interview: [...] "I suppose as a boy She interested <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> anything—like the Greek shard of Amyntas , which {{was the kind of}} machine by which everything got moving." [...] A supposed facsimile of this potsherd appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom. Critics have compared this device to the Testament of Isildur in The Lord of the Rings and to Tolkien's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the Book of Mazarbul. Critics starting with Edwin Muir have found resemblances between Haggard's romances and Tolkien's.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Jackson told Rabbi Shmuley: Shields was [...] "one of the loves of my life. I just {{wished she}} loved <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I loved her", and, they [...] "dated a lot." [...] Before meeting her, {{he said that}} he had {{pictures}} of her all over his room. He recalled his happiness when they first met in 1981. He was at the 53rd Academy Awards with Diana Ross, and Shields walked up and introduced herself; then at the after-party she asked him to dance with her. They exchanged numbers, and he [...] "was up all night, singing, spinning around my room, just so happy." [...] He also said, “We had one encounter when she got real intimate and I chickened out. And I shouldn’t have.” ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall {{also had}} mixed comments, {{comparing}} the episode to House and stating, [...] "And yet {{as much as}} Veronica was annoying <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I wanted to yell at her for automatically jumping to conclusions with Weevil (more on that in a minute), this was maybe my favorite episode of the season. [...] Hell, they even had a cliffhanger ending to the mystery arc {{for the first time}} in forever. I dug it." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Adele {{performed}} [...] "Turning Tables" [...] at Live at Largo in Los Angeles on 9 February 2011. Robie Daw of Idolator {{recognized the}} performance as [...] "intimate" [...] and commented that it featured Adele's soulful vocals simply accompanied by [...] "haunting" [...] piano chords. She performed the single on VH1 Unplugged on 3 March 2011. Adele performed the song at Late Night with David Letterman; the performance was later uploaded to her Vevo account on YouTube. On 4 September 2011, the singer performed [...] "Turning Tables" [...] at {{the premiere of}} The Jonathan Ross Show and was also interviewed. [...] "Turning Tables" [...] {{was part of the}} set list on Adele's second concert tour entitled Adele Live (2011). On 22 November 2011, Adele unveiled a video of her performance of the song from the concert held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The performance was later included in her first video album Live at the Royal Albert Hall which was released on 25 November 2011. Adele described the concert as the most special show that she would ever play. Adele performed the song on 27 January 2012 at Live from the Artists Den. During the performance the singer stated: [...] "Nothing in life moves <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> being on stage does. I love the closeness of playing in small rooms, and this room was lovely and simple, just beautiful." ...|$|E

2500|$|His manager Louis Walsh {{was unaware}} of Gately's {{sexuality}} when he selected him for Boyzone and has said that, had he known, he would have thought twice before picking him, claiming {{less than a year}} before his death that [...] "it wasn't cool then to have a gay guy in a band". Walsh described Gately as his [...] "very, very best friend" [...] after the singer's death, saying: [...] "Of all the people I've worked with I don't think anybody thanked <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Stephen. He used to always say to me, 'If I wasn't in Boyzone I don't know where I'd be today, thank you'".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{contemporary}} adventure novel, H. Rider Haggard's She, was {{acknowledged by}} Tolkien in an interview: [...] "I suppose {{as a boy}} She interested <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> anything—like the Greek shard of Amyntas , which {{was the kind of}} machine by which everything got moving." [...] A supposed facsimile of this potsherd appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom.

2500|$|Philip French of The Guardian {{commented that}} he had [...] "seen nothing in the cinema this past year that {{impressed}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> BBC2's 10-part Band of Brothers, produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and Ken Loach's The Navigators on Channel 4", {{and that it was}} [...] "one of the best films ever made about men in war and superior in most ways to Saving Private Ryan." [...] Matt Seaton, also in The Guardian, wrote that the film's production was [...] "on such a scale that in an ad hoc, inadvertent way it gives one a powerful sense of what really was accomplished during the D-Day invasion - the extraordinary logistical effort of moving men and matériel in vast quantities." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 28, 2011, Love, Erlandson, Patty Schemel and Auf der Maur {{appeared}} at the New York screening of Schemel's documentary [...] at the Museum of Modern Art. The appearance {{was the first time}} in thirteen years that all four members appeared together in public. Schemel had expressed a desire to record with Love, Erlandson and Auf der Maur stating [...] "nothing has been discussed, but I have a feeling." [...] After the screening, the four took part in a Q session where Love stated: [...] "For <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I love playing with Patty – and I would play with her in five seconds again, and everyone onstage – if it's not moving forward, I don't wanna do it. That's just my thing. There's rumblings; there's always bloody rumblings. But if it's not miserable and it's going forward and I'm happy with it… that's all I have to say about that question." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the modern}} style in which {{multiple}} sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and another as color commentator), Scully and his broadcast partners Jerry Doggett (1956–1987) and Ross Porter (1977–2004) called games solo with Scully working the entire game {{except for the}} 3rd and 7th innings. When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels. Drysdale died {{in his hotel room}} following a heart attack before a game against the Montreal Expos in 1993, resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement of the death made. Scully announced the news of his death by saying, [...] "Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> this one. And I say it to you as best I can with a broken heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|People with anxious-preoccupied {{attachment}} type tend {{to agree}} with the following statements: [...] "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and [...] "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I value them." [...] People with this style of attachment seek high levels of intimacy, approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy {{to such an extent that}} they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared to securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often doubt their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, emotional dysregulation (ED), worry, and impulsiveness in their relationships.|$|E
6000|$|... "Magna est veritas," [...] said Miss Dunstable. [...] "The Bishop of Barchester taught <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> Latin <b>as</b> that at Chaldicotes; {{and he did}} {{add some}} more, {{but there was a}} long word, and I forgot it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I tell? He seemed {{just about}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> struck up on <b>me.</b> Anyway, he paid <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> {{attention}} <b>as</b> he did her. Perhaps it's more the way, now, {{to notice the}} mother {{than it used to}} be." ...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{negative}} {{effect of the}} pig cull on the Zabbaleen was {{the loss of the}} economic value of the pigs themselves. According to Fahmi and Sutton, pigs are the main source of income for the Zabbaleen. Before the cull, the Zabbaleen had collected 6,000 tons of MSW daily, of which 60 percent was organic waste which was consumed by the pigs. Every six months, the Zabbaleen would take their pigs to traders, earning around 450LE (approximately 80 USD) per pig. Although the Egyptian government made financial compensations for some of pigs slaughtered; compensations were not given to all of the Zabbaleen who lost pigs to the cull and those who received compensation received far less money compared to what they would have received [...] from selling the pigs to traders. According to one Zabbaleen pig breeder, [...] "The government paid me between LE 50 (US$ 10) and LE 250 (US$ 50) for each pig I lost, depending on its size, whilst meat processors would have given <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> LE 1,000 (US$ 200)." [...] The pig cull also resulted in increased cases of malnutrition and anaemia in Zabbaleen children because prior to the cull, pork had been the only affordable source of animal protein for most of the Zabbaleen.|$|E
2500|$|Jaci Stephen {{from the}} Daily Mail praised the casting of Essex in the role, saying, [...] "There {{is always a}} frisson of {{excitement}} when a big star joins a soap. [...] None, however, has excited <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the arrival of David Essex in EastEnders. It is inspired casting, {{not only because the}} part of Eddie Moon fits Essex like a glove, but because he brings a gravitas to the show. And those eyes. Goodness, those beautiful eyes." [...] Stephen went on to positively review Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "It made for a great start to the week, with David Essex's exquisite comic timing bringing some light-hearted relief to the rather heavy Moon/Mitchell stuff of late." [...] Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror also positively reviewed Eddie's arrival in Albert Square, saying, [...] "Dressed in a smart, black three-piece whistle and flute [...] and a white button-down collar shirt, the dapper grey-haired man looks like he could have been a guest at a Big, Fat Gypsy Wedding. But within four minutes of arriving in Albert Square on Monday, he's been knocked over by Carol's car as he snatches Roxy's toddler Amy from its path. Although there have been reports that this newcomer has been banned from singing in the Vic, within 15 minutes he's croaking out a line from the Leyton Orient supporters' song. This is the grand entrance of former 70s teen idol David Essex" [...] Conversely, Jim Shelley, also from the Daily Mirror, criticised Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "on Monday they blessed us with the arrival of Whispering David Essex as Eddie Moon, the latest example of the Long-Lost Relative Who Has Never Been Mentioned Before that is routine in soaps nowadays. [...] Eddie had been in EastEnders three whole minutes before the writers unleashed the bi-annual cliche of The Mean & Moody New Guy Saving A Child Running Out In Front Of A Car. [...] Eddie spent the week ticking off the components of that great EastEnders cliche, the 'rough diamond'/silver-tongued 'ladies' man.' (See also Dennis Watts, Michael Moon, Johnny Allen, Max & Jack Branning, Steve Owen et al.)" [...] A reporter from the Metro called the character [...] "mischievous", and another from the Evening Chronicle called him [...] "a pleasant, charming character", adding [...] "It seems as if a little bit of Essex will brighten up the East End for a while. [...] s far as I can tell, [...] will be {{a breath of fresh air}} in a soap that sometimes forgets to have a laugh." ...|$|E
