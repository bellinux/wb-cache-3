500|$|Musically, Title {{comprises}} throwback style sound, 1950s doo wop-inspired {{songs that}} straddle {{the line between}} modern R and melodic pop. The EP's opening track, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] is a bubblegum pop, doo-wop song {{which serves as a}} throwback to 1950s and 1960s music, and contains elements from a complex mix of several genres; R, hip hop, tropical, country and rock and roll. Sonically, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] comprises an earworm hook, early 1960s soul-pop groove, scatting tempo and shimmying melody. Lyrically, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] serves as a callout to embrace one's appearance and promote a positive body image. The song metaphorically refers to the appearance of a woman's bottom. Larger women are described as [...] "bass" [...] and thinner women as [...] "treble", which Trainor implies as a joke about [...] "thick and thin". The lyric [...] "I'm bringing booty back" [...] references Justin Timberlake's [...] "SexyBack" [...] (2006). In the song, she also calls out the fashion industry for creating unreachable standards of beauty: [...] "I see the magazines working that Photoshop / We know that shit ain't real, c'mon <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>stop</b> / You know I won't be no stick-figure Barbie doll." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{remains one}} of the most studied and {{controversial}} figures in American history. Historian Charles Grier Sellers says, [...] "Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage." [...] His most controversial presidential actions included removal of the Indians from the southeast, the dismantling of the Bank of the United States, and his threat to use military force against the state of South Carolina to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>stop</b> nullifying federal laws. Not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the British at New Orleans in the last battle of the War of 1812. He was the main founder of the modern Democratic Party and became its iconic hero. He was always a fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies.|$|E
