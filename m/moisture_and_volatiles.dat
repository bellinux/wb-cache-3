This study aimed to investigate the influence of both pyrolysis methods on yield and product composition obtained from Malaysian biomass, i. e. : empty fruit bunch and rice husk pellets. They represent lignocellulosic biomass procured as by-products of the milling process. In the first part of the thesis, an initial characterisation of biomass was conducted to determine the chemical composition.

40|$|Torrefaction is {{the process}} of heating a {{material}} in the absence of oxygen, a pretreatment that represents a promising option for biofuels. Two eucalyptus species harvested in South Carolina, E. benthamii and E. macarthurii, were processed in a torrefier, and wood pellets were manufactured. Eucalyptus represents a promising biomass source in southern U. S. due to fast growth rates and the availability of cold-tolerant plantations. Analyses of moisture content, proximate and elemental composition, and net heating value of “light roasted” wood were assessed. The heating value of the eucalypts and pellets was enhanced by 19 % (average), compared to the original material, while the <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatiles</b> content were drastically reduced. This reduction leads to an increase in the amount (w/w) of carbon, enhancing the energy content in the material. Thus, torrefaction is useful for improving the heating value of woody biomass, consuming little external energy due to recirculation and burning of gases for the process. The pellets showed increased energy density, providing improved properties for transportation and handling...|$|E
5000|$|The {{temperature}} of the conche is controlled and varies for different types of chocolate. Generally higher temperature leads to a shorter required processing time. Temperature varies from around 49 C for milk chocolate to up to 82 C for dark chocolate. The elevated temperature leads to a partially caramelized flavor and in milk chocolate promotes the Maillard reaction. [...] The chocolate passes through three phases during conching. In the dry phase the material is in powdery form, and the mixing coats the particles with fat. Air movement through the conche removes some <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatile</b> substances, which may give an acidic note to the flavor. Moisture balance affects the flavor and texture of the finished product because, after the particles are coated with fat, <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatile</b> chemicals {{are less likely to}} escape.|$|R

50|$|Lignite {{begins as}} an {{accumulation}} of partially decayed plant material, or peat. Burial by other sediments results in increasing temperature, depending on the local geothermal gradient and tectonic setting, and increasing pressure. This causes compaction of the material and loss {{of some of the}} water <b>and</b> <b>volatile</b> matter (primarily methane and carbon dioxide). This process, called coalification, concentrates the carbon content, and thus the heat content, of the material. Deeper burial and the passage of time result in further expulsion of <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatile</b> matter, eventually transforming the material into higher rank coals such as bituminous and anthracite coal.|$|R
40|$|Fixed bed {{combustion}} {{is common}} is small to medium scale heat production in grate furnaces and domestic boilers. Modelling of these fuel beds {{can give a}} better understanding of the conversion process inside them, and provide a tool for analyzing the performance of furnaces and problems related to the fuel bed. The complexity of the task is however significant and there are at present no models considering all phenomenon related to a bed in a grate furnace. To give reasonable computational times the models depend on simplifications. One simplification often used is the neglect of gradients within individual fuel particles. The influence of this approximation has been investigated in this work. A bed model and a single particle model are presented. The bed model is a one-dimensional model describing the conversion of a batch of biofuels ignited at the top while combustion air is fed from below. All conversion stages are considered; drying, devolatilisation, heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions. The particle model is two-dimensional and describes heating, drying and devolatilisation of a particle inside the bed. The surface temperature, given by a simulation with the bed model, is used as boundary condition. The bed and particle model are linked to each other to account for intra-particle gradients in the conversion of the fuel bed. The linking is carried out in an iterative manner in which the bed and particle model are run in series. The bed model provides the boundary condition for the particle model which in turn gives input parameters to the bed model to reflect the impact of intra-particle gradients. The influence of these gradients on ignition rate, temperature profiles and release of <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatiles</b> is investigated...|$|E
40|$|Bioenergy is {{increasingly}} being used {{a means of}} combatting the effects of anthropogenic climate change in sectors such as the power industry. Problems can exist in utilising biomass fuels however such as high moisture contents and low calorific value when compared with fossil fuels. Torrefaction is a pre-treatment process that aims {{to address some of}} these issues. In this pre-treatment step, solid biomass is heated in an inert atmosphere to between temperatures between 200 and 300 °C resulting in the loss of low-energy volatiles and moisture improving fuel chemical and physical properties and is the focus of this thesis work. Firstly, the effect of changing torrefaction temperature and residence time is investigated. Results show that torrefaction increases the calorific value of fuels via reduction in <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatiles</b> contents as a result of degradation of some of the lignocellulosic components- this also improving the grindability characteristics of torrefied materials- with these change more pronounced as conditions become more severe. Results further show that with increasing torrefaction severity, the solid product yields decrease while the liquid and gaseous products increase. The combustion properties of torrefied biomass is also investigated, with results showing that torrefaction reduces the reactivity of biomass fuels and that upon rapid devolatilisation, chars from torrefied fuels differ morphologically to those of untreated biomass and undergo a lesser degree of burnout. Results also show that promotion of nitrogen to the gas phase during rapid devolatilisation may be fuel dependent after torrefaction has been performed. Finally, the effect of torrefaction of supply chain GHG emissions is investigated where it was found that GHG savings can be made as a result of increased calorific value in torrefied materials. Emissions savings are maximised where heat integration of the combustion of the volatiles gases evolved during torrefaction is implemented and wood chips are used as utility fuel. Results also indicate that torrefaction favours long distance transport as a result of improved fuel properties. ...|$|E
40|$|Small-scale fixed-bed {{coal and}} biomass gasifiers {{represent}} an attractive option for distributed {{combined heat and power}} generation. As known, gasification phenomena are very complex, involving drying, devolatilization, pyrolysis, heterogeneous and homogenous reactions, {{with a large}} number of intermediate and final products. Gasification processes are also influenced by reaction kinetics and fluiddynamical effects, such as temperature and concentration gradients. For this reason, simulation models are able to predict gasifiers performance under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium only if the gasification process takes place at a known temperature and the reaction time is lower than the reactants residence time. As a consequence, for fixed-bed gasifiers equilibrium models must consider drying and devolatilization taking place at lower temperature in the heat transfer zone, where solid feed is heated by syngas. Therefore, <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatiles</b> are not involved in the gasification reactions since they are released before reaching the reaction zone. Several models based on steady-state and one-dimensional representations have been developed to reproduce gasification processes in fixed-bed reactors. These models have been found adequate to provide information for engineering design and process optimization. In this framework a steady-state simulation model has been developed at the Department of Mechanical Chemical and Materials Engineering (DIMCM) of the University of Cagliari by using the Aspen Plus computer code for predicting performance of small-scale up-draft fixed-bed coal gasifiers. The model can be used to evaluate the mass and energy balance in each zone of the gasifier and the main characteristics of the syngas produced by the gasification process (composition, mass flow, temperature, heating value, etc.). This paper describes the model and presents the main results of a parametric analysis, which shows how the gasification process is influenced by the main operating parameters. Moreover, the results of the model have been compared with the experimental results of an up-draft gasifier fed with an lignite from Alaska. The above-mentioned gasifier is part of a pilot gasification and gas treatment plant built at the Sotacarbo Research Centre in Sardinia, Italy. The comparison shows that the model well represents the performance of the pilot-scale unit...|$|E

The final aim of the European project SPRITCO which includes this work is the prediction of the coal pushing on the heating wall in the coke oven battery to prevent their damage and then to increase their lifetime. The goal of this work is to develop a thermo-chemo-mechanical model of the coal cake which emphasizes the mechanical effects of the pyrolysis. During pyrolysis, as function of temperature, 4 steps are obtained: drying, plastic phase, semi-coke and coke. Considering the structure of coal, the presence of <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>volatile</b> matter, fully coupled thermo-chemo-mechanical model for unsaturated porous media is used to simulate the complex coupling mechanisms involved.
