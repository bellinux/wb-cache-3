Republican Newt Gingrich argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he {{referred to as a}} type of healthcare rationing. President Obama has argued that U.S. healthcare is already rationed, based on income, type of employment, and medical pre-existing conditions, with nearly 46 million uninsured.

And on any given day, over 37 million Americans—most of them working people and their little children—have no health insurance at all.

50|$|In 2009, the Congressional Progressive Caucus {{outlined}} five key healthcare principles {{they intended}} to pass into law. The CPC mandated a nationwide public option, affordable health insurance, insurance market regulations, an employer insurance provision mandate, and comprehensive services for children. In March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was intended to increase the affordability and efficiency of the United States healthcare system. Although considered a success by progressives, many argued that it didn't go far enough in achieving healthcare reform, as exemplified with the Democrats' failure in achieving a national public option. In recent decades, Single-payer healthcare has become an important goal in healthcare reform for progressives. In the 2016 Democratic Primary, progressive Democratic Socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders {{raised the issue of}} a single-payer healthcare system, citing his belief that <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> still paying too much for health insurance, and arguing that millions more don't receive the care they need. In 2016, an effort was made to implement a single-payer healthcare system in the state of Colorado, known as ColoradoCare (Amendment 69). Senator Bernie Sanders held rallies in Colorado in support of the Amendment leading up to the vote. Despite high-profile support, Amendment 69 failed to pass, with just 21.23% of voting Colorado residents voting in favor, and 78.77% against.|$|E
5000|$|The Baal teshuva {{movement}} and the events it encompasses received the attention of President Ronald Reagan {{in a speech to}} the Bnai Brith in 1984 who quoted from the writings of Irving Kristol:Now, theres one final aspect of our national renewal that I must mention: the return that <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> making to faith—faith as a source of strength, comfort, and meaning.This new spiritual awareness extends to people of all religions and all beliefs. Irving Kristol has written, [...] "the quest for a religious identity is, in the postwar world, a general phenomenon, experienced by Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike. It does not seem, moreover, to be a passing phenomenon, but rather derives from an authentic crisis—a moral and spiritual crisis as well as a crisis in Western, liberal-secular thought."In our country, Kristol asserts, [...] "Ever since the Holocaust and the emergence of the state of Israel, American Jews have been reaching toward a more explicit and meaningful Jewish identity. And according to Rabbi Seymour Siegel of the Jewish Theological Seminary, this trend among American Jews is illustrated by a growing interest in Jewish history and the Hebrew language, and by the rise of—and I hope I get this right—Baal Teshuva movement—a powerful movement of Jews, young and old, Orthodox, Conservative, and Reformed, returning to the ancient ways of the faith.As Americans of different religions find new meaningfulness in their beliefs, we do so together, returning together to the bedrock values of family, hard work, and faith in the same loving and almighty God. And as we welcome this rebirth of faith, we must even more fervently attack ugly intolerance. We have no place for haters in America.|$|E

[...] Cases of this were reported in Florida, New Mexico, Virginia, Washington, and other states.

The Center for Health Information and Analysis estimates unplanned readmissions to cost $ 26 billion annually [1]. Recent US legislation has begun to penalize hospitals which have excess readmissions. The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) aims to reduce payments to hospitals which have an excess of avoidable readmissions [2]. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are tasked with identifying avoidable readmissions and penalizing hospitals using a set of defined formulas. These penalties often exceed potential reimbursement and have motivated hospitals to work towards readmission reduction [3].|$|E

This paper explores factors that affect the of adoption or intention to adopt three e-banking technologies and changes in these factors over time. Using a Federal Reserve Board commissioned data set, the paper finds that relative advantage, complexity/simplicity, compatibility, observability, risk tolerance, and product involvement are associated with adoption. Income, assets, education, gender and marital status, and age also affect adoption. Adoption changed over time, but the impacts of other factors on adoption have not changed. Implications for both the banking industry and public policy are discussed...|$|E
