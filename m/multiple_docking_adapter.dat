50|$|Actually {{the earlier}} {{suggestion}} by McDonnell Douglas was {{to achieve a}} massive station by combining Salyut 1 with Skylab B.This would be achieved by launching an Apollo with a <b>multiple</b> <b>docking</b> <b>adapter</b> with 4 docking ports {{to be able to}} dock both stations and a both servicing vehicles (Soyuz and Apollo).|$|E
50|$|Skylab {{included}} the Apollo Telescope Mount (a multi-spectral solar observatory), <b>Multiple</b> <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter</b> (with two docking ports), Airlock Module with extravehicular activity (EVA) hatches, and the Orbital Workshop (the main habitable space inside Skylab). Electrical power came from solar arrays, {{as well as}} fuel cells in the docked Apollo CSM. The rear of the station included a large waste tank, propellant tanks for maneuvering jets, and a heat radiator.|$|E
25|$|The International <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter</b> (IDA) is a {{spacecraft}} <b>docking</b> system <b>adapter</b> being developed to convert APAS-95 to the NASA Docking System (NDS)/ International Docking System Standard (IDSS). An IDA {{will be placed}} {{on each of the}} International Space Station's (ISS) two open Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMA), both of which will be connected to Node-2 (Harmony module).|$|R
50|$|The NASA Docking System is NASA's {{implementation}} of the IDSS. The International <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter</b> is intended to convert older Russian APAS-95 docking systems to the NASA Docking System.|$|R
50|$|The IBDM is now {{designed}} to be compatible with the International Docking System Standard (IDSS) and is hence compatible with the future ISS International <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapters</b> (IDA) on the US side of the ISS.|$|R
5000|$|This {{idea was}} later {{transferred}} to the original wet workshop design for the Skylab orbital workshop and renamed the Apollo Telescope Mount to be docked on a side port of the workshop's <b>Multiple</b> <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA). When Skylab changed to a [...] "dry workshop" [...] design pre-fabricated {{on the ground and}} launched on a Saturn V, the telescope was mounted on a hinged arm and controlled from inside the MDA. Only the octagonal shape of the telescope container, solar panels and the Apollo Telescope Mount name were kept, though there was no longer any association with the LM.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps the {{ultimate}} kludge {{was the first}} US space station, Skylab. Its two major components, the Saturn Workshop and the Apollo Telescope Mount, began development as separate projects (the SWS was kludged from the S-IVB stage of the Saturn 1B and Saturn V launch vehicles, the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module). Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the Apollo Applications Program, but the components were to have been launched separately, then docked in orbit. In the final design, the SWS and ATM were launched together, but for the single-launch concept to work, the ATM had to pivot 90 degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation, {{clearing the way for}} the crew to dock its Apollo Command/Service Module at the axial docking port of the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Skylab {{had certain}} {{features}} to protect vulnerable technology from radiation. The window was vulnerable to darkening, and this darkening could affect experiment S190. As a result, a light shield {{that could be}} open or shut was designed and installed on Skylab. To protect {{a wide variety of}} films, used for a variety of experiments and for astronaut photography, there were 5 film vaults. There were four smaller film vaults in the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter,</b> which had to have four not one, because each spar could not carry enough weight for single larger film vault. The orbital workshop could handle a single larger safe, which is also more efficient for shielding. The large vault in the orbital workshop had an empty mass of 2398 lb (1088 kg, 171.3 stones). The four smaller vaults had combined mass of 1545 lb. The primary construction material of all five safes was aluminum. When Skylab re-entered there was one 180 lb chunk of aluminum found that was thought to be a door to one of the film vaults. The big film vault was one of the heaviest single pieces of Skylab to re-enter Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The SA-211 S-IVB {{stage was}} mated with the Skylab {{underwater}} training <b>docking</b> <b>adapter</b> and Apollo Telescope Mount {{and is on}} display in the Rocket Garden of the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.|$|R
50|$|Precursors to the Venus flyby {{would include}} an initial orbital test flight with an S-IVB 'wet workshop' and basic <b>docking</b> <b>adapter,</b> and a year-long test flight taking the S-IVB to a near-geostationary {{orbit around the}} Earth.|$|R
5000|$|In two shuttle flights, Skylab {{would have}} been refurbished. In January 1982, the first mission would have {{attached}} a <b>docking</b> <b>adapter</b> and conducted repairs. In August 1983, a second crew would have replaced several system components.|$|R

5000|$|The International Docking System Standard (IDSS), is an {{international}} standard for spacecraft <b>docking</b> <b>adapters.</b> It {{was created by the}} International Space Station Multilateral Coordination Board, on behalf of the International Space Station partner organizations; NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency.|$|R
50|$|NASA has {{contracted}} for the CRS-16 mission from SpaceX {{and therefore}} determines the primary payload, date/time of launch, and orbital parameters for the Dragon space capsule. On the CRS-9 pre-launch conference, Kirk Shireman, NASA ISS program manager, stated that this mission would transport the IDA-3 <b>docking</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|R
50|$|On March 23 2017, Kimbrough {{performed}} {{his fifth}} EVA with Thomas Pesquet. The main {{objective was to}} prepare the Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 (PMA-3) for installation of the second International <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter</b> (IDA), which will accommodate commercial crew vehicle dockings.The EVA lasted for 6 hours and 34 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Martin Marietta/NASA {{subcontracted}} the design, fabrication, testing, {{and installation}} of the <b>multiple</b> <b>docking</b> <b>adapter</b> S- 190 experiment window assembly to Actron. In this paper, we primarily treat the thermal-optical analysis aspect of the design phase. The window is a pane of BK 7 glass 59. 18 cm by 44. 91 cm by 4. 06 cm. Though it must meet many mechanical specifications, the optical requirements, dictated by the high acuity, distortion-free S- 190 multiband camera system, are the most severe. Under operating conditions over any 7. 6 -cm circular area, the maximum rms deviation from the best-fitting plane must be less than 12. 0 nm, and from the reference plane through the entire window, 60. 0 nm...|$|E
40|$|Description of {{the optical}} and {{structural}} design requirements, mechanical and thermal response analyses, final design features, and testing procedures {{employed in the}} development of a large window mounted on the earth-facing side of the <b>multiple</b> <b>docking</b> <b>adapter</b> (MDA) of the Skylab manned space vehicle. This window was designed for the S 190 earth resources multispectral camera and was protected from the space environment during nonuse periods by a hinged cover operated from within the MDA. The camera required a viewing area approximately 43 by 58 cm. A single glass pane 4. 1 cm thick was selected to minimize optical distortions. Heaters on the glass and frame were designed to control distortions caused by thermal gradients in the glass...|$|E
40|$|During {{the initial}} stages of the NASA Skylab orbit, the Apollo {{telescope}} mount (ATM) is deployed by the deployment assembly (DA) which clears the <b>multiple</b> <b>docking</b> <b>adapter</b> axial docking port. This is an essential prerequisite to docking the command service module with the orbital workshop and subsequent occupancy of the workshop by the Apollo three-man crew. The objectives of the full-scale NASA Skylab ATM deployment test program were (1) to evaluate the design concept of the DA and deployment mechanisms while functioning in a zero-g environment with simulated ATM mass properties and (2) to evaluate the effects of handling, transporting, and deployment with respect to the structural geometry and stability of the DA...|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} Atlas-Agena {{vehicle is}} best known for launching the Augmented Target <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter</b> (ATDA) in support of the Gemini 9A mission. This occurred on 1 June 1966, and was the first flight of the Atlas SLV-3 as an independent vehicle. The ATDA failed because the payload shroud did not detach.|$|R
50|$|The Common <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CDA) was {{announced}} in 2009. It was planned {{to be used to}} convert the Common Berthing Mechanism to the NASA Docking System. The CDAs would have been attached directly to Node-2 forward and Node-2 zenith. They would have been delivered on the Japanese HTV cargo spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|Composite or {{component}} video {{at up to}} 576i and stereo audio can be output from the dock connector using an adapter sold by Apple. IPhone 4 also supports 1024×768 VGA output without audio, and HDMI output, with stereo audio, via <b>dock</b> <b>adapters.</b> The iPhone did not support voice recording until the 3.0 software update.|$|R
40|$|Discussion of the {{spectrum}} of remedial concepts and realistic mission constraints. A vehicle design is presented which is offered as the 'best' solution {{among a number of}} alternative designs in terms of its cost effectiveness. The probability of the safe reentry and recovery of one to three stranded astronauts is 0. 80. The vehicle is symmetrical and lenticular in shape, and exhibits a modest lift-to-drag ratio of 0. 5, allowing it to reenter a two-skip trajectory with minimal gravity forces on the astronauts. Attitude control, voice and beacon communication, and impact attenuation are also provided. The vehicle could be delivered in a docked position on the Apollo Applications Program <b>multiple</b> <b>docking</b> <b>adapter...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Skylab Program {{includes}} three {{low earth orbit}} missions. These missions are designated SL- 1 /SL- 2,SL- 3 and SL- 4. In addition to the three nominal Skylab missions, the program includes the Skylab Rescue Mission (SL-R). The SL-R mission {{is designed to provide}} a safe return of the Skylab crew in the event the Command Service Module (CSM) becomes disabled while docked to the Saturn Workshop (SWS). Mission requirements for the SL-R mission only are presented. SL-R mission configuration will be a CSM (modified with a field installed kit) manned by two crewmen launched on a Saturn IB Launch Vechicle. The SL-R CSM will rendezvous and dock with the SWS (or Orbital Assembly (OA), consisting of the SWS and disabled CSM, if the disabled CSM has not previously been jettisoned). The SWS configuration includes a <b>Multiple</b> <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA), Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM), Airlock Module (AM), and an S-IVB stage (modified as an Orbital Workshop (OWS), previously launched and inserted into orbit on a two-stage Saturn V Launch Vehicle for the SL- 1 /SL- 2 mission...|$|E

50|$|The {{assembly}} {{method of}} the station can {{be compared with the}} Soviet-Russian Mir space station and the Russian orbital segment of the International space station, if the station is constructed, China will be the second nation to develop and use automatic rendezvous and docking for modular space station construction. Shenzhou spacecraft and space stations use a domestically made docking mechanism similar to, or compatible with, the Russian designed APAS <b>docking</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Augmented Target <b>Docking</b> <b>Adapter,</b> to be {{used for}} the Gemini 9A manned mission, was {{successfully}} placed into orbit by an Atlas SLV-3 in June 1966. But when the Gemini crew rendezvoused with it, they discovered the fairing had failed to open and separate, making docking impossible. Two lanyards, which should have been removed before flight, were still in place. The cause was determined to be a launch crew error.|$|R
