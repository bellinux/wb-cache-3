40|$|Homogenization {{of tissue}} for {{analysis}} of bioenergetic enzyme activities is a common practice in studies examining metabolic properties of skeletal muscle adaptation to disease, aging, inactivity or exercise, While numerous homogenization techniques are in use today, limited information exists concerning the efficacy of specific homogenization protocols. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to compare the efficacy of four commonly used approaches to homogenizing skeletal muscle {{for analysis of}} bioenergetic enzyme activity. The maximal enzyme activity (V-max) of citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured from homogenous muscle samples (N= 48 per homogenization technique) and used as indicators to determine which-protocol had the highest efficacy, The homogenization techniques were: (1) glass-on-glass pestle; (2) a combination of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>blender</b> and a teflon pestle (Potter-Elvehjem); (3) a combination of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>blender</b> and a biological detergent; and (4) the combined use of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>blender</b> and a sonicator. The glass-on-glass pestle homogenization protocol produced significantly higher (...|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{synthesize}} nanocellulose from Hevea brasiliensis fibres or {{commonly known as}} rubber wood fibres. Rubber trees are able to grow abundantly in Malaysia due to its {{close proximity to the}} equator (within 15 ° latitude). When the production of latex dwindles considerably, the trees are felled and are replaced with newer saplings. Hence, the end —of-cycle trees {{can be used as a}} rich source of synthesis of nanocellulose. The wood fibres obtained were pre-treated using sodium anthraquinone. This was followed by a series of treatment with a mixture of sodium chlorite and acetic acid as well as sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide. The bleached pulps were then air dried and soaked in distilled water for 8 hours. It was then mixed in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>blender</b> for 15 minutes. Diluted suspensions (0. 3...|$|E

The cleaned peels were shredded to small pieces then blended with tap water using a high-speed <b>mechanical</b> <b>blender.</b> The obtained viscous slurry was mixed with the determined quantity of potassium hydroxide and stirred for 1  min to get homogenous slurry. The alkaline blended peel slurry was subjected to boiling with stirring for 30 [*]min. After boiling, the slurry was kept for cooling at room temperature {{to be ready for}} further processing. The cold slurry was subjected to vacuum filtration to get clear brown filtrate and thick dark brown sludge. Hence, the clear filtrate was heated to about 70 [*]°C, with continuous stirring at 300  rpm. After that, urea and citric acid (5 % solution) were added dropwise till pH[*] 5. The obtained sludge was dried at 105 [*]°C, then grinded to fine powder. The product was subjected to physical and chemical analyses for characterization as shown in Fig. 1.|$|E
30|$|Silver nitrate (AgNO 3) (E. Merck, Mumbai, India) of {{analytical}} reagent grade {{was used for}} the synthesis. “Gum ghatti” grade- 1 was purchased from Girijan Co-operative Corporation Ltd., Hyderabad, India. All the solutions were prepared in ultra pure water. Gum ghatti was powdered in a Prestige high-speed <b>mechanical</b> <b>blender</b> (Bengaluru, India) and sieved to obtain a mean particle size of 38 μm. Then, 0.5 % (w/v) of homogenous gum stock solution was prepared by adding this powder to reagent bottle containing ultra pure water and stirring overnight at room temperature. Then this solution was centrifuged to remove the insoluble materials and the supernatant was used for all the experiments. The protein concentration in the gum solution was quantified by Lowry’s method using a Bangalore GeneiTM protein estimation kit, Cat No 105560 (Bengaluru, India). The silver nanoparticles were synthesized by autoclaving the silver nitrate solutions containing various concentrations of gum ghatti at 121 °C and 103 kPa of pressure for different durations of time, under dark conditions. The effect of concentration of gum and reaction time on nanoparticle synthesis was studied.|$|E

40|$|In routine {{experiments}} synthetic {{indicators are}} {{the choice of}} acid base titrations. But there are some limitations like environmental pollution, availability and higher cost which leads to search for natural compounds as an acid base indicator was started. The present work highlights theexploit of the methanolic and aqueous extract of the fruit of Opuntia ficus indica plants as a natural acid base indicator in acid base titrations. Opuntia ficus indica plant was identified and fruits were washed and cleaned by distilled water, grinded by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>blender</b> and soaked in 50 ml methanol for 48 hours and then triturated in mortal and pestle and the resulting solution were filtered through muslin cloth. The resulted methanolic extract and aqueous extract which was prepared by heating fruits in water {{for half an hour}} and filtered used as natural indicator foracidimetry and alkalimetry. For each type of acid base titrations t-value and standard deviation were calculated from results obtained. Natural indicator is easy to prepare, easily available and have no toxic effects and promising results were obtained when it was tested against standard synthetic indicators. Titration shows sharp colour change at the equivalence point. The equivalence points (end points) obtained by the fruit extract correlate with the equivalence points obtained by standard indicators. In strong acid and strong base titration, the results obtained in the fruit's extract matched with the results obtained by standard indicator. Hence, natural indicator is found to be a very useful, readily available, nonhazardous, economical, simple to prepare and accurate for the acid-base titrations...|$|E
