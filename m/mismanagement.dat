5|$|Beginning in {{the last}} decades of the Cold War, American and European critics of the UN {{condemned}} the organization for perceived <b>mismanagement</b> and corruption. In 1984, the US President, Ronald Reagan, withdrew his nation's funding from UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of <b>mismanagement,</b> followed by Britain and Singapore. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing {{the size of the}} organization somewhat. His successor, Kofi Annan (1997–2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the {{state-owned}} oil company, Pertamina, defaulted on its foreign loans {{as a result}} of <b>mismanagement</b> and corruption under the leadership of Suharto’s close ally, Ibnu Sutowo. The government bail-out of the company nearly doubled the national debt.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the PLC {{accused the}} {{executive}} branch of the PNA of financial <b>mismanagement</b> causing the resignation of four members of Arafat's cabinet. Arafat refused to resign his post.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of <b>mismanagement.</b> Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such <b>mismanagement,</b> that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{energy sector}} has had years of <b>mismanagement</b> by the {{parastatal}} Chad Water and Electric Society (STEE), which provides power for 15% of the capital's citizens and covers only 1.5% {{of the national}} population. Most Chadians burn biomass fuels such as wood and animal manure for power.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{recovering}} economy from the Asian Financial Crisis, <b>mismanagement</b> of Tung's housing policy triggered a housing market crisis in 1998, disrupting market supply and sent properties prices tumbling until 2002. This caused many homeowners to become bankrupt due to negative equity.|$|E
5|$|However, the Queen's Park project {{suffered}} serious <b>mismanagement</b> and fraud; {{the company}} secretary William Swindlehurst {{and two others}} were found guilty in 1877 of defrauding £9,312 (approximately £ today) from the project. The company was forced to raise rents, and tenants were no longer permitted to buy their houses; by 1880 the company's finances had recovered sufficiently to allow further expansion.|$|E
5|$|In the beginning, {{everything}} seemed to go well for the new Emperor, who even tried {{to set up a}} new dynasty by conferring the title of Augusta upon his wife Aelia Zenonis and creating his son Marcus, Caesar, and later Augustus; however, due to his <b>mismanagement</b> as emperor, Basiliscus quickly lost most of his supporters.|$|E
5|$|Sprigg {{continued}} to be active in Cumberland city politics. In early 1906, Sprigg was {{a spokesperson for the}} Associated Merchants organization, which had hired an independent auditor to investigate the city government's questionable accounting and appropriation practices. The independent auditor uncovered gross <b>mismanagement,</b> and the Associated Merchants, with Sprigg as their spokesperson, urged the Cumberland city council to take action.|$|E
5|$|The {{downward}} spiral {{of the economy}} has been attributed mainly to <b>mismanagement</b> and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white farmers in the controversial land confiscations of 2000. The Zimbabwean government and its supporters attest that it was Western policies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy.|$|E
5|$|Trollope's {{fortunes}} suffered {{because of}} the mode of the novel's publication. Owing to <b>mismanagement</b> by the publishers, it was not serialised in a popular magazine, as originally intended. Instead, it was issued as monthly numbers, a form of serialisation that had become unpopular with the reading public, and Trollope lost readers as a result.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the Philippines {{was for a}} time {{regarded}} as the second wealthiest in East Asia, next only to Japan. In the 1960s its economic performance started being overtaken. The economy stagnated under the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos as the regime spawned economic <b>mismanagement</b> and political volatility. The country suffered from slow economic growth and bouts of economic recession. Only in the 1990s with a program of economic liberalization did the economy begin to recover.|$|E
5|$|American {{and other}} {{immigrant}} families began arriving in St. Louis and opening new businesses, including printing and banking, {{starting in the}} 1810s. Among the printers was Joseph Charless, who published the first newspaper west of the Mississippi, the Missouri Gazette, on July 12, 1808. In 1816 and 1817, groups of merchants formed the first banks in the town, but <b>mismanagement</b> and the Panic of 1819 led to their closure.|$|E
5|$|An {{economic}} crisis took {{effect in the}} mid-1980s to late 1990s {{as a result of}} international economic conditions, drought, falling petroleum prices, and years of corruption, <b>mismanagement,</b> and cronyism. Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and privatised industries. With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Southern Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, and the Southern Cameroons National Council advocated complete secession as the Republic of Ambazonia.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic <b>mismanagement</b> errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the <b>mismanagement</b> behind Enron’s fall {{to a variety}} of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s reliance on political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.|$|E
5|$|Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram, is the {{principal}} {{of a high school}} named after his elder daughter Mahalakshmi. As a child, she went missing during a pilgrimage to the Godavari River pushkaram in Kakinada. Conditions at the school deteriorate due to <b>mismanagement</b> by Gopalam's nephew, A. K. Raju, an amateur detective. This is exacerbated when Panthulu, an ayurvedic doctor, teaches the children. Gopalam decides to replace them with a male and a female graduate (preferably a married couple) capable of training his younger daughter Sita in singing besides teaching children at the school.|$|E
5|$|Having {{dominated}} Zimbabwe's {{politics for}} nearly four decades, Mugabe has been a controversial and divisive figure. He has been praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped to free Zimbabwe from British colonialism, imperialism, and white minority rule. Conversely, he has been derided as a dictator responsible for economic <b>mismanagement,</b> widespread corruption, anti-white racial discrimination, human rights abuses, suppression of political critics and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{inherited}} a vast fortune and a prosperous economy {{from his father}} Henry VII, who had been frugal and careful with money. This fortune was estimated to £1,250,000 (£375million by today's standards). By comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms. Although he further augmented his royal treasury through the seizure of church lands, Henry's heavy spending and long periods of <b>mismanagement</b> damaged the economy.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, {{the missionary}} {{established}} a mission among the Wabaseemoong Independent Nations, where he repeated his Baie-Saint-Paul design: a log chapel at the centre surrounded by small cabins {{for the local}} population, with outlying farms. The mission closed ten years later; Belcourt blamed this on <b>mismanagement</b> by oblates he had entrusted with its management. In 1845, Belcourt served as the chaplain to some buffalo hunters, but returned to his first mission at Baie-Saint-Paul to teach the Chippewa language {{to a group of}} oblates.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and <b>mismanagement</b> that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Paul {{served on the}} House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for {{inflation}} and spoke against the banking <b>mismanagement</b> {{that resulted in the}} savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873–1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress.|$|E
5|$|In the fall, Hazen leveled {{charges of}} {{corruption}} and <b>mismanagement</b> against Isaac Tichenor, the deputy commissioner of purchases at Coös, General Bayley, the deputy quartermaster-general, and Matthew Lyons, the deputy commissioner of issues. His regiment were poorly supplied the whole summer at Coös, supplies of beef arrived spoiled, and Hazen had to send his men into the fields {{to help with the}} harvest so they could eat. Courts-martial were later held.|$|E
5|$|The Keating Five scandal was {{prompted}} by the activities of one particular savings and loan: Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, California. Lincoln's chairman was Charles Keating, who ultimately served {{five years in prison}} for his corrupt <b>mismanagement</b> of Lincoln. In the four years after Keating's American Continental Corporation (ACC) had purchased Lincoln in 1984, Lincoln's assets had increased from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|The Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707, {{in which a}} fleet commanded by Sir Cloudesley Shovell foundered, highlighted <b>mismanagement</b> at the Admiralty, for which George was nominally responsible. Pressure grew to replace Admiral Churchill with someone more dynamic. By October 1708, five powerful politicians, known as the Whig Junto—Lords Somers, Halifax, Orford, Wharton and Sunderland—were clamouring {{for the removal of}} both Prince George and Churchill. Marlborough wrote to his brother telling him to resign, but Churchill refused, protected by Prince George.|$|E
5|$|The {{institute}} did not {{execute the}} order and incumbent director Devi Singh who completed his six months of extension period, on September 8 did not leave office even after receiving the letter. As a result, there was confusion at IIM-L campus for almost a week. The allegations against Devi Singh, who served two term as director of IIM-L, ranges from nepotism to <b>mismanagement</b> of accounts. The Central Vigilance Commission also asked the HRD ministry to 're investigate' allegations of corruption against Devi Singh.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} Madonna and Maverick sued Warner Music Group and its former parent company Time Warner, {{claiming}} that <b>mismanagement</b> {{of resources and}} poor bookkeeping had cost the company millions of dollars. In return, Warner filed a countersuit alleging that Maverick had lost {{tens of millions of}} dollars on its own. The dispute was resolved when the Maverick shares, owned by Madonna and Ronnie Dashev, were purchased by Warner. Madonna and Dashev's company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music, but Madonna was still signed to Warner under a separate recording contract.|$|E
5|$|There were {{initially}} no other major controversies for Dunstan, although the economy remained {{poor and the}} Redcliff complex was still in limbo as an agreement with Dow was still to be finalised. The financial difficulties forced a freeze on public sector expansion and hospital developments, and there were claims of theft and <b>mismanagement</b> in the health system, but the Liberals were in a disorganised state and unpopular, so {{they were not able}} to pressure Dunstan effectively.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Tombalbaye banned {{opposition}} parties {{and established a}} one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive <b>mismanagement</b> exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT), began a civil war. Tombalbaye was overthrown and killed in 1975, but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions led by Hissène Habré took the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.|$|E
5|$|Victoria's {{household}} {{was largely}} run by her childhood governess, Baroness Louise Lehzen from Hanover. Lehzen {{had been a}} formative influence on Victoria, and had supported her against the Kensington System. Albert, however, thought Lehzen was incompetent, and that her <b>mismanagement</b> threatened his daughter's health. After a furious row between Victoria and Albert over the issue, Lehzen was pensioned off in 1842, and Victoria's close relationship with her ended.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the force}} was {{commanded}} by its commissioner, {{there was also}} an influential senior post of comptroller, created in 1880 in response to Macleod's financial <b>mismanagement</b> of the force. For most of the force's history the role was occupied by Frederick White, until replaced by A. A. Mclean in 1913. The comptroller was responsible for keeping account of expenditure, auditing and managing procurement, and effectively removed most of the non-operational functions from the commissioner's responsibility. White was a political client of Prime Minister John Macdonald, who took a close interest in the management of the force, and the post became critical for garnering support from Ottawa for investment in the police.|$|E
5|$|Dissent within Uganda and Amin's {{attempt to}} annex the Kagera Region of Tanzania in 1978 {{led to the}} Uganda–Tanzania War and the demise of his eight-year regime. Amin then went into exile, first in Libya and then in Saudi Arabia, where he lived until his death on 16 August 2003. Amin's rule was {{characterized}} by rampant human rights abuses, political repression, ethnic persecution, extrajudicial killings, nepotism, corruption, and gross economic <b>mismanagement.</b> The number of people killed {{as a result of}} his regime is estimated by international observers and human rights groups to range from 100,000 to 500,000.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{financial}} <b>mismanagement</b> which included his Safari hunting hobby, in July 1912, Horodecki pledged {{the building as}} a collateral against a loan taken from Kyiv Mutual Credit Association. When Horodecki defaulted on the loan, the building was auctioned off in 1913, and became {{the property of the}} engineer Daniel Balakhovsky, the son of a Kiev trader, who was also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Blahodatinskoe sugar factory, and a French сonsular agent in Kiev. In 1916, the house belonged to the Blahodatinskoe sugar factory. In 1918, the building's ownership changed again, to Samuel Nemets. In 1921, after the Bolsheviks gained control of Kiev, several of the departments of the Kiev Military District took offices in the House with Chimaeras.|$|E
5|$|Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Company {{was accused}} of <b>mismanagement,</b> and Bombay reverted to the British Crown. On 2 August 1858, the British Parliament began {{abolition}} of the Company and asserted full, direct Crown authority over India. The execution was slow. The Company for purposes of liquidation maintained its formal existence until 1874. India was thereafter directly ruled by the Crown as a colony of the United Kingdom, and officially known as the Empire of India after 1876. India consisted of some regions referred to as British India that were directly administered by the British and other regions called the Princely States that were ruled by Indian rulers.|$|E
5|$|His {{research}} and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted {{the government to}} initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating 388 crores for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for <b>mismanagement</b> and cost and time overruns.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, the North-West Rebellion {{broke out}} along the North Saskatchewan River valley. Driven by a {{combination}} of political and economic issues, Louis Riel and his Métis followers intended to form a provisional government, gain the support of the Cree First Nation, defeat the mounted police and seize the region, forcing the Canadian government to the negotiation table. There had been worries among the police about potential instability since the previous fall, and the force had increased its presence in the area over the winter. As tensions rose, Commissioner Irvine, who had replaced Macleod in 1880 after accusations of financial <b>mismanagement,</b> began to mobilise any spare police manpower in Regina, bringing the force up to an operational strength of 562.|$|E
