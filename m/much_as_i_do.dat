5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not know as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them {{back from the dead}} they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E
500|$|More recently, his {{cultural}} {{legacy is}} {{also associated with}} his ageing and continued energetic vitality. Bon Jovi frontman Jon Bon Jovi, also a veteran, has said: [...] "We continue to make Number One records and fill stadiums. But will we still be doing 150 shows per tour? I just can't see it. I don't know how the hell Mick Jagger does it at 67. That {{would be the first}} question I'd ask him. He runs around the stage as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> yet he's got almost 20 years on me." [...] Since his early career Jagger has embodied what some authors describe as a [...] "Dionysian archetype" [...] of [...] "eternal youth" [...] personified by many rock stars and the rock culture.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 August 2003, after {{a meeting}} with the Inland Revenue, Davidson claimed he spent £10,000 a week on back taxes, {{commission}} to agents, maintenance and school fees, and a £2.2 million mortgage: [...] "My problem is money– I used to earn five times as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now, but I still pay the same maintenance, school fees and commission to agents," [...] he told Radio Times magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Forza Horizon was {{developed}} by UK-based Playground Games, which is composed of employees who formerly worked at various studios renowned for earlier racing titles and series such as Project Gotham Racing, Driver, , Colin McRae Rally, [...] and Burnout. When asked about Playground Games' involvement, Dan Greenawalt, the head of Turn 10 Studios, said, [...] "I wouldn't trust this partner as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> if I didn't expect them to surprise me and surprise our players. I have respect {{for their ability to}} come up with great ideas. So I think yes, they are challenged by the customers the same way we are to surprise them with innovation. That's how they see themselves, that's how we see them, it's how they see us. It's really a shared goal." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 13, Williams began {{a limited}} six-week {{engagement}} at the Cambridge Theatre in Chicago, making {{her the first}} African-American to be cast in the West End production of the musical. On discussing Williams' acquiring of the coveted role of murderous chorus girl Roxie Hart, manager and Music World Entertainment executive Matthew Knowles said, [...] "She's {{one of the greatest}} characters in the history of musical theater and it's both a challenge and {{a lot of fun to}} bring her to life on-stage. I hope that everyone who comes to the show enjoys it as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> Michelle is a prime example of an all-round entertainer, she has enjoyed many successes as a music artist and now theater goers are going to experience her far reaching talents once again" [...] whilst Williams is quoted as saying, [...] "It's a real thrill to be given the opportunity to play Roxie Hart in the West End's spectacular production of 'Chicago'." [...] Her run was extended and Williams continued appearing for three additional weeks for an extended engagement starting August 23 through September 12, 2009.|$|E
60|$|Yes. I'm exhausted. But I {{want to tell}} you, Arthur, I think you're right. The {{worst is}} over. I'm not {{suffering}} quite so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> find it a little easier {{not to think of}} him. When I meet him I can manage to be gay and flippant and indifferent. I'm so glad, Arthur.|$|R

60|$|Referring to woman's sphere in life, I'll {{say that}} woman is always right. For twenty-five years I've been a woman's rights man.
