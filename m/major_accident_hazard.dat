In {{the case of}} historical industrial disasters such as Aberfan and Flixborough, {{and in terms of}} preparation for future industrial disasters under Control of <b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Hazard</b> regulations, communities are seen as passive responders to accidents. Moreover, following industrial accidents, communities are frequently accused of culpability or profiting from the disaster.

Using an historical approach, the official accounts of the Aberfan and Flixborough industrial accidents are challenged with a focus on schools and children. Rather than being passive victims of these accidents, schools and children demonstrated agency in terms of their tacit knowledge, reporting potential accidents and recording their consequences.

40|$|The hazards {{associated}} with <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> <b>hazard</b> (MAN) industries are fire, explosion and toxic gas releases. Of these, toxic gas release {{is the worst}} as {{it has the potential}} to cause extensive fatalities. Qualitative and quantitative hazard analyses are essential for the identification and quantification of these hazards related to chemical industries. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is an established technique in hazard identification. This technique has the advantage of being both qualitative and quantitative, if the probabilities and frequencies of the basic events are known. This paper outlines the estimation of the probability of release of chlorine from storage and filling facility of chlor-alkali industry using FTA. An attempt has also been made to arrive at the probability of chlorine release using expert elicitation and proven fuzzy logic technique for Indian conditions. Sensitivity analysis has been done to evaluate the percentage contribution of each basic event that could lead to chlorine release.

40|$|This study {{developed}} small-area health-related environmental indices for England and Wales in {{the context}} of an investigation into socioeconomic inequity in the distribution of environmental risk. Selection of environmental hazards, relevant datasets, and their attribution to standard small-area geography using a geographic information system are described.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{describe}} the frequency, nature {{and location of}} acute chemical incidents in Wales, and the morbidity in employees, emergency responders {{and the general public}} who were exposed.  DESIGN—Active multi-agency community-based surveillance system.  SETTING—Wales, 1993 - 5.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Frequency, nature and location of incidents, populations potentially exposed and with symptoms.  RESULTS—Most of the 402  incidents identified were not associated with sites governed by the Control of Industrial <b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Hazard</b> Regulations but with smaller industrial sites and commercial premises. About two in every thousand of the estimated 236   000 members of the public considered to be at risk from exposure reported symptoms, which were mainly nausea, headaches, and irritation of the eye, skin and respiratory tract. The most commonly reported chemicals that members of the public were exposed to were smoke toxins, miscellaneous organics, toxic gases and flammable gases. A health authority was reported to be involved in only 34  (8 %) of the incidents and in only 3  of the 29  incidents where more than 100  members of the public were exposed.  CONCLUSION—A geographically defined, multi-agency surveillance system can identify high risk locations and types of incidents, together with the chemicals most likely to be involved. Such ongoing surveillance information is essential for appropriate policy making, emergency planning, operational management and training.    Keywords: surveillance; pollution; chemica...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn process {{industries}} {{more and more}} decisions are “risk based”, such as equipment inspection, maintenance and management of change. Risk assessment is, in turn, based on the “Failure Rates”. For process plants, where <b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Hazard</b> Legislation is enforced, even competent authorities’ decisions, such as licensing and land use planning LUP, are “risk based” and, consequently, driven by Failure Rates. The Failure Rates currently in use for process equipment derive, basically from, a few large systematic studies conducted in the Sixties and Seventies on failure frequencies and modes. Many new materials, new production and management methods have been introduced and their effects on aging mechanisms {{on a large scale}} are still unknown. A few major multinational companies have proprietary failure databases, which are supposed to be up to date, both most companies, as well as Authorities, have to trust in public domain Failure Rates, which are poor and generic and could drive to questionable decisions. A few European Competent Authorities are trying to face the problem, by stating a set of trusted Failure Rates, suitable just for LUP. INAIL, as in charge for pressure equipment control throughout Italy, is gathering data for updating generic failure frequencies. The project is aiming to provide a sound knowledge base about pressure equipment failure rates and modes, in order to support the Risk Management by both industry and Authorities...|$|E

40|$|Seveso II Directive on {{the control}} of <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> <b>hazard</b> {{involving}} dangerous substances 1 introduced some important novel concepts concerning risk management policies, domino effects, area risks, and land use planning. In particular, this last issue requires {{the vulnerability of the}} environment in the proximity of a Seveso installation to be defined and assessed. Previous work on environmental vulnerability seems unsuitable to effectively characterize the whole environment, being focused on particular targets, or too simplified to provide a good picture. The present work defines an a priori vulnerability (APV), characteristic of environment and independent of the presence of the hazardous installation, and a major hazard vulnerability (MHV) which depends both on the characteristics of the environment and on the hazard presented by the installation. All types of environmental targets are considered, including human beings, other living organisms (both plants and animals), the natural environment, such as lakes, rivers, underground waters, woods and forests, etc., and the built-up environment, such as buildings, roads, rails, industrial installations, etc. In order to develop a tool for assessing the environmental vulnerability, both easy to use and fast in its response, the proposed approach makes use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), which allow to obtain most information relevant to the targets from commercial databases; other data can be added in the form of plans or tables. A preliminary test of the methodology has been performed on an industrial area in Italy, using ArcView GIS 2, Corine 3 and TeleAtlas 4 databases and Istat 5 population dat...|$|E
40|$|In the Oil & Gas {{industry}} {{the fundamental}} element to control <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> <b>hazard</b> is {{the establishment of}} an efficient barrier management system. On the NCS the PSA has renewed the strong focus on the barrier and barrier management. According to the PSA (Petroleum Safety Authority, 2015 a), the industry has to reinforce the link between the risk assessment and the barrier management and special interest should be given on the degradation of the barrier and the system and methodology used to measure it. The barrier management in operation should be strongly and uniquely linked to the performance requirement, defined in the design phase. As explained in Falck, Flage, and Aven (2015) several methods may be used to identify the performance deviation from the design and operational basis. However, the main challenge is to find models able to reflect the effect of such deviations. In this thesis work, a new methodology to measure the effect of deterioration of the barrier on risk is proposed. The methodology has been developed for the gas detection system of offshore installations, however it is believed that the methodology could be easily adapted to different barrier system. The key aspect of the method is the identification of specific indicators; such indicators shall be easily updated by the operators using field data and connected to failure mechanisms of the barrier. The combination of all indicators is used to build a total score of the barrier that is believed to measure the deviation from the barrier performance requirements; each indicator is combined considering their criticality with respect to the barrier function. Finally, a relationship between the degradation of the barrier and the risk level is proposed. The methodology is applied to a case study: an unmanned platform in North Sea...|$|E

It aims at developing tighter and more beneficial relations between the EU and her neighbours in political, economic and cultural domains, and in particular on security matters, as well as extending and enhancing current existing cooperation frameworks {{in order to reduce}} the likelihood of any new divide appearing. The strengthening of the safety and security with the EU Neighbourhood Countries, also from an economical and resources sharing angle, is identified as a great strategic priority by the European Commission and the EU and is an issue that has acquired a more relevant importance following the latest developments in some of these countries. One particular area of shared concern is the control of chemical accident risks. The Seveso Directive has existed as legislation in the European Union since 1982 and holds a long history of regulatory responses aimed at controlling sites where dangerous substances are processed and stored and where accidents may result in fatalities and serious injury to people or damage to the environment. As such, there is considerable logic in accelerating implementation of a Seveso approach in Neighbourhood Countries to continue the momentum towards Seveso becoming a standard approach to chemical accident prevention and preparedness worldwide. For this reason, the Civil Protection Mechanism 2014 - 2020 (Decision No. 1313 / 2013 of the European Parliament), managed under DG-ECHO, introduced a new initiative, Seveso Capacity Building in EU Neighbourhood Countries strategy to collaborate with its neighbours on strengthening chemical accident prevention and preparedness programmes. The Joint Research Centre’s <b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Hazard</b> Bureau is leading the implementation of this initiative on behalf of DG-ECHO. The JRC therefore has analysed its own experience in capacity building, conducted research and sought expert feedback to produce this strategy document for the initiative.

These Guidelines, developed by the EWGLUP and agreed by the Member States at the 16 th meeting of the Committee of Competent Authorities responsible for the implementation of the Seveso Directive (Porvoo, October 2006), were adopted by the European Commission on 7 June 2007. A preliminary research, exploring the state-of art of the implementation of Art 12 within the 25 Member States (MS) was conducted in 2004 by the <b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Hazard</b> Bureau of JRC {{in the form of a}} questionnaire-based survey.

The European Working Group on Land-Use Planning has, in addition to the development of Guidelines for implementation of Article 12 of the Seveso II Directive, as amended by Directive 105 / 2003 /EC, taken part at the development of this document as a supporting tool addressing the issue of LUP in the context of hazardous facilities. The document provides supplementary information material describing in detail 'good LUP practices' available within selected Member States and it has a twofold objective. Firstly, it reports the results of the survey concerning 'good practice' for LUP in the context of the Seveso II. Secondly, it proposes implementation Roadmaps fulfilling Art. 12 requirements. In that context it should be noted that its character is purely descriptive and informative and it cannot be used for guidance or normative purposes. At the same time, it is believed that the structured information provided can substantially help the Seveso competent authorities and planning authorities to deal with the land-use planning issue.

40|$|The 1999 {{annual report}} from the European Environment Agency {{indicated}} {{that in spite of}} measures on <b>major</b> industrial <b>accidents</b> in force since 1984, the trend in accidents shows that many of the often seemingly trivial 'lessons learned' from accidents have not yet been sufficiently evaluated and implemented in industry's practices and standards. It was confirmed by the recent accidents (Enschede in 2000, Toulouse in 2001) that have shown that disasters continue to occur throughout the EU despite of the efforts to control <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> <b>hazards</b> with Seveso I and Seveso II directives. Moreover, a recent communication from the Commission (European Commission, 2002) indicates that the frequency of <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> is estimated at about 3. 10 ~ 3 per year if we consider the number of accidents reported in the accident database of the European Commission MARS (<b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> Reporting System) versus the number of hazardous installations throughout the European Union.

40|$|<b>Major</b> {{industrial}} <b>accidents</b> {{that occurred}} in the past and even recently, such as the Flixborough, UK in 1974, the ConocoPhillips, UK in 2001 and the Chevron, US in 2012 show that ageing is still a disturbing phenomenon present in chemical process industries. Further to these cases, it is estimated that 30 % of the <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> reported in the eMARS accident database run by the <b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Hazards</b> Bureau of the European Commission are connected to at least one ageing phenomenon. It is sometimes mistakenly believed that ageing is about how old the establishment or the equipment is. Some countries solely consider corrosion as a sign of ageing. However, ageing of chemical plants has a wider meaning which indicates the degradation of the equipment in use, its overall condition and the change in its condition over time, as it is defined in the study published by the UK Health and Safety Executive. People or written procedures could also be key features of ageing plants. Overall, ageing is related to keywords such as material degradation, fatigue, obsolescence. All these physical states, mechanisms and organisational elements can lead to <b>major</b> <b>accidents.</b> Having engaged in a number of studies relevant to ageing, the <b>Major</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Hazards</b> Bureau of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) performed an analysis of keywords on accident reports in the eMARS database as well as reports on chemical accidents in the French ARIA database.

This paper discusses the results of this analysis and makes recommendations on how future accident reports could put more focus on the ageing-related impacts of obsolescence and loss of knowledge and competence.
